<HEADLINE> Posting Research on Net Draws Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A proposal from the director of the National  
Institutes of Health to post medical research on the Internet has 
drawn criticism from those who say the idea would devalue 
scientific journals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would make the journal -- the paper journal, and also the  
journal Web site -- merely archival. Redundant,'' Dr. Marcia Angell, 
executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, said 
Tuesday. ``Insofar as that happened, it would weaken the journals 
and maybe even destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the NIH, and his supporters say  
quickly posting the research online would let scientists exchange 
information much faster, without waiting months or even years for 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	It also could ``enrich the reading experience, deepen  
discussions among scientists, reduce frustrations with traditional 
mechanisms for publication, and save substantial sums of public and 
private money,'' he wrote in his proposal on the NIH's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers could upload film sequences, as well as more  
photographs, tables and data than could ever fit into a magazine, 
supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ``E-biomed'' site would have two archives.  
</P>
<P>
	One would accept just about anything. Submissions would be ruled  
out only if two reviewers found them ``extraneous or outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other archive would include only papers that have been  
accepted for publication by journals, but would post them 
immediately upon acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some see the idea as a threat to not only scholarly  
journals, but to medicine itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Varmus' proposal, Thomas E. DeCoursey, a  
professor of molecular biophysics at Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's 
Medical Center wrote that the idea, ``would serve mainly to lower 
the quality of scientific research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would cheapen the value of scientific publication, diminish  
accountability of both scientists and reviewers, and thus encourage 
fraud,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael M. Cox, a biochemistry professor at the University of  
Wisconsin-Madison, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the sort of scrutiny that journals give, he wrote, ``it  
will inevitably become a massive repository of taxpayer-supported 
junk that very few will read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he wrote, the NIH association will give anything in the  
database a spurious air of legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bruce Swanson of Australia countered that anyone can post  
dangerously misleading information anyway. He compared the opening 
of the Internet to the spread of printing: Not all books are 
accurate, and some are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can imagine priests saying, `Mass printing and wide  
dissemination of books is OK so long as we ensure that every book 
is approved by a priest review process,''' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters also note that Internet publication can add material  
that either can't fit into a magazine or, like movies, can't be 
published on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	An NIH spokesman said Varmus was unavailable for comment  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> Price, Norman Head St. Jude Field  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Defending champion Nick Price and 1997  
winner Greg Norman, both playing limited schedules this year, head 
the field at the St. Jude Classic, the final tuneup to the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, David Duval, Vijay Singh and other top players are  
skipping the event, which begins Thursday, to prepare for the Open, 
but the St. Jude field still is intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III, who failed to make the cut last year, is back,  
along with Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, 19-year-old 
Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia and John Daly, who lives in 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman has played only six events this year and is coming off a  
69th-place finish at last week's Memorial Tournament won by Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman said he felt ``a little rusty'' last week, but refused to  
use that as an excuse for his poor putting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm normally a fairly consistently good putter, even coming  
off a break,'' he said. ``I was shocked by the way I putted. I 
can't remember a week where I performed that poorly with the flat 
stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman knows he must putt much better this week if he is to be  
ready for the lightening-fast greens at Pinehurst Resort and 
Country Club in North Carolina, site of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Tournament Players Club at Southwind features  
softer greens that allow players to ``take dead aim'' at the pin, 
Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman, the 1996 British Open champion, called the greens  
``perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are hitting it anywhere near the hole, you're probably  
going to make a lot of putts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The par-71, 7,030-yard course features rolling terrain with 96  
bunkers and 10 water hazards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Price shot 16 under and won a one-hole playoff with  
Jeff Sluman. He was spectacular at the 528-yard 16th, eagling it 
three times and making birdie once. 
</P>
<P>
	Price expects 15 to 20 under will win the tournament this year,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The course) is in the best shape I've seen it in,'' said  
Price, who has two victories and six top-10 finishes in 12 St. Jude 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Norman, Price is picking his spots now and aiming for major  
championships. He has four top-10 finishes in nine PGA Tour events 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having such a great time,'' he said. ``I'm on the back  
nine of my career now, but I don't know what hole I'm on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman first played the TPC at Southwind course in 1997, when  
Price suggested it might be to his liking. It was. Norman birdied 
the final three holes to beat Dudley Hart by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman was recovering from shoulder surgery and did not defend  
his title last year, but he wanted in this year because the course 
suits his game and he likes the hot, humid conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said, ``Winning is probably the best recipe for wanting  
to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purse of $2.5 million is $700,000 larger than last year. The  
winner's share is $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is sponsored by FedEx.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Olympic Gun Transfers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Federal investigators have interviewed the  
maker of a pistol reportedly given to International Olympic 
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch by Salt Lake Olympic 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The decoratively engraved 9 mm high-power pistol made by  
Browning Arms Co. of Mountain Green, Utah, now sits in the IOC 
museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The pistol was sold to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in  
1991, according to Rich Bauter, Browning's vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's at least one gun that I'm aware of that we delivered  
to a member of SLOC in Salt Lake that ended up (in Europe),'' 
Bauter said Wednesday. ``I think maybe others did too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no way of knowing who got the gun. The Salt Lake  
Tribune reported Wednesday it was given to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics investigation into  
the scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games found that Samaranch 
received a limited edition pistol donated by Browning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauter said the guns weren't donated, but as many as 10 were  
sold at cost to SLOC ``because we wanted to help bring the Olympics 
to Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Samaranch -- or someone else -- packed the pistol back to  
Lausanne or it was shipped by SLOC officials remains unclear. 
Either way, the transfer may have violated federal weapons laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. State Department is required to approve shipments of  
weapons leaving the country. Violators could be charged under 
federal law with felony exportation of a firearm without a permit, 
ATF spokesman Larry Bettendorf told The Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Other federal laws restrict non-U.S. citizens from possessing  
firearms without a permit and prohibit unlicensed dealers from 
exporting firearms from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said, ``We  
are not aware that this an issue,'' and declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley Thomas, SLOC's vice president of communications, said  
she ``has no clue'' how the guns got to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bid committee, being a separate entity, and with the  
Department of Justice investigating, we have no access to any of 
those kinds of records,'' she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said SLOC lawyers have not been contacted by  
investigators regarding the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel refused to discuss the  
case, saying only that the department ``continues investigating 
allegations of impropriety in connection with the Salt Lake City 
bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Bukovac, agent in charge of the Salt Lake City office of  
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, confirmed that ``we 
have done some interviews'' regarding the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF is among the federal agencies participating in the  
Justice Department's investigation of lavish treatment, gifts, and 
cash payments given to IOC officials during Salt Lake's Olympic 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauter said federal agents touched on the gun shipments during  
an interview with Browning officials earlier this year, but the 
meeting dealt mostly with the guns sold to SLOC over a period 
dating back to Salt Lake City's first Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Browning arranged to have a distributor in Europe ship  
two guns to Samaranch's office. Other Browning guns were given to 
the King of Norway and a Norwegian Olympic official, according to 
the SLOC ethics report. Russia's Vitaly Smirnov, a former IOC vice 
president, also reportedly received a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian IOC spokesman has said that Smirnov declined a  
Browning hunting rifle, but hosts packed it in his luggage anyway. 
Customs agents in Atlanta found the gun and he left it behind. Two 
years later it was delivered to Moscow by Salt Lake City organizers 
and Smirnov turned it over to a sports facility in Krasnodar, 
Russia, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has acknowledged Samaranch was given a pistol and rifle,  
and Samaranch has said he received guns on two visits to Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune reported that Browning has an invoice for a $395.86  
pistol sold to the committee in February 1991, two months before 
Samaranch's first visit to Utah, at which time he received a pistol 
during a dinner at the home of businessman Jon Huntsman. 
</P>
<P>
	The pistol on the invoice is now in the IOC museum in Lausanne.

<HEADLINE> Car Hits Gov't. Building in Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man drove his car through the glass doors of a  
state office building Wednesday, smashing into an information 
stand. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, who at first said he was a terrorist with a bomb and  
later claimed to be acting on God's orders, was taken into custody. 
No bomb was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Donald R. Delgade, 37, of Lombard, waited for  
pedestrians to get out of the way of the James R. Thompson Center, 
then drove across the wide plaza and crashed through its glass 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Streets and sidewalks crowded with rush-hour traffic were closed  
off as bomb investigators checked the car. The building was 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who was in the lobby at the time said the driver was calm  
when he got out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just matter-of-factly stated 'I'm a terrorist. I have a  
smart bomb,''' Sam Marchetti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago police said Delgade was from a Chicago suburb and that  
he later recanted his statement about the bomb. He was charged with 
criminal damage to government supported property. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Pardonnet, a spokeswoman for the Department of Central  
Management Services, said Delgade told CMS police that God told him 
to drive into the building.

<HEADLINE> Spain Wants Spanish on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The government will give firms a tax break  
for using Spanish on the Internet in a bid to keep the language 
from falling too far behind English in global communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish companies will receive tax incentives and subsidies if  
an as-yet undetermined percentage of their Web site is written in 
the language of Cervantes, the newspaper ABC reported Wednesday. It 
did not say when the plan would be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive coincides with efforts by the Royal Spanish Language  
Academy to promote Spanish as a visible language on the Internet. 
The academy created a Spanish-language reference site that allows 
users to type in a word or phrase and quickly retrieve examples of 
how it can be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish is spoken by an estimated 350 million people around the  
world. Chinese has the most speakers, but few use it outside China. 
English, the dominant language in international discourse, has some 
500 million speakers and is by far the most common language used on 
Web sites.

<HEADLINE> Bank Agency May Have Violated Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government agency that enforces banking  
regulations is being accused of violating a host of federal 
contracting rules and paying higher prices for computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which supervises  
national banks, continually violated laws requiring competitive 
bidding for contracts even after it had been warned to comply with 
the rules, the Treasury Department's inspector general reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the comptroller's office said they believed the  
rules did not apply to the agency. They denied that money was 
misspent, but also said the agency has changed course and is now 
complying with regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's office, which investigates waste and  
fraud, cited the comptroller for paying vendors to buy computers 
instead of purchasing them directly, according to a summary 
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In one $25 million computer contract, the agency may have racked  
up $600,000 in unnecessary expenses by using middlemen, the summary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report's findings were summarized in a letter to Comptroller  
John W. Hawke from two Republican House subcommittee chairmen, 
Reps. Spencer Bachus of Alabama and Peter King of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general studied computer contracts specifically  
but said the agency may have paid ``higher than fair market value'' 
for other purchases and services as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Bachus expressed concern that taxpayers ultimately would pay for  
violations. ``Every bank customer pays for OCC extravagance through 
higher fees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a federal agency, the comptroller's office is funded by  
bank fees. In 1997 it had revenues of $390 million and spent over 
$26 million on office equipment, software and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency comptroller's office was ordered by Treasury  
Department lawyers in 1993 to stop its contracting practices and 
comply with all procurement laws. But the practices continued for 
at least another four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garsson, a spokesman for the comptroller, said the agency  
discontinued the contracting practices in 1997 and does not believe 
it paid unnecessarily high prices. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency often negotiated lower prices than could have  
been yielded by bidding or by existing federal purchasing 
arrangements. ``We think we saved money,'' Garsson said, without 
specifying the savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bachus and King have demanded Hawke determine how much money may  
have been misspent as a result of the practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, the comptroller's office has argued it was  
exempt from federal contracting regulations because it receives no 
federal funds and has independent purchasing authority. The 
Treasury Department disagreed and ordered it to follow the laws in 
a 1993 legal opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, the office finally capitulated.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a real question as to whether we were covered by  
federal statutes, but it just wasn't worth continuing to argue 
about it,'' Garsson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The office's procurement managers acknowledged they were aware  
of the 1993 compliance order from Treasury lawyers, but they 
``repeatedly used procurement practices that did not conform'' and 
concealed the severity of that noncompliance from then-Comptroller 
Eugene Ludwig, the inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, completed in April, found numerous violations of  
federal procurement regulations. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--Procurement managers used vendors as brokers to buy computer  
equipment instead of purchasing it directly. The vendors were 
minority firms, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garsson said the agency was trying to meet federal mandates  
encouraging agencies to award contracts to minority companies. He 
said the agency believed it was cheaper to buy through the vendors 
than pay prices negotiated by the General Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	--Minority vendors were ``illegally instructed'' to purchase  
specific products by brand name, manufacturer and distributor. In 
other cases, special ``waivers'' were used to award contracts to 
specific vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	--Procurement officials split up orders to keep contract values  
below the level that would require Treasury Department 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers made Ludwig aware of the problem in 1997 and he  
ordered the agency to comply with federal rules. Ludwig left the 
agency last year when his five-year term expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke, a former Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance,  
was appointed comptroller in December.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Join Judy Collins on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a string arrangement of the Hungarian  
Rondo and an accordion performance of the ``Beer Barrel Polka'' as 
her opening act, singer Judy Collins had a White House audience 
singing along by the time she wrapped up a state dinner honoring 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined  
Collins on stage Tuesday night and the trio led the 180 guests 
assembled in the East Room for an a cappella rendition of ``Amazing 
Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand finale topped off an evening celebrating folk music  
from both countries, as members of the Marine Band Strolling 
Strings weaved through the tables playing the rondo and other 
selections. Twelve-year-old accordion virtuoso, Cory Pesaturo, 
enjoyed the full attention of the president as he joined in on 
several pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first family's request, Collins performed ``Chelsea  
Morning,'' a song that inspired the name of the president's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	She also sang such favorites as ``Send in the Clowns'' and a  
song titled ``Walls,'' which came about after her husband, Louis 
Nelson, designed the Korean War Veterans Memorial Mural. 
</P>
<P>
	The song ``kind of says it is all about the transformational  
experience of when the war is over,'' Collins said Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The war in Kosovo -- and looking ahead to when it would be over --  
was a theme echoed also in the toasts given by the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton saluted Goncz for working to help people live together  
peacefully and overcome their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is at the heart of what we have been trying to do in our  
efforts to reverse ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and to build a 
southeastern Europe in which all people can live together in 
dignity and freedom,'' Clinton said in his official toast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian president pledged to use the lessons his nation  
had learned to aid Serbia if it started down the path to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one day the democratic leadership in Serbia is created, we  
Hungarians are ready to share our experience in building democracy 
with the Serbian people, with the Serbian leadership,'' said Goncz 
through a translator. ``We are prepared to extend a helping hand 
... because we know what bonding means from our own experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list included some who have vocally opposed U.S.  
bombing in the region. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who attended 
the dinner, is among a group of lawmakers that had filed suit, 
denied by a judge, accusing the president of overstepping his 
authority when he ordered the U.S. military to bomb Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all want peace,'' Kucinich said. ``The question is what are  
the means to obtain peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, just returned from his trip to  
Macedonia, expressed his hope about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that peace is closer,'' Wiesel said.  
</P>
<P>
	The dinner drew a host of other literary figures -- including  
authors E.L. Doctorow and William Styron -- in a fitting tribute to 
the president who taught himself English while in prison. Goncz 
later went on to translate a host of English works into Hungarian 
and become a writer himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an exceptionally cultivated man,'' said writer Susan  
Sontag, whose works were translated by Goncz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best Hungary has had in generations,'' said Rep. Tom  
Lantos, D-Calif., who was born in Hungary. ``He's a fantastic human 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Tony Curtis, fashion designer Adrienne Vittadini and  
Martha Stewart also attended the event. Author Kitty Kelley, famous 
for penning sensational unauthorized biographies of celebrities, 
sat at Mrs. Clinton's table. Asked whether she would consider 
writing a book on the first family, Kelley wouldn't say but did add 
that the she found the first lady ``probably one of the most 
fascinating women of the 20th century.''

	MIAMI (AP) -- Inspired by the growth of its annual men's  
basketball event, the Orange Bowl Committee announced Wednesday 
it's expanding into the women's game. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural Orange Bowl Women's Basketball Fab Four will be  
played Dec. 19 at Florida International University, one day after 
an expanded men's event that includes North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels, beaten by Weber State in the first round of the  
NCAA tournament last season, will play Miami as the featured game 
of a tripleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	The other men's games will pit Florida State against  
Massachusetts and Florida International against St. Bonaventure. In 
the women's event, Miami plays North Carolina State and Florida 
International faces Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is right for this to happen,'' Orange Bowl executive  
director Keith Tribble said. ``With the WNBA franchise awarded here 
in Miami, it offers another opportunity to showcase women's 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange Bowl sponsored a women's basketball tournament in  
1978 featuring powerhouse Tennessee. With the growth of the women's 
game in the 1990s, the Fab Four is expected to have better staying 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a community that's starting to embrace basketball,'' said  
Miami women's coach Ferne Labati, noting that the Hurricanes didn't 
even have a men's team from 1971-85. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through a time where we didn't have any men's  
basketball in South Florida, so nobody got into the college hoops 
scene. We've worked hard to try and change that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's event has grown steadily since its inception in 1994,  
when Miami played UNLV. Last year's doubleheader of Miami-Ohio 
State and Florida-Michigan drew 11,051. That's an increase of more 
than 8,000 over the 1996 game between the Hurricanes and DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripleheaders are rare for single-day festivals in college  
basketball, but Tribble said the opportunity was too good to pass 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited about it,'' he said. ``From talking to the  
coaches, they're intrigued by the experiment. We look forward to 
hosting a wonderful day of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina represents a landmark of sorts for the event's  
ability to attract top programs. The Tar Heels have reached the 
NCAA tournament each of the past 25 years and has won at least 20 
games in each of the past 29 seasons. Both are NCAA records. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Leonard Hamilton said the Tar Heels ``represent  
college basketball in so many positive ways. They are one of the 
winningest problems in the history of college basketball. They 
represent a position that we are trying to get to.''

<HEADLINE> Kasich's Plan Poses Political Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking a political risk, GOP presidential  
candidate John Kasich is proposing to cut the initial Social 
Security benefit by nearly $4,000 in 2020 -- while giving retirees a 
chance to reap even more by investing some of their payroll taxes 
in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts say Kasich's Social Security plan, presented  
Wednesday, could do for his campaign what former American Red Cross 
President Elizabeth Dole's call for new restrictions on gun 
ownership did for hers: focus needed attention on a Republican 
presidential hopeful other than the front-runner, Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``You take an issue that normally people don't want to get close  
to and just come out with a fairly bold issue that is bound to 
cause people to debate,'' Republican political consultant Eddie 
Mahe said. ``You have no choice. Otherwise, you remain invisible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's issue is Social Security, long known as the ``third  
rail'' of American politics because proposals to cut benefits have 
killed more than one politician's career. Even as voter turnout 
declines, seniors regularly show up at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the risks to his campaign, the Ohio congressman  
said, ``Franklin Roosevelt also said the only thing ... we have to 
fear is fear itself. Yesterday on the Hill, I told a couple of my 
colleagues about this plan. And they said, oh my God, you know -- oh 
my God, you're going to propose that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said some sacrifice was necessary to preserve the system.  
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians who raise the prospects of an adjustment do so at  
some peril, still,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist 
College Institute for Public Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republican candidates, including Steve Forbes, former Vice  
President Dan Quayle and Sen. John McCain, have offered their own 
Social Security proposals, all of them focusing on allowing workers 
to invest in private retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great deal of cynicism that there will be Social  
Security for younger Americans,'' McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky 
said. ``That feeds the cynicism they have about government in 
general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But none of the other candidates has called for reducing future  
benefits, as Kasich has. He said his proposal was designed to 
ensure that the system remained solvent without raising the 
retirement age or increasing payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's plan would base the future initial Social Security  
payments on the Consumer Price Index, which reflects increases in 
prices, rather than the current formula that reflects increases in 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
	The result would be that the average worker beginning to collect  
Social Security in 2020 would receive almost $4,000 less in the 
first year of retirement than he or she would be expected to 
receive under the current formula. The difference increases with 
time. By 2070, newly retired workers would receive an expected 
benefit of $118,368 that first year, almost half as much as they 
would receive under the current program. 
</P>
<P>
	Those workers could more than make up the difference by  
investing part of their payroll taxes in the stock market, Kasich 
said. His plan would allow workers now under age 55 to voluntarily 
divert some of their Social Security taxes into private accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest-wage workers would be allowed to divert the largest  
portion of payroll taxes -- up to 3.5 percent -- into the accounts. 
Workers earning more than the maximum income taxed by Social 
Security -- $72,600 in 1999 -- would be allowed to divert only 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would not affect current retirees nor those workers  
55 and older. Future cost-of-living increases in benefits also 
would not be affected.

<HEADLINE>  Bettman: NHL in State of Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky is retired. So is Mario Lemieux. TV  
viewership and revenues are a fraction of the NFL's. One team is in 
bankruptcy, another has no money. Of every dollar made by owners, 
$1.33 is spent on salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the world of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, one where  
bankruptcy judges and bottom lines cause as much anxiety as 
watching the last four Stanley Cup finals end abruptly in four-game 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	As football, baseball and basketball thrive with exciting home  
run races and unpredictable playoffs and survive labor disputes and 
Michael Jordan's retirement, the state of the NHL is one of 
transition and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	And worry.  
</P>
<P>
	Network TV revenues will jump appreciably next season under a  
new contract with ABC and ESPN, but NHL teams still will earn only 
6 percent of what a single NFL franchise makes from TV. That's 
understandable; hockey's most-watched games attract an audience 
less than one-tenth the size of the viewership for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest-rated NHL game was the 1996 All-Star game, getting a  
4.1 rating. That's about half of what the World Wrestling 
Federation matches draw on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great game,'' Bettman said. ``We just have to get  
more people to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, even as it is expanding to Atlanta, Columbus and Minnesota  
to bring its league to 30 franchises by the 2000-01 season, the NHL 
is preoccupied with keeping afloat the Pittsburgh Penguins and the 
New York Islanders, teams that have won a combined six Stanley 
Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are operating under federal bankruptcy protection,  
the first major U.S. pro sports team to do so since the Penguins 
themselves a quarter-century ago. The franchise's fate likely will 
be decided June 24, when a group led by Hall of Famer Lemieux could 
have its takeover plan approved by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders, looking for new ownership and a new arena, have  
cut their payroll so drastically that only one star, Zigmund 
Palffy, remains, and even he is on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
	So many problems. So much work for hockey to do. So few  
recognizable stars to promote, especially now that Gretzky and 
Lemieux have joined Jordan in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Think selling Michael Peca as a household name is easy?  
</P>
<P>
	``But Rocket Richard retired and the game went on, and Gordie  
Howe retired and the game went on,'' Bettman said. ``The game will 
go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's game plan for a prosperous NHL:  
</P>
<P>
	--Continue to increase revenues, which have jumped by $500  
million in five years, by moving into even more new 
money-generating arenas and stimulating interest in hockey 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Slow skyrocketing salaries with judicious personnel decisions  
and, ultimately, through a new collective bargaining agreement, 
even though the current deal doesn't end until the 2003-04 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revenues in the last five years have increased at a phenomenal  
rate but, having said that, players' salaries for the last two 
years have grown faster than our growth in revenues,'' Bettman said 
Wednesday. ``In the final analysis, that is not going to continue 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Promote, promote, promote to build a younger and broader fan  
base. Not with glowing hockey pucks or Zamboni races, but by 
enticing fans to watch the game in person, where it much better 
appreciated than on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Correcting hockey's myriad problems won't be easy, especially  
since the game remains indigenous to the sparsely populated plains 
and provinces of Canada, not to the Sun Belt cities where the sport 
has migrated. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as always, it comes down to money. Always, money.  
</P>
<P>
	Because its national TV ratings and, subsequently, its national  
TV revenues are so much lower than football, baseball or 
basketball, hockey spends a disproportionate amount of its revenues 
on salaries -- approximately 72 percent, or 9 percentage points more 
than any other sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek's $8 million salary, for  
example, rivals that of Mark McGwire. But McGwire's St. Louis 
Cardinals play twice as many games before twice as many fans and 
make five times as much in national TV income as Hasek's Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	And what is the more magical number: Hasek's .939 playoff save  
percentage or McGwire's 70 home runs? 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we are paying 133 percent of our gate receipts to  
the players,'' Boston Bruins general manager Harry Sinden said at a 
recent Board of Governors' meeting. ``Take every single ticket that 
is sold across the league, and we've got to find 33 percent more 
just to pay them. Just them! We've got problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Penguins bankruptcy hearing last week, NHL general counsel  
William Daly estimated that 20 of the NHL's 28 teams are losing 
money. The figure is questionable because it does not count arena 
revenues that some teams control, but the general consensus around 
the league is that at least half the franchises aren't profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Montreal Canadiens, who are to hockey what the Yankees  
are to baseball, caused a ripple of disbelief in Canada by 
revealing they lost $3.8 million at the same time they moved into a 
new arena this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tampa Bay, Art Williams became so disenchanted with the sport  
so quickly that he agreed to sell the Lightning midway through his 
first season of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing money is one thing but, as Kings president Tim Leiweke  
said, ``If the league keeps going in this direction, it's going to 
be losing franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may come as soon as this month if Lemieux's buyout plan in  
Pittsburgh is disapproved, though that does not appear likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we have teams losing money,'' Bettman  
said. ``Even if it were one team, it would be too many. The worst 
case is it is a four- or five-year phenomenon. The best case is it 
will start correcting itself sooner. It isn't going to be a 
long-term problem because it is going to get fixed.''

<HEADLINE> Fox Withdraws From Broadcast Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Fox network has pulled out of the National  
Association of Broadcasters over a disagreement with the group over 
lobbying Congress for changes in rules governing ownership of 
television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., wanted the  
NAB to push for greater deregulation in the broadcast industry, 
especially a rule that prevents a single company from owning 
stations that reach more than 35 percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox already reaches just under 35 percent of U.S. homes with the  
22 stations it owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Other networks have also protested the ownership rule, but  
locally owned stations have been opposed to increasing the cap 
because they fear that increased concentration of TV ownership 
could give the networks more clout over smaller stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Binzel, the chief lobbyist for News Corp. in Washington,  
said the company had general disagreements with the NAB over 
legislative issues but the ownership rule was the main sticking 
point behind its decision to leave the NAB, effective Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a basic decision that it didn't seem to make sense to  
pay dues to a trade association that was opposed to our No. 1 
legislative priority,'' Binzel said. 
</P>
<P>
	NAB spokesman Dennis Wharton said that Fox's departure would  
have a ``minimal'' financial impact on the group since the four 
major networks together contribute less than 4 percent of the 
group's annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I concede that we as an industry are stronger when we speak  
with a united voice, but the strength of the NAB comes from the 
fact that our member stations are in virtually every city, district 
and county in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS and NBC all remain members of the NAB. ABC quit the  
group in the early 90s over another policy disagreement but 
rejoined the group a year and a half later. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAB, based in Washington, represents 1,200 TV stations  
across the country and more than 5,000 radio stations.

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Ben Folds Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ask Ben Folds what first flipped his musical  
switch and you get a heartwarming, if familiar, answer: He was 
entranced by the Beatles' debut on ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then you do the math.  
</P>
<P>
	Let's see, that Beatles performance was in February 1964. Folds,  
despite his retreating hairline, is 32. That would mean he saw the 
show when he was a boy of ... Hey, wait a minute! 
</P>
<P>
	The answer reveals a couple of important things about him.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Folds is musically astute enough to recognize how that  
Beatles show is cited so much as an influence that it has become a 
cliche. His knowledge of musical history is also evident in his 
work, filled with enough references to thrill a critic but too much 
to pigeonhole his band. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, he's a wise guy.  
</P>
<P>
	Sit down with Folds, Darren Jessee and Robert Sledge, the three  
men who make up Ben Folds Five, and you quickly realize they see 
interviews as a game. Ask how it feels to reach a wider audience, 
and Folds will talk about the increased clothing sizes of his fans. 
</P>
<P>
	What else can they say that's outrageous yet plausible enough to  
be believed? That Jessee has had three wives? That he can't forget 
his first Ratt concert? 
</P>
<P>
	That sense of humor is also a part of their music -- sometimes to  
good effect, sometimes not. It's evident in their name, too. Again, 
do the math. 
</P>
<P>
	Smarm and charm, together with the unusual configuration of  
piano, bass guitar and drums inspired by early Elton John, are what 
sets this North Carolina-based trio apart. 
</P>
<P>
	During concerts, Folds pounds on his grand piano, sometimes with  
his piano stool, and his enthusiastic fans shout his lyrics back at 
him. It's a good time -- a simple element too often forgotten these 
days in rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Folds skewers peers who make irony an art form (``Battle of Who  
Could Care Less''), and kisses off ex-girlfriends and everyone who 
picked on him in high school. But his best-known song, ``Brick,'' 
is a dead-serious chronicle of a relationship disintegrating after 
an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our band has always been a good thing to see for  
people who are jaded,'' Folds said. ``There's always too much going 
on for people to completely ignore. If you thought that the songs 
were stupid, there are about eight other things going on at the 
same time that you can tap into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a long lineage of rock 'n' rollers who used the piano as  
a lead instrument, including Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Elton 
John and Billy Joel. But in today's music world, it's rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Folds, who played bass and drums earlier in his career, settled  
on the piano with Ben Folds Five because it was the instrument he 
used when writing songs. Besides, he thought a piano makes a song 
sound better than it actually is. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the trio had to deal with skepticism: What, no guitar?  
Club owners would grouse about fitting a grand piano on a tiny 
stage, and wonder why Folds couldn't use a portable keyboard 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't take much, but if you do something a bit different,  
you're going to run into a lot of brick walls along the way,'' he 
said. ``We toughened up about those things. By the time we started 
playing in a band, we had a pretty strong resolve about what we 
were doing. There was nothing that was going to get in our way 
creatively, except for ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They don't need a guitar to make a racket, either. Sledge and  
Jessee are adept at filling any holes in BF5's sound; Sledge's bass 
occasionally takes the lead. That's what makes the band's sound 
unique, not the piano, Folds said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most creative thing you can do is put a limitation on  
someone and see how they respond to it,'' he said. ``I think we're 
just now figuring out how to deal with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those surface limitations don't stop the ambitious trio from  
evoking the sounds of all sorts of heroes, like ``Bohemian 
Rhapsody''-era Queen. ``Don't Change Your Plans'' has a blatant 
Burt Bacharach homage. Even Devo appears to be an influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brick'' gave Ben Folds Five a small measure of fame, with  
radio and video airplay, to go with a growing audience resulting 
from their relentless touring. It was nice, although the band 
doesn't necessarily trust it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a pinball machine or something,'' Folds said. ``If  
you get the ball in the right hole, you rack points up, no matter 
how much work you put into it. It definitely seemed like that for a 
while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their latest disc is a concept album of sorts about emotional  
dislocation. One song, ``Army,'' was born when Folds recalled the 
incredulous response of his father when he talked about enlisting. 
That memory was built into a song about a man who probably would 
have been better off if he hadn't listened to his father and gone 
to college instead of into the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``God, please spare me more rejection,'' the narrator pleads in  
the lyrics. ``'Cause my peers, they criticize me. And my ex-wives 
all despise me. Try to put it all behind me, but my redneck past is 
nipping at my heels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the album's songs features the band noodling behind a  
slightly disoriented message left on Folds' answering machine by 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
	A better, more inspired, use of outside material came on a side  
project Folds released under the name Fear of Pop. He provides the 
gentle musical backdrop to a misogynistic narration by the king of 
over-emoting actors, William Shatner. It's hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
	One inside joke almost came back to haunt the band. Recalling  
the name used by a group of Jessee's friends when they made fake 
IDs to get into bars, Ben Folds Five named its new disc, ``The 
Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner.'' Then they discovered 
there was a real Reinhold Messner, a noted mountaineer. 
</P>
<P>
	The band tracked down Messner to explain they weren't trying to  
embarrass him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to Reinhold Messner for being a hero,'' the album's  
liner notes read, ``and now a good sport.''

<HEADLINE> Canoeist To Be Tried for Cursing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- A man who let loose with a stream of  
profanities after falling out of a canoe goes on trial Thursday in 
a case that pits the right of free speech against the struggle to 
preserve decency in an increasingly coarse society. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Joseph Boomer, a 25-year-old factory worker, is charged  
with violating an 1897 state law against cursing in front of women 
and children. The offense is punishable by 90 days in jail or a 
$100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer's lawyers have said the law is rarely enforced because  
prosecutors know it's unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents of rural Arenac County hope the case will help  
make common courtesy fashionable once more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope the message gets out that we should respect each  
other,'' said Ladd White, who runs a canoe livery along the Rifle 
River, where Boomer had his mishap last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer, who is from the Detroit suburb of Roseville, was with a  
group of friends on the winding, tree-lined river about 130 miles 
north of Detroit when his canoe hit a rock. 
</P>
<P>
	He tumbled out and yelled a series of obscenities within earshot  
of a woman and children in another boat, said a sheriff's deputy 
who was patrolling the river and ticketed Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer refuses to repeat the words he used but insists they've  
been exaggerated. He says he didn't see anyone but his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	He is represented by an attorney with the American Civil  
Liberties Union, which contends the law infringes on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Allen C. Yenior, who will preside over the trial, ruled in  
February that the prohibition on cursing in front of women is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yenior upheld the law as it pertains to children, saying  
Boomer's alleged expletives could be considered ``fighting words,'' 
which the courts have ruled lack constitutional protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Police began patrolling the river last summer because of  
complaints about drunken, rowdy boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Undersheriff Patricia Skarbek said her department sometimes  
issued up to 40 tickets a day on weekends, but most were for 
offenses like public drunkenness. She said she didn't know of 
another instance in which someone was cited for profanity. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who posted a sign at his livery reading ``We Love Sober  
Canoers,'' said things have gotten better. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not drinking as much, going as ballistic as in years  
past,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Draft Customer Service Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the face of more serious congressional  
action, the nation's major airlines are drafting a ``customer 
service commitment'' outlining specific plans to treat passengers 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	One part of the 12-point plan, a draft of which was obtained  
Wednesday by The Associated Press, would commit airlines to meeting 
customers' essential needs during long on-aircraft delays. That 
would include making ``every reasonable effort to provide food, 
water, restroom facilities and access to medical treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That commitment stems from the New Year's travel delays in  
Detroit, when passengers stuck on snowbound plans were held for 
hours in view of the airport terminal, in some cases without access 
to food, water or functioning toilets. Complaints about such 
treatment prompted several bills in the House and Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One such bill would require airlines to pay passengers  
compensation when they are stranded for more than two hours. 
Another would give passengers 48 hours to cancel nonrefundable 
tickets. Northwest Airlines, the focal point for many of the New 
Year's complaints, also was criticized last week by the 
Transportation Department for its handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the nation's major airlines were holding their  
quarterly meeting in Washington on Thursday at the headquarters of 
their trade group, the Air Transport Association. The plan, which 
was drafted by the ATA, has a signature page and is dated June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline representatives, along with key members of Congress, had  
been expected to announce the voluntary plan during a Thursday news 
conference on Capitol Hill, but that was postponed as the final 
details were discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	David Fuscus, an association spokesman, declined expansive  
comment on the issue, but he did say: ``This is something we are 
actively working on. The final customer service plan has not been 
completed but will be shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides better treatment of stranded passengers, the airline  
plan would publicly commit the airlines to several things that have 
been proposed by Congress and the Clinton administration, are 
already the law or are the current policies of some carriers. 
According to the draft, they include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Providing the lowest fare available on telephone reservation  
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Notifying customers of known delays, cancellation and  
diversions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Return of checked baggage within 24 hours.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the baggage liability limit from the current $1,250  
per bag. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowing reservations to be held or canceled.  
</P>
<P>
	--Providing prompt ticket refunds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing airline procedures for accommodating disabled  
passengers or minors traveling alone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishing and disclosing policies for all passengers who are  
kept off a flight despite a confirmed reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Disclosing in advance aircraft seating plans, rules on frequent  
flier redemptions and ticket cancellation policies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ensuring flight partners provide comparable customer service.  
</P>
<P>
	--Assuring that all written complaints are answered within 60  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The service commitment says the plans will be completed by  
December 15 and fully implemented by June 15, 2000.

<HEADLINE> The Many Musical Sides of Los Lobos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last month, the crowd gathered to see Puerto  
Rican singing star Ricky Martin at a Manhattan record store 
outnumbered the throng across the street lined up for an advance 
screening of the new ``Star Wars'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	While Los Lobos may not attract the same frenzy of fans as the  
hip-swiveling Martin, the older, less flamboyant roots-rock band 
from East Los Angeles does possess an eclectic edge that rivals 
most contemporary Latin bands. 
</P>
<P>
	The band's new album ``This Time'' -- its first in almost three  
years -- is scheduled for release on July 20. The band plans to tour 
and is scheduled to perform at this year's Woodstock Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer-guitarist David Hidalgo said the new album is like those  
made by the '70s multiethnic band War, ``where you have eight 
people playing at once, kind of sloppy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This Time'' is a mixture of rhythm-and-blues, guitar rock,  
Mexican ballads and other Latin-based styles like cumbias and 
guajiras. The album is marked by a production quality that has a 
``strong neighborhood feel to it,'' said Hidalgo, 44, during an 
interview at the midtown offices of Atlantic Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo, along with guitarist-singer Cesar Rosas, drummer Louie  
Perez and bassist Conrad Lozano, formed Los Lobos some 25 years 
ago. Saxophone player Steve Berlin joined the band in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Lobos is best-known for its No. 1 hit rendition of Ritchie  
Valens' ``La Bamba.'' The band boldly fuses its Mexican roots with 
an array of styles that include blues, country, Tex-Mex and, most 
recently, the avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Mitchell Froom and sound engineer Tchad Blake were  
invited to the communal recording sessions for ``This Time,'' to 
add their experimental flair. Both have worked with Los Lobos since 
the 1992 album ``Kiko,'' which was praised as a production and 
musical triumph. Layers of industrial-tinged rhythms and 
idiosyncratic instrumentation were matched up against the band's 
Mexican origins and rhythm-and-blues grooves. 
</P>
<P>
	Froom and Blake's quirky recording techniques have become an  
integral part of the Los Lobos sound without being a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have our own self-imposed boundaries, but that's how we  
became who we are,'' Hidalgo said. ``We stuck to the Mexican 
music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the formula has helped define Los Lobos, it has also  
limited exploration of other musical realms. Rather than completely 
alter the band's focus, Hidalgo and his bandmates have found other 
musical outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three years between ``This Time'' and its predecessor  
``Colossal Head,'' Hidalgo and Rosas each won a Grammy for their 
contributions to Los Super Seven, an all-star assemblage of Tex-Mex 
musicians known as the Latin version of the Traveling Wilburys. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Rosas manifested his roots-rock tendencies on  
his debut solo album, ``Soul Disguise,'' the first of a four-record 
deal with Rykodisc USA. The album goes back to the stripped sound 
of earlier Los Lobos albums. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rosas embraces his roots on his solo excursion, Hidalgo  
turns his influences upside down in his more established 
avant-barrio side project, the Latin Playboys, which grew out of 
his desire to experiment more openly with Puerto Rican and Cuban 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to do something over the top -- experiment and take it  
a step beyond the more restrictive Los Lobos style,'' Hidalgo said. 
The Latin Playboys also includes Perez and the producer-engineer 
team of Froom and Blake, who are inclined toward the experimental. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo's homegrown project began in his kitchen, where he  
recorded his musical sketches on a four-track tape recorder using 
silverware, newspaper-stuffed guitars and an array of ``found'' 
sounds. In some cases, the charm and simplicity of Hidalgo's 
low-tech blueprints were so endearing, Froom and Blake couldn't 
bring themselves to alter them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Latin Playboys has released two albums in its six years  
together. Everyone has a career apart from the band, so ``we're not 
putting the weight of our lives on this,'' Blake said. ``We come to 
this clean.'' As the band's underground popularity grows, so does 
its influence on its more ubiquitous parent Los Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happened once before already on the last record, but it  
hasn't caused any serious conflict,'' said Hidalgo, who recently 
unleashed ``Houndog,'' a digitally altered blues record. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much happening in Los Lobos' camp, how do Froom and  
Blake decide which songs go to Los Lobos and which go to the Latin 
Playboys? 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the stuff that sounds complete in its demo form --  
that's the Latin Playboys record,'' Froom said. ``If it sounds like 
it would be cool to reinvent it with the band and open it up and 
see how that feels, then that's a Los Lobos record.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins 100 Meters at Milan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Four false starts and a lack of competition  
kept world champion Maurice Greene far off the world record but 
didn't stop him from winning the 100 meters at the Milan track and 
field meet Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene clocked 10.16 seconds, beating Nigeria's Innocent Asonze,  
runner-up at 10.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, ranked No. 1 in the world last year, was .32 seconds off  
the world mark of 9.84 held by Canadian Donovan Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not obsessed with the world record,'' said Greene, who  
blamed the series of false starts for a lack of concentration and 
for failing to clock a faster time. 
</P>
<P>
	Inger Miller made it a sweep for U.S. sprinters, winning the  
women's 100 in 11.14. She beat Susanthika Jaysinghe, the silver 
medalist at the 1997 World Championships, who was timed in 11.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Moroccan Salah Hissou had the world's best performance of the  
year in the 5,000, clocking 12:52.53, as he beat world champion 
Daniel Komen of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Iagar-Dinescu of Romania also produced the best world  
performance of the year in the women's high jump, clearing 6 feet, 
7 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco won the 1,500 meters in a quick  
3:31.34. Italy's Fiona May took the women's long jump at 23-0 1/2, and 
Mexico's Alejandro Cardenas beat Leonard Byrd of the United States 
in the 400 meters in 45.50.

<HEADLINE> NBC Takes Stake in Personalized TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- TV networks, struggling to reverse a decline  
in viewership amid heavy competition from cable and the Internet, 
can at least find solace from an increase in advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	So it may seem strange that one of the big four, NBC, is  
partnering with a fledgling technology company to sell digital 
video recorders that automatically find shows to fit the viewer's 
personal tastes and allow commercials to be skipped. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's true the new recorders could mean people will watch  
fewer ads, NBC is banking on the technology, created by TiVo Inc., 
because the machines can choose ads targeted specifically to the 
interests of each viewer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Digital recording is going to happen. It's going to be a fact  
of life,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC Cable, which announced 
Wednesday it will make a multimillion dollar investment in the 
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based TiVo and work with the small, privately 
held company in refining the recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies are also betting on TiVo. Investors in the  
company include the consumer electronics maker Philips Electronics, 
the satellite TV company DirecTV, Showtime Networks, and Vulcan 
Ventures, the investment company run by Microsoft co-founder Paul 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	TiVo's main rival, Replay Networks Inc., of Mountain View,  
signed a deal Tuesday to have the electronics maker Panasonic 
manufacture its devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar to Replay Networks, TiVo's device stores TV shows on a  
high-capacity computer disk for viewers to watch when they're 
ready. The boxes can record 14 hours to 30 hours, depending on the 
size of the hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, which will sit atop the TV set like a cable TV box,  
also gives viewers controls to pause, rewind and ``instant replay'' 
television without using a videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	TiVo sells its recorders directly over the Internet and expects  
to have them in retail stores by July or August. The 14-hour 
version sells for $499 and the 30-hour box costs $999. Customers 
also pay a $9.95 monthly service fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay boxes are expected be in stores in time for the holiday  
shopping season. Replay's device costs from $699 to $1,499 
depending on storage capacity. There is no monthly service fee. 
</P>
<P>
	With the alliance, NBC will gain a prominent position on TiVo's  
electronic programming screen, which gives viewers a menu for 
programs they want to record. As they select programs, the box 
builds a profile of the viewer's preferences and will automatically 
record similar shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the TiVo and Replay boxes allow viewers to quickly bypass  
commercials in a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The critical issue for NBC was the concept of targeted  
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and TiVo plan to modify the system to allow the network to  
download large batches of ads onto the hard disk. The device would 
then pick ads that fit the viewer's personal profile and insert 
them into programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hope that by tailoring the ad package, viewers will be  
less likely to skip them. The digital recorders also create other 
opportunities, such as selling ads that would appear on the TiVo 
program schedule, said Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester 
Research in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all opportunities NBC would like to investigate as a  
potential bulwark against the loss of advertising,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also important for NBC: Unlike Replay, TiVo won't tout its  
commercial-killing capability, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``TiVo preserves our advertising model,'' he said during a  
conference call with reporters. ``Digital programming where ads 
would be automatically zapped would be anathema to what 
broadcasting is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practically speaking, the new technology means viewers will be  
watching fewer ads, said Bernoff. A Forrester study predicts that 
commercial viewing will decline by 8 percent during the next five 
years and 50 percent over 10 years as a result of digital 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a TiVo at home and I never watch commercials anymore,''  
said Bernoff.

<HEADLINE> Parental Consent Law Struck Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arizona's parental consent law is  
unconstitutional because it lacks a time limit for a judge to 
decide on whether to allow a minor to get an abortion without her 
parents' permission, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a federal judge's  
ruling striking down the 1996 law, which has never been enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	An anti-abortion lawyer denounced the ruling and said he hoped  
the state would appeal it to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Since minors need parental consent for other types of  
operations, ``it's strictly politics when they make a distinction 
that this particular surgical procedure, abortion, doesn't need 
parental consent,'' said Edmund D. Kahn, lawyer for Arizona Right 
to Life. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Napolitano's office said it will study  
the ruling and decisions from other courts before deciding whether 
to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law would require an unmarried woman under 18 to obtain  
consent from a parent for an abortion. As an alternative, she could 
try to persuade a judge, in a confidential proceeding, that an 
abortion without parental consent was in her best interest.

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Twins outfielder Matt Lawton will  
be out for about two weeks with a fractured right eye socket, the 
team's general manager confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawton was hit by a pitch from Cincinnati reliever Dennys Reyes  
in the eighth inning of the Twins' 5-2 victory over the Reds on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins initially believed Lawton had escaped serious injury,  
but X-rays revealed two fractures in his eye socket. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not too badly displaced, but he's not going to be  
able to play baseball,'' Twins physician Vijay Eyunni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins general manager Terry Ryan said Lawton would be put on the  
15-day disabled list today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawton was hitting .258 with five home runs and 26 runs batted  
in going into the game. Cleatus Davidson ran for Lawton.

<HEADLINE> FDA Restricts Sale of Trovan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government warned doctors Wednesday to  
quit using the popular antibiotic Trovan except in emergencies 
because it can damage patients' livers. To make sure doctors 
comply, the drug no longer will be sold in general pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
	Trovan should be used only for patients in hospitals or nursing  
homes who have certain lifethreatening infections for which the 
need for the antibiotic outweighs its liver risks, the Food and 
Drug Administration said in issuing the unusual restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturer Pfizer Inc. has agreed to sell Trovan only to  
hospitals and long-term nursing care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	If patients using intravenous Trovan are well enough to go home,  
doctors would give patients enough Trovan pills to complete their 
treatment rather than writing a prescription a regular drugstore 
would fill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only way to get the message across that this really  
was not supposed to be used for the run-of-the-mill outpatient 
infection,'' said FDA drug chief Dr. Murray Lumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February 1998, 140 cases of liver damage have been  
reported among Trovan users. The FDA said in 14 cases, the drug 
apparently caused the most severe liver damage, called acute liver 
failure. Six patients died, three survived thanks to liver 
transplants, and three recovered without a transplant. Two others 
still are being treated. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA maintains that Trovan's liver risks were not apparent in  
pre-market testing of the drug. Thus, the agency initially allowed 
the antibiotic to be sold as a broad treatment for everything from 
minor skin infections to severe hospital infections. Some 2.5 
million people have used it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the reports of liver damage began. Last month, the European  
Union warned Europeans to stop taking Trovan if they experience 
liver damage symptoms such as fatigue, yellowing skin or eyes, 
stomach pain with nausea or vomiting, or dark urine. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a consumer advocacy group urged that Trovan be banned  
in the United States, saying Americans can buy eight other equally 
effective but less risky antibiotics. The advocacy group Public 
Citizen repeated that recommendation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA concluded, in a public health advisory to the nation's  
doctors, that Trovan no longer should be used for outpatient or 
less serious infections. But the agency said Trovan treats a 
slightly broader range of some of the most dangerous germs in 
hospitalized patients -- such as deadly abdominal infections -- and 
thus was important for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said even though it agreed to the restriction, other  
antibiotics have similarly dangerous risks. ``We honestly don't 
believe Trovan needed to be restricted in this way,'' said vice 
president Dr. Joseph Feczko.

<HEADLINE> Tough Truck Pollution Rules Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a familiar sight: A dump truck pulls onto  
the road and sends a black cloud of smoke spewing from the exhaust 
pipe, momentarily choking the air. 
</P>
<P>
	While automobiles must pass periodic emissions tests and  
increasingly tougher anti-pollution devices, large diesel trucks 
require no such inspections and far less stringent controls. 
</P>
<P>
	As the nation's capital sweltered in another summer air  
pollution alert Tuesday, environmentalists and state regulators 
pressed for tougher federal pollution fighting measures for 
heavy-duty diesel trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably no more offensive air pollution than the  
thick, noxious pollution from big trucks,'' Bill Becker, who 
represents state and county air pollution agencies in Washington, 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely unregulated until the late 1980s, the trucks have become  
cleaner, but still belch out millions of tons of smog-causing 
nitrogen oxide and account for about half of the fine soot released 
from moving sources, according federal and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Environmental Protection Agency issued  
tougher pollution standards for heavy trucks, beginning in 2004. 
The agency is reviewing the regulation to see whether it should be 
changed and considering a separate requirement to reduce the amount 
of sulfur in diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those actions and more are needed, says Felice Stadler of the  
Clean Air Network, a coalition of public health and environmental 
groups. Yet, she said even under the EPA regulation, trucks would 
not be required to have commercially available pollution control 
catalysts such as those required on cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree that more may be required to reduce pollution from  
heavy trucks and buses,'' EPA spokesman David Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollution from the more than 5 million large trucks that  
crisscross the country is gaining increased attention as the EPA 
proposes dramatically tougher emission controls on cars and popular 
sport-utility vehicles. It also has proposed cutting sulfur content 
in gasoline by 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But state regulators and environmentalists said trucks, although  
far fewer in number, are an equally bad source of air pollution. 
They want the EPA to require low-sulfur diesel fuel, impose even 
stricter emission standards than contemplated for 2004 and require 
inspections to ensure standards are met by trucks actually on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department disclosed in October that 1.1 million  
trucks that had passed factory emission inspections actually were 
polluting much more than allowed because of devices that had been 
installed illegally to overcome emissions controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Large trucks account for 3 million tons of smog-causing nitrogen  
oxide annually and half of the soot that comes from mobile sources. 
Diesel fuel contains almost twice as much sulfur as even today's 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	A single heavy-duty diesel truck can emit as much pollution as  
150 cars, said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of Clean Air 
Trust, another environmental group. In many urban areas big trucks 
are the single biggest source of microscopic soot, and a major 
contributor to smog. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, regulation of large trucks is now at about the same stage  
as regulation of cars in the mid-1970s, said Rich Kassel of the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The petroleum industry has pledged to fight an EPA proposal to  
cut sulfur in gasoline to 30 parts per million from 300 and 
expressed misgivings about sulfur reductions in diesel fuel. 
Trucking companies and independent drivers have complained about 
the added cost of low-sulfur fuel as well as new costs from tighter 
emission controls.

<HEADLINE> Gill To Attend W.Va Graduations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- About 400 high school graduates will  
have ``One More Last Chance'' to end the school year with Vince 
Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	Students from three high school graduating classes and their  
guests will join the country music star June 12 for a 
picture-taking reception just before he takes the stage at the 
Charleston Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Graduate With Vince Gill'' promotion was sponsored by a  
radio station, which promised a party to the high school class that 
sent in the most postcards with the message, ``I want to graduate 
with Vince Gill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The station received so many entries -- 124,000 -- that it decided  
to declare three winners instead of just one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew this could be a fun project for the kids, but it  
certainly exceeded anything I imagined,'' Gill said. ``I'm really 
looking forward to meeting all the students.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pentagon Official Settles Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Derek J. Vander Schaaf, a former deputy  
inspector general at the Pentagon, agreed Wednesday to pay $12,125 
to settle a conflict of interest claim filed by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Vander Schaaf retired in March 1996 and was hired as a private  
consultant in 1997 by Concurrent Technologies Associates, a 
Pentagon contractor. The $12,125 was the amount of fees he received 
as a consultant for the company, the Justice Department said in a 
news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal conflict of interest laws bar former government  
officials from being hired for two years after leaving office by 
firms doing business to influence their previous employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department had filed the civil claim in federal  
court in Alexandria, Va.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Talks Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, met by  
protesters carrying ``Carpetbagger Go Home'' signs, told factory 
workers Wednesday the nation has been successful ``because of 
people who have been willing to try new things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many people locked into old thinking ... We are  
all such prisoners of our past,'' the first lady told about 40 
hand-picked employees brought together at a Lockheed Martin plant 
just outside Binghamton to discuss economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton addressed the high technology work being done  
at the plant, her remarks perhaps shed some light on her own 
thoughts about possibly seeking the New York Senate seat of 
retiring Democratic Sen. Dainel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the plant, some clearly sought to dissuade her from  
making the race. 
</P>
<P>
	About three dozen demonstrators chanting ``Go home'' were  
waiting for Mrs. Clinton when she left the plant. One sign said 
``Queen Hillary go home.'' But there also were a scattering of 
signs supporting the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are pros and cons and that's just the fact of political  
life,'' Mrs. Clinton said when asked about the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Clinton's first visit to New York since announcing  
Friday that she would form an exploratory committee to continue 
preparations for the Senate race her advisers expect her to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	The race could pit Mrs. Clinton against Republican New York City  
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who formed an exploratory committee in 
April. Also eyeing the GOP nomination is Rep. Rick Lazio of Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also planned to help fellow Democrats raise funds  
during her trip to New York. Per-person ticket prices for a 
Binghamton fund-raiser for Rep. Maurice Hinchey ranged from $125 to 
$500. The larger amount guaranteed a personal visit with the first 
lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Mrs. Clinton's schedule was a $5,000-a-person dinner  
organized by financial writer Andrew Tobias at a private home in 
New York City. The event, aimed at gay and lesbian campaign 
contributors, was expected to raise at least $200,000 for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said taxpayers would  
pick up part of the trip's tab -- for the Lockheed Martin discussion 
on the economy -- while Hinchey's campaign committee and the DNC 
would pay the rest. She did not have a breakdown of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The taxpayer financing for portions of Mrs. Clinton's  
campaign-like trips has already led to criticism. Advisers have 
said funds raised by the exploratory committee may be used to cover 
such future expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some local Democrats were clearly excited by Mrs. Clinton's  
decision to visit the Binghamton area as part of her attempt to get 
a better handle on New York issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled. This is wonderful,'' said Barbara Paoletti,  
Broome County's Democratic Party chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans thought it was all hoopla for nothing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably the only one who still thinks she's not  
running,'' state Sen. Thomas Libous, a county GOP leader. He 
theorized that Mrs. Clinton was toying with the Senate race ``to 
take attention off the president and the war'' in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Former state Democratic Chairman John Burns, a one-time mayor of  
Binghamton, said he believes Mrs. Clinton is in the race and will 
run well in the region. In Broome County, Republicans have a slight 
enrollment edge over Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's got a big women's vote around here,'' Burns  
said. ``I find that the men, Republican men and some Democrats and 
independents, might be a little standoffish about her. But I think 
she'll more than make up with women what she'll lose to the men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Burns said the carpetbagger issue being raised by  
Giuliani and Lazio is something she has to overcome. The former 
state party leader said that on a visit earlier in the week to his 
wife's doctor, the talk quickly turned to the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `The only thing I don't like about her is what does  
she know about New York?' It was the first thing out of his 
mouth,'' Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue, but I think she can handle it,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> China Banks, Insurers Run Y2K Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese banks and insurers are to suspend all  
computer network operations in a series of tests to ensure they are 
ready for possible Year 2000 computer glitches, a state-run 
newspaper reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Bank of China and the China Insurance Regulatory  
Commission will conduct three nationwide tests on June 19-20, July 
17-18 and Sept. 18-19, the China Daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests will suspend computer networks at all banks,  
cooperatives, postal savings and domestic insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts fear that the problem, known as Y2K, will cause  
computers which use only the last two digits to mark the year 2000 
and possibly mistake it for 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	China's banking sector is bracing for possible miscalculated  
interest on deposits and canceled savings records, the paper quoted 
a People's Bank of China official as saying. It did not identify 
the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the government's top Y2K troubleshooter said  
a lack of money and experience was hampering China's readiness, 
confirming foreign analysts' warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``No need to worry about your money. We have more than one copy  
of the savings deposits to safeguard customers' money,'' an 
official with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, who was 
not identified, told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance sector could also suffer huge claims for  
Y2K-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests, all during weekends, are not expected to cause much  
inconvenience to customers, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Gucci Posts 49 Percent Profit Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Buoyed by a surge in sales, luxury  
goods maker Gucci Group on Wednesday posted a first-quarter net 
profit of $60.2 million, up nearly 50 percent from $40.5 million in 
the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Executive Domineco De Sole said he expected the group to  
have net earnings of approximately $3.40 a share in 1999. Gucci 
said its net sales increased 7.7 percent to $270 million, while 
operating profit improved 4.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the first quarter we posted strong sales and further  
consolidated Gucci's position as one of the leading luxury brands 
in the world,'' De Sole said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``In March we entered into a strategic alliance with  
PPR (Pinault-Printemps-Redoute of France), which ... will enable us 
to transform Gucci into the world's leading multi-brand luxury 
goods company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci fought to avoid a takeover by France's Louis Vuitton Moet  
Hennessy. Last month, a Dutch court upheld a decision by Gucci 
management to allow PPR to take a 42 percent, $2.9 billion interest 
in Gucci by issuing new shares and selling them to PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH, which had owned 34 percent of Gucci shares, was reduced to  
a 20 percent interest. LVMH said Wednesday it has filed two 
lawsuits with the Dutch Supreme Court and the Amsterdam District 
Court against Gucci and PPR, demanding the cancellation of Gucci's 
March 19 share issue to PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the earnings pushed Gucci shares up nearly 6 percent in  
early trading Wednesday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci said it intends to open a large new ``flagship store'' in  
Tokyo in September and said it also will expand the number of its 
fine jewelry stores to 400 from 350 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Gucci said, the renovation of its main store began  
in May. The group said it's pleased with increased sales there but 
that additional costs for rent and depreciation of a temporary 
store will add about $7.5 million to operating expenses through the 
last three quarters of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Dies of Self-Inflicted Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- A gunman who held police at bay for  
3 1/2 hours before killing himself early today had been sought on an 
arrest warrant in a meatpacking plant shooting death of his former 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosendo Hernandez, 24, fired several shots at police around 9  
p.m. Tuesday, after police responded to reports of a wounded woman 
lying outside Hernandez' hotel room, Police Lt. Monty Montagne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations appeared to be going well, and Hernandez indicated  
he wanted to turn himself in when he shot himself at about 12:25 
a.m. CDT. 
</P>
<P>
	He died sometime before 1 a.m. at Mercy Hospital in Council  
Bluffs, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez asked to speak to his mother late in the standoff,  
Police Capt. Keith Mehlin said. Mehlin said police were negotiation 
to comply with that request when Hernandez shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	At around 8:30 p.m., someone saw a woman who had been injured  
lying on the ground in the Chalet Motor Lodge parking lot, 
according to Officer Danny Paulson. 
</P>
<P>
	When the person tried to help the woman, a man in a nearby hotel  
room shot at the person, Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was flown to University Hospital in Omaha. A hospital  
spokeswoman said the 40-year-old woman, who had been shot in the 
leg, was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two police officers also suffered minor injuries in the  
standoff. One officer was grazed in a shoulder by a bullet and the 
other was injured by flying glass, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Lewis of Council Bluffs said at the news conference that  
he watched as the woman was gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came walking down the stairs. I could see smoke, but I  
didn't think it was a gunshot,'' said Lewis, fighting tears. ``A 
lady came walking down the sidewalk, and then that guy just shot 
her. I still can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called the police on a cell phone, and then a policeman  
came, and (the suspect) shot him, too,'' Lewis said. ``I've never 
seen anybody get shot before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Zaloudek of Council Bluffs was driving by the hotel around 9  
p.m. when he saw four police cars drive into the hotel parking lot, 
he said. The suspect began firing at them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must have fired 20 or 30 shots in 30 minutes,'' Zaloudek  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were still being fired as late as 11:35 p.m. before the  
suspect later shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, neighboring Omaha police responded to the  
shooting death of Ana Hernandez-Martinez, 22, who was shot several 
times in a Nebraska Beef meatpacking plant where she worked. Police 
issued an arrest warrant for Hernandez, who had dated 
Hernandez-Martinez, in connection with that shooting.

<HEADLINE> Mob Lawyer Elected Vegas Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A lawyer who became famous by winning verdicts  
for the likes of Meyer Lansky and Tony ``The Ant'' Spilotro won one 
for himself when he was elected the next mayor of Sin City. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar Goodman, a flamboyant criminal defense attorney and  
self-described mob mouthpiece, came out of nowhere with a campaign 
that culminated in a landslide win Tuesday over a veteran city 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
	He likened his populist, come-from-behind campaign to that of  
Gov. Jesse Ventura, and shared the Minnesotan's healthy ego and 
loud intellect. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the body,'' the 59-year-old Goodman said, referring to  
the Minnesota governor. ``I'm the brain,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voters didn't seem to mind Goodman's past defense of notorious  
mobsters, convincingly rejecting Councilman Arnie Adamsen's claims 
that electing him would further tarnish the image of the gambling 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the whole political science book could be rewritten by  
this,'' Goodman said as he celebrated his win at an outdoor party 
with several hundred supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, who came within 277 votes of winning the job outright  
in a nine-candidate primary May 4, ended up with 32,765 votes, or 
63.8 percent, to Adamsen's 18,620 votes, or 36.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never went into anything I didn't expect to win,'' Goodman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He won without backing down on his efforts for mobsters like  
Spilotro, who once reputedly put a rival's head in a vise and 
squeezed his eyeballs out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my past,'' he said. ``I don't apologize for one day in  
my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman entered the race seemingly on a lark with $160,000 of  
his own money and not much more than a relentless drive to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended it with money pouring in from casino owners who jumped  
on his bandwagon after the strong primary showing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm colorful. That's what got me in the limelight,'' said  
Goodman, who played himself in Martin Scorsese's movie ``Casino.'' 
``But I honestly believe I'm going to be the best mayor Las Vegas 
ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adamsen, the favorite going into the race, tried to make his  
opponent's past a campaign issue. But voters seemed more interested 
in Goodman's personality and his populist promises. In a newspaper 
poll last week, 69 percent of participants said Goodman's image as 
a mob lawyer would not hurt the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman promised to immediately tackle the growth and  
infrastructure issues that fueled his campaign, and said he would 
meet with the city's council members on Wednesday, though he 
doesn't take office until June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make things happen overnight,'' Goodman said.  
``Unlike other people, I'm impatient. I'm ready to get going.''

<HEADLINE> Angels' DiSarcina Sent for Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina,  
who broke a bone in his left forearm in spring training and hasn't 
played this season, was cleared Wednesday to begin a rehabilitation 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina will report to Single-A Lake Elsinore for four days  
beginning Thursday, then will report to Double-A Erie. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthopedic hand and wrist specialist Norman Zemel examined  
DiSarcina and cleared him to begin playing again. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina, an outstanding fielder who hit .287 with three homers  
and 56 RBIs in 157 games last season, was struck by a fungo bat 
during batting practice on Feb. 21. The original prognosis was he 
would be able to return in four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a later CT scan showed the ulna bone had not completely  
healed and DiSarcina, 31, had a plate inserted into the bone so it 
would heal properly.

<HEADLINE> Bush Sets Sights on New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush didn't beat  
Elizabeth Dole to New Hampshire, but he did beat her in signing a 
pledge to protect the state's status as home of the first 
presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sent a letter Tuesday to the secretary of state saying he  
would not campaign or file as a candidate in states that hold their 
primaries earlier than seven days after New Hampshire's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Elizabeth Dole said she would sign the New Hampshire  
primary pledge today, when she speaks at a real estate dinner in 
Portsmouth. ``New Hampshire first by seven days,'' she said in a 
statement Tuesday, referring to a state law requiring the primary 
to be held at least a week before any other. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who makes his first campaign trip to New Hampshire next  
Monday, said he knows he's late getting to the state, but he's 
ready to convince New Hampshire voters he knows how to lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I have a lot of work do to and I'm looking forward to  
doing it,'' he said in a telephone conference call with New 
Hampshire reporters. ``I'll honor the pledge and I intend to put 
together a great grass-roots organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said he had sent a letter accepting the Americans for  
Tax Reform pledge to veto any federal income tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor said he plans to spend his time in New  
Hampshire talking about tax cuts, free trade, education and 
strengthening the military. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered few specifics, saying voters should be patient. ``I  
think it's important for those who are watching the campaign to 
understand I will have a timetable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledged the pressure to impress during his first trip  
to New Hampshire. He leads in the polls even though he hasn't yet 
started campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first problem I have is expectations are out of sight for  
me,'' he said. ``It means I'll have to go up there and shake as 
many hands as I can. My first hurdle is to tell people what's in my 
heart.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges Filed Over Schiavo's Bag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- No federal charges will be filed against  
former inspector general Mary Schiavo, whose unaccompanied bag at 
the Columbus airport disrupted operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bag, which was being used by Ms. Schiavo and a television  
station for a story on airport security, was found in a passenger 
area of Port Columbus International Airport on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officials took it to a runway, which they closed for  
about four hours while investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Sharon Zealey said Wednesday that prosecutors  
could not prove that Ms. Schiavo acted with criminal intent to 
damage the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	A message seeking comment from Ms. Schiavo, former inspector  
general of the U.S. Transportation Department, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  
criticizing the Federal Aviation Administration on several 
occasions. She has since published a book accusing the FAA of 
sloppy inspections, lax airport security and disregard for bogus 
airplane parts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Columbus case, she has said she attempted to put an  
unaccompanied suitcase packed with harmless items on a plane the 
day the runway shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo has said she was hoping to determine whether the bag  
would be allowed to leave with the flight even though its owner was 
not on board. Bags are matched to passengers on international 
flights, but checks are not required for domestic passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the bag was clearly marked with her name and address,  
and claimed that airport officials called the bomb squad to make a 
scene that would discredit her. 
</P>
<P>
	WCMH-TV reported that it had told airport officials it was doing  
a story on airport security. Station president and general manager 
Michael Jack said Wednesday that its news department was vindicated 
by the federal prosecutor's decision.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Euro, Up Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the euro and other  
major European currencies Wednesday in anticipation of further data 
indicating strengthening economies in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged higher against the yen as traders locked in  
gains from the Japanese currency's rise a day earlier amid talk 
that Japan's economy is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0465, up  
from $1.0458 late Tuesday. The dollar also was quoted at 118.93 
Japanese yen, up from 118.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, buoyed by positive economic data from Germany on  
Tuesday, were encouraged by an apparent truce in Yugoslavia , which 
NATO has been bombing since the end of March. An announcement 
detailing the agreement came long after European markets closed, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has certainly been more optimism in general in the  
European equity markets over the last 24 hours, which has coincided 
with the euro's firmer tone,'' said David Coleman, chief economist 
at CIBC World Markets in London. He noted a report Tuesday showing 
a rise in Germany's first quarter gross domestic product along with 
other positive German economic reports this week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, German productivity reports are expected to show  
gains while unemployment figures were expected to show a marginal 
increase. Germany is the world's third largest economy and the 
largest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have already seen the worst of the economic  
downturn in Europe and are now looking at a general recovery, 
building on Germany's rise in first-quarter GDP data,'' Coleman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's retreat also came as U.S. stocks fell for a second  
straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yen gained during Asian trading on the continued  
belief that data being released Thursday would show improvement in 
first quarter gross domestic product and that the lackluster 
economy was in recovery. But the yen pulled back against the dollar 
later as investors took profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5222 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.5224, and 1.4730 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.4753. The British pound fell to $1.6026 from $1.6049. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 
1.8688 German marks, down from 1.8702; 6.2696 French francs, down 
from 6.2735; and 1,851.85 Italian lire, unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Are Really Hot Ticket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Spurs are in the NBA Finals for the first  
time, and suddenly long lost friends are surfacing everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	What do they want?  
</P>
<P>
	Tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to popular belief, we aren't ticket machines,''  
forward Sean Elliott said. ``For all the people out there that are 
going to call up other players for tickets: We don't have them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, who advanced to the championship round by defeating  
Portland 4-0 in the Western Conference finals, will have been off 
10 days by the time the NBA Finals begin June 16. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio awaits the outcome of the Eastern Conference finals  
between Indiana and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days off, the Spurs resumed practicing Wednesday. And  
there was lots of rough contact. 
</P>
<P>
	The players admit it's easy to get distracted with all the  
hoopla around town, and the requests from old friends and casual 
acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The finals tickets, you get a lot of people call,'' point  
guard Avery Johnson said. ``But that's a good problem to have. I'm 
not dealing with it. I've got my assistant and my wife, they deal 
with it. The main thing is to stay focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Duncan, who grew up in the Virgin Islands, said fans in his  
hometown of St. Croix are yearning to get in on the NBA Finals 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strangest request? A bunch of people from the Virgin Islands  
want to come down,'' he said. ``Like a hundred and fifty of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott started hearing from old friends before the Portland  
series was finished. The phone began ringing after he sank a 
3-point shot with nine seconds left in Game 2 to give the Spurs a 
1-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Antonio, some call Elliott's winning basket the  
``Memorial Day Miracle.'' He simply refers to it as ``the shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I got to my car there were calls from people I  
haven't heard from in two years,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each Spurs player receives three tickets from the team. He can  
then can buy up to six more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have guys calling, 'Can I get four? Can I get five? I need  
three, the best seats,''' Elliott said. ``I go, 'Hey, wait a 
minute, just because I play doesn't mean I can just go get 20 
seats.' It's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Elliott would certainly rather be a ticket broker now than a  
television spectator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember this time last year sitting at home watching  
somebody else do it,'' he said. ``And being pretty envious.''

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Helicopter Crash in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A sightseeing helicopter crashed into a  
glacier Wednesday, killing all seven people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter went down with six tourists and a pilot near  
Herbert Glacier, 20 miles north of the popular tourist destination 
of Juneau. The cause had yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears as though they flew into the glacier,'' said Greg  
Wilkinson, a spokesman for Alaska State Troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather was cloudy in Juneau, and fog was also present.  
Worsening weather in the afternoon forced the troopers to suspend 
efforts to recover the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists frequently hire helicopters to view the area's  
spectacular glaciers, forests and fjords, and two cruise ships were 
docked in Juneau on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the victims were cruise ship passengers from the Sea  
Princess, a cruise ship docked in Juneau for the day, said Dean 
Brown, president of Princess Tours. Neither their names nor the 
names of the other five people aboard were released. 
</P>
<P>
	Joette Storm, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation  
Administration in Anchorage, said the helicopter was an 
Aerospatiale AS-350BA. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you could see was wreckage,'' said Pauline Acherman of  
Santa Monica, Calif., who flew over the crash site on a separate 
helicopter tour. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate accident Wednesday, two people were taken to a  
hospital after an Era Aviation helicopter crashed on Admiralty 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist-related aviation accidents are not uncommon in Alaska  
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a helicopter on a sightseeing trip over Juneau  
collided in midair with a small plane. One person on board the 
plane was killed and the helicopter was damaged, but the helicopter 
passengers escaped serious injury.

<HEADLINE> `Year 2000 Investor Kit' Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, the Securities and Exchange Commission and industry 
groups are issuing information to the public on the financial 
industry's readiness for the millennium date change. 
</P>
<P>
	The information package, called the ``Year 2000 Investor Kit,''  
also includes tips to help investors prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are advised to:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Keep good financial records.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Stay informed about what actions your financial service  
companies are taking to become ready for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Get the Year 2000 publications provided by your brokerage  
firms, mutual funds, investment advisers and corporations in which 
you hold stock. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Continue to invest for the long term.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Not worry about obtaining stock certificates.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Check the Year 2000 readiness of your personal computers.  
</P>
<P>
	The moves stem from concerns that disruptions that may occur if  
computers misread the 2000 date as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a review of the financial industry's efforts to  
prepare, the kit also includes a list of questions frequently asked 
by investors, a Year 2000 checklist, and information on how to 
check personal computers and fax machines for potential changeover 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit was developed by the SEC, the National Association of  
Securities Dealers and the Securities Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It is available on the NASD's Web site at www.nasd.com. Printed  
copies will be available in early July by calling 1-888-227-1330 or 
by sending an e-mail message to y2k(at)nasd.com. Securities firms 
also will distribute them to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, investors can check on the Y2K readiness of

<HEADLINE> Hogan Exhibit Opens in USGA Museum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAR HILLS, N.J. (AP) -- It wasn't the trophies, the medals, the  
trademark white hat or any of the other memorabilia in the room 
dedicated to Ben Hogan that caused his wife to pause and cry 
briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	The items were a magnificent tribute to one of golf's greatest  
players, a man whose success was not only measured on the course, 
but also in his courageous battle to return there after a 
near-fatal car crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The sad part for Valerie Hogan was her beloved Ben wasn't there  
to share the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben would have loved this,'' she said Tuesday as the USGA  
Museum opened the Ben Hogan Room, the first it has dedicated to the 
life and career of a professional golfer. Hogan died two years ago 
at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Hogan talked about his golf, his 63 career victories and  
nine majors, she talked about his love of practicing, his 
personality, his battle to come back from the 1949 accident, and 
most of all, her love for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would give anything if he could be here, even if I were not  
here,'' Valerie Hogan said, and there was no doubt she meant it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-case permanent exhibit includes more than 300 objects,  
with the majority coming from Valerie Hogan. It details Ben Hogan's 
early years -- did you know his real first name was William? -- 
follows the highlights of his golf career, his accident and 
recovery and later his work as a clubmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you no one, no one loved golf more than Ben  
Hogan,'' Valerie Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, playing in tournaments wasn't what Ben Hogan enjoyed  
most. It was practicing on the range. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he felt the actual playing of golf was for something  
else,'' she said. ``Where he really enjoyed it was on the practice 
tee and then hoping he would play the way he would like to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most feared golfers of his time, Hogan was known as a  
loner by many competitors. He spent endless hours on the practice 
range and was known to be a man of few words during a round. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the course, Valerie Hogan said her husband of six decades  
was a man of many interests who tried to do his best at everything. 
He also didn't speak much off the course, for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could discuss almost any subject with you because he was  
the best listener,'' she said. ``As he said: `People who talk all 
the time don't learn anything because you have to listen, that's 
how you learn,' and believe you me, he listened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't true all the time, especially during his recovery  
from the head-on collision with a bus in 1949 that shattered his 
legs. After that, he always played in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first month after the accident, Hogan barely survived  
blood clots in his left leg. It took him almost a year to start 
swinging a club again, said his wife, who admits she was never sure 
whether he would play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``After he got home, he surprised me one day,'' she said. ``He  
so wanted to walk sometimes, he would slip out of the house. ... He 
would be out trying to walk and sometimes I'd have to go in the car 
and find him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within 16 months, he would win the U.S. Open in a playoff with  
Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio, much to the surprise of his wife. 
He qualified for the playoff by playing a 36-hole final day at 
Merion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say that the night he came in, I didn't feel he  
would have the strength the next morning because his eyes were in 
the back (of his head) and he was so very, very tired. I felt that 
he was not going to be able to play the next day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hogan slept like a baby and woke up refreshed the next  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even then I doubted he would have the strength,'' she said.  
``I was probably the most surprised person he won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan would go on to win two more U.S. Opens -- only Jack  
Nicklaus, Bobby Jones and Willie Anderson have won as many -- and 
the 1953 British Open at Carnoustie. He won the Masters and U.S. 
Open that same year, when he won five of the six tournaments in 
which he competed. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie and friends had to persuade Hogan to play in the British  
Open, the only time he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept saying, `I just think you want me to go just to see me  
get beat over there,''' his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Hogan's funniest comment was about the movie ``Follow  
The Sun,'' which portrayed her husband's life and starred Glenn 
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glenn Ford, he worked so hard, but he did not know how to play  
golf, but he told them he did,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who knew very little about golf when she married,  
Valerie Hogan has grown to love the game. She still watches it all 
the time. Justin Leonard is her favorite player. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if anyone reminds her of her husband, she bluntly says,  
``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair to compare,'' she said. ``I think he  
was the greatest, especially when he came back. I know what he went 
through and all that he did.''

<HEADLINE>  Big Lift for Giants: Bonds Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds returned from a seven-week  
absence with a wave of his hand and a tip of his cap to the roaring 
crowd. It got a lot quieter after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing an intense rehabilitation and returning three weeks  
sooner than expected from a serious arm injury, Bonds was activated 
from the disabled list Wednesday but was hitless in four at bats in 
the San Francisco Giants' 2-1 loss to the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting to be out there. The welcome was phenomenal,''  
said Bonds. ``It meant a lot to me to be able to open back up at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds immediately showed his trademark defensive flair with a  
nice running catch in foul ground in the first inning. Then, he 
zinged the ball to second and his surgically repaired arm passed 
its first test. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I got that out of the way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Swinging the bat was another matter. Greeted by a rousing  
ovation in his first at bat, Bonds grounded out to the pitcher. He 
hit another comebacker and then flied out to left in his third 
at-bat against winning pitcher Tim Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ninth, with Bonds leading off, the drama and tension  
quickly faded when Bonds popped out against Troy Percival, and his 
first day back was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he learned from his first day back, Bonds quipped,  
``I still can't hit Belcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds is a lifetime .142 hitter against Belcher.  
</P>
<P>
	``Knock on wood, I've had pretty good luck against him in my  
career,'' Belcher said. ``He's one of the best players in the game 
and he's such a force, such a presence in the lineup, whether 
you've had success against him or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I made a mistake in his third at bat, threw a ball a  
little more over the plate than I wanted to and I think he jammed 
himself on it,'' Belcher added. ``But that's certainly indicative 
of being on the DL as long as he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds last played April 17 and underwent surgery April 20 to  
remove a bone spur and repair a triceps tendon in his left arm. He 
missed 47 games during which the Giants went 25-22. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-star outfielder for the Giants said he still has to get  
his timing back and once again get in sync with his teammates in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to be back out there and I hope it doesn't take  
me too long to help this club,'' Bonds said. ``At times, I felt 
like a third wheel out there. Sometimes you don't want to come in 
and mess it up. Right now, it's just a feeling out process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco manager Dusty Baker said Bonds' return is a big  
lift for the club, especially with the loss of right fielder Ellis 
Burks, who took Bonds place on the disabled list due to swelling in 
the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play 160 games a year and then miss 47 of them, you  
are eager to get back,'' Baker said. ``We expect him to do the same 
thing he has always done, be a tremendous player. We have 102 more 
games with him back and it is hard to think of another 102 without 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants first baseman J.T. Snow said he's not surprised Bonds  
returned earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry's a great player for a reason,'' Giants first baseman  
J.T. Snow said. ``A lot of that is God-given talent. The other part 
of that is work ethic and desire. And Barry works hard. He's been 
in here every day working on that elbow. You keep yourself in good 
shape, you bounce back a little faster back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Bonds' first stay on the disabled list as a Giant and  
just the second of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian Sabean said Bonds was determined to get  
back as quickly as possible, but the team and Bonds himself wanted 
to make sure he was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more relief than anxiety,'' Sabean said. ``He wouldn't  
put himself in a danger zone, nor would our medical people even 
think about putting him out there if wasn't able to do what he 
needed to do as an everyday baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds had been off to one of the best starts before the injury.  
In the first 12 games of the season, he batted .366 with six 
doubles, four home runs, 12 RBIs, 11 walks and a then NL-leading 
.805 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Burks was hitting .250 with seven home runs and 27 RBIs in 51  
games but had been plagued by sore knees. He had surgery on both 
knees during the winter and missed much of spring training. Burks 
had said he has been bothered by lingering soreness this season.

<HEADLINE> Caldera's Claims Won't Be Separated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A federal judge has tentatively decided to  
reject Microsoft's motions to dismiss Caldera's claims piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orem software company has accused Microsoft of violating  
antitrust laws by attempting to quash competition for its computer 
operating system, MS-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft divided the strategies alleged in Caldera's lawsuit  
into nine claims, and asked U.S. District Judge Dee Benson to rule 
on the validity of each claim separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera lawyers argued against that plan Tuesday, saying Benson  
-- and a jury -- should consider how all of Microsoft's tactics 
worked together to thwart competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson said Tuesday that he will continue to hear arguments on  
each of the claims outlined by Microsoft because ``they have been 
beneficial in educating me'' about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Benson said Microsoft's ``divide and conquer'' method  
of chopping Caldera's case into pieces ``may be arguably improper'' 
under court rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson said he is considering initially denying all of  
Microsoft's requests, then ruling later on which of Caldera's 
allegations will be admitted into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson has heard arguments on three of the claims -- that  
Microsoft used illegal licensing agreements with computer 
manufacturers, deliberately announced overly optimistic release 
dates for its products to dissuade consumers from buying other 
brands of software and disparaged the competing operating system 
DR-DOS, which is now owned by Caldera. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he has drafted an order on those claims: ``The  
way it's now written, it's denying all (three) motions for summary 
judgment,'' or requests to dismiss the claims before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	An operating system allows a computer to execute basic  
functions, such as opening a file. Microsoft offered operating 
system MS-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital Research produced DR-DOS, which embellished on MS-DOS.  
Digital sold it to Novell, which in turn sold it to Caldera in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer James Jardine said he still hopes to persuade  
Benson to dismiss some of the allegations immediately -- such as the 
claim Microsoft illegally tied MS-DOS to Windows. A federal appeals 
court already has rejected that argument, Jardine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera argues some of Microsoft's aggressive but legitimate  
business tactics should be considered at trial because they reveal 
the intent to destroy competition.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad:

</P>
<P>
	The Herald-Dispatch of Huntington, W.Va., on religion in school:  
</P>
<P>
	For every difficult problem, there's a solution that's quick,  
easy -- and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Sickened by the recent bloodshed in our schools, many Americans  
are urging that schools again should have formal prayers and post 
the Ten Commandments in their classrooms or hallways. Those doing 
so are sincere, well-intentioned -- and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1960s  
strengthened the ``separation of church and state'' interpretation 
of the U.S. Constitution. Many Americans decried the decisions at 
the time and now point to them as at least one of the reasons for 
the current violence and turmoil in our schools. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem with religion in the schools, as the Supreme  
Court rightly recognized, is that religion comes in all types and 
forms. Inevitably, if there's a prayer in school, that prayer will 
reflect the religious beliefs of the person offering it -- beliefs 
that may in fact run sharply counter to those held by the families 
of some of the students.

	The Palm Beach (Fla.) Post, on Russian troops in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Adding Russian troops to the mix of Kosovo peacekeepers makes  
the latest peace plan more acceptable to Slobodan Milosevic. Aside 
from that point ... giving the Russians a role makes the peace plan 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to protect ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, NATO is  
pledging to protect refugees returning home. The refugees won't go 
back unless they feel safe, however, and because Russia has been so 
supportive of Milosevic, the sight of armed Russians will not make 
refugees forget the threat of armed Serbs. ... 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has committed 7,000 American troops to a NATO  
peacekeeping force of nearly 50,000, to be deployed if Serbs 
withdraw from Kosovo. ... 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how long NATO forces would have to stay in Kosovo.  
NATO has no way of making Milosevic pay for the ethnic Albanians 
his troops killed. NATO can't even stop Milosevic from claiming 
victory ... 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, NATO also can't make peace quickly without giving  
Russia a role. 
</P>

<P>
	Journal Star of Peoria, Ill.:  
</P>
<P>
	Wouldn't it be great if every dad and mom could afford 12 weeks  
off work to get to know their newborn? There's a lot of curb appeal 
in President Clinton's proposal to let states dig into their 
unemployment insurance funds to pay brand-new parents to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, it's a bad idea, for several reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	Most obviously, it would unduly burden a fund that exists to  
tide people over when they lose their jobs and cannot quickly find 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	That may not seem important now, with unemployment here hovering  
at 4 percent and insurance fund coffers healthy. But only half a 
generation ago nearly one out of five central Illinoisans was out 
of work, and unemployment insurance kept many of them off relief. 
...
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, requiring most employers  
to give workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to accommodate childbirth 
and other family health problems, was a sound piece of legislation. 
More power to those employees who save extra money so they can 
afford to take unpaid leave when a child is born, and kudos to 
those employers whose commitments to family well-being take them 
beyond the requirements of the federal law.

	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on curbing gambling ills:  
</P>
<P>
	If previous bipartisan, congressionally mandated studies on  
Medicare and Social Security serve as any indication, 
recommendations being made this month by a group that spent two 
years studying the social and economic effects of gambling are 
unlikely to lead to any meaningful national policy or law. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise did, however, provide a comprehensive overview of  
gambling in this country, which in just over two decades has 
mushroomed to a $638.6 billion industry that has spread to all but 
three states, employs 1 million people and includes lotteries, 
racetrack betting, riverboat gambling and Indian-run casinos. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Conceivably, the compiled results could be used by Congress to  
address public health needs created by gambling; at the least, they 
serve to offset the industry's self-promoted image as a means to 
get rich quick and have fun at the same time.

	The Tampa (Fla.) Tribune, on the spelling bee champion:  
</P>
<P>
	Being deemed the champion speller of all middle school students  
in a county as large as Hillsborough would be an honor for any 
young person. But 14-year-old Nupur Lala of Tampa's Louis Benito 
Middle School went for the ultimate honor and ... won the National 
Spelling Bee. And she did it without a spellcheck, a human or 
mechanical prompter or any other aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning word was ``logorrhea,'' which means incoherent  
talkativeness. Few adults, much less many eighth-graders, know both 
the definition and the sequence of letters within the word. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Some people have the odd idea that the ability to spell words  
correctly is essentially a gift; there are those who are naturally 
good at it and there are those who aren't. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, the triumph belongs to Nupur herself, because it  
was she who remained focused while spelling some of the most arcane 
words in the English language. Nupur, you are 
e-x-c-e-p-t-i-o-n-a-l.

	The (Charleston) Post and Courier, on the federal tax code:  
</P>
<P>
	The federal income tax code, an ever-expanding universe of laws  
regulating the primary source of revenue for the U.S. government, 
should be consistent and clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it is erratic and virtually indecipherable. ...  
</P>
<P>
	The tax code's purpose has become warped. Washington has fallen  
into the counterproductive habit of altering the code, not to 
maximize the effectiveness of revenue collection, but to maximize 
the system's function as an agent of social incentives and 
disincentives. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But forget for the moment the pros and cons of tax cuts. Focus  
on the cumulative confusion of endless tax-code permutations. 
Resist the urge to reward politicians -- of any party -- who stretch 
tax laws beyond their logical limits. Encourage them to simplify 
the federal tax code.

	The Advocate of Baton Rouge, La., on Mike Tyson:  
</P>
<P>
	Mike Tyson has committed rape, chewed off part of an opponent's  
ear in the ring and assaulted two men, thus violating terms of his 
probation in the rape case. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind. No problem.  
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Parole Commission, a judge in Indiana and Nevada  
boxing officials all have done their part to clear the way for 
Tyson's return to televised, big-money boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just great -- exactly what's needed to get Tyson's  
attention and encourage him to behave in a civilized manner. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's expected return to the ring is more bad news for a sport  
that already has plenty, including questions surrounding the 
controversial draw decision in the title bout between Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We believe, though, that age and boxing fans soon will impose  
upon Tyson restrictions that sports officials are unwilling to 
apply. ...

	Star Tribune of Minneapolis, on Sen. Paul Wellstone:  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., is nothing if not persistent. For  
years now, he's been chipping away at society's reluctance to 
invest in mental-health treatment. He's the author of the 1996 law 
meant to assure that health insurers treat diseases of the brain 
just as readily as those of the body. 
</P>
<P>
	But insurers have found ways to skirt the spirit of that law,  
and Wellstone is set on making them behave. His latest proposal 
could do the trick -- if only the right people will support it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone's new plan, cosponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,  
would eliminate limits on hospital stays and outpatient visits for 
mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	And it would stop the practice of charging higher co-payments  
for mental-health visits. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to be against treating people with brain disease as  
decently as those with cancer. ...

	The Times of London, on the NATO bombing:  
</P>
<P>
	The West has finally extracted Russian agreement on the text of  
a U.N. Security Council resolution, but at the price of two 
concessions. The first, an agreement to suspend NATO bombing before 
it is put to a vote, may not be as ominous as it seems. The second, 
President Bill Clinton's admission that Russian troops in Kosovo 
may not now come under NATO control, is irresponsible; only the 
probably tardy deployment of Russian forces can stop it being 
disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
	There can in any case be no question of a bombing pause until  
Yugoslav generals have signed up to the Jackson schedule and are 
proved to be carrying it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this ``military-technical'' impasse ends, NATO must  
intensify air attacks on Yugoslav troops. But it must also mass 
ground forces and prepare to use them if, as is possible, the 
Yugoslav commanders in Kosovo, all Milosevic loyalists, either fail 
to sign the withdrawal plan, or to honour it even if they do sign.

<P>
	The Mainichi Daily News of Tokyo, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	After 72 days of bombing by NATO, Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic last week accepted a deal to end the Kosovo conflict put 
forth by the United States, European countries and Russia, but 
hopes of an imminent cease-fire crumbled on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though we tip our hats to Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy to  
the Balkans, and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who brought 
Milosevic to the peace talks last week, we must now call on 
Yugoslavia to return to the discussion table for a political 
solution. ... 
</P>
<P>
	A peace treaty must be drawn up and a U.N. Security Council  
resolution must be adopted immediately. We hope that China will 
actively support the peace overtures, even though its relations 
with the United States have chilled due to NATO's accidental 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and U.S. 
allegations that China stole its nuclear secrets.

<P>
	Frankfurter Neue Presse daily in Frankfurt, on Yugoslovia:  
</P>
<P>
	The euphoria over peace in Kosovo that appeared to be at hand  
has vanished for now. Contrary to the agreement of Milosevic to 
completely withdraw his troops from Kosovo, he now wants to leave 
about 15,000 men there. However, no refugees will return under the 
care of the Serb thugs. In that respect the new Serb demands are 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the same old game of Milosevic, first make promises, only  
to qualify them with new demands. Spread fog to deceive. ... 
</P>
<P>
	It was less the desire for peace or clever negotiating that  
brought Milosevic to basically agree to NATO's Kosovo solution. It 
was far more the determination, primarily the Americans and the 
British, to militarily stop the ethnic cleansing of the barbarians 
and to return the 850,000 refugees to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic will still attempt much more finesse. Whoever wants to  
wring a lasting peace out of him needs nerves, intelligence and an 
iron will -- to use force.

	Neue Luzerner Zeitung, of Switzerland, on Tour of Italy cycling  
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	After last year's doping scandal in the Tour de France such a  
quagmire was revealed in cycling that no one could have imagined 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	It could not have been expected that the practices of a lifetime  
could be changed in a week. But the brazenness with which cheating 
still continues in this sport is appalling. 
</P>
<P>
	It is hard to judge whether, in the latest affair in the Tour of  
Italy, Marco Pantani is culprit or victim ... 
</P>
<P>
	Since even renowned sporting doctors have questioned the 50  
percent hematocrit level, the International Cycling Federation 
(UCI) is under pressure again. The responsible people must go back 
to the books, and not only as far as this threshold is concerned. 
The UCI must go a step farther than simply defending the status quo 
of blood controls. 
</P>
<P>
	There are tests -- the one used by the Italian federation goes  
along such lines -- which give fairly reliable information on the 
use of EPO. The UCI has not explained so far why it has balked at 
simultaneous blood and urine tests.

</P>
<P>
	After nine years of economic expansion, the United States  
continues to be the economic motor of the world. But what will 
happen if Wall Street, the foundation of American economy 
throughout this extraordinary period of wealth, suddenly gives in? 
</P>
<P>
	According to economists at the International Monetary Fund, the  
growth of the American economy would stop, and the euro's value 
would strengthen with respect to the dollar. But with minimal 
growth and a less competitive exchange rate, the European economy 
would slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy of the 15 European countries represents a fifth of  
the world economy -- exactly that of the United States. And yet 
Europeans continue to think like they are still living in their 
own, small countries.

</P>
<P>
	Belgrade's acceptance of the 10-point peace plan brokered by EU  
and Russian envoys is a positive development that paves the way for 
a resolution to the months-old conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-point plan calls for the deployment of the force under  
the leadership of the United Nations with NATO forces playing a 
`fundamental role.' Yugoslavia's hope, therefore, that NATO's 
resolve will not endure seems to have been false. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most wars, there are many losers and a very few winners to  
this latest armed struggle in the Balkans. The obvious losers from 
the war are the hundreds of thousands of Kosovars who are subjected 
to untold suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Yugoslav leadership has agreed to the EU-Russian  
plan, we hope that the international community will soon put 
together a truce force that will see the repatriation of all Kosovo 
refugees.

	The Nation of Bangkok, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	There were few, if any, Kosovar refugees before the bombing. But  
never mind. NATO is after all cleaning up its own mess. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest loser in this war is clearly the United Nations, the  
body entrusted by the world to keep peace, and the sole authority 
in giving the green light to the use of military force. That the 
U.N. Charter was violated by 19 key democracies should serve as a 
warning to all. However one might want to see it, NATO has attacked 
a sovereign country in clear violation of international law and 
without the authorization of the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet NATO has no qualms about asserting that the war was fought  
on behalf of the `international community.' Its spin doctors in 
Brussels repeated that magical phrase time and again, and often 
with a straight face, even when China and India -- which make up 
about half of the global population -- have spoken out in no 
uncertain terms that they are opposed to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo war goes to prove, once again, that the rich and  
powerful will continue to call the shots on global -- and internal -- 
affairs of nations.

<HEADLINE> Plane's Tape Doesn't Mention Spoiler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Pilots going over a landing checklist  
on American Airlines Flight 1420 made no mention of setting the 
spoilers to help slow down the plane, according to an investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet crashed off the end of the runway last week during a  
violent thunderstorm, killing nine and injuring more than 80 of its 
145 passengers and crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News quoted sources today who said  
investigators listening to a tape of the flight's final minutes 
also have not been able to distinguish two distinct metallic thumps 
that would have been recorded if the spoiler lever was set and had 
activated on landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of background noise on the tape, so you can't  
say for sure that the spoilers were not armed,'' a source told the 
newspaper on condition of anonymity. ``But the noise of that lever 
is not there at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cockpit voice recorder, being analyzed in Washington, D.C.,  
raises more questions about whether the spoilers were set to 
activate on landing, as co-pilot Michael Origel believes they were. 
Investigators previously said the flight data recorder indicates 
the spoilers did not open when the plane touched down. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoilers are panels on the wings that pop up to decrease the  
plane's lift and help it brake after landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel told investigators last week he believed Capt. Richard  
Buschmann, who was killed in the crash, had set the spoiler lever 
before landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm really interested in is the communication between the  
two officers,'' Greg Feith, lead investigator with the National 
Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday. ``Was there a 
miscommunication? Did they not do something because someone did not 
understand?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB's George W. Black Jr. said it is possible Buschmann and  
Origel communicated non-verbally about the spoilers, by pointing or 
nodding, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane ran off the end of a wet runway at more than 90 mph,  
tore open and caught fire June 1. Investigators are examining 
whether mechanical problems, pilot error, severe weather or a 
combination of those factors contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Tuesday the recording indicates the pilots went over  
some items on the pre-landing checklist, but there was no mention 
of the spoilers. He would not say if any other elements of the 
checklist were not heard on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Feith said Origel claimed he had completed the checklist for  
landing. Investigators want Origel to listen to the cockpit 
recording with them to refresh his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of Fort Worth, Texas-based American, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said it is company policy to go through the 
items on the checklist out loud, as well as physically note each 
completed task. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found a checklist displaying data for takeoff, not  
landing, at the crash site. But Feith said the checklist could have 
been knocked out of place during the crash and rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel also told investigators last week he never lost sight of  
the runway as the airplane approached in a ``bowling alley'' gap in 
storm clouds. Black said that the cockpit voice recorder indicated 
otherwise and that Origel would be asked to explain the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Two survivors of the crash filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Chicago  
against American Airlines and Buschmann's estate. Serena and 
Johnnie Dexter claim the pilot and airline were negligent for 
attempting to land in a severe thunderstorm with high winds. They 
are seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Another lawsuit was filed 
in Little Rock last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The runway on which the plane crashed reopened at 10:35 a.m.  
Tuesday, although repairs were not complete to the lighting 
approach system.

<HEADLINE> Readers Eat Up Copies of ``Hannibal'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Readers were champing at the bit to get their  
hands on the latest tale of Dr. Hannibal ``The Cannibal'' Lecter. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers on Tuesday ate up copies of ``Hannibal,'' the new novel

<HEADLINE>  Big Lift for Giants: Bonds Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds returned from a seven-week  
absence with a wave of his hand and a tip of his cap to the roaring 
crowd. It got a lot quieter after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing an intense rehabilitation and returning three weeks  
sooner than expected from a serious arm injury, Bonds was activated 
from the disabled list Wednesday but was hitless in four at bats in 
the San Francisco Giants' 2-1 loss to the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting to be out there. The welcome was phenomenal,''  
said Bonds. ``It meant a lot to me to be able to open back up at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds immediately showed his trademark defensive flair with a  
nice running catch in foul ground in the first inning. Then, he 
zinged the ball to second and his surgically repaired arm passed 
its first test. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I got that out of the way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Swinging the bat was another matter. Greeted by a rousing  
ovation in his first at bat, Bonds grounded out to the pitcher. He 
hit another comebacker and then flied out to left in his third 
at-bat against winning pitcher Tim Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ninth, with Bonds leading off, the drama and tension  
quickly faded when Bonds popped out against Troy Percival, and his 
first day back was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he learned from his first day back, Bonds quipped,  
``I still can't hit Belcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds is a lifetime .142 hitter against Belcher.  
</P>
<P>
	``Knock on wood, I've had pretty good luck against him in my  
career,'' Belcher said. ``He's one of the best players in the game 
and he's such a force, such a presence in the lineup, whether 
you've had success against him or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I made a mistake in his third at bat, threw a ball a  
little more over the plate than I wanted to and I think he jammed 
himself on it,'' Belcher added. ``But that's certainly indicative 
of being on the DL as long as he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds last played April 17 and underwent surgery April 20 to  
remove a bone spur and repair a triceps tendon in his left arm. He 
missed 47 games during which the Giants went 25-22. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-star outfielder for the Giants said he still has to get  
his timing back and once again get in sync with his teammates in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy to be back out there and I hope it doesn't take  
me too long to help this club,'' Bonds said. ``At times, I felt 
like a third wheel out there. Sometimes you don't want to come in 
and mess it up. Right now, it's just a feeling out process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco manager Dusty Baker said Bonds' return is a big  
lift for the club, especially with the loss of right fielder Ellis 
Burks, who took Bonds place on the disabled list due to swelling in 
the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play 160 games a year and then miss 47 of them, you  
are eager to get back,'' Baker said. ``We expect him to do the same 
thing he has always done, be a tremendous player. We have 102 more 
games with him back and it is hard to think of another 102 without 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants first baseman J.T. Snow said he's not surprised Bonds  
returned earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry's a great player for a reason,'' Giants first baseman  
J.T. Snow said. ``A lot of that is God-given talent. The other part 
of that is work ethic and desire. And Barry works hard. He's been 
in here every day working on that elbow. You keep yourself in good 
shape, you bounce back a little faster back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Bonds' first stay on the disabled list as a Giant and  
just the second of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian Sabean said Bonds was determined to get  
back as quickly as possible, but the team and Bonds himself wanted 
to make sure he was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more relief than anxiety,'' Sabean said. ``He wouldn't  
put himself in a danger zone, nor would our medical people even 
think about putting him out there if wasn't able to do what he 
needed to do as an everyday baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds had been off to one of the best starts before the injury.  
In the first 12 games of the season, he batted .366 with six 
doubles, four home runs, 12 RBIs, 11 walks and a then NL-leading 
.805 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Burks was hitting .250 with seven home runs and 27 RBIs in 51  
games but had been plagued by sore knees. He had surgery on both 
knees during the winter and missed much of spring training. Burks 
had said he has been bothered by lingering soreness this season.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Join Judy Collins on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a string arrangement of the Hungarian  
Rondo and an accordion performance of the ``Beer Barrel Polka'' as 
her opening act, singer Judy Collins had a White House audience 
singing along by the time she wrapped up a state dinner honoring 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined  
Collins on stage Tuesday night and the trio led the 180 guests 
assembled in the East Room for an a cappella rendition of ``Amazing 
Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The grand finale topped off an evening celebrating folk music  
from both countries, as members of the Marine Band Strolling 
Strings weaved through the tables playing the rondo and other 
selections. Twelve-year-old accordion virtuoso, Cory Pesaturo, 
enjoyed the full attention of the president as he joined in on 
several pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first family's request, Collins performed ``Chelsea  
Morning,'' a song that inspired the name of the president's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	She also sang such favorites as ``Send in the Clowns'' and a  
song titled ``Walls,'' which came about after her husband, Louis 
Nelson, designed the Korean War Veterans Memorial Mural. 
</P>
<P>
	The song ``kind of says it is all about the transformational  
experience of when the war is over,'' Collins said Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The war in Kosovo -- and looking ahead to when it would be over --  
was a theme echoed also in the toasts given by the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton saluted Goncz for working to help people live together  
peacefully and overcome their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is at the heart of what we have been trying to do in our  
efforts to reverse ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and to build a 
southeastern Europe in which all people can live together in 
dignity and freedom,'' Clinton said in his official toast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian president pledged to use the lessons his nation  
had learned to aid Serbia if it started down the path to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one day the democratic leadership in Serbia is created, we  
Hungarians are ready to share our experience in building democracy 
with the Serbian people, with the Serbian leadership,'' said Goncz 
through a translator. ``We are prepared to extend a helping hand 
... because we know what bonding means from our own experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list included some who have vocally opposed U.S.  
bombing in the region. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, who attended 
the dinner, is among a group of lawmakers that had filed suit, 
denied by a judge, accusing the president of overstepping his 
authority when he ordered the U.S. military to bomb Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all want peace,'' Kucinich said. ``The question is what are  
the means to obtain peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, just returned from his trip to  
Macedonia, expressed his hope about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that peace is closer,'' Wiesel said.  
</P>
<P>
	The dinner drew a host of other literary figures -- including  
authors E.L. Doctorow and William Styron -- in a fitting tribute to 
the president who taught himself English while in prison. Goncz 
later went on to translate a host of English works into Hungarian 
and become a writer himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an exceptionally cultivated man,'' said writer Susan  
Sontag, whose works were translated by Goncz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best Hungary has had in generations,'' said Rep. Tom  
Lantos, D-Calif., who was born in Hungary. ``He's a fantastic human 
being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Tony Curtis, fashion designer Adrienne Vittadini and  
Martha Stewart also attended the event. Author Kitty Kelley, famous 
for penning sensational unauthorized biographies of celebrities, 
sat at Mrs. Clinton's table. Asked whether she would consider 
writing a book on the first family, Kelley wouldn't say but did add 
that the she found the first lady ``probably one of the most 
fascinating women of the 20th century.''

<HEADLINE> Cox, MP3.com Plan Music Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cox Interactive Media Inc. and MP3.com Inc. today  
announced a joint venture to create and operate a number of 
music-related Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox Interactive Media, which operates a network of 30 local Web  
sites, will invest $45 million in MP3.com, one of the leaders in 
online music distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will make equal investments in the joint  
venture, according to a statement released by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, David E. Easterly, president and chief  
operating officer of Cox Enterprises Inc., will join MP3.com's 
board of directors. Cox Enterprises Inc., based in Atlanta, is the 
parent company of Cox Interactive Media. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3.com, based in San Diego, Calif., offers a music catalog with  
more than 56,000 songs by 11,000 artists that can be downloaded for 
free. The music is stored in a file format called MP3, which offers 
near-CD quality sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry has blamed MP3 technology for increased  
song piracy, and Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment 
have recently teamed up with software companies to develop secure 
methods of selling and distributing music online. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some recording artists have signaled a growing  
acceptance of MP3 technology. MP3.com is sponsoring a summer 
concert tour featuring Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos.

<HEADLINE> NHL Boss Hasn't Been Lucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There are plenty of tools a shrewd commissioner can call on to  
make his game go. Unfortunately for NHL boss Gary Bettman, luck 
hasn't been one of them. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
	The past four seasons, Bettman has tinkered with almost  
everything connected to hockey but the puck and the national 
anthems. He's made moves to increase scoring, clamp down on 
fighting, stabilize franchises in Canada and plant flags in the 
soil for expanding globally by test-marketing the game at the 
Olympics. He's faced down labor strife and insolvent owners and 
kept the game always moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to the league's showcase series, fate seems to  
be waiting for him with a cross-check. Because the past four 
seasons, Bettman might just as well have handed the winners of the 
Stanley Cup a broom along with the trophy. When he needed drama the 
most what he got were sweeps. First, New Jersey, then Colorado, 
then Detroit twice. What happened Tuesday night in Game 1 of this 
year's finals, though, suggests his fortunes are about to change. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's 3-2 overtime win in Dallas practically guarantees the  
series won't be slipping into that well-worn groove. That's not to 
say there wasn't plenty that was familiar about the way things 
turned out. Winning is a definite possibility on any night that 
your goalie stops 35 of 37 shots -- which happens to be most nights 
when your goalie is Dominik Hasek. But the Stars bring so much more 
ammunition to the showdown than the Sabres do that this one won't 
be Buffalo in four-and-out. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this means,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said in assessing  
the win, ``is that we can't get swept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed a definite possibility going in, what with Buffalo a  
seventh-place team in the East matched against the Stars. It wasn't 
just that Dallas roared back to beat the Avalanche and represent 
the West, whose teams swept the last three Stanley Cups. The Stars 
had also won the league's Presidents' Trophy as the top team with 
114 points in the regular season, and they have a goalie, Eddie 
Belfour, who has looked every bit as formidable as Hasek scaling 
the playoff pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour and Hasek trying to climb over each other to get to the  
top is a great story line by itself. Both are now 34, both have won 
Vezina and Jennings trophies, and this is hardly the first time 
they stood in one another's way. They tried sharing a job in 
Chicago in 1992, and it ended in disaster, depending on who you 
talk to, because Belfour had the starting job and Hasek desperately 
wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until they met in this year's series, the only Stanley Cup  
experience either goalie had was gained during an unmercifully 
brief sweep of the Blackhawks by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992. 
In that sense, at least, Hasek looked the much better prepared 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lying on his side, he made a brilliant kick save with his right  
pad on Pat Verbeek with some five minutes left in the overtime. 
Less than a minute later, Buffalo's Curtis Brown held the puck 
along the right boards and spotted teammate Jason Woolley coming 
off the bench and barreling down the slot toward the Dallas net. He 
sent the puck to Woolley, who redirected it past Belfour in one 
sweeping motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock summed up the sudden turn of events  
just as deftly: ``Chances missed on the other end will come back to 
haunt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman would do well to remember those words, especially with  
his state-of-the-game message set for delivery today. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest buzz hockey generated this season was when it said  
goodbye to Wayne Gretzky, a mixed blessing if there ever was one. 
Its TV ratings were up on one network and down on another. Almost 
18 million people showed up at the rinks to watch the game, so much 
better in person, which remains both a strength and a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the series, Hitchcock acknowledged how important it  
was to come up with an appealing matchup. He practically apologized 
for the defensive styles both Buffalo and Dallas played, saying, 
``This isn't going to be a series made for television. If you look 
for `Champions on Ice,' you're watching the wrong game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bettman has said repeatedly that speed and physical play,  
racheted up a notch or two by the intensity playoffs bestow on the 
game, is all he needs to sell it. That -- and a series long enough 
to hold the public's attention. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Univ. of Wis. Building Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Part of a building under construction on  
the University of Wisconsin campus collapsed today and injured 
seven workers, including one who was trapped in the rubble for more 
than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the collapse was not immediately known.  
</P>
<P>
	The fourth floor, the highest assembled so far for what  
eventually will be an eight-story pharmacy academic building, gave 
way about 8:15 a.m., university spokeswoman Amy Toburen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Beyler was waiting at a nearby bus stop when she heard a  
loud noise from the construction site, which stands across the 
street from University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very sudden,'' she said. ``But it lasted long enough  
for us to look. We saw all this debris cascading off the 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injured were found on the third floor.  
</P>
<P>
	The trapped worker, who had been stuck in debris up to his  
waist, was finally freed and then lifted out of the damaged 
building in a crane with a basket. He suffered trauma to both legs, 
officials at the scene said. He was awake and talking as rescuers 
worked to free him, Fire Department spokesman Jay Deppe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other people were injured, two seriously, Deppe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the $46.9 million building, which now consists  
primarily of girders and concrete floors, started in September. The 
building had been scheduled to open in the fall of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Park Suspended for Seven Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The message from NL president Leonard Coleman  
was clear: There is no kicking in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	For that matter, forearm shivers won't be tolerated, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park was suspended for seven  
games and fined $3,000 on Tuesday for his part in a fight with 
Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher, who wasn't punished. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension began with Tuesday night's game against the Texas  
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	A contrite Park said he wouldn't file an appeal, but still  
seemed puzzled by Belcher's actions before the incident, which 
occurred in the fifth inning of Saturday's game at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize for the bad news for (my) teammates,'' Park said.  
``I couldn't understand why he did it to me. I apologize for trying 
to hurt him. I was so mad about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park essentially repeated what he said the day of the fight,  
that Belcher tagged him hard following his sacrifice bunt, and when 
he asked him why, the Angels' pitcher used profanity in telling him 
to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected three or five games, seven games is so long,'' Park  
said. ``I'll forget about it after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park will be eligible to return June 17 against Pittsburgh at  
Dodger Stadium, and manager Davey Johnson said the 25-year-old 
right-hander from Korea will pitch that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Belcher refused to comment on the fine and suspension following  
Anaheim's 6-2 loss at San Francisco on Tuesday, but expressed anger 
Monday night in his first public comments on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy about what happened,'' Belcher said. ``The guy  
tried to take my head off. I just don't think there's any place for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, Coleman agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he understood  
Coleman's thinking on the matter and believed the decision was a 
fair one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys know Chan Ho, he's a very good person,'' Malone said  
from Corning, N.Y. ``I would defend him all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was frustrated, he misunderstood what Belcher was  
doing and what he said. He reacted in the wrong way. He just made a 
mistake. He'll learn from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone said he regretted the incident took place for a reason  
altogether separate from the resulting suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it sets a good example,'' Malone said. ``Players  
are role models. We have to be examples. I just don't like to see 
it. I see the potential risk of serious injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight began after Belcher fielded Park's bunt and tagged him  
out. After a brief exchange of words, Park forearmed Belcher in the 
face and followed with a leaping kick. Both benches and bullpens 
emptied, and Park was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Walbeck had hit a grand slam off Park an inning earlier,  
the fourth grand slam allowed by Park this season, equaling a 
big-league record for grand slams allowed in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Park, 4-3 with a 4.84 ERA in 12 starts this year, will actually  
miss just one start. And because the Dodgers are off Thursday and 
Monday, it will allow them to go with a four-man rotation in his 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``All suspensions are stiff to me,'' Johnson said. ``There's  
nothing good about a suspension. We have some off days, we won't 
need an extra pitcher, that helps. Someone was looking out for us 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a difficult season so far, for whatever reason.  
There's still plenty of time left for him to have an excellent 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park was 14-8 with a 3.38 ERA in 1997, and 15-9 with a 3.71 ERA  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he respected Coleman's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``He did what he had to do,'' Johnson said. ``(But) it takes two  
to rumble. You don't get into a fight for no reason at all, you 
know what I'm saying? I know what it's like getting tagged hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's severe, seven games, but the schedule makes it  
easier. It's over and done with, let's turn the page and go home.''

<HEADLINE> Okla. Diverts Nichols Trial Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Though he agreed to help tornado victims  
with $1.2 million meant for the trial of Oklahoma City bombing 
conspirator Terry Nichols, Gov. Frank Keating says he wants to make 
sure the prosecution goes forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating on Wednesday signed a bill reallocating the money  
budgeted for Nichols' trial on murder charges to a fund to help 
victims of last month's deadly tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers were angry that money was being spent on a  
redundant state prosecution -- Nichols already has been convicted in 
federal court -- when tornado victims needed help. 
</P>
<P>
	But Keating insisted the state prosecution should proceed, and  
told lawmakers who meet in special session beginning Monday to find 
another $1.2 million for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I resent the fact that I got put in that mess,'' Keating said.  
``The fact is that both of these things should be funded. Both of 
these are obligations of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecution of Terry Nichols will proceed, and the state  
must participate. To suggest that we walk away from this to me is 
unconscionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, was convicted on federal charges and was sentenced  
to life in prison for the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building that killed 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating described the verdict as ``cobbled together'' and said  
questions have been raised about whether it will survive an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols could be sentenced to death if convicted in state court.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure signed Wednesday transfers $300,000 set aside for  
Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy to prosecute Nichols on 
160 first-degree murder counts, one for each bombing victim who was 
not part of the federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	It also moves $900,000 previously earmarked to help pay for  
Nichols' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy did not file charges against Nichols' co-conspirator,  
Timothy McVeigh, who was sentenced to death for his role in the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature appropriated $4 million to help victims of  
May tornadoes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed 44 
people. The money was also to help victims of severe storms and 
flooding.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Takes Birthday Dive From Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Former President Bush took the  
plunge again today, celebrating his upcoming 75th birthday with his 
third parachute jump. 
</P>
<P>
	He jumped from an airplane at 12,500 feet, floating down to the  
lawn of the George Bush Presidential Library on the Texas A&AMP;M 
University campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush deployed his parachute after a free fall of about 4,500  
feet. With a big smile on his face, he landed feet first and sat 
down as crew members gathered around to cushion his landing and 
help him remove the chute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had one of the biggest thrills of my life,'' Bush said  
shortly after receiving a kiss from his wife, Barbara. ``This is 
kind of a euphoric high -- landing safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting, rolling around in the sky. It was  
exhilarating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would do it again, Bush responded: ``I may, but I'll  
wait until I'm 80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After initially saying this would be his last jump, Mrs. Bush  
was more certain than her husband about a repeat performance: ``I'm 
going to announce it right now: He's going to jump when he's 80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will turn 75 on Saturday. Today's event was dubbed  
Operation Spring Colt by the U.S. Parachute Association, which 
organized it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a spring colt,'' Bush told reporters. ``I don't  
feel 75.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's first jump was during World War II, when he bailed out of  
his torpedo plane after it was disabled by Japanese fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The second time was two years ago, in Arizona. He said then he  
had promised himself after his wartime jump that someday he would 
parachute for fun. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, asked if the  
Clinton-Gore team felt any pressure to match Bush's show of 
vitality, replied: ``I think it'd be fair to say that the president 
is encouraged that he's got at least 20 years to go before he has 
to engage in such dynamic activities.''

<HEADLINE> Sony To Pipe in Hard-To-Find Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sony Music Entertainment announced an  
agreement Wednesday to bring 4,000 hard-to-find albums to record 
stores via a high-speed digital network. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement with Digital On-Demand, record stores will be  
outfitted with equipment allowing customers to find music not 
currently on the shelves and have it transferred to a CD in the 
store while they wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``This technology aims to minimize lost sales at retail while  
extending the reach of our artists' music by providing consumers 
with an all-access pass to the Sony Music catalogue,'' said Ron 
Urban, senior vice president of Sony Music. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers would be able to receive the music in a variety of  
formats, including CD, DVD, MiniDisc, or have it installed directly 
onto a digital music player. 
</P>
<P>
	The back-catalogue access provided by Sony includes material  
that may not sell enough copies to merit store space, but that 
retailers may want to make available on demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will start in September in unspecified stores in the  
New York and Los Angeles areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital On-Demand, a Carlsbad, Calif.-based company, is a  
distributor of digital entertainment content to retail outlets 
using point-of-sale systems.

<HEADLINE> DrKoop.com Surges in Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop is  
now a multimillion-dollar ``dot com'' on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in shares of DrKoop.com Inc., a provider of consumer  
health-care information via the Internet, began Tuesday on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. The initial public offering price was $9, but 
by the time trading closed, investors had pushed up the value to 
$16.43 3/4 per share, an increase of more than 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop's 7 percent stake in the company, at Tuesday's closing  
price, was worth about $31.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop, 82, spent seven years as surgeon general in the Reagan and  
Bush administrations, bringing high visibility to the usually 
obscure post. His Amish-style silver beard and white, braided 
uniform were instantly recognizable as he pushed for AIDS education 
and against tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	A political conservative whose nomination was originally opposed  
by liberals, he won wide respect with his blend of old-fashioned 
values, pragmatism and empathy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old company, Koop's brainchild, was formerly known as  
Empower Health Corp., but the name was changed to take advantage of 
Koop's reputation, according to the company's prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Internet ventures popular on Wall Street, DrKoop.com  
isn't making money just yet. The company lost $4.1 million on 
revenue of $404,000 in the three months ended March 31, compared 
with a loss of $709,000 on no revenue during the same period a year 
earlier. For all of last year, the company lost $9 million on 
revenue of $43,000.

<HEADLINE> Secret Message Hidden in Dot of DNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have devised a way of hiding a coded message in a dot  
of human DNA, retooling a Nazi spy trick used during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique wouldn't be of much use to secret agents because  
it is a cumbersome way of sending a message. It is little more than 
a neat trick that exploits the enormous capacity of DNA to hold 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Nazi spies sent messages by reducing them photographically to a  
so-called microdot. The dot was then pasted over a period at the 
end of a sentence in an innocent-looking letter, which was dropped 
in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's issue of the journal Nature, researchers led by  
molecular biologist Carter Bancroft at the Mount Sinai School of 
Medicine in New York describe how they made -- and mailed -- a 
microdot that contained a secret message hidden amid millions of 
strands of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	Bancroft likened it to a page from the ``Where's Waldo''  
children's books, where Waldo is hidden in a large, detailed 
drawing of lots of people. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA is shaped like a twisted ladder, with four kinds of rungs,  
called bases. The scientists built a DNA strand in which different 
combinations of bases represented the letters of their message. 
</P>
<P>
	At either end of the strand they put sequences of bases that  
would serve as the key to finding the strand. The strand was one 
three-thousandths the width of a human hair in length. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists then chopped the entire DNA of a human cell into  
pieces of about the same length, and mixed them with the message 
strand. 
</P>
<P>
	They soaked the mixture into paper with a period printed on it,  
cut out the period and pasted it onto a letter. They mailed the 
letter to themselves to prove that the DNA could survive the rigors 
of the U.S. mail. 
</P>
<P>
	When the letter arrived, they extracted the DNA, multiplied  
millions of times the strand containing the message, and read its 
contents. The message they chose for their test was perhaps the 
most famous secret of the microdot era: ``June 6 invasion: 
Normandy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without knowing the key, it would be practically impossible to  
find the message among the 3 million or so similar strands of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely an intriguing idea,'' said Anne Condon, a  
computer scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ``It 
exploits one of the great advantages of DNA, which is that you can 
have a huge amount of information in a tiny volume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conventional computers would not be of much use in reading a DNA  
microdot, Condon said. Instead, it might require advances in DNA 
computing, the fledgling field of making DNA strands do math, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for any practical applications, you would need a biochemical  
lab both to write and to read the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point of cryptography, it's more of intellectual  
interest,'' Bancroft said.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Test His Skills in NH, Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush says he's been ``a tempting  
target'' for too long, easy pickings for rivals arguing that he is 
a wishy-washy, poll-driven, presidential front-runner not ready for 
the political prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know some people, from what I have read, have raised some  
questions about whether I have a record worth defending and whether 
I have a vision for tomorrow. I'm here to say, I do,'' Bush said in 
a telephone interview from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's what the campaign is for.''  
</P>
<P>
	There was no trace of bitterness in the Texas governor's voice  
as he discussed his first trip of the 2000 campaign, after ending a 
self-imposed sequestration during the state's legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
	But his advisers say his visit to Iowa and New Hampshire,  
starting Saturday, will feature a defiant defense of his 
``compassionate conservatism'' philosophy. He wants to pick a fight 
to make news, one aide said, but doesn't want to engage Vice 
President Al Gore this early. So he will attack, by inference, 
Republican rivals Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander and other critics 
of his philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first test of Bush's campaign skills -- a remarkable  
statement about a candidate who, less than eight months away from 
the first caucuses, is endorsed by a majority of GOP governors and 
House members, has raised millions more dollars than his closest 
competitor and holds a healthy lead in polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush is the best candidate in either party and  
nobody beats him at connecting with the voters and sticking to a 
winning message,'' said Republican strategist Ralph Reed, an ally 
of the twice-elected governor. ``I think anybody who thinks George 
W. Bush begins to look weaker by comparison when he gets a chance 
to shake voters' hands, look them in the eye and mingle is kidding 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential hopefuls -- including Quayle, Alexander and Pat  
Buchanan -- say Republicans are foolishly following polls and 
stampeding behind an untested candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, alarmed by polls showing Bush ahead of Gore, are  
linking the Texas governor to an unpopular Congress -- particularly 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Whip Tom DeLay, both of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Congress in disarray, people are going to start asking  
the question, `George, these guys are from Texas; if you can't 
influence them now how will you do it as president?''' said Roy 
Romer, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He 
was in New Hampshire and Iowa this week in advance of the Bush 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is shrugging off the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a tempting target to say George W. is a person  
who hasn't had to fight for anything in his life,'' he said. ``But 
I know what I believe in and I know the battles I've been 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He prepared for the trip with hours of briefings coordinated by  
aides in Austin with input from policy and political experts from 
around the country. Participants say Bush is prepared for the 
campaign trail and the presidency, but their words often reveal an 
underlying fear that he cannot possibly live up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if people are fair minded in their questions and their  
expectations that they'll find his performance to be superb,'' said 
Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, who attended a session Monday. ``But 
he's been focused on things other than this virtually from the 
first of the year and these other people have been running for 
president for a long time. Focusing has not been an option for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush believes he is up to the task.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire have a chance to  
hear me speak from the heart and I know I'll listen to them,'' Bush 
said. ``I want to talk about why I'm running and show some 
passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers say his signature speech in Iowa will trace the broad  
themes of his campaign without laying out specific policy 
proposals. The highlight, they say, will be a rebuttal to criticism 
of compassionate conservatism ideology. 
</P>
<P>
	He will argue that Republicans can cut taxes, trim welfare,  
reduce crime -- be conservative -- without being mean about it. He 
will vow not to retreat from the criticism, said two senior 
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	He also plans to visit a charity to highlight his efforts in  
Texas to get faith-based organizations involved in solving social 
problems, a pet issue of conservatives that Gore embraced recently. 
He hopes to stake his claim to the issue without mentioning Gore by 
name, advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Look, too, for Bush to sign up new supporters in Iowa and  
perhaps New Hampshire to underscore his solid but growing 
grass-roots organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has yet to reveal how he'll handle an early test of his  
organization -- the Ames, Iowa straw poll in August. A loss would 
raise questions about the depth of his support. Going all out for a 
win would be expensive. Ignoring the event would anger party 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the advisers said Bush is likely to settle for a  
``modified limited play'' -- meaning he will participate to show his 
respect for the state's political might but won't try to win it. It 
would be an attempt, the adviser said, to lower sky-high 
expectations.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Says No Large Tax Cut Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told Senate  
Democrats on Wednesday that the nation's economy does not need the 
large tax cut envisioned by Republicans in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting behind closed doors in the Capitol with seven key  
Democrats, Rubin said paying down the nation's debts would be a 
better use for projected surplus money left over once Social 
Security and Medicare are safeguarded, according to participants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to say they would like nothing to happen,''  
said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, top Democrat on the 
Senate Finance Committee. ``The economy is in full employment, with 
low interest rates. This economy doesn't need any stimulus ... 
that's their view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan and other participants said no final decision was  
reached on whether Democrats will offer an alternative to the 
yet-to-be-announced Republican tax relief package expected to total 
$778 billion over the next 10 years. Republican leaders in the 
House and Senate plan to release separate draft proposals in July 
and have asked for Democratic input. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin and the man nominated by President Clinton to succeed him,  
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, left the Capitol 
without speaking to reporters. The president's fiscal 2000 budget 
calls for targeted tax cuts worth $75.3 billion over five years, 
but they are paid for with increases many in the GOP oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said most Democrats believe that the  
Republican tax cut would eat up money needed for critical programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest problem with the Republican tax bill is that it's  
so large that it's forcing deep cuts ... they're going to have to 
cut veterans programs, housing, education, all sorts of things,'' 
Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, however, believe the existence of the surplus is a  
golden opportunity to reduce taxes without trimming spending and 
say tax cuts are second in priority only to guaranteeing Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is a bipartisan package of tax cuts,'' the chairman of  
the Senate Finance Committee, William Roth, R-Del., told committee 
members in a letter this week. ``I hope to build the package on tax 
relief proposals supported on both sides of the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if such support is possible, Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of  
Montana said: ``That's unclear at this point. It's way to early to 
tell.''

<HEADLINE> Romance Writer Warned of Her Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Romance novelist Nancy Richards-Akers' husband  
had threatened to kill her several times, according to e-mails she 
sent her friends in the months before she was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``(I) told my husband I wanted a divorce. He threatened to kill  
me, broke my nose, and I was basically a hostage in my own house 
until early (last) June,'' Richards-Akers, 45 at the time of her 
death Saturday, wrote to a friend in January. ``I had to get myself 
away so my children would not see me killed before their eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail, passed along to a reporter by a fellow novelist on  
condition of anonymity, was the most graphic of nearly a dozen 
messages to friends and colleagues that were sent by Richards-Akers 
and provided Monday and Tuesday to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	They shed light on the events that culminated in the romance  
novelist's slaying Saturday night, apparently by her estranged 
husband, in one of Washington's most posh neighborhoods. Her 
husband, Jeremy Akers, 57, a lawyer and former Marine, fatally shot 
himself a few hours later as police officers approached him near 
the Vietnam Memorial on the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards-Akers was the third romance author killed by a husband  
in three years, according to the Romance Writers of America. 
California authors Pamela Macaluso and Ann Wassall were shot to 
death by their husbands in 1997 and 1996, respectively, the group 
said in a statement today. The husbands killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akers' deaths have made orphans of their three children,  
Finny, Jeb and Isabel, who all knew of the brutality, according to 
Richards-Akers' letters. At the time of her death, the novelist was 
living with a male friend, and Akers with the children in the home 
the couple had shared for 16 years. She moved out after Akers 
punched her in the nose in front of Jeb and Isabel. He also told 
Finny to prepare to raise his two siblings alone, the novelist 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some friends refused to house her because they feared her  
husband, Richards-Akers wrote. It was well known that he collected 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths came days before the first court date of divorce  
proceedings that Akers had resisted, according to the e-mails. When 
she asked for a divorce, ``he threatened to kill me,'' 
Richards-Akers wrote. She said she moved out and into the apartment 
for the children's sake. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had not left, they might have witnessed my death,'' she  
wrote in a Jan. 18 note to the fellow romance novelist who demanded 
anonymity but who confirmed the document's authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	The novelist's e-mails paint a picture of a darkly abusive  
relationship far from the world of chivalry and daydreams that fill 
her books. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 2, Richards-Akers wrote: ``He is a violent, possessive,  
terrorist control-freak, and although I am out of the immediate 
path of his wrath he has spared nothing in his efforts to punish me 
financially and emotionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richards-Akers had found love in recent months in her world of  
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 16, Richards-Akers sounded upbeat in an e-mail to  
fellow author Kay Bailey, who goes by the pen name ``Karen Kay.'' 
In another written that day, she described ``Jim,'' as ``a truly 
sweet and generous man who is becoming an important part of my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later, Richards-Akers revealed that she and ``Jim,''  
who writes poetry for children, had made plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have talked about getting married,'' she wrote to Bailey.  
</P>
<P>
	Richards-Akers was prominent in the cyberworld of romance  
novelists and their fans who wrote daily on a Web site devoted to 
``Avon Ladies'' who had contracted with Avon Books. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote 16 historical romance novels, including ``Devil's  
Wager'' and ``Miss Wickham's Betrothal.'' Her latest was ``So Wild 
a Kiss,'' a book for which she had high hopes but which had 
disappointing sales. Her 1997 book, ``Wild Irish Skies,'' was named 
one of the top 10 romance novels of that year by The Washington 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards-Akers was working on a new book, tentatively titled,  
``Lady of the Tower,'' at the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	She turned to romance writing after being disillusioned by jobs  
in the political world, which she described on her Web site as ``a 
tragic waste for a chronic daydreamer.''

<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Capital City Bombers manager and three  
players have been suspended after a confrontation with fans during 
a game in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the South Atlantic League, which handed down the  
disciplinary action Wednesday, said manager Dave Engle can finish 
the team's road trip in Charleston before beginning his three-game 
suspension Thursday.

	Player Michael Ribaudo was suspended for five games by the  
league and put on the restricted list by the Class A club's parent 
organization, the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Ribaudo jumped on top of the dugout and knocked  
down a fan.

	Robert Stratton and Brian Jenkins were suspended for three games  
for allegedly throwing cups of ice water into the stands. The water

<HEADLINE> Hard Times for CBS Evening News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The folks at ``CBS Evening News'' once thought  
hard news was the key to success. Now they've fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady ratings downturn at Dan Rather's signature show has  
accelerated in recent weeks to near-record lows, leaving CBS 
dangerously close to dropping out of any real competition with NBC 
and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has added a new producer and promises to tweak the show this  
summer. But its executives can't explain the slide, which executive 
producer Al Ortiz traces to viewer boredom with the Monica Lewinsky 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABC came back from that and we never did. We're not entirely  
sure why,'' Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``CBS Evening News'' ratings this week were down 17 percent  
from the year before, according to Nielsen Media Research. NBC was 
down 4 percent and ABC down 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather's broadcast was hot early in 1998, occasionally winning  
the closely watched ratings competition. CBS suggested then that 
viewers were attracted to its no-nonsense approach to news, with 
less reliance on features than its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can no longer make that unique claim,'' said Andrew  
Tyndall, who studies the content of evening newscasts for a weekly 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``CBS Evening News'' has done more lifestyle and health care  
features during the past year, Tyndall said. Ortiz said there 
hasn't been any conscious change in focus. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS may also be suffering from its lack of strong news platforms  
to drive viewers to the evening show. Ratings leader NBC starts its 
day with the powerful ``Today'' show, keeps its correspondents 
working on MSNBC during the day and covers big stories in 
prime-time on ``Dateline NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has no cable outlet, its morning show trails badly in the  
ratings and its newsmagazines, while popular, tend to play off the 
news less than competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a big story going on ... and you start your day  
with another network, it's tough to draw people over to us at 6:30 
in the evening,'' Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, a former Washington bureau chief, took over as top  
executive last August from Jeff Fager, who runs ``60 Minutes II.'' 
Some insiders suggest Ortiz, while a respected newsman, is hurt by 
his lack of experience in running a show. The former 
second-in-command at ``48 Hours,'' Jim Murphy, was recently added 
to Ortiz's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	During May, CBS achieved its second-lowest weekly rating ever  
for the news show and also tied its mark for third-lowest rating. 
Its lowest rating ever came in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS tends to be hurt this time of year because its strength is  
in Southern markets, which are hit by the traditional summer 
downturn in viewership sooner than Northern cities, said network 
researcher David Poltrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a seasonal aspect to it, but clearly we're not  
satisfied with being in third place,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Taxicab kidnappings, armed robberies and  
carjackings have long terrorized citizens of Mexico's capital. Yet 
the death of a television star and the brazenness of the noon 
attack have shocked many Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for Monday's killing of Francisco ``Paco'' Stanley  
remained a mystery today, and its professional style made it 
untypical. 
</P>
<P>
	The death has galvanized popular outrage over crime in Mexico  
and prompted some to attack the city's mayor, a candidate for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so much violence in the city, the government has ignored  
us. Anybody can carry a weapon in his hand just as he'd carry a 
cell phone,'' said Claudia Flores, one of thousands of people who 
lined up outside a funeral home Tuesday to file past Stanley's 
coffin. ``Nobody protects us. We are alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many in line sobbed as they talked about their memories of the  
comedian. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley was a morning talk show cross between Rosie O'Donnell  
and Ed Sullivan, a wisecracking host offering musical acts and 
silly skits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I woke up pessimistic, he would tell one of his jokes,  
which were stupid but funny,'' said Carmen Dolores Duran, 74, a 
retired school principal, clutching a rose against her gray suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the memorial, thousands gathered at Mexico City's  
Spanish Cemetery for the burial. Many clambered atop family tomb 
chapels to shower flowers on the hearse carrying Stanley's body as 
it eased through the chaotic crowd. Some chanted ``Justice! 
Justice!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The developments were covered almost nonstop on Mexico's two  
main television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a gunman with a .40-caliber automatic weapon fired  
26 shots into Stanley's black Lincoln Navigator at noon Monday in 
front of El Charco De Las Ranas, one of the capital's most famous 
restaurants alongside its busiest freeway, the Periferico. 
</P>
<P>
	An insurance agent standing nearby also was killed, and three  
people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, whose 1997 election victory came on a  
wave of outrage at soaring crime, quickly came under attack -- 
turning the slaying into a political issue ahead of Cardenas' 
likely run for the presidency in July 2000 on the opposition 
Democratic Revolution Party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the government of Cardenas camouflages the statistics  
of the fight against crime ... Paco's death is one more example 
against what the authorities say,'' Congressman Jorge Galvan of the 
National Action Party told the daily El Heraldo de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``The responsibility is that of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,'' charged  
Jorge Garralda, a newscaster on the TV Azteca network where Stanley 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	A prominent anti-crime lobbying group, Mexico United Against  
Crime, announced plans for a demonstration on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, investigators said they had found cocaine on  
Stanley's body and a credential identifying him as an employee of 
the Interior Secretariat, which is concerned with security. The 
secretariat said it was a temporary permit intended to allow 
Stanley, who had suffered four robberies, to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation could embarrass another presidential candidate,  
Francisco Labastida of the governing Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, who recently resigned as interior secretary to campaign for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardenas claims his administration has reduced the wave of armed  
robberies, carjackings, thefts and kidnappings that have soared in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials admit that many crimes are not reported due to  
lack of faith in authorities, and those victims who do report 
crimes sometimes find they are not taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardenas at first seemed to minimize the Stanley killing, but as  
public outrage grew, his tone changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no such thing as a 'common crime,''' Cardenas said in  
an ad placed in Tuesday newspapers, vowing ``our most urgent 
priority'' to solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused the news media of ``an act of great  
irresponsibility'' in blaming his government for the crime and 
insisted that the federal government -- run by the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party -- also is responsible for fighting crime.

	Yugoslav, NATO Commanders Sign Deal  
</P>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- The commander of NATO troops in  
Macedonia announced today NATO and Yugoslav generals had signed an 
agreement providing for the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, 
suspension of the NATO air campaign and the return of hundreds of 
thousands of refugees. Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson says it explains 
how the Yugoslav forces will achieve military compliance with 
NATO's conditions. He says once that compliance is verified, there 
will be an end to the NATO air campaign. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon made the announcement in Washington, saying the pullout could 
begin ``in a matter of hours.''

	Indonesia Defends Slow Vote Count

<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- International observers warned today  
that continued delays in vote counting from Indonesia's freest vote 
in 44 years could erase public trust in the Southeast Asian 
nation's fledgling democracy. Only 5.6 percent of votes cast in 
Monday's parliamentary elections have been tabulated, a fraction of 
what had been promised by this stage. Election officials blamed the 
delays on laborious checks against cheating, their own lack of 
experience and logistical challenges in a nation of 210 million 
people and 13,000 islands.

	Clinton Order Targets Race Profiling

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today announced an executive  
order that federal law enforcement officials must collect data on 
the race and sex of the people they stop to question or arrest, 
calling racial profiling by police a ``morally indefensible, deeply 
corrosive practice.'' The president announced the executive order 
at a roundtable on civil rights law enforcement, and said he hoped 
it would encourage state and local officials to examine their own 
law enforcement agencies for evidence of racial profiling. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Criticizes House Gun Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused House Republicans  
today of pushing a gun-control bill ``ghostwritten'' by the 
National Rifle Association. Republican polling shows strong support 
nationwide for gun-control measures, including an increase in the 
allowable age for handgun purchases from 18 to 21. The GOP survey 
also found lopsided public backing for mandatory background checks 
for gun show sales, safety devices for guns and mandatory sentences 
for felons who used a gun.

	Cosmonauts Launch Mir Fund-Raiser  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian cosmonauts launched a fund-raiser today to  
try to keep the Mir space station aloft. Vitaly Sevastyanov and 
German Titov, veterans of the Soviet space program, called on 
Russians to contribute to a new fund to save the Mir. The Russian 
government has said it would only pay for the Mir's operation 
through August, and efforts to lure private investors have failed. 
Mir's operation is estimated to cost $250 million a year. If no 
money is found by February or March, ground controllers will lower 
the 130-ton station to burn up in the atmosphere.

	FAA To Allow Carry-On Coffee  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration said today  
that passengers can keep the cups of coffee they've carried onto 
airliners despite rules saying that carry-on items must be put 
away. The decision came after a flight attendant for Alaska 
Airlines complained that the FAA inspector overseeing the West 
Coast carrier was forcing it to collect carry-on coffee cups out of 
concerns that passengers could be splashed with hot liquid if a 
plane made a sudden stop. Inspectors overseeing Alaska's 
competitors did not have the same rule, which triggered a review of 
the consistency and common sense of some rulings.

	NATO, Yugoslavia Sign Peace Deal  
</P>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Serb officials say the Yugoslavian  
army will begin pulling out of Kosovo on Thursday, a first step in 
implementing the peace agreement signed by NATO and Yugoslav 
generals. Other aspects of Wednesday's agreement include suspension 
of the NATO air campaign and the return of hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanian refugees to Kosovo. President Clinton said the deal 
``is another important step toward achieving our objectives in 
Kosovo.'' Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson said the agreement describes how 
all Serb-led forces would conduct a ``phased, verifiable and 
orderly withdrawal from Kosovo.'' The Pentagon said the Serbs could 
begin pulling out ``in a matter of hours.''

	Peacekeeper Forces Quickly Prepare  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heavily armed U.S. Army soldiers, 1,700  
strong, began moving by road toward the Macedonia border from 
neighboring Albania today as preparations for Kosovo peacekeeping 
accelerated. Meanwhile, 1,900 Marines aboard ships off the coast of 
Greece were to move quickly ashore and begin heading north to 
Skopje, Macedonia, to help spearhead the entry of U.S. forces into 
Kosovo, Pentagon officials said. The Marines were taking attack 
helicopters. All the preparations picked up speed as an agreement 
for Serb troop withdrawal was announced. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon it probably would take at least 24 hours after the beginning 
of a withdrawal before the lead elements of the U.S. peacekeeping 
force could enter Kosovo.

	Cigars Double Risk for Some Cancers  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In yet another warning about the dangers of one  
of the hottest trends of the '90s, a study found that cigar smokers 
are twice as likely as nonsmokers to get cancer of the mouth, 
throat and lungs. They also run about 1 1/2 times the risk of all 
smoking-related cancers together and are more likely to develop 
heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study, 
published in tomorrow's New England Journal of Medicine, was 
conducted by Dr. Carlos Iribarren, an epidemiologist at the Kaiser 
Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland, Calif., who examined

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rallied but failed to lift the  
broader market today as the threat of higher interest rates kept 
investors on edge and alert to changes in bond market yields. The 
Dow Jones industrial average ended down 75.35 at 10,690.29. On the 
NYSE, losers led gainers 1,556-1,389. The Nasdaq composite index, 
which includes a large number of technology stocks, rose 31.90 to 
2,506.46.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The WNBA's Washington Mystics expect to draw a  
sellout crowd of more than 20,000 for their season opener tomorrow 
night against the Charlotte Sting -- and will be disappointed if 
they don't. And the big draw to the game is No. 1 overall draft 
pick Chamique Holdsclaw, the so-called female Michael Jordan. Asked 
to say something about herself during the Mystics luncheon 
yesterday, Holdsclaw stood and said: ``I'm from Tennessee. I'm a 
rookie.''

<HEADLINE> MedPartners Exiting From California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MedPartners Inc. will continue to provide  
medical care for its 1.3 million enrollees in California as it 
withdraws its financially troubled operations from the state under 
a settlement reached with officials Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement worked out with the state Department of  
Corporations also settles litigation between MedPartners and the 
state just three months after state regulators seized control of 
the company's California subsidiary, MedPartners Provider Network, 
forcing it to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is a middleman between health maintenance  
organizations and providers such as hospitals and physician groups. 
The subsidiary, one of the largest health care providers in 
California, manages business affairs for 117 clinics and more than 
1,000 doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement must still be approved in U.S. Bankruptcy  
Court and state Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had been afraid the company would leave the state  
without paying its bills and leave more than 1 million enrollees 
shopping for new doctors. The state took over the network after 
declaring the company's cash reserves depleted, prompting 
MedPartners to accuse the state of exceeding its authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Birmingham, Ala.-based MedPartners, faced with falling prices  
for shares of its stock and doctor discontent, said in November 
that it was quitting the physician management business. The company 
planned this year to sell or spin off 238 physician clinics and 
more than 13,000 affiliated doctors in 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
	MedPartners also agreed to be responsible for valid debts and  
claims against its California subsidiary and to transfer enrollees 
to other physician-care companies in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The company agreed that its clinics to be sold to ``financially  
viable'' third parties. State officials said they prefer that the 
clinics be sold to California-based companies.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Donald Faison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Faison is creating a niche playing the  
cool cat in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He starred in the 1995 film ``Clueless'' and is one of the stars  
of the UPN television series based on the movie. He also plays a 
high-school playboy hustler in ``Trippin','' a new teen comedy 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	So is Faison drawing on his own exploits in high school for his  
roles? 
</P>
<P>
	Not really.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember I wasn't popular in high school until my junior  
year, and that's because I got on the yearbook committee and put my 
face on every page of the yearbook. So that's when popularity 
started for me,'' said Faison, who celebrates his 25th birthday on 
June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't a 'ladies' man' in high school. In fact, I didn't  
start dating until my senior year. Before that I was too much into 
videogames or basketball or toys. I matured later than anyone 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faison is a native of New York. His roots in acting can be  
traced back to his parents, who staged plays at the National Black 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	He landed his first movie role in the gritty urban drama  
``Juice,'' starring Omar Epps and Tupac Shakur, which was released 
in 1992. His film credits also include ``New Jersey Drive'' and 
``Waiting to Exhale.'' But it was his role in ``Clueless,'' 
starring Alicia Silverstone, that put him in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Faison loves action and sci-fi movies.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to be in the next 'Star Wars,''' he said.  
``I would do anything -- well, not ANYTHING -- but I'd do a lot, an 
awful lot, to get in that picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. How did your life change after your movie successes?  
</P>
<P>
	Faison: It was kind of weird. One day nobody knew who I was, and  
I would go out, if I went to a club, I'd ask the girls to dance and 
they would say 'No.' And then two years later, I'd see the same 
girls at a different club, and all of a sudden, they're like, 'Hey, 
remember me?' And it's like, 'Oh yeah, you're the girl that dissed 
me!' 
</P>
<P>
	1-1/2: Did you ask her to dance again?  
</P>
<P>
	Faison: I don't hold a grudge. I was like, 'You wanna dance?'  
Maybe two years ago I would have wanted to take it further, but 
after that, I knew what she was about. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Do you worry about getting typecast in teen roles?  
</P>
<P>
	Faison: I'd like to do different things. Right now I've just  
been cast in a lot of teen stuff. And that's just the way it is. I 
don't know if Jennifer Love Hewitt is worried about getting 
typecast. She does a lot of teen-age stuff. ... Sooner or later 
(you're) going to grow out of it. I look forward to growing out of 
it. I think as I mature, my acting will mature. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Why have teen movies become so popular in the last few years?  
</P>
<P>
	Faison: I think kids like watching stories about their lives in  
high school. Everybody can relate to somebody in high school, 
especially when you're in high school, and right now that's a great 
market. 'Clueless' set it off in the '90s. There was a long time 
when there wasn't a lot of high school movies, and then all of a 
sudden 'Clueless' came out, and then all of these other movies 
followed. I think it's great. I think it's wonderful that a lot of 
young actors are getting the opportunity to play characters like 
the ones they saw back in the '80s, like 'Sixteen Candles' and 
'Pretty in Pink.' 
</P>
<P>
	4. The film roles you do are usually positive. Do you choose  
such roles purposefully? 
</P>
<P>
	Faison: As long as it's good, it's good. ... I do choose a lot  
more positive roles because I'm a positive person and I don't want 
to just play thugs in film. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Do you get antsy when you're not working?  
</P>
<P>
	Faison: Yeah, I get very antsy. I enjoy working. I don't do it  
just because it's my job. I do it also because of love. Just like a 
basketball player, they ask for that $121 million check, but then 
they play their hearts out because they love the game, and I love 
this game. I love playing make-believe.

<HEADLINE> Univ. of Wis. Building Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Part of a building under construction on  
the University of Wisconsin campus collapsed today, seriously 
injuring three workers including one who was trapped in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened at a pharmacy academic building under  
construction across from University Hospital. Witnesses said it 
appeared part of the top floor of the three- or four-story building 
gave way. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the workers were taken to a hospital, and a third, also  
seriously injured, remained trapped in the debris more than an hour 
after the floor collapsed at about 8:15 a.m., said Debbie Sumwalt, 
a university program assistant. The nature of their injuries was 
not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Three or four others were treated for less serious injuries.  
Sumwalt did not know if they were taken to the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Kan. Farmers Bring in Winter Wheat / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIOWA, Kan. (AP) -- Battered by violent spring storms and plagued  
by outbreaks of crop diseases, Kansas farmers have begun bringing 
in the first truckloads of winter wheat from their fields. 
</P>
<P>
	But nature's whims pale next to the dismal crop prices at the  
local grain elevator, where the price early this week hovered at 
$2.29 per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We work hard to try to raise a good crop. We like to haul as  
much into town as we can. Unfortunately, the price isn't there,'' 
said Greg Miller, a third-generation Kiowa wheat farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller brought in a sample Tuesday to the O.K. Co-op to test.  
The weight, at 60.2 pounds per bushel, was good. But it was still 
too moist to cut that day. Like most farmers, Miller is anxious to 
get the crop in -- he has already lost 18 percent of his crop to 
hail this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has started pushing it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Around Kiowa -- a south central community where the wheat harvest  
traditionally begins in Kansas -- the first bushels brought in so 
far have looked very good. 
</P>
<P>
	Test weights on loads now coming in to the O.K. Co-op have  
ranged between 60 pounds and 62 pounds per bushel, said assistant 
manager Jeff Kimmell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had such a moist spring wheat has filled out really  
well on a weight basis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still too early to get a good estimate of yields in the  
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Disease problems have been minimal in these parts of the state,  
unlike other regions where nearly half of the wheat crop has been 
infested to some degree with a variety of diseases. Much of the 
first wheat harvested so far in Kiowa is infested with cheat grass, 
which lowers test weights. 
</P>
<P>
	But at this farmer-owned cooperative, elevator workers were  
reluctant to dock farmers unless it was really bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the owners of this business too -- it is a  
cooperative. We feel we can absorb that,'' Kimmell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first wheat-laden trucks began bringing in the crop late  
Monday, and by the end of that first day the elevator had taken 
nearly 20,000 bushels, said elevator manager Steve Fenton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figure today we ought to get a pretty good start,'' Fenton  
said Tuesday. ``We still need some 90-plus temperatures, and a good 
stiff wind (to dry fields). I'm hoping to be rocking and rolling by 
Wednesday or Thursday by the latest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The O.K. Co-op still has about 48,000 bushels of grain in  
storage, much of it to cover government loans. But the elevator has 
nearly 350,000 bushels more of storage space available this year 
than during the last wheat harvest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Storage isn't as tight here as it is further north, where crops  
are more diversified. And since Kiowa is where the Kansas harvest 
started, there is still room in larger terminal elevators to move 
the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson Tucker, a high school senior hauling wheat for a local  
farmer, brought in a load this week with a 60.7 pound per bushel 
test weight and only 13.7 percent moisture. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said the crop looks real good -- good bushels and pretty  
clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Custom cutter Kim Clark just got back to her hometown of Kiowa  
after cutting wheat in Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get home and cut here in familiar surroundings  
and people,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Eberts, a custom cutter from North Dakota, just got into  
Kansas after cutting in Frederick, Okla. ``This looks better. They 
had lots of hail. That is why we are here a little early,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Voters Back LA Charter Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Voters cast off the city's 74-year-old  
constitution in favor of a streamlined document meant to thwart 
secession movements by meeting citizens' complaints about remote, 
unresponsive government. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Riordan pitched the new charter as an alternative  
for residents in the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere who have 
increasingly tried to break away, complaining they are ignored by 
city officials downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The charter gives the mayor more power; creates neighborhood  
councils with local control; and decentralizes decisions on 
planning and zoning. 
</P>
<P>
	With mail-in ballots and 1,076 of 1,740 precincts counted  
Tuesday, 60 percent of voters in the nation's second-largest city 
supported the proposed charter and 40 percent were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over the 74-year-old charter pitted municipal leaders  
against one another and generated hefty out-of-state donations. But 
less than 20 percent of registered voters were estimated to have 
cast ballots on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the old charter had grown with more than 400  
amendments into what was considered an unwieldy document that made 
conducting city business cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
	The new constitution gives the mayor the authority to dismiss  
most city commissioners. The mayor also could fire department 
heads, although the council can veto the decision with a two-thirds 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will enable the citizens of Los Angeles to reconnect with  
their government,'' said Councilman Mike Feuer, who supported the 
new charter.

<HEADLINE> Rich Tell Us To Be Optimistic / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the very rich are similar to you and me, as  
some would claim, the skies over America will be rather quiet next 
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	That assumption might be made based on a survey of the very  
rich, more than half of whom indicated the risk of computer 
failures make air travel an unpleasant prospect on those days. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey respondents are talking about Y2K, for Year 2000,  
computer bugs that are expected to cause at least some computer 
systems to crash or malfunction because of an inability to 
recognize the new millennium's numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	While airlines and regulators are, of course, hoping to have the  
risk greatly reduced or eliminated by that holiday weekend, you 
might say the very rich didn't get to be where they are by taking 
needless chances. 
</P>
<P>
	For definition purposes, ``very rich'' or ``affluent'' refers to  
those individuals with annual incomes of at least $225,000 or 
assets of $3 million, which places them among the wealthiest 1 
percent of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	That population segment includes U.S. Trust customers, which  
surveys the very rich annually, adhering to that principle of 
modern marketing that says you cannot know enough about your 
customers. Y2K questions were among those asked in 20-minute 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the survey showed the very rich are overwhelmingly  
optimistic (94 percent) about the future and, with the possible 
exception of the New Year's weekend, confident about U.S. 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 60 percent agreed with the statement that ``the United  
States has been, and will continue to be, the world leader,'' and 
one-third expressed confidence that the best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, they do have concerns, just like the rest of us. They fear  
the next generation will have a more difficult time financially 
than their generation, and most fear that stocks will be less 
generous. 
</P>
<P>
	They fear also that global economic troubles could cause a U.S.  
recession, although the timing wasn't mentioned. They fear that 
taxes will rise steeply and inflation will eat at investments. 
</P>
<P>
	They have great hopes too. No less than 89 percent indicated  
that technology is the industry offering the greatest potential for 
financial success. And they believe strongly that the best way to 
assure this success is by starting your own business. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting an attitude that bears further analysis, they ranked  
``well-to-do family'' at the bottom of a long list of factors for 
achieving success. ``Ambition'' and ``willingness to work hard'' 
were at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
	In other ways as well, responses to questions constituted an  
endorsement of what many consider to be all-American attitudes of 
optimism and faith that in the long run obstacles will be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Such as Y2K. While most feel it will cause only minor problems,  
some are taking just-in-case precautions. Not just avoiding New 
Year's travel, but planning to stock up on food and water. 
</P>
<P>
	And nearly half those interviewed said they were taking extra  
cash out of the bank, which suggests a possible answer to that 
eternal question of whether they are different from you and me. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. savings rate is below zero. While ordinary Americans do  
have assets, such as cars and houses, on average they do not have 
extra cash. They have debts instead.

<HEADLINE> Body Suspends Skating Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Skating Union  
suspended two judges Wednesday but said it would not change the 
results of a controversial competition. 
</P>
<P>
	ISU general secretary Fredi Schmid said that it could not be  
determined whether the judges' collusion had affected the results 
of the World Championships pairs competition at Helsinki in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Yelena Berzhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won the gold  
medal over China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo, in a decision that 
elicited boos from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian judge Sviatoslav Babenko received a three-year ban and  
Alfred Korytek of Ukraine was banned for two years. They will not 
be allowed to officiate at any championship or international event 
under ISU jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an investigation and the conclusions were there was  
obviously misconduct,'' Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Footage shot by Canadian television showed the two judges  
glancing at each other and appearing to talk before the results for 
the Chinese pair were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The two judges also ranked another Russian pair third, while six  
of the seven other judges ranked them fourth or fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	ISU rules say ``judges must mark independently and, while  
judging, they are not permitted to converse with one another or to 
indicate errors by action or sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmid said the difference in the length of suspension for the  
judges was based on their past record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each official has a track record where we see how he judged,  
and the suspension is based on that,'' Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korytek was a judge during the 1994 Olympics controversy  
centering around Oksana Baiul of Ukraine winning the gold by a 5-4 
count. He also is the father of Baiul's first coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges have the right to appeal to the ISU's appeals  
commission, and could ultimately take their case to the Court of 
Arbitration for Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problem, ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta said his  
organization would not consider separating judges with partitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a bad image,'' he said. ``The best way is to  
educate people ... to respect the ideals of sport.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Fan Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The annual homecoming for country music  
fans is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands will stream into Nashville for the 28th International  
Country Music Fan Fair, which starts Monday and runs through 
Thursday (June 14-17). They pay $90 for access to 12 concerts 
featuring a variety of artists, and the opportunity to stand in 
line for autographs from some of Nashville's biggest stars. Most of 
the action is at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds, where concerts 
are held at the race track. 
</P>
<P>
	For another $50, fans can attend the annual TNN Music City News  
Country Awards at Nashville Arena. Satellite events such as a 
charity softball game abound, as do private events where stars 
greet members of their fan clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at that week as being totally for the fans,'' said Mark  
Wills, an up-and-comer nominated for best single, song and video at 
the Music City Awards show for the ballad ``Don't Laugh at Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Fan Fair remains a must for many diehard fans, interest  
has waned a bit. Most years, all 24,000 tickets were snapped up 
months ahead of time. But last year, tickets were available until 
just before the start. This year, organizers at the Country Music 
Association expect to have about 3,000 leftover tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing of the Opryland USA theme park in January 1998 has  
hurt Fan Fair. A Fan Fair ticketused to buy admission to the park, 
and the $230 million entertainment complex of shops, bars and 
restaurants set to replace it doesn't open until next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	There also has been a slight but noticeable decline in the  
popularity of country music, after the boom years sparked by the 
1980s rise of superstar Garth Brooks. Some Nashville record 
companies have even laid off employees. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in 1994, 2,642 radio stations played country music.  
Today, the number is 2,368. That's still about a quarter of all 
radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	CMA officials say they are not worried about the long-term  
viability of country music, noting it has outlasted other musical 
trends for much of this century. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan Fair still reflects the best of country music, where stars  
still embrace their followers instead of putting up obstacles to 
keep them away. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the hundreds of singers who will participate this year are  
Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Trisha Yearwood, Alan Jackson, Deana Carter and John 
Michael Montgomery. George Jones will perform, the first time many 
fans see him since a near-fatal car accident in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Music City News Country Awards, one of three major country  
music awards shows each year, is the only one in which winners are 
picked by fans. This year's top nominee is Faith Hill, who is up 
for awards in seven categories: best female artist; best album for 
``Faith; best video, single and song for ``This Kiss''; and best 
vocal collaboration for ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me,'' 
a duet with husband Tim McGraw. ``Just to Hear You Say That You 
Love Me'' also is nominated as best song.

	REISSUES: Several new reissues are worth a look. Buddha Records  
has just released two by Waylon Jennings. ``Love of the Common 
People'' was produced in 1967 by Chet Atkins before Jennings 
changed to an ``outlaw'' image. It has a nice version of the 
Beatles' ``You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.'' Even better is 
``Honky Tonk Heroes'' from 1973, a full-fledged outlaw album 
comprised almost totally of songs by the incomparable Billy Joe 
Shaver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Swing West!'' is a three-CD set of West Coast country that's  
educational and quite good despite being light on the two most 
famous practitioners, Merle Haggard and Buck Owens. ``Bill Monroe 
Live From Mountain Stage'' isn't really a reissue, but it is a 
wonderful collection of the late bluegrass founder in prime 
latter-day form. It was recorded in 1989 for the West 
Virginia-based radio show, and includes many of his classics. 
Highly recommended.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged To Mull More Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economic figures for the first three months  
of the year are expected to show improvement and may even show 
growth for the first time in almost two years, a spokesman for the 
prime minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have better figures than the previous quarter,'' said  
Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Economic Planning Agency is scheduled to release gross  
domestic product figures for the January-March period on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saiki did not say what the figures would be and refused to  
comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the government said the economy shrank 0.8 percent in  
the October-December period for a record fifth straight quarter of 
contraction, extending Japan's longest recession since World War 
II. The last time the economy expanded was in the July-September 
period of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, a top economic adviser to Obuchi said  
Japan should consider boosting public spending soon to stimulate 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is a good time to consider a supplementary budget,  
including measures for employment and spending on public works,'' 
said Ichizo Ohara, a member of the House of Representatives from 
Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
	Generous outlays for road and bridge construction and other  
public projects in recent years have pumped hundreds of billions of 
dollars into the Japanese economy and kept it from sinking further 
into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians and business leaders have proposed opening public  
coffers even further, arguing that only a massive dose of 
government spending will ensure a full economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohara warned that the government should closely monitor rates on  
long-term government bonds for several months before making a 
decision on compiling a supplementary budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan would have to issue bonds to pay for an increase in public  
spending and that could flood the debt market and drive interest 
rates higher. Rising rates could exacerbate the already severe 
credit crunch in Japan and kill a recovery before it begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohara said it's too early to say how much money the government  
would need to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news, Japan's government aims to create  
600,000 jobs in temporary public service projects and by partially 
subsidizing hiring by private firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is part of a plan the ruling Liberal Democratic  
Party is expected to unveil Friday to replace jobs lost in a recent 
wave of corporate cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	The package would also contain legal reforms to encourage  
mergers and make it easier for companies to sell off parts of their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, central and local governments would hire  
300,000 people and subsidize the costs to companies of hiring about 
300,000 more, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper today. 
</P>
<P>
	Those hired by the government would be put to work as school  
guidance counselors, on ecological projects and even excavating and 
preserving historical artifacts, according to Japanese media 
reports.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Ships in S. Korea Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korean warships intruded into  
South Korean waters today and refused to immediately withdraw for 
the second time in two days, the Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	While South and North Korean naval vessels faced off throughout  
the day in the Yellow Sea, the ministry warned that the standoff 
could degenerate into an armed clash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The North Korean forces must immediately stop crossing the  
border,'' ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Cha Young-koo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides, however, appeared to be exercising restraint.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest standoff began when six North Korean navy ships  
entered South Korean waters off the west coast shortly after 
daybreak, six hours after withdrawing from the area. 
</P>
<P>
	One North Korean patrol boat was spotted crossing the western  
sea border and, within an hour, five more joined it in South Korean 
waters, ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's navy sent nine warships to the area, and one  
collided with a North Korean patrol boat as they maneuvered for 
position. The accident caused only slight damage to each ship and 
brought no exchange of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	One North Korean warship later withdrew. But the North rejected  
a proposal by the U.N. Command in Seoul that generals from both 
sides meet at the U.N. truce village of Panmunjom to discuss easing 
tensions, ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Korean navy ships appeared to be guarding fishing  
vessels from the North operating in the area, ministry officials 
said. The area is a rich crab fishing ground controlled by South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Seoul officials said North Korean navy ships have intruded into  
the area 20 to 30 times a year in the past, but usually withdrew 
when challenged by South Korean navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, six North Korean navy ships penetrated South Korean  
waters in the same area, creating an 11-hour armed standoff with 
eight South Korean navy boats. 
</P>
<P>
	After ignoring repeated South Korean warnings, the North Korean  
boats withdrew shortly before midnight. But they re-entered the 
area early today, ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The infiltration came after North Korea accused South Korea on  
Sunday of sending three warships into its territorial waters in the 
Yellow Sea. It warned of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	In radio broadcasts monitored in Seoul, North Korea said today  
that up to nine South Korean navy ships penetrated its waters three 
more times Monday and Tuesday and were chased out by its navy 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and  
the capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war, 
having signed no peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly 2  
million troops on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Jacobsen Named International Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sally Jacobsen, an economics and foreign affairs  
specialist, has been named international editor of The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Her deputy will be Nicolas B. Tatro, a veteran Middle East  
journalist who has been assigned to Beirut, Cairo, Tehran and now 
Jerusalem in a 20-year foreign service career. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments were announced Wednesday by Vice President and  
Executive Editor William Ahearn. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobsen, currently second in command of the AP's international  
news gathering, succeeds Thomas Kent, who was named a deputy 
managing editor of the news cooperative last month. She will be 
responsible for the work of AP writers and editors in more than 100 
bureaus outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobsen, 52, joined the AP in 1976 in Baltimore and covered  
banking in Washington before becoming AP's chief economics 
correspondent. She was a reporter in Mexico City from 1985 to 1988 
and for seven years reported from Brussels as correspondent for the 
European Union and NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	She held a Jefferson Fellowship for Asian studies at the  
East-West Center in Honolulu in 1996 and then joined the AP's 
Business News Department, specializing in international economic 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	A Colorado native, Jacobsen earned a bachelor's degree from Iowa  
State University and a master's from Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatro, 52, first went abroad for the AP in 1977, serving as  
chief Middle East correspondent based in Beirut, then as news 
editor in Cairo and chief of bureau in Tehran through 1983. He was 
bureau chief in Israel from 1983 to 1990 and returned to Jerusalem 
in 1993. In 1991, Tatro was a University of Michigan Journalism 
Fellow and later served two years in New York as deputy 
international editor. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Chicago and a graduate of the University of Florida,  
Tatro worked on The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun and the Daytona Beach 
News Journal before joining the AP in Miami in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Tatro transferred to New York, where he worked  
on the national and international editing desks.

<HEADLINE> Fisher To Step Down As Kodak CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- George Fisher, hailed as savior when he  
took charge at Eastman Kodak in 1993, will step down as chief 
executive at year-end, his vision of growth for the photo company 
spoiled by a film price war that's led to 20,000 job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, 58, the first outsider hired as CEO in Kodak history,  
will hand over the post to a veteran insider, company president Dan 
Carp, but remain chairman until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining Kodak, Fisher had built a reputation at  
Motorola for doing everything right, guiding that company to 
dominance in the computer-chip and cellular-telephone industries. 
His arrival at Kodak raised hopes that he might salvage a legendary 
company's blue-chip status without resorting to mass layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I emphasized growth from the start,'' Fisher said Wednesday.  
``I believe -- even more today -- there are great growth 
opportunities here and you cannot shrink your way to greatness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carp, 51, joined Kodak in 1970 and was named president and chief  
operating officer in 1997. He will retain those posts when he 
becomes CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only make progress if you set high expectations,'' Carp  
said. ``What I've learned from George is that whenever you think 
you've set them too high, it's about time to take them higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher described Carp as the ``co-architect of Kodak's strategic  
turnaround.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, Fisher has drawn praise for disposing of  
Kodak's healthcare and chemicals businesses, championing a new era 
of digital photography, and shaking up a stagnant corporate culture 
that stifled creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to steer clear of across-the board layoffs, instead  
trimming unit-by-unit, but changed his approach radically last year 
after Fuji caught Kodak off-guard by slashing film prices in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Kodak's is trying to cut $1.2 billion in costs and 19,900  
jobs, or about one-fifth of its payroll of 100,500, by the end of 
1999 -- the most severe cutbacks ever at Kodak, which was founded in 
1881. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the response to the change in command was  
initially positive, but Kodak's shares finished just 25 cents 
higher at $69.75 on Wednesday after rising as high as $70.43 3/4 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's clearly left Kodak better off, but I don't think as well  
off, to date, as one would have expected,'' said Jack Kelly, an 
analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``The jury is still out to some 
degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Fisher assured shareholders at their annual meeting  
that Kodak was climbing back to prosperity after two hard years of 
price wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, after dropping for eight consecutive quarters, rose 6  
percent in the first quarter to $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	However, retail surveys suggest that the price war for consumer  
film in the United States is intensifying again as the peak 
picture-taking season nears. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Barnard, a management professor at the Rochester Institute  
of Technology, said, ``Fisher hasn't been as in touch as he should 
be with the reality of Fuji and the fact that they just weren't 
going to fold up and creep quietly away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, Fisher shouldn't be faulted for deep cuts.  
``There was really an awful lot of dead wood in Kodak. ... Kodak 
had to change as they encountered competition, and the data is 
showing us that companies are doing better with fewer 
(employees).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher will be 60 when his work at Kodak ends.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty years old has seemed like -- even when I was at Motorola  
-- a good time to make such a transition to another stage of life,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While undecided about his plans, Fisher did not rule out running  
another company. ``I would like to be a student, I would like to be 
a teacher and I would like to stay in touch with business,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Man Sues To Annul His Adoption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- For 35 years, Michael Chalek was  
tormented with unfulfilled questions of his birth, his adoption and 
his true parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 47, he's condemned to know the answers.  
</P>
<P>
	Chalek discovered he was sold for $200 by a baby broker after  
his young mother was coerced into giving him up under an assumed 
name, according to state records recently unsealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his adoptive parents and the baby broker are all dead,  
Chalek hopes a lawsuit filed this week in Alachua County will right 
some wrongs: He's asking to annul his adoption and get a new birth 
certificate with his true mother's name. And she's supporting his 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``By me doing that, it's making a statement that ought to be  
made,'' said Chalek, who moved a few months ago from Boca Raton to 
Estes Park, Colo. ``I think the individuals involved in this ought 
to be exposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chalek was born Jan. 25, 1952, in Jacksonville to Winnie Faye  
Higginbotham Yarber, a barroom waitress who had separated from her 
husband and became pregnant by another man. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight days after the birth, records show the child -- then known  
as Baby Barnwell -- went home with Alex and Adela Chalek, who had 
contacted baby broker Lenora Fielding when they were not successful 
at having their own child. 
</P>
<P>
	Although private adoptions such as those set up by Mrs. Fielding  
were not legal, laws were not as strict then and such arrangements 
were largely ignored, said Josette P. Marquess, coordinator of the 
Florida Adoption Reunion Record. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 11, Michael Chalek found out he was adopted and he became  
obsessed with wanting to know about his birth family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It burned in my lower gut all the time,'' he said Tuesday. ``I  
always wondered every single day who I really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Chalek found a document that named the hospital where  
he was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen years later, a judge granted Chalek access to his  
confidential records -- something rarely done in Florida without a 
compelling medical need, Ms. Marquess said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the 100 pages were notes from state case workers that  
showed Mrs. Fielding coerced Chalek's birth mother into using a 
false name on documents and that his mother had even asked a state 
worker if she could get her baby back. 
</P>
<P>
	The mother -- now Winnie Faye Whitaker -- welcomed the telephone  
call this past December when Chalek finally found her. His birth 
father died sometime in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to give him up -- but I was so young,'' said Mrs.  
Whitaker, now 70. ``I asked if I could just get the baby back, and 
they told me no. I'd already signed the papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Whitaker said she supports Chalek's petition to have those  
papers annulled. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Mallory Horne, former Florida Senate president and  
House speaker who filed the petition on Chalek's behalf, said 
Chalek was angered by the fact his parents paid a baby broker for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Chalek had hoped to sue the attorney who brought his  
adoption to the court and the judge who approved it -- both now 
elderly men -- but she advised him he'd have no case. 
</P>
<P>
	Adoption annulments are extremely rare and most are sought by  
parents, said Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. 
Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York which studies adoption 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really an unbelievable set of circumstances,'' said  
Freundlich, adding that she's never heard of a new birth 
certificate being issued. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalek hopes his fight will pave the way for adoptees in similar  
situations. He has set up a Web site and he also is writing a book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have covered every inch in this,'' he said. ``I am going all  
out with this.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Discuss 21st-Century Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- More people will be shopping and working  
via the Internet in the 21st century, but fewer car trips to work 
and stores might not necessarily unclog the nation's roadways, a 
transportation planner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead, what you'll have is lots of trucks, vans, whatever,  
getting stuff from the wholesaler to the home,'' said Yossi Sheffi, 
director of the Center for Transportation Studies at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffi spoke to transportation experts from the academic world,  
as well as the auto industry and government transportation 
departments, at an MIT conference on traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	He said while it's possible more people working and shopping  
from home could ease traffic crunches, there also exists the 
possibility that people would be encouraged to move to more 
far-flung areas where cars are the only practical means of 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before an audience looking for predictions about what  
the world's transportation infrastructure might look like in the 
next 100 years, Sheffi said such flexible working and living 
environments could even give people the opportunity to make more 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally uncertain,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And if competing companies try to deliver goods to customers at  
the times they request, Internet shopping might do nothing to 
alleviate traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people want deliveries between 5 and 7 p.m.,'' Sheffi  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While delivery van drivers may make up an increased share of  
motorists in the 21st century, the world's rapidly aging population 
also means more elderly people will be behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Coughlin, a researcher at the Center for Transportation  
Studies, said car designs may have to change in the future to 
accommodate elderly drivers who have trouble getting in and out of 
high or tight spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said the minivan, the staple vehicle of baby boomers  
with children in the 1980s, may see some modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ever try to do that first step with your mother?''  
Coughlin asked. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that with more retired people on the road and more  
adult children giving rides to parents who are unable to drive, 
there could be increased traffic during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks will travel during off-peak hours,'' he predicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Sheffi called for market-based approaches to reducing traffic  
congestion, perhaps by using electronic devices in roads and cars 
to extract tolls from motorists as they drive around congested 
areas. The tolls could even be adjusted depending on the area, the 
time of day and how many other vehicles are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can price every yard of real estate on the pavement,'' he  
said. ``The technology is here. It's the political will to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Joshua Bell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Joshua Bell was 3 and living in  
Bloomington, Ind., he would string rubber bands on dresser-drawer 
pulls and play tunes that he heard his mother play on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 31, Bell is an acclaimed violinist who lives in New York.  
Each year, he performs more than 100 concerts, recitals and chamber 
music collaborations. He plays an Antonio Stradivari violin, dated 
1732. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for someone who started out playing rubber bands.  
</P>
<P>
	His parents chose the violin for Bell when he was 4. Playing it  
was like a game, he said. ``I did like the challenge of it.'' When 
he was 11, he started studying with Josef Gingold, renowned 
violinist and teacher. ``He was one of the reasons for my serious 
interest in music. It wasn't until then I started to love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 14, Bell won the Seventeen Magazine-General Motors  
competition. He created a sensation throughout the music world with 
his Philadelphia Orchestra debut that year, followed by his 
Carnegie Hall debut and an Avery Fisher career grant. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his latest projects is artistic consultant for ``The Red  
Violin,'' directed by Francois Girard, who made the acclaimed 
``Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new film traces the 300-year history of a violin known for  
its unusual reddish hue. It stars Carlo Cecchi, Jean-Luc Bideau, 
Greta Scacchi, Jason Flemyng, Sylvia Chang and, in a pivotal role, 
Samuel L. Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Violin'' is propelled by a score created by  
contemporary composer John Corigliano. The music unites the film's 
many vivid and unforgettable images to create a moving and magical 
story about the enduring relationship between life and art. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is a soloist on the soundtrack, released by Sony Classical,  
with the London Philharmonia conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gershwin Fantasy'' was Bell's first release for Sony  
Classical. A new CD, ``Short Trip Home,'' will be released this 
fall, with Bell, bassist Edgar Meyer and bluegrass musicians Sam 
Bush and Mike Marshall playing music composed by Meyer, an old 
friend of Bell's from Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	He also appears briefly in a concert scene in ``Fifty Violins,''  
a new film starring Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
	1. How did you get involved in ``The Red Violin''?  
</P>
<P>
	Bell: It was maybe four years ago that Francois Girard, the  
director, came to me, wanting me to play the music. He didn't know 
whether it would be a composer writing in styles of music over the 
centuries or using period music for the various times. It became 
clear that the best way would be to have a composer write. 
Corigliano was everybody's first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Did you play all the violin music?  
</P>
<P>
	Bell: Yes. The red violin had to have its own personality. The  
same person playing tied everything together. Christoph Koncz, as 
the child violinist, plays violin. I played his music, taking into 
account it was a child playing. He learned it very well and was 
able to synch it. He looked very realistic when he was playing. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Did you really play the red violin?  
</P>
<P>
	Bell: It was made for the movie. A shop in London made six of  
them, to look like the same instrument in various stages over the 
years. They were props in a way. I don't know what they did with 
them. They didn't give one to me. I never did play on it. All the 
sounds were made on my Strad, which was made in 1732. I first saw 
it at a dealer in Chicago. It took me years of looking. I loved it. 
It was sold to someone else. It was on loan to me for two years. 
Seven years ago, I finally bought it from the owner. I'm lucky to 
end up with it. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Are you seen in the movie?  
</P>
<P>
	Bell: I was the same height and similar build to Jason Flemyng,  
who played the virtuoso-composer Frederick Pope. I was able to 
dress up looking almost exactly like him, like a stuntman. You see 
me playing, but not my face, from a distance. There are close-up 
shots of my hands. Once, you see his face with my left hand around 
the violin and someone else's right hand using the bow. It looked 
like he was playing. It always looks silly when actors try to 
pretend they're playing the violin. The music was already recorded, 
fortunately. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Are people going to find a movie about a violin boring?  
</P>
<P>
	Bell: I don't think so. In one scene Greta Scacchi was dancing  
naked in front of Flemyng and the two of us who were playing the 
violin. He was supposed to be inspired to compose and play by 
sexual passion. There was one scene where people were listening 
outside his dressing room. I had to play in a way that sounded like 
he was trying to do two things at once.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Beats Pacers With Many 3's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Johnson didn't need a four-point play.  
A couple of 3s did just as much damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, whose 3-pointer and accompanying foul shot won Game 3  
for the New York Knicks, beat the Indiana Pacers from long range 
again Wednesday, hitting two 3-pointers in less than a minute late 
in the fourth quarter. The 3s gave the Knicks the cushion they 
needed, and the Pacers never recovered as New York won 101-94 and 
took a 3-2 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say it again, I still don't consider myself a 3-point  
shooter,'' Johnson said. ``But when I'm playing the three-spot and 
(Latrell Sprewell) and (Allan Houston) are getting doubled, I've 
got to get them in the net. I've got to keep the defense honest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 6, which could send the Knicks to the NBA Finals for the  
first time since 1994, is Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only three teams left and we're 3-2 going back  
home,'' Johnson said. ``This is a golden opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So were Johnson's long shots. With Johnson and Houston in foul  
trouble in the first half, the Knicks had a tough time keeping up 
with the Pacers, trailing by as much as 14. At halftime, Johnson 
had just two points in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks clawed their way back, taking an 83-80 lead on Chris  
Childs' layup with 4:17 left. Rik Smits, who'd barely been a factor 
all night, answered with a hook shot, giving the Pacers their first 
field goal in two minutes and some badly needed momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``After games, everyone talks about intensity,'' Knicks coach  
Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Sometimes it's about making shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Johnson. Someone must have forgotten to tell Johnson that  
it's some guy named Reggie Miller who's supposed to be hitting the 
big 3s in games between the Knicks and Pacers. After a timeout, 
with the Pacers swarming inside, Johnson hung back on the right 
baseline and just waited until Sprewell got enough room to feed him 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Catch.  
</P>
<P>
	Square up.  
</P>
<P>
	Shoot untouched from 23 feet.  
</P>
<P>
	Swish.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the same scenario 48 seconds later, only this time the  
shot was from 24 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big? That's an understatement. They were huge,'' Charlie Ward  
said. ``We can always count on Larry to give us the big shots. He's 
done it time and time again, and he knocked those shots down 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks took an 89-84 lead and, despite a 3-pointer from  
Miller with 1:59 left, Indiana didn't threaten again. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson finished with 17 points, including 6-of-8 from the  
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get the opportunity to play the first half, so I just  
wanted to come through for my teammates in the second half,'' 
Johnson said. ``Jeff said I should have fresh legs after sitting, 
and he was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Johnson insists he's not a 3-point threat, the Pacers  
should have known better than to leave him open deep. Or maybe 
they've blocked the horror finish of Game 3 from their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	With 5.7 seconds left, Johnson connected from 3-point range and  
was fouled by Antonio Davis. He converted on the extra point -- the 
first 4-point play of his career -- to give New York a 
come-from-behind 92-91 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say that after Game 3,'' Johnson said when asked if  
he was surprised he was open. ``But I wasn't surprised after Game 
4, when I went 1-for-7.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jazz pianist Oscar Peterson and choreographer  
Pina Bausch are among the five recipients of the 1999 Praemium 
Imperiale, considered Japan's Nobel prize for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The three others honored in a ceremony at Lincoln Center on

architect Fumihiko Maki. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say thank you not only on my behalf but on behalf of

Masahito Hitachi, governor of the Japan Art Association that awards 
$650,000 in annual prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Praemium Imperiale, created in 1988, will officially be

<HEADLINE> NCAA May Bar Freshmen Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Freshmen would be barred from playing basketball under a  
proposal being considered by a special NCAA panel, according to USA 
Today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, aimed at giving both men and woman players a year  
to become accustomed to campus life, is given a 50-50 chance of 
being endorsed, NCAA president Cedric Dempsey told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-member panel studying the proposal includes school  
presidents, athletic directors and retired North Carolina coach 
Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior college transfers and international players also would be  
barred from playing in their first year at school. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel has moved toward an initial draft of recommendations  
to be presented at a June 23 meeting in Chicago, USA Today said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less radical proposals also are being considered, including one  
which would keep freshmen from playing until Jan. 1 or a school's 
second semester. Another idea would expand scholarships to cover 
summer enrollment before a student's first full year at school. 
</P>
<P>
	A ban on freshmen players would likely discourage some top high  
school players from going to college, presumably trying instead to 
go right to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey conceded that could happen, but added, ``College isn't  
for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also is studying a proposal that would delay the  
start of the season more than a month until Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the group is looking into an idea that would tie  
scholarship limits to a school's graduation rate.

<HEADLINE> Adviser Leaves Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Yellen, head of President Clinton's  
Council of Economic Advisers for the past two years, is leaving the 
administration to return to college teaching. The leading candidate 
to succeed here is Martin Baily, a former member of the CEA. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen announced Tuesday that she is resigning for ``personal  
and family'' reasons and will return to teaching at the University 
of California, Berkeley, joining her husband, George Akerlof, also 
an economics professor at Bekeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen said that the reason she is leaving now is she did not  
want to subject her family to more cross-country commuting. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official said President Clinton had sought to  
nominate her as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve in an effort 
to keep her in government service, but Yellen declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said that Baily  
was the leading candidate to succeed Yellen. Baily served earlier 
in the administration as a member of the Council of Economic 
Advisers from 1995-96. He is currently a partner in McKinsey &AMP; Co., 
a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement citing Yellen's valued economic advice, Clinton  
praised her for contributing ``enormously to the formation of my 
administration's policies in critical areas ranging from Social 
Security, health care and the budget to trade and international 
financial architecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Rivlin, the Fed's current vice chairwoman, said last week  
she will leave the central bank next month after three years in 
order to devote more time to her duties as head of the District of 
Columbia financial control board. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has taken a year to fill another vacancy on  
the seven-member Federal Reserve board, but National Economic 
Council Director Gene Sperling said Tuesday that the search for 
Rivlin's replacement is ``well along. We are down to a very short 
list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen's and Rivlin's announcements followed the resignation  
announcement last month of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who is 
scheduled to leave in early July. Clinton has nominated Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to replace Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen said she has not set a firm departure date because of her  
desire for a smooth transition. She has headed the three-member 
Council of Economic Advisers since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, her appointment was seen as an administration  
effort to foster closer ties with the Fed, where Yellen was serving 
when Clinton chose her for the council. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen was among Clinton's first two appointees to the Fed.  
Before joining the central bank, she was an economics professor at 
Berkeley, where she plans to rejoin the faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellen was Clinton's third council chief, after Laura Tyson,  
another Berkeley professor, and Joseph Stiglitz. Tyson has returned 
to Berkeley as dean of the business school, and Stiglitz is chief 
economist at the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has nominated Harvard professor Robert Lawrence to fill  
another vacancy, but the Senate has not confirmed him. Rebecca 
Blank is the third member of the CEA.

<HEADLINE> Olympics for NHL? Answer by Sept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The NHL is still trying to decide whether it  
should go back to the Olympics. At least now the league has a 
deadline for reaching a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IIHF (International Ice Hockey Federation) has told us  
that they are going to need a decision for their constituents from 
us by Sept. 15,'' commissioner Gary Bettman said during a news 
conference Wednesday as part of the Stanley Cup finals. ``So that 
is the timetable we are on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to add from a substantive basis as to  
where we stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL played in the Olympics for the first time last year at  
Nagano, interrupting its season for the first time in its history 
for such activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman touched on a variety of other topics during his  
state-of-the-NHL conference usually held a couple of times a year 
during such high-profile events as the Cup finals and the All-Star 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
	Included was the two-referee system currently being used for the  
first time in the playoffs, the controversial man-in-the-crease 
rule, and the minor-league experiment of using four skaters in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-referee system was used on a selective basis during the  
regular NHL season and full-time in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two referees, we believe, was an unqualified success in the  
270 regular-season games in which we used the system and during the 
playoffs,'' Bettman said. ``The comments, the feedback, that we 
have gotten was overwhelmingingly positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next season we are anticipating using two referees for about  
700 games, which would continue to phase in (the system) and by the 
following year, we think it may be all the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL, meanwhile, might be phasing out the man-in-the-crease  
rule, or at least looking to change it in some way. The rule 
disallows a goal if an offensive player has any part of his body in 
the goalie crease. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the replay of some of the goals we have been  
disallowing, we have been taking away some very skillful plays and 
disallowed (goals) because of things that are going on the ice that 
are purely incidental and had nothing to do with the play,'' 
Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman was also worried about the game losing some of its  
spontaniety when play is stopped for a video review of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my only personal standpoint, I have a real question about  
relying on replay too much and taking some of the energy and some 
of the excitement out of the building when a goal is scored and 
people are worried about whether or not they can cheer because they 
don't know if it's a goal because there was a toe in the crease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman also said he was ``intrigued very much by the results  
that we saw in the AHL'' in the use of four skaters instead of five 
in overtime to open up the ice and perhaps bring an easier 
resolution to games during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something we should look at,'' Bettman said. ``It's a  
little bit harder to trap and use the left-wing lock when you are 
playing four-on-four. The feedback we have gotten from the AHL 
coaches, general managers, owners, fans, was that it was exciting 
and they thought it was terrific. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been looking at our own overtime to see whether or not  
it is a prudent investment of our players' time and energy, and 
that is something that we should continue to look at.''

<HEADLINE> Mudochs Reach Divorce Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and his  
wife, Anna, have divorced, ending their 32-year marriage in a 
settlement that leaves Murdoch in control of his global media 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the settlement were not disclosed, but in a joint  
statement the couple described the agreement as amicable. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Murdoch, 54, filed for divorce last July in Los Angeles,  
raising questions about whether Murdoch's control of News Corp. 
might be threatened under California's joint property laws. The 
settlement, completed Tuesday, appeared to put to rest those 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Murdoch family ownership and the management of News Corp.  
will not be affected,'' the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch, 68, controls 30.1 percent of News Corp., the  
international media conglomerate that includes the 20th Century Fox 
movie studio, Fox TV, the Los Angeles Dodgers, major newspapers in 
the United States, England and Australia and satellite TV networks 
on several continents. 
</P>
<P>
	His net worth was estimated by Forbes magazine last year at $5.6  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Murdoch was Murdoch's second wife. The couple met when she  
served as an apprentice reporter at the Daily Mirror in Sydney, 
Australia, and were married in April 1967.

<HEADLINE> Bettman: NHL in State of Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky is retired. So is Mario Lemieux. TV  
viewership and revenues are a fraction of the NFL's. One team is in 
bankruptcy, another has no money. Of every dollar made by owners, 
$1.33 is spent on salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the world of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, one where  
bankruptcy judges and bottom lines cause as much anxiety as 
watching the last four Stanley Cup finals end abruptly in four-game 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	As football, baseball and basketball thrive with exciting home  
run races and unpredictable playoffs and survive labor disputes and 
Michael Jordan's retirement, the state of the NHL is one of 
transition and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	And worry.  
</P>
<P>
	Network TV revenues will jump appreciably next season under a  
new contract with ABC and ESPN, but NHL teams still will earn only 
6 percent of what a single NFL franchise makes from TV. That's 
understandable; hockey's most-watched games attract an audience 
less than one-tenth the size of the viewership for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest-rated NHL game was the 1996 All-Star game, getting a  
4.1 rating. That's about half of what the World Wrestling 
Federation matches draw on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great game,'' Bettman said. ``We just have to get  
more people to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, even as it is expanding to Atlanta, Columbus and Minnesota  
to bring its league to 30 franchises by the 2000-01 season, the NHL 
is preoccupied with keeping afloat the Pittsburgh Penguins and the 
New York Islanders, teams that have won a combined six Stanley 
Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are operating under federal bankruptcy protection,  
the first major U.S. pro sports team to do so since the Penguins 
themselves a quarter-century ago. The franchise's fate likely will 
be decided June 24, when a group led by Hall of Famer Lemieux could 
have its takeover plan approved by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders, looking for new ownership and a new arena, have  
cut their payroll so drastically that only one star, Zigmund 
Palffy, remains, and even he is on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
	So many problems. So much work for hockey to do. So few  
recognizable stars to promote, especially now that Gretzky and 
Lemieux have joined Jordan in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Think selling Michael Peca as a household name is easy?  
</P>
<P>
	``But Rocket Richard retired and the game went on, and Gordie  
Howe retired and the game went on,'' Bettman said. ``The game will 
go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman's game plan for a prosperous NHL:  
</P>
<P>
	--Continue to increase revenues, which have jumped by $500  
million in five years, by moving into even more new 
money-generating arenas and stimulating interest in hockey 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Slow skyrocketing salaries with judicious personnel decisions  
and, ultimately, through a new collective bargaining agreement, 
even though the current deal doesn't end until the 2003-04 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revenues in the last five years have increased at a phenomenal  
rate but, having said that, players' salaries for the last two 
years have grown faster than our growth in revenues,'' Bettman said 
Wednesday. ``In the final analysis, that is not going to continue 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Promote, promote, promote to build a younger and broader fan  
base. Not with glowing hockey pucks or Zamboni races, but by 
enticing fans to watch the game in person, where it much better 
appreciated than on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Correcting hockey's myriad problems won't be easy, especially  
since the game remains indigenous to the sparsely populated plains 
and provinces of Canada, not to the Sun Belt cities where the sport 
has migrated. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as always, it comes down to money. Always, money.  
</P>
<P>
	Because its national TV ratings and, subsequently, its national  
TV revenues are so much lower than football, baseball or 
basketball, hockey spends a disproportionate amount of its revenues 
on salaries -- approximately 72 percent, or 9 percentage points more 
than any other sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek's $8 million salary, for  
example, rivals that of Mark McGwire. But McGwire's St. Louis 
Cardinals play twice as many games before twice as many fans and 
make five times as much in national TV income as Hasek's Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	And what is the more magical number: Hasek's .939 playoff save  
percentage or McGwire's 70 home runs? 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we are paying 133 percent of our gate receipts to  
the players,'' Boston Bruins general manager Harry Sinden said at a 
recent Board of Governors' meeting. ``Take every single ticket that 
is sold across the league, and we've got to find 33 percent more 
just to pay them. Just them! We've got problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Penguins bankruptcy hearing last week, NHL general counsel  
William Daly estimated that 20 of the NHL's 28 teams are losing 
money. The figure is questionable because it does not count arena 
revenues that some teams control, but the general consensus around 
the league is that at least half the franchises aren't profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Montreal Canadiens, who are to hockey what the Yankees  
are to baseball, caused a ripple of disbelief in Canada by 
revealing they lost $3.8 million at the same time they moved into a 
new arena this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tampa Bay, Art Williams became so disenchanted with the sport  
so quickly that he agreed to sell the Lightning midway through his 
first season of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing money is one thing but, as Kings president Tim Leiweke  
said, ``If the league keeps going in this direction, it's going to 
be losing franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may come as soon as this month if Lemieux's buyout plan in  
Pittsburgh is disapproved, though that does not appear likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we have teams losing money,'' Bettman  
said. ``Even if it were one team, it would be too many. The worst 
case is it is a four- or five-year phenomenon. The best case is it 
will start correcting itself sooner. It isn't going to be a 
long-term problem because it is going to get fixed.''

<HEADLINE> ID Endorsed in R-Rated Movie Rental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A leading home video organization endorsed President Clinton's  
plan to require teens to show photo ID to see R-rated movies, but 
rental store operators were divided Wednesday over whether the 
get-tough policy is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Video Software Dealers Association is asking members to  
``actively check IDs'' and will provide stores with posters 
explaining the rating system for both movies and video games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraging people to enforce it strongly,'' said Kelli  
Clayton, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles-based organization, which 
represents the home entertainment industry. She said most video 
stores already let parents restrict accounts so children cannot 
rent R-rated movies without permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Theater Owners, which represents  
about two-thirds of the nation's movie screens, adopted the photo 
ID plan Tuesday during a White House ceremony with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Video store operators, who are not bound by the VSDA's  
endorsement, had mixed reactions to applying the rules to their 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Court Attinger, owner of Videophile Inc. in Seattle, said he  
didn't think making video stores police children would work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be the arbiter of morals,'' Attinger said.  
``Personally, I'm of the opinion that it's too late. The barn door 
has been open too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Nighbert, manager at Tower Records-Video in New York City,  
said he favors requiring a photo ID for young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make a rule that says kids of a certain age aren't  
allowed to see a film, it's only right to enforce it,'' Nighbert 
said. He said, however, that the responsibility for shielding 
children from inappropriate material should lie with parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had parents send their kids in to pick up X-rated  
movies,'' Nighbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Blockbuster, the country's largest video chain, staff members  
are trained to ask for ID if parents have said they don't want 
children checking out R-rated videos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not telling you it happens every time. Mistakes are  
made,'' said spokeswoman Stephanie Cota. ``But that's our policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many teens said the new rules won't stop children from seeing  
R-rated movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Brown, 17, of Detroit said he'd never had trouble renting  
an R-rated film. He said that even if kids can't see R-rated movies 
in theaters or on videos, ``it's going to be on cable.''

<HEADLINE> Importer Pleads in Swordfish Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A fish importer has pleaded guilty to fraud for  
passing off nearly $6 million worth of swordfish as whitefish to 
get around screenings for a poisonous chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-based Kenbourne International and its freight forwarder,  
Fresh Cargo Handling Co., were charged with two felonies for 
telling its supplier to mislabel all its swordfish shipments in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The two pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court.	   Whitefish such as halibut, carp, flounder and sea bass don't  
undergo the rigid screening for methyl-mercury that the Food and 
Drug Administration requires of swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing fish samples takes time, stalling shipments and forcing  
importers to freeze their fish. The fish in question was sold 
without having been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they will recommend to a judge that the two  
companies serve a four-year probation and pay a $650,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> WNBA's Starzz Release Reiss, Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Starzz finalized their 1999  
roster Wednesday by releasing guards Tammi Reiss and Dena Head, two 
original team members who were the latest casualties of the 
franchise's rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiss' departure, while not unexpected, is a benchmark move for  
the team. Reiss, one of Utah's first draft choices in 1997 and a 
former team captain, was a signature player in advertising 
campaigns by the Starzz and the WNBA the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	An aspiring actress and television commentator with a magnetic  
personality, Reiss, 29, was the Starzz's most popular player among 
fans. But her performance on the court never matched her visibility 
off it. 
</P>
<P>
	She averaged 6.5 points per game while shooting 40.3 percent  
last year, and her 2.2 assists per game weren't nearly what the 
Starzz wanted from their starting point guard. Reiss' job was put 
in further jeopardy when Utah drafted former ABL Defensive Player 
of the Year Debbie Black last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the hardest part of the job to cut players, because you  
get to know them very well,'' Starzz coach Frank Layden said. 
``You're asking for their loyalty, and then when the pressure is 
on, you seem to be letting them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden worked with Reiss during Utah Jazz television broadcasts  
in which Layden was a studio host and Reiss a roving reporter. He 
expressed hope the Jazz-Starzz organization would find another 
capacity in which to use Reiss. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's great at it. I predict that if you're interested in  
keeping Tammi, we better sign her up, because I think Tammi will be 
headed for ESPN or NBC,'' Layden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiss was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Black, who at 5-foot-2 is the shortest player in the league, was  
a two-time ABL all-star and is expected to be one of the WNBA's top 
defensive players. Black will be backed up by fourth-round draft 
pick Dalma Ivanyi, a Hungarian national who led the NCAA in assists 
last season at Florida International, and Tricia Bader. 
</P>
<P>
	Head's role with Utah declined steadily last year. She was one  
of just three Starzz to play in all 30 games, but she averaged just 
3.6 points and 1.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's the end for them,'' said Layden, noting the  
WNBA's plans to expand to four new cities in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz will open the season with two players from last  
year's team on the injured reserve. Forward Olympia 
Scott-Richardson gave birth to her first child just six weeks ago, 
while talented but oft-injured guard Chantel Tremitiere has a 
slight hamstring tear. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of Utah's roster looks strong -- and markedly different  
from last year's motley collection. It has a distinctly 
international flavor, with four Europeans making the final cut for 
the 11 roster spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah will be led by 7-foot-2 center Margo Dydek, who was named  
the Most Valuable Player of the recently completed European 
Championships while leading Poland to the title. Dydek's 
countrywoman, rookie point guard Krystyna Lara, also made the 
Starzz roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Dydek formed a friendship with Reiss last season and was  
surprised to hear the guard had been released. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always bad to know somebody that got cut,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Russian forward Elena Baranova is back for her third year with  
the team, as is two-time team scoring leader Wendy Palmer, who 
played in Turkey during the winter. Forward LaTonya Johnson and 
Bader are the only other returnees from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of the Starzz's 1999 draft picks made the team,  
including former ABL MVP and Utah native Natalie Williams and 
forward Adrienne Goodson. Free agent Michelle Campbell, a 6-foot-5 
forward who played for Starzz assistant coach Fred Williams at 
Southern California, also survived training camp.

<HEADLINE>  NATO: Early Sign of Serb Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Yugoslav and NATO generals held  
marathon talks at a French garrison on a plan to end 11 weeks of 
airstrikes. The allies reported initial signs of a withdrawal while 
Germany said NATO virtually halted the bombing of Yugoslavia today. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's ``de facto suspension of attacks since 9 a.m. (3 a.m.  
EDT) today'' was meant as a signal to the Serbs, German Defense 
Minister Rudolf Scharping said at a news conference in Bonn, 
Germany, as Western powers and Russia continued negotiations over 
ending the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, however, spokesman  
Jamie Shea said at about the same time that the bombing campaign 
hadn't halted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Air operations continue,'' Shea said. ``Nobody has taken any  
decision to suspend them or end them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the state-run Tanjug news agency announced a Serb  
police unit that had been fighting ``terrorists'' in Kosovo 
returned to its base today in central Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug gave no figure for the number of police who it said  
returned to Jagodina, and it was unclear whether this was a first 
step in the ``substantial'' withdrawal that NATO has demanded 
before it halts the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea also spoke of early indications of Serb preparations for  
withdrawal but added: ``I think we have to be cautious about 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Yugoslavia said it was withdrawing some forces but  
NATO brushed aside the announcement as being far from sufficient to 
meet Western terms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO commander, detailed early  
indications of Serb troop movement, a ``change of Serb military 
activities in the northern and central part of Kosovo we do 
interpret as preparatory signs of withdrawal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He reported heavy artillery fire, ``often used by ground troops  
to assist in breaking contact with close-in enemy forces. With the 
assistance of artillery, one can discourage opposing forces from 
closing in. This could also very well be another sign for 
preparation of withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity after the  
two sides had met along the Macedonia border for nearly 10 hours, 
expressed ``cautious optimism'' that an agreement would be 
concluded later today between British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson and 
the Yugoslavs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the official said issues raised in the talks must be  
referred to ``the halls of power'' for approval. He did not 
elaborate, but the remark suggested that President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government was seeking substantive changes in an 
agreement it said it accepted last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the major stumbling blocks were the timing of  
the Yugoslav withdrawal from Kosovo and the sequence of events 
surrounding it -- including the timing of an end to the NATO bombing 
campaign and U.N. Security Council approval of the peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks recessed after daybreak for internal consultations, and  
key members of the Yugoslav delegation crossed back into Serbia to 
receive instructions. The negotiations resumed by early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug reported daylight NATO airstrikes today in southwestern  
and southern Kosovo, meanwhile, but said there were no overnight 
attacks on Belgrade, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said over the past 24 hours that NATO aircraft flew 523 air  
missions, including 130 strike sorties and 56 aimed at degrading 
the Yugoslav air defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	That bombing was less intense than over the past two days, when  
NATO had stepped up its air campaign after a first round of talks 
between alliance and Yugoslav military commanders stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 civilians have been killed and 5,000 wounded  
since the NATO air raids started March 24, Tanjug reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China insist that NATO formally end the bombing  
before they will approve the peacekeeping force within the Security 
Council. NATO is willing to suspend its air campaign but wants to 
see a ``substantial'' withdrawal first. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has disagreed with the Yugoslavs on how many Serbs could  
remain in Kosovo. The allies want all Serb police, soldiers and 
paramilitary militias -- an estimated 40,000 are in Kosovo -- to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, ``hundreds, not thousands'' could return to guard  
religious sites and clear minefields in Kosovo, NATO has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo, the southernmost province of Serbia, had a prewar  
population of 2.1 million that was 90 percent ethnic Albanian. An 
estimated 860,000 refugees have fled Kosovo since March, most of 
them crossing into Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-month Yugoslav crackdown on ethnic Albanians preceded  
NATO's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks at this military garrison near the Kosovo border began  
late Tuesday after the Group of Eight -- Russia, the United States 
and six other leading democracies -- agreed on the text of a Kosovo 
peace plan to be sent to the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 authorized a text calling for a peacekeeping force for  
Kosovo with ``substantial'' NATO participation. Under the plan, 
NATO would suspend the bombing once it verified that a substantial 
Yugoslav troop withdrawal was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	That would pave the way for the Security Council to approve the  
peace plan and allow 50,000 international peacekeepers to move into 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S.  
intelligence had detected signs that Serb forces were preparing to 
withdraw from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon, however, also said the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army  
rebels were pinned down by Yugoslav forces near the Morini crossing 
point, where hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees have 
fled into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Jertz, meanwhile, detailed ``credible reports that looting in  
Pristina and in the area is still ongoing, taking windows and doors 
off houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have experience of those actions in Bosnia where we  
observed that immediately prior to departure of forces, these 
forces literally steal whatever they can. There's also evidence of 
home burnings in central Kosovo. This also could very well be a 
final message in their wake.''

<HEADLINE>  NATO: Early Sign of Serb Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Yugoslav and NATO generals held  
marathon talks at a French garrison on a plan to end 11 weeks of 
airstrikes. The allies reported initial signs of a withdrawal while 
Germany said NATO virtually halted the bombing of Yugoslavia today. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's ``de facto suspension of attacks since 9 a.m. (3 a.m.  
EDT) today'' was meant as a signal to the Serbs, German Defense 
Minister Rudolf Scharping said at a news conference in Bonn, 
Germany, as Western powers and Russia continued negotiations over 
ending the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, however, spokesman  
Jamie Shea said at about the same time that the bombing campaign 
hadn't halted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Air operations continue,'' Shea said. ``Nobody has taken any  
decision to suspend them or end them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, the state-run Tanjug news agency announced a Serb  
police unit that had been fighting ``terrorists'' in Kosovo 
returned to its base today in central Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug gave no figure for the number of police who it said  
returned to Jagodina, and it was unclear whether this was a first 
step in the ``substantial'' withdrawal that NATO has demanded 
before it halts the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea also spoke of early indications of Serb preparations for  
withdrawal but added: ``I think we have to be cautious about 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Yugoslavia said it was withdrawing some forces but  
NATO brushed aside the announcement as being far from sufficient to 
meet Western terms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO commander, detailed early  
indications of Serb troop movement, a ``change of Serb military 
activities in the northern and central part of Kosovo we do 
interpret as preparatory signs of withdrawal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He reported heavy artillery fire, ``often used by ground troops  
to assist in breaking contact with close-in enemy forces. With the 
assistance of artillery, one can discourage opposing forces from 
closing in. This could also very well be another sign for 
preparation of withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity after the  
two sides had met along the Macedonia border for nearly 10 hours, 
expressed ``cautious optimism'' that an agreement would be 
concluded later today between British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson and 
the Yugoslavs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the official said issues raised in the talks must be  
referred to ``the halls of power'' for approval. He did not 
elaborate, but the remark suggested that President Slobodan 
Milosevic's government was seeking substantive changes in an 
agreement it said it accepted last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the major stumbling blocks were the timing of  
the Yugoslav withdrawal from Kosovo and the sequence of events 
surrounding it -- including the timing of an end to the NATO bombing 
campaign and U.N. Security Council approval of the peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks recessed after daybreak for internal consultations, and  
key members of the Yugoslav delegation crossed back into Serbia to 
receive instructions. The negotiations resumed by early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug reported daylight NATO airstrikes today in southwestern  
and southern Kosovo, meanwhile, but said there were no overnight 
attacks on Belgrade, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said over the past 24 hours that NATO aircraft flew 523 air  
missions, including 130 strike sorties and 56 aimed at degrading 
the Yugoslav air defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	That bombing was less intense than over the past two days, when  
NATO had stepped up its air campaign after a first round of talks 
between alliance and Yugoslav military commanders stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 civilians have been killed and 5,000 wounded  
since the NATO air raids started March 24, Tanjug reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China insist that NATO formally end the bombing  
before they will approve the peacekeeping force within the Security 
Council. NATO is willing to suspend its air campaign but wants to 
see a ``substantial'' withdrawal first. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has disagreed with the Yugoslavs on how many Serbs could  
remain in Kosovo. The allies want all Serb police, soldiers and 
paramilitary militias -- an estimated 40,000 are in Kosovo -- to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, ``hundreds, not thousands'' could return to guard  
religious sites and clear minefields in Kosovo, NATO has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo, the southernmost province of Serbia, had a prewar  
population of 2.1 million that was 90 percent ethnic Albanian. An 
estimated 860,000 refugees have fled Kosovo since March, most of 
them crossing into Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-month Yugoslav crackdown on ethnic Albanians preceded  
NATO's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks at this military garrison near the Kosovo border began  
late Tuesday after the Group of Eight -- Russia, the United States 
and six other leading democracies -- agreed on the text of a Kosovo 
peace plan to be sent to the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 authorized a text calling for a peacekeeping force for  
Kosovo with ``substantial'' NATO participation. Under the plan, 
NATO would suspend the bombing once it verified that a substantial 
Yugoslav troop withdrawal was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	That would pave the way for the Security Council to approve the  
peace plan and allow 50,000 international peacekeepers to move into 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S.  
intelligence had detected signs that Serb forces were preparing to 
withdraw from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon, however, also said the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army  
rebels were pinned down by Yugoslav forces near the Morini crossing 
point, where hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees have 
fled into Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Jertz, meanwhile, detailed ``credible reports that looting in  
Pristina and in the area is still ongoing, taking windows and doors 
off houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have experience of those actions in Bosnia where we  
observed that immediately prior to departure of forces, these 
forces literally steal whatever they can. There's also evidence of 
home burnings in central Kosovo. This also could very well be a 
final message in their wake.''

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Mourn Singer Mel Torme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Musicians played a selection of his songs as  
family and friends remembered the life and talent of velvet-voiced 
Mel Torme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never met anyone in my life who was as excited about  
anything as much as he was about everything,'' actor Harry Anderson 
said before Tuesday's service in a small chapel at Pierce Brothers 
Westwood Village Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, whose character on the old TV series ``Night Court''  
was an obsessive fan of Torme, said Torme ``will be remembered as 
one of those people who didn't get by on anything but talent and 
style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the nearly 200 mourners were comedian Mel Brooks, science  
fiction author Harlan Ellison, actor Cliff Robertson and 
entertainer Nancy Sinatra, who broke down in tears at Torme's 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme, whose career ranged from co-writing ``The Christmas  
Song'' to a series of memorable jazz albums, died Saturday at age 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Torme's children -- Steve, Melissa, Tracy, Daisy and James --  
remembered their father as a big kid who loved chocolate, toy 
trains, race cars and Western movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad and I were both just 12-year-olds in older bodies,''  
said Steve March Torme. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy founder Hugh Hefner recalled that he and Torme watched  
old movies together every Monday night at the Playboy Mansion. It 
was the singer's only regular outing after a debilitating stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he asked for dessert against the doctor's orders, I said  
that's what passed for sin these days at the Playboy Mansion,'' 
Hefner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Charlton Heston, another longtime friend, did not attend  
the memorial, but his recorded eulogy was played. ``I'm pleased to 
think that where he is now, he's teaching the angels how to sing,'' 
Heston said. 
</P>
<P>
	A recording of Torme singing ``Stardust'' ended the service.  
</P>
<P>
	The tree-lined cemetery where Torme was interred is also the  
final resting place for such stars as Marilyn Monroe, John 
Cassavetes and Eva Gabor.

<HEADLINE> Dr.: Lewis Admitted Using Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Cocaine always promised to be a gripping topic in  
the malpractice case stemming from the 1993 death of Boston Celtics 
captain Reggie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, six weeks into the trial of three doctors accused of  
misdiagnosing and mistreating the NBA All-Star, it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the respected cardiologist who publicly said  
Lewis suffered from a benign fainting condition months before the 
player collapsed and died of a cardiac arrhythmia, told the jury 
about the day he says Lewis stopped denying cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	It was July 12, 1993, and the two were sitting in Lewis' car,  
parked outside Brandeis University's gym, where inside the Celtics 
were holding their annual rookie camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, who felt drugs would explain an abnormality in Lewis'  
heart, was looking over medical records with the player and asked, 
``Have you ever taken cocaine in the past?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis changed the subject, Mudge said, so he asked again.  
</P>
<P>
	Before Lewis could answer, there was a knock on the car window.  
</P>
<P>
	``A small boy asked, `Are you Carl Lewis?' and passed him a  
playing card,'' Mudge testified, flashing a rare smile. After Lewis 
gave the child an autograph he turned to his doctor and friend and 
joked, ``You've seen one Lewis, you've seen 'em all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Mudge reminded Lewis he still hadn't answered the question.  
</P>
<P>
	``He nodded his head and said, `Yes,''' Mudge testified.  
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, Lewis died at 27 while shooting baskets.  
</P>
<P>
	The story, detailed during a day of testimony in his own  
defense, cut to an issue that has sparked controversy since rumors 
started swirling after Lewis' death. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, sued Mudge and two of his  
consultants, Drs. Peter Friedman and Mark Creager, claiming they 
misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband. A third consultant settled 
the case for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who is suing for the millions Lewis could have  
earned -- estimated as high as $117 million -- rejected a $5 million 
offer to settle the case last week, a legal source said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. Lawyers for both Harris-Lewis and Mudge 
today vehemently denied there had been a settlement offer of any 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has claimed Lewis' alleged late admission of drug use made  
an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``By not knowing he was on cocaine, we deprived many of our  
consultants of valuable information,'' he said, referring to the 
more than half-dozen doctors from Boston to Los Angeles who helped 
evaluate Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis vehemently denies her husband ever used drugs and  
tried unsuccessfully to get any related testimony excluded from 
trial. Her lawyers have suggested the claims are simply intended to 
smear the reputation of a local hero and divert attention from 
Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months before Lewis died, Mudge had announced Lewis suffered  
from a neurological condition that causes fainting spells and 
predicted Lewis would play professional basketball again. 
</P>
<P>
	The publicly announced finding went against an earlier diagnosis  
by a team of top doctors who said Lewis had a life-threatening 
arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeat. That initial hospitalization was 
prompted by Lewis' collapse during a playoff game in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand Tuesday, however, Mudge conceded he also suspected  
Lewis had a heart problem but only told the media about the 
less-serious problem out of concern for the Lewises' privacy. But 
he maintained he was also pursuing the cardiac ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge took the stand again today under cross-examination by  
Harris-Lewis' attorney, denying he had removed any hospital records 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge testified earlier in the trial, when Harris-Lewis'  
attorney called him as a hostile witness and tried to portray him 
as a physician whose desire to be a hero to the Lewises, the 
Celtics and thousands of fans led to negligent care. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, under questioning by his attorney, William  
Dailey Jr., Mudge tried to convince the jury that his treatment of 
Lewis was thorough and appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's defense has rested on three principles: He suspected  
Lewis had a heart problem and was trying to treat it, Lewis lied 
about drug use, and Lewis ignored orders not to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, head of the cardiac transplant unit at Brigham and  
Women's Hospital, said he told Lewis they would have to meet again 
to discuss a future treatment regimen in light of the cocaine 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
	That meeting, he testified, was scheduled for July 28 -- the day  
after Lewis died.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Doctor on the Defensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The cardiologist accused of misdiagnosing Boston  
Celtics captain Reggie Lewis' fatal heart condition was on the 
defensive Wednesday as a lawyer suggested the doctor had done 
everything from tampering with hospital records to lying on the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	The daylong barrage came during cross-examination of Dr. Gilbert  
Mudge in the malpractice trial stemming from the NBA all-star's 
death in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge is the main defendant in the suit brought by Lewis' widow,  
which also names consultants Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman. 
A third consultant settled the case for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the insinuations Wednesday of plaintiff's lawyer Robert  
Harley were that several of the conversations Mudge contends are 
critical to his defense happened between the cardiologist and 
people who are now dead, allowing him to fabricate. 
</P>
<P>
	The most dramatic example is the discussion Mudge said he had  
with Lewis two weeks before his death in which Lewis allegedly 
admitted he had used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone is accused of using drugs (in the past), it's very  
hard for them to prove they didn't. ... And if that person is dead, 
it's even harder, isn't it?'' Harley asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps,'' replied Mudge, 54, who contended in court Tuesday  
he had suspected that cocaine might be responsible for a potential 
heart problem from the day he met Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in public, despite an earlier diagnosis by a team of doctors  
who said Lewis had a life-threatening arrhythmia after he collapsed 
during a playoff game, Mudge said during a May 1993 news conference 
that Lewis' heart was normal and that he suffered from a 
neurological condition that causes fainting spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Lewis died of an arrhythmia, or abnormal heart  
rhythm, while practicing. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge says the late admission by Lewis made an accurate  
diagnosis impossible. But he testified Wednesday that even after 
the alleged admission of drug use, he did not feel Lewis was in 
danger and didn't change his treatment plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, it did not change my opinion,'' Mudge said,  
adding that Lewis already had been prescribed medication that would 
treat a possible heart problem, cocaine-related or not. ``I wanted 
to re-evaluate him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has maintained that though he told the public about the  
neurological ailment, in private he was pursuing the possibility 
Lewis had a heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Harley questioned that contention, accusing Mudge of removing a  
standard discharge form from Lewis' hospital file. Mudge said he 
never filled out the form, but Harley suggested Mudge was hiding 
the document because it would show that he had conclusively 
diagnosed Lewis with the fainting condition.

<HEADLINE> Hearings Focus on Retirement System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers struggled Wednesday on both sides of  
the Capitol to overcome obstacles to changes aimed at ensuring the 
long-term future of America's government retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate hearings in the House and Senate focused on whether  
Medicare and Social Security can handle the retirement of the big 
baby boom generation in the coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and members of both parties in Congress say  
they want to overhaul both programs using projected budget 
surpluses, but agreement is elusive amid the political jockeying 
for control of the House in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said that ``some believe it would  
be to the benefit of Democrats if we ignored Social Security and 
blame the Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know most Democrats don't feel this way,'' said Rangel,  
senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. ``We have 
plenty of other issues with which to demonstrate our differences 
with Republicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said much the same thing  
in a letter to committee members: ``I truly believe that through 
hard work and a strong commitment, on both sides of the aisle and 
at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, consensus is possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although lawmakers are also impatient to move ahead with  
Medicare changes, the Senate Finance Committee is confronting 
complaints about budget cuts set in motion by Congress two years 
ago, as part of the 1997 balanced budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, lawmakers agreed to trim $115 billion from  
Medicare's spending over five years -- mainly from payments to 
health care providers 
</P>
<P>
	Now, medical industry groups -- from health plans and hospitals  
to nursing homes and physical therapists -- along with some patient 
advocates, say the cuts were too deep and are lobbying hard to get 
some money back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said those issues are the ``first order  
of business'' this year and suggested they could get in the way of 
other action on Medicare -- including consideration of a proposal by 
Clinton to add new prescription drug benefits to the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers consider greater participation by private health  
plans in Medicare among the best prospects for saving the program 
money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	But Medicare officials told senators they are expecting more  
closings among private health maintenance organizations -- known as 
HMOs -- that already serve retirees. Last year, health plan closings 
affected more than 400,000 beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The health plans say that Medicare budget cuts have squeezed  
them too far and are asking for some money back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare enrollees, especially low-income enrollees, will  
suffer if payments to their health plans are inadequate to cover 
costs,'' said Stephen J. deMontmollin, vice president of AvMed 
Health Plan of Gainesville Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But Medicare officials say that before the 1997, there was  
evidence HMOs were paid too much and that factors such as stiff 
competition among health plans have contributed to the closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That suggests plan withdrawals have more to do with internal  
plan and marketplace considerations than Medicare payment 
volatility,'' said Medicare Deputy Administrator Michael Hash. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee, meanwhile, held the first of  
two days of hearings on eight proposals to overhaul Social 
Security, many of them creating new personal accounts that would 
invest money for future retirees. Each of the proposals would 
extend the program's life for at least 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said it is ``critical'' that Congress  
approve such personal accounts in the next few years to allow the 
investment money to begin building up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't wait to make this plan work,'' said Gramm, whose  
proposal would divert a portion of current payroll taxes into new 
personal investment accounts. ``If you want to avoid cutting 
benefits or raising taxes, you've got to do it next year.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Manager Faces More Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backed by handwritten notes, a manager for IBM  
testified at Microsoft's antitrust trial that the software giant 
offered valuable discounts for Windows if IBM agreed not to 
distribute rival software on its line of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Garry Norris, a mid-level manager, also backed off a central  
claim in his earlier testimony -- that Microsoft proposed an 
alliance in 1994 if IBM would abandon its rival OS/2 operating 
system and ``primarily promote'' Windows on its computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Rick Pepperman was expected to continue  
questioning Norris today, working to undermine some of the damaging 
allegations Norris made during two days on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private meeting with lawyers toward the end of Tuesday's  
session, the judge appeared to tell Pepperman he wasn't being very 
persuasive. His comments came as Pepperman informed the judge he 
expected to question Norris all day today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm not going to tell you that you can't have it,'' the  
judge said, according to transcripts of the meeting released today. 
``I'm not sure how much progress you have made so far, but we will 
leave that aside. But be economical with your examination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperman confronted Norris on Tuesday with later drafts of the  
Microsoft alliance proposal -- which IBM ultimately rejected -- 
requiring IBM to promote Windows ``but not exclusive to products 
offered by other divisions of IBM, affiliates or ventures of IBM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said he never saw those later drafts, but acknowledged  
they didn't include restrictions against selling OS/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly appears that way,'' Norris said.  
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also asked  
Pepperman how he could be sure the later drafts were genuine, since 
they weren't turned over by International Business Machines Corp. 
but were found in Microsoft's files. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperman offered to put on the witness stand two Microsoft  
executives to vouch for the drafts. But in a stinging rebuke, the 
judge accepted the paperwork yet replied that if they were to 
testify, ``there's a lot more they'll have to testify about than 
these documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Norris testified about Microsoft's alleged  
efforts to dissuade IBM from supporting software rivals. He said 
that Microsoft executive Bengt Ackerlind had told him clearly 
during a 1997 meeting: ``No Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government showed the judge handwritten notes by Norris from  
that meeting, when Microsoft allegedly offered to increase rebates 
available under its Market Development Agreements if IBM promised 
not to ship Internet software from Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In notes he marked with three asterisks for significance, Norris  
wrote: ``No Netscape &AMP; receive more MDA $ across the PC Co.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, the government's next-to-last witness in the trial,  
recounted the meeting with Ackerlind, who wanted IBM to distribute 
on its computers the fourth version of Microsoft's Internet 
Explorer Web browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have to agree to load IE 4 without any competitive  
software,'' Norris said, shifting in his seat to face the judge. 
``Bengt was very specific. He said, 'No Netscape.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge appeared transfixed again Tuesday by parts of the  
testimony. He took notes and alternated glances between Norris and 
Microsoft's lawyers at their defense table. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said outside the courtroom that,  
``We don't believe such a proposal was ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray also noted that IBM continues to this day to distribute  
rival software on its popular line of desktops and portable 
Thinkpad machines. The price IBM pays for Windows remains among the 
lowest in the industry, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dog, Cat Fur Products May Be Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should outlaw a common  
practice overseas -- slaughtering dogs and cats so their fur can be 
used for clothing, two lawmakers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., and Rep. Jerry  
Kleczka, D-Wis., would set a maximum fine of $25,000 fine or a year 
of imprisonment for people convicted of manufacturing, transporting 
or selling clothing, toys and other items made with the fur or 
skins of dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important occasion, one that runs to the heart  
of who we are and what we hold dear and meaningful in our lives,'' 
Roth said as Colby, Kleczka's pet sheltie, barked at reporters 
attending a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manufacturers in other lands are shipping to this country  
articles of clothing and toys made with pets like Colby here 
today,'' Kleczka said. ``Clearly that is an abhorrent practice. 
There isn't an American that I know of that would support the 
purchase of that merchandise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Roth, Kleczka and officials of the  
Humane Society of the United States displayed two stuffed cats made 
with cat hair, a coat trimmed in dog hair and a full-length woman's 
coat made of hair from tabby cats. 
</P>
<P>
	The fur also can be found in gloves, fur linings, insoles for  
shoes and boots. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million dogs and cats are killed each year, primarily in  
China and other Asian countries, for the international fur trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers of clothing often are unaware their purchases include dog  
and cat hair because they are intentionally mislabeled with exotic 
``fantasy names'' -- such as Asian jackal, sobaki, wildcat, goyangi 
and katzenfelle -- to make them more attractive to American 
consumers, said Richard Swain Jr., the Humane Society's vice 
president for investigative services. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is no evidence that pets are being killed in the  
United States for their fur, DNA tests on furs in the United States 
have confirmed that products made with dog or cat hair have been 
sold here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roth and Kleczka bills would require that all fur or  
fur-lined products be labeled accurately, regardless of their cost. 
The Humane Society also said current U.S. laws are ineffective 
because they generally do not apply to products costs less than 
$150.

<HEADLINE> Conviction Overturned in Cosby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court Wednesday overturned  
Autumn Jackson's conviction on charges she tried to extort $40 
million from Bill Cosby by threatening to tell the tabloids she was 
his illegitimate daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge  
improperly instructed the jury on the law pertaining to extortion. 
The court also overturned the convictions of two accomplices for 
the same reason, ordering the case returned to the lower court for 
a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The court added, however, that ``evidence at trial was plainly  
sufficient to support verdicts of guilty had the jury been properly 
instructed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson, 24, was sentenced in 1997 to two years and two  
months in prison after she was convicted of extortion, conspiracy 
and crossing state lines to commit a crime. She has served just 
over half of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her lawyers, Robert Baum, said he would ask for Ms.  
Jackson to be freed on bail as soon as Thursday. Prosecutors 
indicated they would not oppose the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, said  
prosecutors hadn't decided whether to appeal the ruling or ask for 
a retrial. A lawyer for Cosby said the entertainer would support 
whatever decision they make. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the judge should have instructed the  
jurors that in order to convict Ms. Jackson, they needed to find 
that she had wrongful intent. That would have allowed the jury to 
consider whether Ms. Jackson truly believed she was Cosby's 
daughter and therefore did not have any wrongful intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Jackson demanded the money from Cosby on  
Jan. 16, 1997 -- the day Cosby's 27-year-old son, Ennis, was shot to 
death in a robbery while changing a flat on a Los Angeles highway. 
If Cosby failed to comply, she said, she would tell her story to 
the supermarket tabloids. The slaying of Cosby's son was unrelated 
to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Ms. Jackson and Jose Medina were arrested in New  
York in an FBI sting after signing a $24 million payoff agreement 
with Cosby's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case tarnished Cosby's wholesome TV image as husband and  
father when he was forced to disclose that he had an affair with 
Ms. Jackson's mother, Shawn Upshaw, in the 1970s. He had provided 
her with more than $100,000 in support over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he repeatedly denied he is Ms. Jackson's father, telling  
jurors that he told Ms. Jackson: ``I will be for you a father 
figure, but I am not your father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of paternity was ruled irrelevant to the charges.  
Cosby took a paternity test after the trial to try to settle the 
dispute, but Ms. Jackson and her mother declined to take blood 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also overturned the case against Medina, who  
was sentenced to five years and three months in prison, and Boris 
Sabas, who got three months behind bars.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Wins 100 Meters at Milan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Four false starts and a lack of competition  
kept world champion Maurice Greene far off the world record but 
didn't stop him from winning the 100 meters at the Milan track and 
field meet Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene clocked 10.16 seconds, beating Nigeria's Innocent Asonze,  
runner-up at 10.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, ranked No. 1 in the world last year, was .32 seconds off  
the world mark of 9.84 held by Canadian Donovan Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not obsessed with the world record,'' said Greene, who  
blamed the series of false starts for a lack of concentration and 
for failing to clock a faster time. 
</P>
<P>
	Inger Miller made it a sweep for U.S. sprinters, winning the  
women's 100 in 11.14. She beat Susanthika Jaysinghe, the silver 
medalist at the 1997 World Championships, who was timed in 11.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Moroccan Salah Hissou had the world's best performance of the  
year in the 5,000, clocking 12:52.53, as he beat world champion 
Daniel Komen of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Iagar-Dinescu of Romania also produced the best world  
performance of the year in the women's high jump, clearing 6 feet, 
7 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco won the 1,500 meters in a quick  
3:31.34. Italy's Fiona May took the women's long jump at 23-0 1/2, and

in the 400 meters in 45.50.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Japan Key to Asia Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Asia's economies will likely improve this year,  
but time is needed for restructuring that would bring back healthy 
growth, American analysts told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The main question is whether Japan, Asia's largest economy, will  
recover and when, the analysts said in a satellite teleconference 
on the region's outlook organized by the U.S. Information Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never known a time where there has been more uncertainty  
about the Japanese outcome,'' said Lawrence Krause, coordinator for 
the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council's two-year forecast, 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The PECC report forecast average growth of 2.6 percent this year  
for the 23-nation Asia-Pacific region and 2.9 percent in 2000, 
adding to surveys that suggest the worst of the two-year Asian 
financial crisis is over. 
</P>
<P>
	But Krause, a member of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations,  
speaking from Washington, said Japan still has deeply rooted 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hatchett, the Asia managing partner for Arthur Andersen  
Associates, noted the large amount of money used to bailout failing 
banks in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Japanese government, finally, after nine years of  
recessions, is dealing with the fundamental issues,'' he said. ``If 
they do it right, it would be a significant engine of growth for 
the whole region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The PECC report also predicted a 2.5 percent contraction of  
Indonesia's economy this year, despite Monday's vote, the country's 
first democratic election in 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The election doesn't spell the end of political uncertainty,''  
Krause said. If opposition parties win, ``they may well find 
forming a coalition government is difficult and time consuming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The analysts said China's big problem was finding economically  
productive jobs for workers who lost their jobs when nonperforming, 
state-owned enterprises were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some private analysts have suggested Singapore may  
recover from recession and have up to 5 percent growth this year, 
the PECC is forecasting a modest 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our belief is that Singapore does have to think through a  
restructuring,'' Krause said. The island of 3.7 million people is 
heavily dependent on manufacturing. ``Even for high tech, there may 
not be a future in that,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore is one of the world's largest producers of disk drives  
for computers. But as technology advances, machines can do the job 
instead of people, Krause said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Expectations that the Japanese government will  
announce a rebound in economic growth kept the dollar sharply lower 
against the yen today. Tokyo stocks edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.38 yen in early trading, down 1.94 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but higher than the late New York level 
of 118.88 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 59.58 points,  
or 0.04 percent, to finish the day at 16,622.50. On Tuesday, the 
average closed up 87.03 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar came under selling pressure overseas following rumors  
that a government report due Thursday would show that Japan may 
finally be recovering from its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors emerged that the report would show a rise in gross  
domestic product, perhaps indicating that Japan's economy has 
turned the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency's relative strength from its New York level  
came after traders bought the greenback to cover short, or 
oversold, positions amid concerns that Japanese financial officials 
might warn against a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, influential Japanese finance ministry official  
Eisuke Sakakibara warned against a strengthening of the yen before 
Japan's economy recovers. Traders said that caution remained today. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.05 yen and 119.63 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.88 yen, down  
from 125.98 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices finished higher today as  
domestic institutional investors joined foreign participants in 
buying high tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were heartened by the market's  
resilience during the morning session despite overnight weakness in 
New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 143 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.37 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,342.51. The 
TOPIX closed up 10.49 points, or 0.79 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 490.41 million shares, up from 371.35 million shares 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 726 to 423, while 147  
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.5700 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.5750 percent, driving its 
price up to 98.53 yen from 98.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Taxes Region's Power Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Urgent calls for electricity conservation helped  
avert possible blackouts in New England as an unseasonable heat 
wave blanketed the East. 
</P>
<P>
	And today, temperatures were starting to ease. The National  
Weather Service forecast highs of only around 60 degrees in the 
Boston area today, a far cry from Tuesday's 92. The temperature hit 
97 Tuesday in Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one death was blamed on the heat. A 62-year-old man was  
found dead Tuesday in his apartment in Pottstown, Pa. The 
Montgomery County Health Department said he died of hyperthermia, 
or an above-normal body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical transmission companies made urgent appeals Tuesday to  
hundreds of businesses and industrial plants from Maine to 
Connecticut, asking them to cut back on their power use because of 
the sudden demand for air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the tensest any of us have been for the last six  
years,'' said Peter Dimond, spokesman for Cambridge-based 
Commonwealth Energy System. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such hot days are common in August, this two-day heat  
wave caught utilities by surprise. Many power plants were down for 
refueling or maintenance between the peak seasons of summer and 
winter, and the region's power supply was only at 70 percent of 
capacity, said David O'Connor, Massachusetts' energy resources 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts sent  
tens of thousands of state workers home and asked the public to cut 
back on electricity use. Other governors in New England urged 
consumers to turn off appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals, plus temperatures that topped out in the low 90s,  
kept energy usage below forecasts, and a power warning was lifted 
Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Credit Card Firms' Tactics Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sean Moyer, a University of Oklahoma junior,  
had earned the minimum wage as a part-time salesman and gift 
wrapper in a department store. Yet by the time he hanged himself in 
his bedroom closet, he had 12 credit cards and had amassed $10,000 
in debt on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitzi Pool had only three cards -- but they were maxed out,  
totaling $2,500 in debt. Ms. Pool, a freshman at the University of 
Central Oklahoma, also hanged herself, her checkbook and credit 
card bills spread out on her dorm bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups are citing the deaths in 1997 and 1998 to  
underscore their criticism of credit card companies, who they say 
are aggressively trying to get college students hooked on credit 
the way cigarette makers tried to get young people hooked on 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown University sociologist Robert Manning, who studied  
credit card debt among college students, maintains that marketing 
of the cards on campuses ``now poses a greater threat than alcohol 
or sexually transmitted diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, students slide into debt through the extension (by  
credit card companies) of unaffordable credit lines,'' Manning said 
Tuesday at a news conference organized by the Consumer Federation 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation released Manning's study showing that  
some students are forced to cut back on their courses or spend more 
time working to pay off their credit card debts. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of students at four-year colleges have at least  
one credit card, and revolving debt on these cards averages more 
than $2,000, the study said. In the worst cases, students are 
forced to drop out of school and work full time. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Trisha Johnson of Enid, Okla. recounted  
how her daughter Mitzi had phoned her on a December night in 1997, 
crying because she had lost her part-time job and didn't know what 
to do. She already had maxed out three credit cards after 3 1/2 months 
of college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to assure her that ... we would sit down and go over  
her bills and work some plan out,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``This was my 
last conversation with my daughter.'' Later that night, she killed 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card companies such as Visa USA Inc. and MasterCard  
International have defended their college marketing practices, 
maintaining that most students use credit responsibly and 
appreciate getting the cards as a way to establish a credit 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the suicides of Ms. Pool and Moyer, who killed  
himself in February 1998, Visa said: ``The loss of a young person 
is tragic under any circumstances, and it is very troubling to hear 
of the loss these families suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Visa and its (member banks) feel a strong responsibility to  
educate college students about wisely managing their personal 
finances,'' the company said in a statement. ``We see financial 
education as an important tool to prevent problems before they 
occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group officials also criticized colleges and  
universities for allowing what they said was aggressive marketing 
of credit cards on campuses and benefiting financially from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit card companies pay colleges and universities fees to be  
able to sponsor school programs and student activities, to rent 
tables on campus used to solicit students to apply for cards, and 
for marketing agreements such as ``affinity'' cards linked to 
colleges, the consumer activists said. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last fall by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group  
found that credit card companies lure students on campus with free 
T-shirts, Frisbees and other items if they apply for cards. It also 
found that students who obtain cards that way often end up with 
bigger unpaid balances and pay off their debts later than those who 
do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Brobeck, the Consumer Federation's executive director,  
said Congress should adopt a measure requiring people under age 21 
to get a parent's approval or demonstrate sufficient income before 
obtaining credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning's study, which was partially funded by the Consumer  
Federation, was based on interviews with and questionnaires filled 
out by students at Georgetown University, American University and 
the University of Maryland, all in the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that campuses are concerned about,'' said  
Jacqueline King, director of federal policy analysis for the 
American Council on Education, which represents college and 
university administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	She said some schools have raised concerns about aggressive  
soliciting by employees of marketing firms hired by credit card 
companies, while others have banned them from setting up tables on 
campus. Most students are able to handle credit responsibly, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wackerman, a spokesman for Georgetown, acknowledged that  
schools can benefit financially from credit card promotions. 
However, he added, credit card companies need to conduct their 
activities in a responsible way. Manning's report ``raised some 
good issues,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassandra Robinson, a University of Maryland spokeswoman, said  
the school no longer allows credit card issuers to physically 
solicit students on campus. And American University's Todd Sedmak 
said the campus bookstore has stopped solicitations, though student 
groups can still sponsor them.

<HEADLINE> House Again Bans Abortion Pills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has voted for the second consecutive  
year to bar the government from testing, developing or approving 
abortion-inducing drugs like the French RU-486 pill. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 217-214 vote Tuesday was a victory for House  
abortion foes, the bill's chances for becoming law this year appear 
dim. When the House voted a year ago for the same prohibition, the 
Senate did not approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something terribly wrong'' when the Food and Drug  
Administration uses taxpayers' dollars for ``drugs that are 
designed to kill unborn children,'' said sponsor Rep. Tom Coburn, 
R-Okla., during the sometimes emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another baby pesticide that kills babies,'' said Rep.  
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a leading antiabortion lawmaker. ``Come 
up with drugs that heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued that the restriction was another attempt to  
limit abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Science, not politics, should determine what drugs are  
approved,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have our Flat Earth Society days around here, and this  
appears to be one of them,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's roll call was closer than last year's 223-202 vote.  
</P>
<P>
	The language was included in a $61 billion bill financing  
agriculture, food and drug programs, which the House approved by 
246-183.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch May Have Violated Gun Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch may  
have violated federal law when he took a handgun given to him by 
Salt Lake Olympic bidders out of the country, a newspaper said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the government's investigation of the bid for the  
2002 Winter Games, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is 
examining a series of transactions between the Salt Lake bid 
committee, the IOC and Browning Arms Co., The Salt Lake Tribune 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning sold or delivered 10 weapons to the bid committee. At  
least three of those guns were given to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were interviewed by the ATF and the FBI and we discussed  
the facts that the products we sold to the bid committee were 
spotted in other parts of the world,'' said Rich Bauter, Browning's 
vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the United States must obtain approval from the  
State Department before leaving the country with weapons purchased 
or obtained here. 
</P>
<P>
	Violators could be charged under federal law with felony  
exportation of a firearm without a permit, ATF spokesman Larry 
Bettendorf said. Other federal laws restrict non-U.S. citizens from 
possessing firearms without a permit and prohibit unlicensed 
dealers from exporting firearms from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATF inquiry dovetails with investigations of wire fraud and  
money laundering by the FBI, tax fraud by the Internal Revenue 
Service and a U.S. Customs probe of a transport of large sums of 
cash out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really can't comment on any ongoing information that we may  
or may not have,'' Bettendorf told the Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department also declined to comment on any aspect of  
the investigation, although the Tribune has reported that at least 
two people are facing imminent indictments in the Olympic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning has found invoices for 10 firearms bought by the bid  
committee. A bolt-action rifle and a semiautomatic shotgun were 
delivered to Samaranch in May 1995 at the bid committee's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Another invoice was for a pistol sold to the bid committee in  
February 1991, two months before Samaranch's first visit to Utah. 
The invoice, for $395.86, was directed to Tom Welch, the former 
head of the bid committee and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The pistol was presented to Samaranch during a dinner at the  
home of businessman Jon Huntsman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our counsel has not been informed of any involvement by ATF,''  
SLOC spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee has acknowledged that  
Samaranch was given a pistol and a rifle, and Samaranch has said he 
was given guns on two visits to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The rifle was in a case with an engraved plaque that read,  
``Presented to President Juan Antonio Samaranch from the Browning 
Arms Co. on behalf of the people of Salt Lake City.''

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Cos. Accuse Philip Morris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO (AP) -- Three cigarette companies urged a judge today  
to stop Philip Morris Inc., the world's largest cigarette maker, 
from offering sizable discounts to store owners who prominently 
display Marlboro and other Philip Morris brands. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and  
Williamson Tobacco Corp. allege Philip Morris has used its market 
clout to monopolize the U.S. cigarette market, where it accounts 
for almost 54 percent of all retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies have asked for a jury trial and unspecified  
damages. Their lawsuits have since been consolidated into a single 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies want U.S. District Judge Frank Bulock to put an  
immediate stop to Philip Morris' ``Retail Leaders'' marketing 
program, which they claim violates federal and state antitrust 
laws. It was unclear whether Bullock would issue an oral ruling at 
the hearing's conclusion, which may come Thursday, or rule in 
writing later. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is about Philip Morris' exercise of market power to  
unreasonably restrict the advertising by its competitors,'' Richard 
Cooper, an RJR attorney, said in his opening statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are best served when retailers can present cigarette  
brands in the best interests of the consumer, not Philip Morris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiff companies' lawyers unveiled a model of a retail  
store to show the alleged disadvantage at which Philip Morris' 
program places its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness was Brian Stockdale, RJR's vice president for  
trade marketing, who said if Philip Morris is permitted to go ahead 
with the marketing program, it could gain control of 60 percent to 
70 percent of the national cigarette market. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris would squeeze out competitors by relegating them  
to less advantageous displays in store cases, Stockdale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris has disputed the claims in court filings.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Retail Leaders program does not require that participating  
retailers offer only Philip Morris promotions at any time. And the 
Retail Leaders program does not preclude participating retailers 
from providing `visible' space to non-Philip Morris brands,'' said 
a Philip Morris memorandum.

<HEADLINE> Car Hits Ill. Government Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A motorist claiming to be a terrorist with a bomb  
smashed his car into the state government center today, drove 
across the floor and rammed into an information stand before he was 
taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured and no bomb was found.  
</P>
<P>
	The James R. Thompson Center, named for a former governor, was  
evacuated and streets and sidewalks crowded with rush-hour traffic 
were closed off as bomb investigators checked the car. Office 
workers crammed onto the sidewalks across from the futuristic 
glass-walled building, waiting to be let back in. 
</P>
<P>
	A man who said he was in the lobby when the car came in said he  
heard the glass shatter, then the sound of the engine being gunned 
before the car hit the information booth and the man got out and 
was surrounded by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just matter of factly stated `I'm a terrorist. I have a  
smart bomb,''' said the witness, Sam Marchetti, who works for a 
company putting panels on an escalator in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver later recanted his statement about the bomb, police  
spokesman Pat Camden said. Authorities did not release his name. 
Police knew of no motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Camden said the man stopped in front of the building, waited for  
pedestrians to get out of the way, then drove across the wide plaza 
in front of the building and crashed through the glass doors of the 
handicapped entrance around 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing it didn't happen a couple of hours later,''  
Marchetti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thompson center is the Chicago base for Illinois state  
government. Most state agencies have offices there.

<HEADLINE> Fisher To Step Down As Kodak CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- George Fisher, who built a reputation for  
doing everything right at Motorola Inc., is stepping down after a 
turbulent, six-year reign at Eastman Kodak Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, 58, the first outsider hired as chief executive in Kodak  
history, will hand over the top post at the end of the year to a 
veteran insider, company president Dan Carp, but will remain as 
chairman until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Hailed as golden-boy savior and pro-growth visionary when he  
took the helm at Kodak in 1993, Fisher is leaving a mixed legacy as 
the photography company struggles to rebound from a bruising price 
war that led to nearly 20,000 job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I emphasized growth from the start,'' Fisher said Wednesday.  
``I believe -- even more today -- there are great growth 
opportunities here and you cannot shrink your way to greatness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carp, 51, joined Kodak in 1970 and was named president and chief  
operating officer in 1997. He will retain those posts when he 
becomes CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only make progress if you set high expectations,'' Carp  
said. ``What I've learned from George is that whenever you think 
you've set them too high, it's about time to take them higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher described Carp as the ``co-architect of Kodak's strategic  
turnaround.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, Fisher has drawn praise for disposing of  
Kodak's healthcare and chemicals businesses, championing a new era 
of digital photography, and shaking up a stagnant corporate culture 
that stifled creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to steer clear of across-the board layoffs, instead  
trimming unit-by-unit, but changed his approach radically last year 
after Fuji caught Kodak off-guard by slashing film prices in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Kodak's is trying to cut $1.2 billion in costs and 19,900  
jobs, or about one-fifth of its payroll of 100,500, by the end of 
1999 -- the most severe cutbacks ever at Kodak, which was founded in 
1881. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's clearly left Kodak better off, but I don't think as well  
off, to date, as one would have expected,'' said Jack Kelly, an 
analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``The jury is still out to some 
degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Fisher assured shareholders at their annual meeting  
that Kodak was climbing back to prosperity after two hard years of 
price wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales, after dropping for eight consecutive quarters, rose 6  
percent in the first quarter to $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	However, retail surveys suggest that the price war for consumer  
film in the United States is intensifying again as the peak 
picture-taking season nears. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Barnard, a management professor at the Rochester Institute  
of Technology, said, ``Fisher hasn't been as in touch as he should 
be with the reality of Fuji and the fact that they just weren't 
going to fold up and creep quietly away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, Fisher shouldn't be faulted for deep cuts.  
``There was really an awful lot of dead wood in Kodak. ... Kodak 
had to change as they encountered competition, and the data is 
showing us that companies are doing better with fewer 
(employees).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher will be 60 when his work at Kodak ends.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty years old has seemed like -- even when I was at Motorola  
-- a good time to make such a transition to another stage of life,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While undecided about his plans, Fisher did not rule out running  
another company. ``I would like to be a student, I would like to be 
a teacher and I would like to stay in touch with business,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Macarchuk To Coach Stony Brook Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nick Macarchuk, basketball coach at Fordham for  
12 years, has resigned to take the coaching job at Stony Brook, 
sources told The Associated Press on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	His hiring will be announced Thursday at a news conference  
called by Stony Brook, which moves up to Division I as an 
independent starting next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk will be given a five-year contract, according to  
sources close to the schools and Macarchuk and who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. He had one year remaining on his contract 
with Fordham. 
</P>
<P>
	Stony Brook's opening was created when it failed to renew the  
contract of Bernard Tomlin, who has coached the Seawolves the last 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson coach Bob McKillop, a friend of Stony Brook athletic  
director Richard Laskowski, was pursued for the job, but decided 
last month to stay with the North Carolina school, which he's 
coached for 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk was 161-192 at Fordham, but hasn't had a winning  
record since the Rams were 18-13 and played in the NCAA tournament 
in 1992. His last Fordham team was 12-15, the seventh straight 
losing record for the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Fordham moved to the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1995 and has had  
little success, losing 80 of 108 games in four seasons. But 
Macarchuk made progress last season, with the 12 victories matching 
the combined total of the previous two years. He was honored as 
A-10 coach of the year for the turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	Macarchuk was 149-128 in 10 seasons at Canisius before taking  
over at Fordham in 1987-88. His first team was 18-15 and played in 
the NIT. His best teams were 20-13 in 1990 and 25-8 in 1991, and 
both played in the NIT. The 1992 team played in the NCAA tournament 
by virtue of winning the Patriot League postseason tournament.

<HEADLINE> New Moms Stay Longer in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New mothers are staying in the hospital a  
little longer -- about half a day more on average -- says the first 
study since a public outcry over ``drive-by deliveries.'' The trend 
began even before a federal law requiring insurance coverage of 
48-hour stays went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, many insurance companies began paying only  
for 24-hour hospital stays for vaginal childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say that's often long enough for healthy women with  
uncomplicated vaginal deliveries who are having their second baby, 
but that first-time mothers who generally have longer labors and 
more questions about newborn care often need a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	So in the wake of complaints about inadequate care, states began  
passing laws in 1995 and 1996 requiring insurance to pay for 
48-hour stays. A similar federal law was passed in 1996 and took 
effect last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the nation's average stay for a vaginal delivery was  
3.2 days. That dropped to 1.7 days by 1995, but inched up to 2.1 
days by 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, 1.4 million new mothers -- 37 percent -- were  
hospitalized for one day or less. In 1997, 951,000 new mothers -- 25 
percent -- had such short stays, the CDC reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Obstetricians weren't surprised, saying the difference between  
1995 and today is obvious -- length of stay is no longer an issue 
their patients discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the laws, ``patients were angry or upset'' while today,  
``it's mostly noticeable by the lack of discussion,'' said Dr. 
Fredric Frigoletto, obstetrics chief at Massachusetts General 
Hospital. ``Those that want to go home earlier are ready to go 
home, it's apparent they are and everybody feels comfortable, and 
we don't have to force people out that literally aren't ready to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separate data from the insurance company Aetna-U.S. Healthcare  
shows that its members' maternity stays after vaginal delivery 
increased from 1.7 days in 1997 to 2.4 days in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the change is costing Aetna more -- it pays about  
$1,000 per day of childbirth hospitalization -- the insurer has cut 
its previous benefit of two at-home nurse visits to one. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger issue is whether hospitalizing lots of new mothers  
longer is beneficial: Are newborns healthier? Do women get extra 
training in breast feeding? Do they bond better with their babies? 
Thus, is the extra care cost-effective? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody yet knows. University of Chicago researchers just won  
federal funding for a five-year study of the effects of the 48-hour 
stay law. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a study just published in the American Journal of Public  
Health, the university's Kristiana Raube used Illinois births to 
estimate the law's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Her conclusions: Extra hospitalization will cost about $1,400  
more per mother and baby. Overall, about 2 percent of U.S. newborns 
are readmitted to the hospital during the first two weeks of life. 
If a 48-hour initial stay eliminated every newborn readmission, the 
state's childbirth costs still would rise by 18 percent if all 
mothers took the extra day. 
</P>
<P>
	Measuring an extra day's benefit may not be easy. Frigoletto  
said for first-time mothers recuperating from longer labor, much of 
that second day is spent resting -- something they might not do at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's hospital study also examined patients with the AIDS  
virus, and found good news: They spent almost 900,000 fewer days in 
the hospital in 1997 than in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Better drugs that started hitting the market in 1995 already had  
slashed AIDS deaths. But the CDC said its study is the first to 
show these expensive drugs -- about $20,000 for a year's supply -- 
also cut even more costly hospital stays.

	Yugoslavs Leave Talks, Then Return

<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Marathon talks on a plan to end 11  
weeks of airstrikes appeared to have stalled today when Yugoslav 
representatives left for Belgrade reportedly to consult with 
President Slobodan Milosevic's government, but to the surprise of 
NATO officials, the Yugoslavs returned after only an hour. 
Meanwhile, in Germany, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said NATO 
is ready to compromise with Yugoslavia over final sticking points

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House took up Republican-sponsored  
legislation today that would cut off funds for the operation in the 
Balkans after Sept. 30, despite warnings by Democrats that it could 
undermine the peace process. Democrats said they would attempt 
later today to strip the provision from a defense spending bill. 
The House debate came after the Senate insisted that the United 
States not be billed for any costs associated with rebuilding 
Serbia under a Kosovo peace plan, as long as Slobodan Milosevic 
remains in power.

was announcing the executive order at a roundtable on civil rights 
law enforcement as a way of encouraging state and local officials 
to examine their own law enforcement agencies. Questionable 
shootings this year by police that took the lives of young blacks 
have revived debate about how officers handle confrontations with

21. The survey also found lopsided public backing for mandatory 
background checks for gun show sales, safety devices for guns and 
mandatory sentences for felons who commit their crimes with a gun. 
Backing for all these provisions was in the range of 80 percent,

yesterday's 92. The two-day heat wave along the East Coast caught 
utilities by surprise. Many power plants were down for refueling or 
maintenance between the peak seasons of summer and winter. At least 
one death was blamed on the heat. A 62-year-old man was found dead 
yesterday in his apartment in Pottstown, Pa.

	Senate Debates Y2K Litigation Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is grappling with a Y2K litigation  
bill that business groups say could save them from billions of 
dollars in lawsuits but the Clinton administration says undermines 
defendant rights and faces a veto. The bill, which has passed the 
House in a different version, aims to stop frivolous lawsuits by 
people trying to take advantage of computer breakdowns on Jan. 1, 
2000, by encouraging mediation and giving companies 90 days to fix 
computer problems before they can be taken to court. Senate 
Democrats agreed to resume debate on the bill today.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble said today it will cut about  
13 percent of its work force -- 15,000 jobs worldwide -- over six 
years and close about 10 plants in a global restructuring program. 
The changes are to be implemented beginning this year. They are 
part of what P&AMP;G calls its Organization 2005 program designed to 
increase sales, get new products to market more quickly, cut costs 
and make the company more responsive to market changes.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Twins outfielder Matt Lawton will  
be out for about two weeks with a fractured right eye socket, the 
team's general manager confirmed today. Lawton was hit by a pitch

Twins' 5-2 victory over the Reds on Tuesday. Lawton was hitting 
.258 with five home runs and 26 runs batted in going into the game. 
Cleatus Davidson ran for Lawton.

	SMART CARDS: Worldwide sales of smart cards, the plastic cards  
embedded with computer chips, rose 32 percent to 1.25 billion last 
year from 950 million in 1997, according to a survey by Faulkner &AMP; 
Gray's Card Technology magazine. The wallet-sized computerized 
cards are used most frequently as prepaid phone cards, but are also 
used in banking, shopping, parking services, mass transit, toll 
systems and vending machines. The cards are still having a hard 
time gaining acceptance in the United States -- another study, by 
Standard Register Co., which makes smart cards, said only 5 percent 
of the plastic cards used in the United States are smart cards. 
That compares with 89 percent for credit cards, 61 percent for 
automated teller machine cards, and 37 percent for debit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BUT WILL YOUR CREDIT CARD BILL KEEP YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT?: If  
you're looking to hide a lot of money in your bed and you don't 
want to stuff it under the mattress, you could always sink it into 
a $2,300 pillow. The Company Store, which manufactures and sells 
comforters and bed linens, is selling a pillow made of eiderdown, 
with a price range of $1,800 for a standard size to $2,300 for a 
king size. Eiderdown is pricier than goose down because it's 
collected by hand from the nests of eider ducks that live in cold, 
northern places like Iceland. The retailer, noting that most people 
buy pillows in pairs, concedes that eiderdown may be a little out 
of reach for many of us. It also offers regular down pillows at a 
more modest $99.

	A CONTRARIAN VIEW OF Y2K: Amid all the hair-pulling and  
teeth-gnashing about Y2K computer bugs, comes another, more 
positive, take from Richard Feinberg, a consumer sciences professor 
at Purdue University. Feinberg says many companies have been forced 
to take a good look at the way they do business as they race to 
solve their Y2K problems before 2000 arrives. They've updated their 
computers and in the process improved their ability to work with 
vendors and manufacturers. That in turn can mean they're in a 
better position to get their products to customers. Feinberg also 
found a plus for consumers -- many businesses, including retailers, 
will stock up on extra inventory, and that could mean better prices 
when the crisis is over and companies have to sell off the excess.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets ended higher Wednesday, with  
the region's largest -- Tokyo and Hong Kong -- shrugging off Wall 
Street's worries over a possible rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares rose as domestic institutional investors joined  
foreign participants in buying high-tech issues. The blue chip 
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 59.58 points, or 0.04 percent, 
to end at 16,622.50. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Nikkei had closed up 0.53 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were heartened by the market's  
resilience despite overnight losses in New York, where the Dow 
Jones industrial average fell 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On currency markets, expectations that the Japanese government  
will announce a rebound in economic growth kept the U.S. dollar 
sharply lower against the yen. The dollar bought 119.38 yen in 
early trading, down 1.94 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but higher 
than the late New York level of 118.88 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares rose in lackluster trading, with investors  
undeterred by Wall Street's overnight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 9.56 points, or 0.07 percent,  
to close at 12,874.42. On Tuesday, the index had gained 0.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Seoul bucked the trend, falling 5.9 percent after Wall Street's  
overnight loss prompted many investors to cash in on gains 
accumulated over the recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The KOSPI fell 50.14 points to close at 803.46, the largest  
daily drop in the index since it fell 5.4 percent on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rose 3.4 percent following late afternoon rumors  
that U.S. rating agency Moody's would upgrade several Thai banks. 
The SET index rose 16.83 points at 510.50. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell as investors focused on the slow counting  
of election results in the absence of fresh news. The JSX Composite 
Index fell 7.977 points, or 1.4 percent, to 678.970 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose despite heavy early selling in the  
absence of fresh leads. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 2.41 
points, or 0.31 percent, to end at 757.50. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares fell as investors cashed in selected blue chips  
following Wall Street's overnight loss. The PSE fell 48.62 points, 
or 2 percent, to 2,366.45. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares rose on continued buying in technology and  
financial shares. The Weighted Price Index rose 65.58 points, or 
0.83 percent, to 7,957.71. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares rose as investors ignored Wall Street's losses  
and bought heavily in afternoon trading. The STI rose 10.10 points, 
or 0.50 percent, to 2,006.54. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares rose on a late flurry of futures contract-related  
buying. The All Ordinaries index was up 18.7 points, or 0.6 
percent, at 2,985.5. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares fell in lackluster trading on the absence of  
major international buyers. The NZSE-40 Capital index fell 0.08 
points, 0.003 percent, to 2,114.42.

<HEADLINE> Weather News Sinks Grains, Soybeans / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for cooling temperatures 
later this week in Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices were pressured by private and government  
forecasts for cooler weather and relieving rains later this week. 
Prices had been supported by temperatures much above normal in 
parts of the Midwest that investors speculated could stress young, 
early-planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean losses were limited by government figures showing strong  
exports in the past week. That is significant, given heavy 
competition from bumper South American production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.53 a bushel; July  
corn fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1 cent to

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres' physical play has carried them  
to the Stanley Cup finals. But coach Lindy Ruff thought his team 
went a little overboard in Game 1 against the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in and tried to set the tone and throughout the game,  
but a couple of times we got carried away,'' Sabres coach Lindy 
Ruff said Wednesday, referring to the 10 power-play opportunities 
they gave the Dallas Stars. ``We have to be a lot more 
disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Sabres will be any less physical in Game 2 on  
Thursday night, only smarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did take some bad penalties,'' Ruff said. ``I think you're  
playing with fire if you give the Stars 10 power plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres managed to kill nine of them en route to a 3-2  
overtime victory on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WARMING UP:* Dominik Hasek was hot, and it had nothing at all  
to do with his goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never played before in such a hot building,'' the  
Buffalo goalie said about Game 1 of the finals in Reunion Arena. 
``I tried to drink as much water as I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek said he was so tired he couldn't even get to the other  
side of the ice after Jason Woolley scored the winning goal. He 
actually flopped down, too exhausted to celebrate with his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his much-publicized groin injury, he said that didn't  
bother him at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good throughout the game,'' Hasek said.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT ON SCHEDULE:* The NHL is working on different possibilities  
for its schedule for the 1999-2000 season -- all relating to the 
fortunes of the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are currently in bankruptcy court, and their future  
is still up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working on two alternative schedules -- one if the  
Penguins are nonexistent and the other if the team is somewhere 
else,'' NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday. ``It would be 
easier for us to make up the schedule if the Penguins stay put.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At any rate, Bettman promised that the NHL season would not run  
as long as it has this season. If the finals are extended to the 
maximum seven games, the season will end on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate starting as early as Oct. 1, and being done a  
week sooner next year,'' Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOLID SABRES:* Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock isn't surprised by  
Buffalo's strong showing so far in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can just throw the seventh seed out of the window  
because if Buffalo was healthy they would be a lot higher seed,'' 
Hitchcock said. ``We were healthy for 90 per cent of the year, so 
that was the gap. In head-to-head competition (between the teams), 
it is pretty close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams split the two-game series during the season.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GREEDY:* In winning the first game of the finals, the Buffalo  
Sabres have eliminated the Dallas Stars' home-ice advantage. But 
that doesn't mean that Sabres coach Lindy Ruff is necessarily 
satisfied with a split of the first two games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the luxury of going up 2-0'' and then going home,  
Ruff said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the series, Ruff had said he would be satisfied with a  
split of the first two games in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOSING PROPOSITION:* NHL commissioner Gary Bettman readily  
admitted Wednesday that teams were losing money in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we have teams losing money,'' Bettman told  
the media. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked how many, Bettman said: ``I'm not going to get into  
percentages or the number of teams. It's more than one team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most notable, of course, are the Pittsburgh Penguins, who  
are fighting for their existence in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JASON'S JUMPIN':* Buffalo's Jason Woolley has suddenly become a  
force in the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His winning goal in Game 1 was his fourth and gave him 14 points  
in 16 games, tops among defensemen in the postseason. By 
comparison, he had just five goals and 23 points in 37 previous 
playoff games with three other NHL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason is a very underrated offensive defenseman,'' said Sabres  
captain Mike Peca. ``He has gotten an opportunity to play on a 
consistent basis and has done a good job for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the strongest guys in the weight room, and offers  
some leadership in the locker room. He doesn't say much, unless it 
needs to be said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *-------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROAD ADVANTAGE:* Playing at home hasn't necessarily been easy  
for teams in the playoffs. The road club has now won 10 of the 15 
series-opening games and the overall playoff record for road teams 
in 81 games so far is 42-39. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO INFORMANT:* The Dallas Stars are getting a lot out of Derek  
Plante since acquiring him from the Buffalo Sabres at the trading 
deadline -- everything, it seems, but information about the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ken Hitchcock says he ``hasn't pushed the envelope'' as  
far as pressing Plante for information about his former team. 
Hitchcock said he didn't want to make Plante uncomfortable because 
``he still has too many friends on that team.''

<HEADLINE> Dr. Koop Launches Fitness Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The doctor who declared war on smoking is  
setting his sights on the couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. C. Everett Koop, former U.S. surgeon general, called today  
for fitness to be a national health priority, saying that 
inactivity among Americans has reached ``crisis proportions.'' He's 
offering an Internet guide to Americans wanting to craft their own 
fitness plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``An intensified effort to motivate Americans, at every age, to  
be more physically active is essential to reducing premature death 
in this country,'' said Koop. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple changes in routine can make a difference. Koop, 82,  
suggested staying in shape by avoiding elevators. ``People forget 
how important stairs are,'' he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop said living in a technically advanced society makes it far  
too easy to remain sedentary. An estimated 60 percent of adult 
Americans are not active on a regular basis, and one in four are 
not active at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop is especially concerned with inactivity among young people.  
``Fat kids become fat adolescents, and fat adolescents become fat 
people,'' Koop said. 
</P>
<P>
	New scientific studies indicate that fitness may contribute more  
to a long, healthy life than any other factor, including quitting 
smoking. Moderate regular activity reduces the likelihood of high 
blood pressure, heart disease, colon cancer and depression. Even 
light, intermittent activity such as walking offers health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop's anti-obesity initiative, ``Shape Up America,'' offers an  
interactive tool on the World Wide Web that allows users to assess 
their fitness levels and to develop customized activity programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort is separate from DrKoop.com Inc., a company providing  
consumer health-care information on the Internet that made its 
initial public offering of stock Tuesday. Koop's 7 percent stake 
was worth about $31.5 million at Tuesday's closing price. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was surprised by the stock's success, but wasn't in  
the venture for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop served as surgeon general from 1981 to 1989. He advised the  
public on health matters such as smoking and health, diet and 
nutrition, environmental health hazards and the importance of 
immunization and disease prevention. He also was the government's 
chief spokesman on AIDS. Koop is now senior scholar of the C. 
Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth.

<HEADLINE> Students Seek Voice in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Putting two students on his state's board of  
education did not satisfy higher school senior Ben Smilowitz of 
West Hartford, Conn., so he worked the halls of Connecticut's 
Statehouse on Wednesday to gain voting rights for those student 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in 11 states and the District of Columbia can serve on  
the boards that set education policy, but only California, 
Maryland, Massachusetts and Tennessee allow student members full 
voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason why one perspective ought to be counted less  
than any other perspective,'' said the 18-year-old Smilowitz, who 
has rallied a nationwide network of high school students to the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts took the lead in 1975, adding a full student  
member. Today, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Montana, 
Nevada and Washington state have non-voting student members, while 
North Carolina has two student advisers. The District of Columbia 
allows the student member to vote on student services committee 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, Smilowitz and the International Student  
Activism Alliance pushed to add two more seats to Connecticut's 
nine-member board with the hope they would go to students. 
Lawmakers in May approved the new seats -- but not the students' 
right to vote on education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we'd be back for more,'' Smilowitz said from the  
Connecticut Statehouse in Hartford, where he hoped to convince 
lawmakers to consider the matter before the end of their current 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states targeted for student board members with voting  
rights are Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina 
and Vermont, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of student participation on state education boards  
question whether the high-schoolers know enough to be able to 
decide how to spend public money, award contracts, and set 
education policies dealing with classroom instruction and teacher 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Kysilko of the National Association of State Boards of  
Education said he was unaware of any complaints from state boards 
whose student members have full-voting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
	The association last year urged state boards to let students  
have some say in education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a groundswell of opposition to the idea of  
students on the boards,'' Kysilko said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 students nationwide serve on local school boards,  
including New York, Chicago and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, student state board members have made a difference  
over the past 15 years, said J.V. Sailors, the board's executive 
director. A student member once broke a tie in a debate over 
whether students could use two years of ROTC classes to fulfill 
health and wellness class requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a very positive action on the part of our  
Legislature,'' said Sailors, who added that Tennessee student 
members vote on all actions. ``It's our business to serve students 
and that student perspective is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's current student member, Brittney Roberts of Roan  
Mountain, admitted feeling intimidated by her duties at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``They treated me like I was a grownup,'' said Roberts, 17, who  
recently considered a proposal to increase parent involvement in 
schools. ``Most of the people there had doctorate degrees so it was 
very important to me that I had just as much say so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Smilowitz, the recent incidents of school violence around  
the country point to the need for student input on education 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're wondering what the solutions are, yet we fail to involve  
the key players,'' he said. ``We walk through the hall of the 
schools, we sit behind the desks. All of the rules apply to us; we 
know how rules are being carried out, what is needed and what is 
not.''

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Building Damaged by Paintball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Off-duty police officers playing paintball  
splattered four floors of a historic former mental hospital in 
multicolored paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Paint covered corridors, walls, ceilings, floors, wooden doors,  
staircases and a 12-by-14-foot mural of the hospital on an interior 
wall of the vacant 19th-century Weston Hospital, Sheriff Robert 
Rinehart said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking so much paint it was hazardous to walk on the  
floors it was so wet,'' Rinehart said.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Scrutinizes Calif. Gun Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis, hoping to keep guns  
owned by the state from reaching the streets, wants state agencies 
to tell him how they get rid of their old weapons, which number in 
the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor does not want to exacerbate a problem by having  
guns going from state agencies to individuals who then put them on 
California streets,'' said Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who has already ordered the Corrections Department to  
stop selling used and damaged guns to gun dealers, wants to know 
how other agencies dispose of their old or outdated weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration then will decide how to proceed, his office  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, the Corrections Department has sold off  
about 1,600 of its old weapons. At the time of Davis' order to 
cease sales, the department already had halted the practice. But at 
least three other state agencies also have sold or traded guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Highway Patrol traded 4,046 confiscated rifles,  
pistols and handguns last July to a private dealer in San Jose in 
return for new service weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	But the April massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton,  
Colo., has focused attention on the number of guns on the streets, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a lot of latitude under the law, and we thought,  
`Hey, let's just trade some of them,' and it obviously backfired,'' 
CHP Deputy Commissioner Bill Carlson said. ``What happened in 
Colorado really drove up the sensitivity about guns. ... If 
something happened with one of those guns, it would be horrible.''

<HEADLINE> School: Teacher Gave Bomb Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) -- A high school teacher faces suspension  
for allegedly showing his class how to make a pipe bomb and where 
to place it for maximum injuries and damage to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Falls of Palm Harbor University High presented the  
lesson a day after the massacre at Columbine High School in 
Colorado, according to a school district investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pinellas County school superintendent has recommended that  
the social studies teacher be suspended for 10 days, meaning he 
would lose $1,430. 
</P>
<P>
	Falls, 38, has requested a hearing. He did not return a call for  
comment from the St. Petersburg Times. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an account provided by the school board, Falls  
discussed the Columbine shootings in several classes, calling it a 
travesty and emphasizing the importance of students being aware of 
their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at students' request, Falls allegedly drew a diagram of a  
pipe bomb on the chalkboard ``and described its components in 
detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also ``initiated a discussion explaining to students exactly  
where a pipe bomb should be placed at Palm Harbor University High 
School in order to maximize impact and why such a placement would 
be most effective in causing injury or harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A parent contacted school administrators in this Gulf Coast  
community near Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Jade Moore, executive director of the teachers union, defended  
Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he advocated building a pipe bomb, that would be one thing.  
Or if the students were prone to do that, that's one thing. But 
explaining it, discussing it, that's topical,'' Moore said. ``It 
sounds to me like he was probably exercising his First Amendment 
right to academic freedom.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Case Apparently a Murder-Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- A woman who said she needed to care for  
her husband because he was depressed shot him to death, then stayed 
home with the body for two days before killing herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quite apparently a homicide-suicide,'' Greene County  
Medical Examiner James Spindler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgil Dean Blehm had been dead for at least two days when  
deputies arrived at the couple's home Monday night. The deputies 
heard a gunshot just after they arrived, and they found Dorothy 
Blehm dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Blehm, 68, had been shot three times with a handgun. Mrs. Blehm,  
61, had two gunshot wounds to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive was unknown.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Blehm took two days off from her job as a nursing-home  
housekeeper last week, saying she needed to care for her husband 
because he was depressed, said Sandy Wyatt, an administrator at the

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Expectations that the Japanese government will  
announce a rebound in economic growth kept the dollar sharply lower 
against the yen today. Tokyo stocks edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.38 yen in early trading, down 1.94 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but higher than the late New York level 
of 118.88 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 59.58 points,  
or 0.04 percent, to finish the day at 16,622.50. On Tuesday, the 
average closed up 87.03 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar came under selling pressure overseas following rumors  
that a government report due Thursday would show that Japan may 
finally be recovering from its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors emerged that the report would show a rise in gross  
domestic product, perhaps indicating that Japan's economy has 
turned the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency's relative strength from its New York level  
came after traders bought the greenback to cover short, or 
oversold, positions amid concerns that Japanese financial officials 
might warn against a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, influential Japanese finance ministry official  
Eisuke Sakakibara warned against a strengthening of the yen before 
Japan's economy recovers. Traders said that caution remained today. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 119.05 yen and 119.63 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.88 yen, down  
from 125.98 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices finished higher today as  
domestic institutional investors joined foreign participants in 
buying high tech issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were heartened by the market's  
resilience during the morning session despite overnight weakness in 
New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 143 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.37 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,342.51. The 
TOPIX closed up 10.49 points, or 0.79 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 490.41 million shares, up from 371.35 million shares 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 726 to 423, while 147  
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.5700 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.5750 percent, driving its 
price up to 98.53 yen from 98.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Limit on Kosovo Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with a peace agreement at hand, the House  
debated a Republican-drafted measure Wednesday that would cut off 
future funds for military operations in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would strengthen security at the nation's nuclear labs  
in the aftermath of a congressional report on Chinese espionage, 
and provide for a 4.8 percent military pay raise in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, claiming the Kosovo measure could not be considered  
at a worse time, worked with some GOP help to try to strip the 
provision from a $288.8 billion defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would ``pull defeat from victory by cutting off  
funds,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior Democrat on the 
House Armed Services Committee, which voted in May to cut off funds 
for Kosovo after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Also late last month, House conservatives rebelled against an  
effort by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to remove the 
provision from the bill after strenuous administration objections. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the House took a second crack at passing the  
defense spending bill with the Kosovo funds prohibition attached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to have this particular debate,'' said  
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, noting that NATO and Yugoslav officials 
were working out final details for a Serb withdrawal and a halt to 
the allied bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Frost called the provision ``inappropriate and ill-advised. ...  
It makes the House a laughing stock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-led chamber has not been supportive of the NATO  
air campaign. On a tie vote in late April, it withheld support for 
the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defended their right to take up the issue,  
regardless of the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a huge embarrassment for us not to discuss the  
Kosovo situation,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The House voted 428 to 0 for a package of amendments  
from members of a House committee that last month concluded China 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The package beefs up counterintelligence programs at the Energy  
Department, requires polygraph tests of employees at national 
laboratories, restricts lab visits by foreigners, and requires a 
barrage of new reports to Congress on technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a balanced response to an urgent problem,'' said Rep.  
Christopher Cox, R-Calif, the chairman of the committee and the 
author of the amendments. ``Our report found wholesale inexcusable 
national security weaknesses...at our laboratories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the senior Democrat on the  
so-called Cox committee, said the package ``will help solve the 
glaring security problems we have at the laboratories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks also said Clinton and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson  
already had put into practice many of the security measures. 
``Let's stay away from the blame game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation includes nearly $40 million for  
counterintelligence activities at U.S. labs, about three times the 
president's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying defense bill also includes a 4.8 percent military  
pay raise for 2000, as does a Senate-passed measure, up from the 
4.4 percent proposed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration claims the pay package is expensive and could  
create a disparity with civilian pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also liberalizes the military retirement system,  
as does the Senate bill -- allowing military personnel to be able to 
retire after 20 years at 50 percent pay, up from the 40 percent 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provides $400 million more for ballistic missile defense  
programs than the $4.3 billion sought by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 

</P>
<P>
	The bill is HR 1401.

<HEADLINE> EU Investigates Exxon-Mobil Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The proposed $84 billion merger between  
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. faces additional scrutiny by European 
Union regulators, who announced they would open an in-depth 
investigation into the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to launch a second-phase probe, announced  
Wednesday, was widely expected by market analysts and competition 
lawyers. Wednesday marked the end of the EU's initial one-month 
inquiry into the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission said it will be examining the merger's  
competitive impact on the exploration, development and production 
of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the distribution of 
natural gas in the Netherlands and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also focus on how the deal might affect the lubricants  
supply chain and the refining and marketing of motor fuels in 
countries including Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and France. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Commission will now continue a detailed fact-finding  
operation using as a legal test the likelihood that the merger 
might create or reinforce a dominant position,'' the EU executive 
body said. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by the two companies said they expected the EU  
decision to launch a second-phase investigation, considering the 
size and complexity of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such an inquiry had been anticipated,'' the companies said.  
``It is unrealistic to expect the Commission to assess this merger 
and digest the large amount of information provided by Exxon and 
Mobil in a 30-day period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expect the regulatory review by both EU  
and U.S. authorities to be completed by around the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned merger between the two largest U.S. oil companies,  
announced in December, would create the world's sixth-largest oil 
producer and one of the largest companies overall with about $150 
billion in combined 1998 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly approved the  
marriage last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU Commission said it will continue to cooperate with the  
U.S. Federal Trade Commission and with Canadian competition 
authorities over the deal.

<HEADLINE> SEC Warns of 'Prime Bank' Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are warning the public  
against phony securities offerings known as ``prime bank'' notes as 
they pursue charges against an attorney and a consultant accused of 
defrauding investors of $6.2 million in such a scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims included an Ecuadorian charity for underprivileged  
girls, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, the SEC  
charged attorney Lewis Allen Rivlin and consultant Edwin Earl 
Huling III, who worked at Rivlin's firm, with securities fraud. 
Rivlin and Huling denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also charged Alfred Huascar Velarde, a former law  
partner of Rivlin, with aiding the fraudulent investment scheme. 
Velarde agreed to settle the charges by paying a $20,000 fine and 
promising to refrain from future violations of federal securities 
laws. He neither admitted to nor denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Huling's attorney described his client as an unwitting investor  
in the scheme and said he would contest the charges in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Huling ``invested his own money with Mr. Rivlin,'' said the  
attorney, Frank Razzano. ``He certainly had no knowledge of this'' 
being fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin, in a statement, denying any wrongdoing, accused the  
government of tapping his telephone and said the Ecuadorian 
charity's money was stolen by a Greek financier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hoped I would never be one of the arbitrary targets of  
ill-informed law enforcement, but I did not go into this activity 
without knowing with certainty that any such fight would be one I 
would win,'' Rivlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin worked as a Justice Department attorney before starting  
his own law firm in the 1970s. He is the former husband of Federal 
Reserve Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin, who announced last Thursday she 
was leaving the central bank to devote more time to her second job 
as head of the District of Columbia's financial control board. They 
divorced in 1977 after 22 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that Lewis Rivlin and Huling, with Velarde's  
help, sold some $6.2 million worth of sham securities to groups of 
investors, including the Ecuadorian charity. They allegedly 
portrayed their investment program as a pooling of investors' money 
to buy and resell at a profit the so-called ``prime bank'' notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ``prime bank'' schemes are a growing area of fraud in which  
ordinary investors -- especially seniors -- have lost millions of 
dollars, according to securities regulators. The schemes promise 
high, risk-free returns on debt notes said to be guaranteed by the 
world's biggest banks. Promoters often claim that only big 
corporations, foreign banks and super-rich individuals know about 
``prime bank'' notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prime bank offerings are a total scam; they do not exist,''  
SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said Tuesday. ``Investors 
should contact the SEC immediately if they are asked to invest in a 
prime bank offering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its suit against Rivlin and Huling, the SEC is seeking  
unspecified fines, an accounting of the money trail and 
compensation to investors. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fox Sports Net To Air WAC Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Fox Sports Net will televise up to 18  
Western Athletic Conference football games and 40 basketball games 
live over the next two seasons, WAC commissioner Karl Benson 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which also carries a three-year extension option,  
was approved by the WAC board of directors at its annual meeting in 
Napa Valley, Calif., the league said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson called the agreement with Fox Sports Net ``a major and  
important step for the television future of the Western Athletic 
Conference and its eight member institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For football, Fox Sports Net has agreed to televise up to three  
national and five regional games the first year, and five national 
and five regional games the second year. 
</P>
<P>
	For basketball, the deal calls for three to five national and 15  
regional games both years, according to the WAC. It includes the 
national telecast of the men's tournament championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competitiveness of the WAC and its intense regional  
rivalries have national implications on the rankings each year,'' 
Fox Sports Net executive vice president Arthur Smith said in the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight schools have left the WAC to form their own conference,  
called Mountain West. The remaining WAC schools are SMU, San Jose 
State, Fresno State, Hawaii, Rice, Texas Christian, Texas-El Paso 
and Tulsa.

<HEADLINE> New Drugs Blamed in 'Sleep Attacks' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two new drugs for Parkinson's disease may  
suddenly put patients to sleep, a dangerous narcolepsy-like side 
effect termed ``sleep attack'' that has caused at least eight 
people to have car wrecks, doctors warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration is talking with the  
manufacturers about whether the drugs need additional warning 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steven Frucht of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New  
York, who reported the eight cases in the journal Neurology, said 
Parkinson's patients should not overreact to the warning and stop 
taking the drugs, which can be very helpful at treating Parkinson's 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to discuss this possibility frankly with patients  
before starting this medication,'' advised Frucht, who still 
prescribes the medicines. Patients, he added, should talk with 
their doctors whether they feel sedated or ever have suffered a 
sleep attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight men taking the drug Mirapex, known chemically as  
pramipexole, suffered sleep attacks while driving that resulted in 
accidents, although none of the patients was injured, Frucht 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Four also experienced sleep attacks during business meetings and  
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Six stopped taking Mirapex and two others reduced the dose, and  
the sleep attacks stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	But one former Mirapex patient then switched to a second  
Parkinson's drug called Requip, known chemically as ropinirole, and 
suffered another sleep attack while driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect appears rare: Over 100,000 Americans take these  
drugs, and the FDA said it knew of no additional cases. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``unless you ask, many patients won't report this,'' Frucht  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the FDA approved Mirapex and Requip in 1997, it noted on  
the drugs' labels that they occasionally cause somnolence, and thus 
driving is not a good idea until the patient has taken the 
medicines long enough to tell if they are susceptible. 
</P>
<P>
	But somnolence -- that drowsy feeling that even over-the-counter  
drugs like antihistamines often cause -- is very different from a 
sleep attack, said Frucht, describing the attacks as overwhelming 
and irresistible sleepiness that comes on without warning. 
</P>
<P>
	How long a patient must take the drugs to see if they will be  
affected is questionable, he added. Frucht noted that the eight 
patients who had car wrecks had taken the medicines anywhere from 
one month to 14 months before the sleep attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``A sleep attack is for all intents and purposes meaningless if  
you're sitting in front of the TV,'' Frucht said. ``But they're 
driving on the highway. The next thing they knew they'd hit the car 
next to them, or the passenger screamed at them that they're going 
off the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frucht and colleagues at three Parkinson's centers alerted the  
drugs' manufacturers -- Pharmacia &AMP; UpJohn for Mirapex and 
SmithKline Beecham for Requip -- to the eight patients they treated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia &AMP; UpJohn said it is investigating whether patients  
just were drowsy from the drugs and driving made it worse, or if 
they indeed experienced the abrupt attack Frucht described. If so, 
the next question is whether patients took additional medications 
that interacted to cause the sleep attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 500,000 and 1.5 million Americans have Parkinson's,  
which causes progressive muscle rigidity, tremors and difficulty 
moving as they slowly lose a vital brain chemical called dopamine. 
Mirapex and Requip work by mimicking dopamine.

<HEADLINE> Coffe May Help Prevent Gallstones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Good news for the coffee generation: A study  
shows drinking a few cups of joe each day might help keep 
gallstones away. 
</P>
<P>
	The study published in today's edition of The Journal of the  
American Medical Association found that men who drank two to three 
cups a day had a 40 percent lower risk of gallstones than those who 
did not drink coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Men who drank four or more cups a day had a 45 percent lower  
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But hold the decaf: Only coffee with caffeine stimulates  
contractions in the gallbladder and lowers cholesterol in bile that 
can form painful gallstones. Decaffeinated coffee and caffeinated 
tea and soda didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't actually say we would recommend that people take up  
coffee just to prevent gallstones,'' said Dr. Michael F. Leitzmann 
of the Harvard University School of Public Health, the lead 
researcher. ``But it's OK to continue drinking it. Coffee doesn't 
cause any other major diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gallstones are painful deposits of cholesterol in the  
gallbladder, the organ under the liver that stores bile. They 
affect about 20 million Americans and cause 800,000 
hospitalizations each year, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of physical activity and being overweight are the two main  
causes, Leitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers followed 46,008 men from 1986 through 1996. The men,  
who were aged 40 to 75 in 1986, were members of the Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study, which is looking at dietary and 
lifestyle factors and their effect on diseases. Their caffeine 
intake was assessed several times in the course of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Leitzmann said there was no theoretical reason the results would  
not translate to women, but that a separate study would look at 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Magnuson, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins  
University who not involved in the study, has conducted animal 
research that reached similar conclusions about the link between 
coffee consumption and gallstones. 
</P>
<P>
	``But further research needs to be done to see what that link is  
and what it is in coffee that causes that relationship,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gucci Posts 49 Percent Profit Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Buoyed by a surge in sales, luxury  
goods maker Gucci Group on Wednesday posted a first-quarter net 
profit of $60.2 million, up nearly 50 percent from $40.5 million in 
the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Executive Domineco De Sole said he expected the group to  
have net earnings of approximately $3.40 a share in 1999. Gucci 
said its net sales increased 7.7 percent to $270 million, while 
operating profit improved 4.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the first quarter we posted strong sales and further  
consolidated Gucci's position as one of the leading luxury brands 
in the world,'' De Sole said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``In March we entered into a strategic alliance with  
PPR (Pinault-Printemps-Redoute of France), which ... will enable us 
to transform Gucci into the world's leading multi-brand luxury 
goods company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci fought to avoid a takeover by France's Louis Vuitton Moet  
Hennessy. Last month, a Dutch court upheld a decision by Gucci 
management to allow PPR to take a 42 percent, $2.9 billion interest 
in Gucci by issuing new shares and selling them to PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH, which had owned 34 percent of Gucci shares, was reduced to  
a 20 percent interest. LVMH said Wednesday it has filed two 
lawsuits with the Dutch Supreme Court and the Amsterdam District 
Court against Gucci and PPR, demanding the cancellation of Gucci's 
March 19 share issue to PPR. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the earnings pushed Gucci shares up nearly 6 percent in  
early trading Wednesday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci said it intends to open a large new ``flagship store'' in  
Tokyo in September and said it also will expand the number of its 
fine jewelry stores to 400 from 350 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Gucci said, the renovation of its main store began  
in May. The group said it's pleased with increased sales there but 
that additional costs for rent and depreciation of a temporary 
store will add about $7.5 million to operating expenses through the 
last three quarters of 1999.

<HEADLINE> NCAA May Bar Freshmen Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Freshmen would be barred from playing basketball under a  
proposal being considered by a special NCAA panel, according to USA 
Today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, aimed at giving both men and woman players a year  
to become accustomed to campus life, is given a 50-50 chance of 
being endorsed, NCAA president Cedric Dempsey told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-member panel studying the proposal includes school  
presidents, athletic directors and retired North Carolina coach 
Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior college transfers and international players also would be  
barred from playing in their first year at school. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel has moved toward an initial draft of recommendations  
to be presented at a June 23 meeting in Chicago, USA Today said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less radical proposals also are being considered, including one  
which would keep freshmen from playing until Jan. 1 or a school's 
second semester. Another idea would expand scholarships to cover 
summer enrollment before a student's first full year at school. 
</P>
<P>
	A ban on freshmen players would likely discourage some top high  
school players from going to college, presumably trying instead to 
go right to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey conceded that could happen, but added, ``College isn't  
for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also is studying a proposal that would delay the  
start of the season more than a month until Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the group is looking into an idea that would tie  
scholarship limits to a school's graduation rate.

<HEADLINE> Pleas Entered in Del. Secretary Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Two men whose testimony against their  
brother, a former governor's aide, helped convict him of murdering 
his mistress, pleaded guilty to federal charges and received 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement with prosecutors, Gerard Capano pleaded guilty  
yesterday to possession of a firearm by a drug user and was 
sentenced to three years of probation. Louis Capano Jr. pleaded to 
tampering with a witness and got one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both gave key testimony against their brother Thomas Capano, who  
was convicted and sentenced to death this year for murdering his 
mistress, Anne Marie Fahey, the governor's scheduling secretary, in 
June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerard Capano testified that he was with Thomas Capano when the  
lawyer dumped a body from his boat off the Atlantic coast the day 
after Ms. Fahey disappeared. Gerald testified that Thomas begged 
for his help after saying he might kill someone who was extorting 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Capano, a prominent Delaware developer, testified at his  
brother's trial that Thomas Capano had asked him to get rid of 
potential evidence.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Considering Barring Freshman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- The proposal is a long way from  
happening, but a group studying NCAA basketball is considering a 
drastic step: making male freshmen players ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is prompted by concerns over poor graduation rates, a  
freshman's ability to adapt to college life and the greater 
willingness of underclassmen to jump to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany is not certain the NCAA  
presidents would take such a step. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the answer to that,'' Delany told The Associated  
Press. ``But they should have the opportunity. I hope this 
committee is bold and does what it thinks is right for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 27 people, chaired by Syracuse president Buzz Shaw,  
was organized to examine problems in Division I basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was formed after Delany studied the matter and  
presented possible solutions, including making freshmen males 
ineligible. Freshmen have been eligible for basketball since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is expected to make its recommendations in late  
July. The NCAA board of directors might not rule until October 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there is mixed sentiment among members of the  
working group on freshman eligibility,'' NCAA president Cedric 
Dempsey said. ``I would say there has been a growing interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the NCAA were to bar freshmen, the decision might be  
challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a judge would listen to different treatment for men's  
basketball if you could demonstrate with data how unhealthy 
Division I men's basketball really is,'' said Delany, a former 
chairman of the NCAA's tournament selection committee. ``You would 
need to have rationale for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delany conceded that barring freshmen males from basketball  
could encourage them to jump from high school to the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to me, that should not be a primary consideration,''  
Delany said. ``Those players are not going to be (in school) very 
long anyway. At the end of the day, that's not an NCAA problem. 
That's a problem for the NBA players' association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another possibly controversial move, the group is thinking  
about asking the board of directors to tie scholarship limits to 
graduation rates. Schools with low graduation rates in men's 
basketball would have fewer scholarships to offer than those with 
higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would want to be sure that schools are not penalized when  
student-athletes leave school in good academic standing,'' Dempsey 
said. ``We wanted people to use their imaginations, and they 
certainly are doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Males would be singled out for freshmen ineligibility because of  
their consistently low graduation rates. According to the NCAA's 
latest statistics, only 41 percent of male basketball players in 
the 1991 entering class got their degrees, including just 37 
percent of black players. That was the lowest of all groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The graduation rate for all Division I athletes was 57 percent.  
The rate for female basketball players, 66 percent, was the 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the general feeling is that the women  
student-athletes are not faced with the same kinds of issues that 
many of the male student-athletes are faced with,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are several different options being looked at. I'm not  
sure which ones will surface at this point. But one concept is 
letting the entry-level student-athletes, including transfer 
students and international students, sit out a year and concentrate 
on their academics.''

	Kosovo Deal Could Come Tonight  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- An agreement between NATO and Yugoslav  
commanders on a pullout of Serb troops from Kosovo ``could be 
signed tonight,'' a senior U.S. official said today. NATO's bombing 
of Yugoslavia would be suspended within hours if the initial 
withdrawal of the troops is verified, the official said. Earlier

sentence remained in dispute in the deal being worked out in

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican-sponsored legislation that would

being criticized by Democrats who warn that it could undermine the 
peace process. Democrats said they would attempt later today to 
strip the provision from a defense spending bill. The House debate

for any costs associated with rebuilding Serbia under a Kosovo 
peace plan, as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains in power.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused House Republicans  
today of pushing a watered-down gun-control bill ``plainly

internal Republican polling shows strong support nationwide for a 
series of gun-control measures, including an increase in the 
allowable age for handgun purchases from 18 to 21. The GOP survey, 
conducted late last month in the wake of the Littleton, Colo., high 
school shootings, also found lopsided public backing for mandatory 
background checks for gun show sales, safety devices for guns and 
mandatory sentences for felons who commit their crimes with a gun.

Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and Williamson Tobacco

eventually will be an eight-story pharmacy academic building, gave 
way about 8:15 a.m., university spokeswoman Amy Toburen said. The

<HEADLINE> Okla. Diverts Nichols Trial Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Gov. Frank Keating on Wednesday signed a  
bill to divert $1.2 million from the planned murder trial of 
Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols to a fund to help 
victims of last month's deadly tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes amid controversy over attempts to try Nichols on  
state charges and have him face the death penalty. Nichols has been 
convicted in federal court and is serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lawmakers were angry that money was being spent on a  
redundant prosecution when tornado victims needed financial help. 
Although he abided by the reallocation, Keating was not backing 
away from a prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	He told lawmakers they should come up with another $1.2 million  
for Nichols' trial, saying the state has a ``moral obligation'' to 
proceed with a prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to come up with the money,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Many have said a trial would be too expensive -- some senators  
say as much as $20 million -- and a waste because Nichols has 
already been convicted and may not face a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, was convicted on federal charges for the April 19,  
1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that killed 
168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy did not file  
first-degree murder charges against Nichols' co-defendant, Timothy 
McVeigh, who was sentenced to death for his role in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature appropriated $4 million this year to help  
victims of May tornadoes that destroyed thousands of homes and 
killed 44 people. The money was also to help victims of severe 
storms and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	But the funds were estimated to be too little.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Off 75.35 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rallied Wednesday, but failed  
to lift the broader market as the threat of higher interest rates 
kept investors on edge and alert to changes in bond market yields. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.35 to close at  
10,690.29, extending Tuesday's 143.74-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 1.31 to 1,318.64, and the Nasdaq composite index, which has a 
high representation of technology stocks, rose 44.79 to 2,519.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors kept their focus primarily on interest rates. Over the  
past few weeks, stocks and bonds have been rattled by fears that 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to hold off 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Treasury market, the declining price of the government's  
30-year bond has pushed its yield above the psychologically 
important 6 percent barrier, to 6.02 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure of 6 percent is weighing on investors,'' said  
Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates often lower corporate profits. A yield of  
6 percent might also prompt some stock investors to switch to bonds 
because at that level, they offer a more stable, guaranteed return 
than volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say stocks may have trouble picking up any true  
momentum at least until Friday, when the government will report on 
producer prices. The report is expected to offer the latest 
suggestion of whether inflation is indeed rising. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is in a standoff, and with little volume, the  
market can be pushed higher or lower very easily,'' Cripps said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of technology bellwethers were mostly higher Wednesday  
after the Semiconductor Industry Association said 1999 sales are 
expected to grow faster than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said growing acceptance of the Internet and electronic  
commerce is driving chip sales. Chip maker Intel rose 1 7/16 to 53 1/8 
and Applied Materials, a maker of chip components, rose 3 to 64 
13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Research firm International Data Corp. issued a positive  
forecast for global shipments of personal computers, boosting PC 
makers including Dell, which gained 1 1/2 to 35 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications, a provider of long-distance telephone and  
Internet services, rose 3 11/16 to 47 after the regional phone 
company BellSouth said it was considering purchasing Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the technology sector, there wasn't much good news to  
move the market. Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 2 9/16 to 92 1/4, led the Dow 
lower after the company announced a restructuring that will 
eliminate 15,000 jobs and close 10 plants worldwide over six years. 
Some analysts said the plan wouldn't help much in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer sank 6 1/16 to 104 15/16 after the U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration restricted the use of its antibiotic Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks mostly fell as Warburg Dillon Read became the  
latest Wall Street firm to question their short-term earnings 
potential. Delta Air Lines lost 3 1/8 to close at 56 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman Kodak, a Dow component, rose 1/4 to 69 3/4 following word  
that chairman and chief executive officer George Fisher will step 
down as CEO at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's market proved inhospitable to several companies  
making their initial public offerings. Of four new issues, only 
DiTech Corp., a telecommunications company, rose more than a few 
cents from its opening price. DiTech was priced at 11 and closed at 
12 9/16, a far cry from the double-digit gains that accompanied 
IPOs a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume remained extremely light as investors continued to hold  
off on any new positions until they receive a clearer indication of 
the Fed's next move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lack of volume almost always defines minimal conviction,''  
said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; 
Co. in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 794.35 
million shares, down from 835.12 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.49 to 629.28, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.07 to 772.99. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.43 to 445.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.04 percent.  
Germany's DAX index was up 1.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sabres No Longer Content To Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres got the victory in Dallas they  
so wanted -- one that gave them home ice advantage in the Stanley 
Cup finals, and, if only temporarily, the mental edge in a sport 
where mind games always matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, flush from the success of a Game 1 they admittedly stole in  
overtime 3-2 from the supposedly superior Dallas Stars, do the 
Sabres dare think they can do it again in Game 2 Thursday night? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes. But make that a cautious yes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy with the split anymore,'' coach Lindy Ruff said  
Wednesday. ``You go on the road hoping for a split but, if you win 
the first game, you want to steal two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you always want to take it shift by shift, period by  
period,'' the Sabres' Curtis Brown said. ``You don't ever want to 
get ahead of yourself. I think we showed that last night. If you 
start looking too far down the road ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	You might get run over by a Zamboni. Or, even worse, one of  
those six large Stars defensemen who wouldn't look out of place in 
a Cowboys' uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	But, despite the Stars' superior season -- they had 51 victories  
to Buffalo's 37 -- they were exceedingly aware of the dangers of 
underestimating a team with Dominik Hasek in goal. Especially one 
that is 13-3 in the playoffs and 7-0 at Marine Midland Arena, where 
the series shifts Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	If they weren't before, they are now.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek kept the Sabres from getting buried in Game 1, stopping 35  
shots and denying a single goal on any of the Stars' final nine 
power plays even as Buffalo was being outshot at one point by 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Give the save -- and the steal -- to Hasek, who dismissed  
suggestions that he reinjured his groin in a steamy, noisy arena. 
He was so spent when the game ended he couldn't join his 
celebrating teammates, but he blamed that on heat, fatigue and 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired,'' he said. ``I tried to get to the other side  
of the ice but I made a couple of steps and I said, `No more.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, exactly what he said to Dallas.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Stars warn the series has only started, even if  
Buffalo could win its first Stanley Cup merely by winning its 
remaining home games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars believe their own complacency led to this 1-0 deficit,  
not just Hasek's play, and they are certain they know how to fix it 
in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize what we did wrong, and the coaches and players  
know how to correct it,'' center Mike Modano said. ``You probably 
won't see the same effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars are convinced they didn't force Hasek to make nearly  
enough difficult saves, even if Pat Verbeek had two excellent 
chances in overtime just before Jason Woolley scored the game 
winner at 15:30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be more aggressive and feed off that,'' Modano  
said. ``We've got to take more quality shots in front of the net 
and not leave that area until the puck does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Stars recognize the dangers of their predicament.  
Go down 2-0, and they might not come back -- in the series or to 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a desperate situation, trust me,'' coach Ken  
Hitchcock said. ``I think our team recognizes that, as well as we 
played, we've got to find another gear. When we face adversity, we 
pull together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about these series is the best team prevails  
over time, and things change as the adversity goes up and down,'' 
the Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the league was  
reviewing Brian Skrudland's head butt on the Sabres' Vaclav Varada. 
The first-period incident was unnoticed by many in the arena, 
including Bettman, but was replayed several times on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a head butt,'' Ruff said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is obviously under review, but whether or not we do  
anything about it isn't something I am prepared to address right 
now,'' Bettman said.

<HEADLINE> Charity Installs Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The relief agency Feed The Children will  
install a donated video surveillance system in an effort to prevent 
future employee theft at its Nashville warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Feed The Children temporarily closed the 274,000-square-foot  
Nashville warehouse and fired all 14 Nashville employees a week ago 
after Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents found boxloads of 
donations in the homes of several upper-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly $20,000 surveillance system will include a dozen  
palm-sized cameras, a monitor and a time-lapse recorder. One camera 
will monitor the inside of the front exit. The rest will watch the 
warehouse perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The system could be monitored from Feed The Children's Oklahoma  
City headquarters, said spokeswoman Emilee Truelove, but she said 
there were no plans to do that yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to this point it was like considering putting a camera in a  
church,'' she said Tuesday. ``We've just had a level of trust 
that's no longer there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The security system is being donated by Nashville alarm company  
Creative Alarm Systems whose employees heard about the thefts. Feed 
The Children will pay none of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like we needed to do something on a community effort  
to try to help them any way we could,'' Creative president Tom 
Burnside said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizures followed a four-month investigation by Nashville  
television station WTVF, which secretly videotaped the staff 
carting boxes of donated goods into their cars and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Torry Johnson said he is awaiting the results  
of a state investigation before deciding whether to file charges 
against the staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure of the Nashville office has prevented 201 agencies  
in 20 states from getting food from the charity. The states are 
Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, Georgia, Illinois, Virginia, 
Alabama, Arkansas, New York, Texas, Oklahoma, California, Missouri, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Massachusetts, Mississippi, 
South Dakota and Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Secret Message Hidden in Dot of DNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Updating a Nazi spy trick used during World War II, scientists  
have devised a way of hiding a coded message in a dot of human DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique wouldn't be of much use to secret agents because  
it is a cumbersome way of sending a message. It is little more than 
a neat trick that exploits the enormous capacity of DNA to hold 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Nazi spies sent messages by reducing them photographically to a  
so-called microdot. The dot was then pasted over a period at the 
end of a sentence in an innocent-looking letter, which was dropped 
in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, researchers led by  
molecular biologist Carter Bancroft at the Mount Sinai School of 
Medicine in New York describe how they made -- and mailed -- a 
microdot that contained a secret message hidden amid millions of 
strands of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	Bancroft likened it to a page from the ``Where's Waldo''  
children's books, where Waldo is hidden in a large, detailed 
drawing of lots of people. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA is shaped like a twisted ladder, with four kinds of rungs,  
called bases. The scientists built a DNA strand in which different 
combinations of bases represented the letters of their message. 
</P>
<P>
	At either end of the strand they put sequences of bases that  
would serve as the key to finding the strand. The strand was one 
three-thousandths the width of a human hair in length. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists then chopped the entire DNA of a human cell into  
pieces of about the same length, and mixed them with the message 
strand. 
</P>
<P>
	They soaked the mixture into paper with a period printed on it,  
cut out the period and pasted it onto a letter. They mailed the 
letter to themselves to prove that the DNA could survive the rigors 
of the U.S. mail. 
</P>
<P>
	When the letter arrived, they extracted the DNA, multiplied  
millions of times the strand containing the message, and read its 
contents. The message they chose for their test was perhaps the 
most famous secret of the microdot era: ``June 6 invasion: 
Normandy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without knowing the key, it would be practically impossible to  
find the message among the 3 million or so similar strands of DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely an intriguing idea,'' said Anne Condon, a  
computer scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ``It 
exploits one of the great advantages of DNA, which is that you can 
have a huge amount of information in a tiny volume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conventional computers would not be of much use in reading a DNA  
microdot, Condon said. Instead, it might require advances in DNA 
computing, the fledgling field of making DNA strands do math, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for any practical applications, you would need a biochemical  
lab both to write and to read the messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point of cryptography, it's more of intellectual  
interest,'' Bancroft said.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From Mrs. Dole Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Comments by Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole  
during an interview with The Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On President Clinton's leadership during the Kosovo campaign:  
</P>
<P>
	``I do think that there are instances ... both on domestic  
matters and foreign policy, where we needed stronger leadership, 
where there was too much waiting to see which way the polls were 
going. ... Your allies and your adversaries both need to understand 
where you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Defending her record at the Red Cross, which has been the  
subject of a critical review by the KPMG Peat Marwick auditing 
firm: 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really one of the most far reaching contributions that I  
have had the opportunity to make in 30-plus years of service to the 
public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On rival Texas Gov. George W. Bush's Republican presidential  
campaign: 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush is doing his thing. I'm doing mine. I'm staying  
focused. I'm not going to be distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic being indicted as a war  
criminal: 
</P>
<P>
	``It means nothing to indict him as a war criminal if he's not  
going to be arrested and taken to The Hague. ... I think the next 
person that talks to him should be the one who arrests him and 
takes him to The Hague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On women's role in society:  
</P>
<P>
	``Women make different choices. There's not one mold for  
everyone. Every woman doesn't have to go into the work force. ... 
My path was a different one. It's in the marketplace. And I'm doing 
everything I can to help women in the marketplace.''

<HEADLINE> Firms Create Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Goldman Sachs Group and  
Madoff Securities announced Tuesday the have formed an electronic 
trading system that will compete with traditional stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Their venture is called Primex Trading, and is the latest in a  
string of electronic communications networks that have popped up to 
offer investors another way to trade stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Primex's gimmick is that it displays all stock orders to an  
electronic ``crowd'' of participants, who then compete, via 
computer, for the best price. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the New York Stock Exchange, relies on a large  
group of brokers who gather on the floor of the exchange and call 
out their competing offers to buy or sell shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Systems like Primex, so far, have not yet been able to attract  
enough buyers and sellers to truly compete with the NYSE. But with 
high profile companies like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, two of 
Wall Street's biggest brokerages, behind the Primex, that could 
start to change. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is scheduled to go online by June 2000.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Talks to House Freshman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley delivered a soft sell  
Wednesday to first-term House members, sharing his ideas but not 
asking them directly to support his campaign for the White House 
against Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	A former three-term senator and the only Democrat thus far to  
oppose Gore for the party's nomination, met behind closed doors 
with about a dozen members of the 23-person Democratic freshman 
class, plus a few veteran lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	People in attendance described the morning meeting as a low-key  
discussion of issues rather than an appeal for support. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., said the meeting was informal and  
informational. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave a general discussion of what he's been finding out on  
the campaign trail, and why he can win,'' said Holt, a freshman who 
is neutral for now on the Gore-Bradley race. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt's administrative assistant, Steve Maviglio, said one  
congressman asked Bradley how he counters the notion of Gore's 
invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley replied that ``he's able to do retail politics in New  
Hampshire and Iowa, while the vice president is encumbered by 50 
Secret Service and staff,'' Maviglio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley told the group that freshman House Democrats have the  
most at stake in 2000, when they will be seeking reelection for the 
first time and need the best candidate at the top of their ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley hopes to win the support of Democrats in Congress,  
for now he is just sharing ideas, said his spokesman, Eric Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point what we're doing is making the connection and  
letting them know what we're doing and why he's running,'' Hauser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats were careful to describe the meeting as  
fundamentally different from a gathering of a candidate and his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash., organized the breakfast as president  
of the Democratic freshman class. Baird's chief of staff, Joe 
Shoemaker, noted that Gore will meet with the group July 1. Baird 
also is neutral in the Bradley-Gore race. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has locked up the endorsements of numerous national  
Democratic figures including House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt 
of Missouri and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone gave Bradley his first  
congressional endorsement.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Lineup Different in Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres will face a slightly different  
Dallas Stars squad in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Wednesday he has a few lineup  
changes planned for tonight in hopes of getting more out of his 
team. Dallas played two strong periods in Game 1, but lost the 
opener 3-2 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Without being specific, Hitchcock indicated that two of the new  
faces in the rotation could be Tony Hrkac and Derek Plante. 
</P>
<P>
	Hrkac has played just two playoff games because of cracked ribs.  
Plante, acquired from Buffalo at the trading deadline, has sat the 
last eight games after playing six of the first 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said he needs to do something to counter the Sabres'  
depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the one thing that we found against Buffalo is that  
they have more than two lines that can score,'' he said. ``They 
really get offensive production throughout their lineup. As a team, 
you have be prepared to match that throughout your lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we've got some people who are offensive people who we'll  
look at using.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock also noted that some of his older players could use a  
break after going seven games against Colorado in the Western 
Conference finals and six games against St. Louis in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a chance to get some young legs in there and some  
quickness,'' he said. ``If we're smart, we'll take advantage of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Dallas wins Game 2, the Stanley Cup finals will end a streak  
of four straight sweeps. On Wednesday, Stars centers Mike Modano 
and Joe Nieuwendyk laughed at the suggestion they could be the 
fifth straight victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' Modano said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about a sweep,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``We've got  
a lot of veteran guys in here who have been through this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Carbonneau, Craig Ludwig and Brian Skrudland were on the  
1986 Montreal team that lost Game 1 to Calgary, then came back to 
win the Cup. Mike Keane was on the '93 Canadiens club that dropped 
Game 1 at home to Los Angeles and also rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Those comebacks are significant because they're two of only 12  
clubs that became champions after being down 1-0. Dallas already 
clawed back from a 3-2 deficit in the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we face adversity,'' Hitchcock said, ``we pull  
together.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Valentine, Reporter Argue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine got into a  
heated argument with a reporter before Wednesday night's game 
against the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	During his pregame news conference, Valentine was confronted by  
Newsday reporter Marty Noble, who was upset by comments the manager 
made about him during a radio interview on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine wondered how Noble could cover the team, saying the  
writer had not talked to the manager in more than a year. The two 
have feuded ever since Valentine called Noble a liar in reference 
to an article written more than a year ago about former catcher 
Todd Hundley's nocturnal habits. 
</P>
<P>
	During the argument Wednesday, Noble acknowledged he had only  
asked Valentine questions once, during spring training about the 
death of Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Valentine he didn't ask the manager other questions  
because the answers were always lies. The two then shouted back and 
forth for about three minutes, calling each other liars. 
</P>
<P>
	Noble then walked away and Valentine continued his news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine has been under fire since half his coaching staff was  
let go on Saturday. Noble broke the story that the team planned to 
fire pitching coach Bob Apodaca.

<HEADLINE> Two Skating Judges Are Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Two judges accused of colluding  
over scores at the World Figure Skating Championships were 
suspended by the International Skating Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Sviatoslav Babenko received a three-year ban, while  
Alfred Korytek of Ukraine was suspended for two years, USI general 
secretary Fredi Schmid told The Associated Press today. The two 
will not be allowed to officiate at any championship or 
international event under USI jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an investigation and the conclusions were there was  
obviously misconduct,'' Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Videotape showed the judges exchanging glances, making gestures  
and possibly conversing during the final of the pairs event at the 
world championships in Helsinki in March. ISU rules require judges 
to determine scores independently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won  
the event and the decision was loudly derided by the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd favorite was Shen Xue and Hongbo Zhao of China, who  
followed the Russians with a spectacularly athletic performance. 
The tape shows Korytek and Babenko glancing at each other as the 
Chinese pair were taking bows, before the scores were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmid said the USI did not plan to change the results.  
</P>
<P>
	``That is a different story. We only have evidence that there  
was misconduct,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmid said the difference in the length of suspensions for the  
two judges was based on their past record. 
</P>
<P>
	Korytek was one of the judges in the 1994 Olympics controversy  
centering around Oksana Baiul of Ukraine winning the gold in a 5-4 
vote. He also is the father of Baiul's first coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges have the right to go before the ISU's appeals  
committee, and could ultimately take their case to the Court of 
Arbitration for Sport. Schmid said they had not yet appealed.

<HEADLINE> Conviction Overturned in Cosby Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court Wednesday overturned  
Autumn Jackson's conviction on charges she tried to extort $40 
million from Bill Cosby by threatening to tell the tabloids that 
she was his illegitimate daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge  
improperly instructed the jury on the law pertaining to extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also overturned the convictions of two accomplices for  
the same reason, ordering the case returned to the lower court for 
a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The court added, however, that ``evidence at trial was plainly  
sufficient to support verdicts of guilty had the jury been properly 
instructed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, said  
prosecutors haven't decided whether to appeal the ruling or ask for 
a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left with Ms. Jackson's lawyer was not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jackson was sentenced in 1997 to two years and two months in  
prison after she was convicted of extortion, conspiracy and 
crossing state lines to commit a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Jackson demanded the money from Cosby on  
Jan. 16, 1997 -- the day Cosby's 27-year-old son, Ennis, was shot to 
death in a robbery while changing a flat on a Los Angeles highway. 
If Cosby failed to comply, she said, she would tell her story to 
the supermarket tabloids. The slaying of Cosby's son was unrelated 
to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Ms. Jackson and Jose Medina were arrested in New  
York in an FBI sting after signing a $24 million payoff agreement 
with Cosby's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case tarnished Cosby's wholesome TV image as husband and  
father when he was forced to disclose an affair with Ms. Jackson's 
mother, Shawn Upshaw, in the 1970s. He had provided her with more 
than $100,000 in support over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he repeatedly denied he is Ms. Jackson's father, telling  
jurors that he told Ms. Jackson: ``I will be for you a father 
figure, but I am not your father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of paternity was ruled irrelevant to the charges.  
Cosby took a paternity test after the trial to try to settle the 
dispute, but Ms. Jackson and her mother declined to take blood 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also overturned the case against Medina, who  
was sentenced to five years and three months in prison, and Boris 
Sabas, who got three months behind bars.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Wants Movie Lawsuit Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Pictures has asked a federal judge  
to dismiss a $50 million lawsuit over the rights to a movie about 
the life of former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	If the suit's allegations are true, Ali should be the defendant  
rather than the movie company and its parent, Sony Pictures 
Entertainment, Columbia attorney Jim Quinn told U.S. District Judge 
Samuel Wilson on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plaintiffs, former Ali spiritual adviser Jabir Herbert  
Muhammad of Chicago and Jason Hirschfeld, the son of Ali's former 
lawyer, did not name Ali a defendant in the suit filed in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleges that Muhammad and Hirschfeld are partners with  
Ali in Muhammad Ali Productions Inc., which the suit said was 
formed in Virginia in 1988, when Ali lived near Charlottesville, to 
``own, develop and commercialize any authorized biographical or 
autobiographical story of the life and times of Ali.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn argued that the case is a breach-of-contract matter  
between Ali and the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Cooter, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told Wilson that  
Ali did not have the authority to sell the rights to his life story 
and that Columbia's movie, which is to star Will Smith, bars any 
hope of Muhammad or Hirschfeld making a film. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he will rule in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Boston Cops Probe Radio Jamming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A black police commander's radio transmissions  
were jammed while he directed transportation for Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, and authorities are investigating whether it was 
intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander, Lt. Valimore Williams, found a noose made of  
police tape on his motorcycle in April and has filed a $1.2 million 
discrimination complaint against the Boston Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have determined that Williams' radio was jammed Friday by  
the radio used by Sgt. Michael R. Donovan, a white officer who was 
transferred last month, according to published reports Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan was the supervisor of the officer who admitted making  
the noose. An internal investigation concluded the noose was part 
of a prank by both white and black subordinate officers. Williams 
nonetheless filed the discrimination complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no problems during Mrs. Clinton's visit, but the  
Boston Herald quoted a police source as saying that security could 
have been compromised by what he called ``foolishness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radio transmissions can be jammed, intentionally or  
unintentionally, during events like motorcades when several 
officers are sharing the same frequency. Williams himself said 
Friday's incident ``could be a coincidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan was not in his office Wednesday and could not be reached  
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Accuses Bank of Selling Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A large bank illegally sold account  
balance information and other private data on a million customers 
to a telemarketing company for $4 million, Minnesota officials 
alleged in a lawsuit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank violated the federal Fair Credit  
Reporting Act and engaged in consumer fraud and deceptive 
advertising, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court by 
Attorney General Mike Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch asked the court to prohibit the bank from exchanging  
customers' personal information and to make the bank pay civil 
penalties to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Information sold by the bank included customer names, Social  
Security numbers, birth dates, credit limits, marital status, 
occupation and home ownership status, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Member Works Inc., of Stamford, Conn., said it used the data to  
sell services such as memberships in a medical discount program. 
The bank also illegally allowed Member Works to automatically 
withdraw payments from checking accounts without written customer 
authorization, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp, parent company of U.S. Bank, denied the  
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our direct marketing program is very carefully managed. Our  
partners at no time have access to customer accounts,'' said Donn 
Waage, a spokesman for the nation's 13th-largest bank holding 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70,000 bank customers have purchased products through  
Member Works, Waage said. ``When customers agree to purchase a 
product, their approval is voice-recorded with their permission,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative of Member Works did not return a call for  
comment Wednesday. Hatch said a lawsuit also could be filed against 
Member Works. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said 1 million people were affected in 17 states:  
California, Colorado, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, 
Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, 
Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dies in Maryland Walkway Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARBUTUS, Md. (AP) -- A truck carrying an improperly loaded  
backhoe struck and collapsed an unused pedestrian bridge, killing a 
man underneath. Five others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Taylor, 54, died when the front of his sport utility  
vehicle was pinned under the rubble of the Maiden Choice bridge. 
The front ends of two others cars also were crushed. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers who witnessed Tuesday's accident on Interstate 695  
grabbed crow bars and tried to pry open the door of the vehicle. 
Taylor died at the scene, said Baltimore County Fire Department 
spokesman Capt. Michael Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Three women were in critical but stable condition at the  
University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. Two other people 
suffered minor injuries, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, Paul C. McIntosh, 23, of Ontario, Canada, will  
undergo routine testing for drugs and alcohol, Maryland State 
Police said. He has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	State police spokesman Pete Piringer said that the truck was  
improperly loaded when it hit struck an earlier bridge moments 
before the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
	McIntosh told investigators he didn't know that he'd struck  
anything until he hit the second bridge. No one on the concrete 
bridge, which had been closed for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said the elbow of the backhoe hit the bridge, seeming  
to lift it up before it crashed down on the sport utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Slavin, 21, who was crossing a nearby bridge on foot said  
he at first thought someone had blown up the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared. It shook my whole body. It shook from my feet to  
my head,'' Slavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic in both directions on Interstate 695 -- the main artery  
around Baltimore -- was routed to Interstate 95 and local roads. 
Early today the interstate was reopened.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Loewer Has Serious Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies right-hander Carlton  
Loewer went on the disabled list Wednesday with a stress fracture 
in his humerus bone, the same one Tony Saunders fractured while 
throwing a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Saunders, Dave Dravecky, Tom Browning and John Smiley,  
Loewer's injury was caught before it turned into another horrible 
fracture on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewer had complained of weakness in his pitching arm for about  
a month and was persuaded to have an MRI on Wednesday. It revealed 
a partial stress fracture of the right humerus bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the injury not been caught early, Loewer could have  
sustained the kind of terrifying injury suffered by Saunders, the 
Tampa Bay left-hander who broke the bone while throwing a pitch on 
May 26, team doctor Phillip Marone said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thankfully, because of good communication, it was caught  
before something terrible happened,'' Phillies manager Terry 
Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewer, the Phillies' No. 3 starter, was placed on the 15-day  
disabled list. General manager Ed Wade said, ``This is not 
portrayed as anything close to career-ending.'' But Marone would 
not give a timetable for Loewer's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a fracture on the mound,'' Wade said. ``It's not  
Tommy John surgery. It's not a torn labrum. I view it as an 
aberration more than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Wolf, a 22-year-old left-hander, was promoted from  
Triple-A and will start Friday against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewer took batting practice Wednesday and was shagging fly  
balls with the rest of the pitchers when Francona summoned him to 
reveal the bad news. Loewer was ``very emotional,'' Francona said, 
and didn't want to talk with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked,'' said Francona, his usually upbeat voice knocked  
down to a somber tone. ``It doesn't have anything to do with how 
good he is. It has to do with the kind of kid he is. He's the 
nicest kid in the world, and he tries every time to do his best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loewer's injury resulted from wear and tear over time, not a  
single pitch, Marone said. Though it could have been worse, news of 
Loewer's fate cast a disquieting mood in the Phillies' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty minutes ago he was out there hitting and thought he was  
fine,'' Francona said. ``He actually said, `I feel good. I'm not 
concerned about it.' It's a good thing we got this done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The humerus is the same bone Dravecky broke while throwing his  
final pitch in the majors for San Francisco on Aug. 15, 1989. 
Saunders broke it while delivering a pitch to Juan Gonzalez of 
Texas two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning broke his left arm while throwing a pitch in a game in  
1994 and never was an effective major league pitcher again. Smiley 
broke his left humerus while warming up for a game with Cleveland 
in 1997 and has not pitched in the majors since. 
</P>
<P>
	All four of them were left-handed, while Loewer is right-handed.  
Marone said there is no explanation for the seeming rash of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's cyclical, maybe,'' Marone said. ``Let's face it, these  
people are not doing something like you and me. We really don't 
know what the cause of it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loewer has lost three straight decisions and hasn't won since  
pitching a five-hit shutout against the Padres on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was diagnosed exactly a year to the day after  
Loewer's first callup to the majors on June 10, 1998. Four days 
later, he pitched a five-hit complete game in his major league 
debut against the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf, 22, was 4-5 with a 3.61 ERA at Scranton-Wilkes Barre. He  
had 72 strikeouts in 77 1-3 innings. The Phillies had wanted to 
leave Wolf in the minors all season and give him a shot at making 
the rotation next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not ready to anoint Randy as a member of our starting  
rotation for the next 20 years,'' Wade said. ``We'll see how it 
goes.''

<HEADLINE> Dad Expelled From Daughter's Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- Another father is causing problems in  
women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	The father of 17-year-old Australian player Jelena Dokic was  
ejected from a Wimbledon warmup tournament for shouting abuse at 
officials during his daughter's match. He was later arrested for 
lying down in traffic and jumping on the hood of a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Dokic had been drinking and was arrested ``for his  
own safety.'' He was not charged and was released three hours after 
his arrest, ``when he sobered up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anything bad has been done,'' Jelena Dokic said.  
``It was just a person cheering. I don't think there's anything 
wrong with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty thousand people do a lot of it at the French Open in  
the final and no one thinks there's a problem with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Damir Dokic was removed by security guards at  
the DFS Classic at Edgbaston on Tuesday and banned from the rest of 
the tournament. If he causes any further trouble, he risks a long 
ban from all women's events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Dokic's conduct will be closely monitored and further  
incidents at any time could result in an extension of the ban or 
the revocation of any or all privileges at future WTA Tour 
events,'' the tour said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jelena Dokic won the U.S. Open junior tournament last year and  
finished last season as the No. 1 junior. She turned professional 
in January and is one of the most highly regarded young players. 
Her next tournament is Wimbledon, which begins June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take this very seriously and one more incident we could do  
to him what we did to Jim Pierce,'' WTA Tour spokesman Joe Favorito 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Pierce, the father of French player Mary Pierce, was banned  
from WTA Tour events from 1993-98 for what the WTA called abusive 
behavior. He has been readmitted with ``severe restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Security is as good at Wimbledon as any place and we have  
already spoken to them about what's happened,'' Favorito said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jelena Dokic's first-round match Tuesday against Rita Grande of  
Italy was suspended because of rain with the Australian leading the 
third set 2-1. When play resumed Wednesday, Grande rallied to win 
2-6, 6-3, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that disturbs me is that I didn't think he had done  
anything wrong, just shouting a few `come ons,''' Jelena Dokic 
said. ``I definitely think the English are a bit fussy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament officials said Damir Dokic was wrestled to the ground  
while hundreds of spectators looked on after he had shouted abuse 
at tennis officials who had repeatedly asked him to tone down his 
cheering. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Dokic, who is of Serbian heritage and lives in  
Australia, also shouted insults in apparent reference to NATO's 
bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he went out of the match he went on a little rampage,  
lying down in the street and blocking traffic and jumping on the 
hood of a car,'' Favorito said. ``He was apparently lying in front 
of traffic babbling about how good Australia was and how bad 
England was.''

<HEADLINE> 7 Feared Dead in Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A sightseeing helicopter crashed near a  
glacier Wednesday, and seven people were feared dead, the Fire 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter went down near Herbert Glacier, 20 miles north of  
Juneau, Fire Chief Mike Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau is a popular cruise ship destination, and tourists  
frequently hire helicopters to view the area's spectacular 
glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle said emergency crews were headed for the scene but did not  
expect to find any survivors. A hospital was told by fire officials 
not to expect any injured people. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a helicopter on a sightseeing trip over Juneau  
collided with a small plane. One person aboard the plane was 
killed.

<HEADLINE> Study: Stroke Drug's Effects Linger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A lifesaving drug that has revolutionized emergency-room  
treatment of strokes isn't just a short-term fix, researchers 
reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Their study found that patients treated with TPA within three  
hours after a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain are less 
likely to be severely disabled a year afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were reported by Dr. Thomas Kwiatkowski of Long  
Island Jewish Medical Center and doctors at eight other U.S. 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The clot-dissolving medicine is the only drug approved for  
treating strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved TPA, or tissue  
plasminogen activator, for stroke treatment in 1995 after a 
three-month study showed that it saves lives. The latest study was 
a one-year follow-up involving 312 patients who got TPA and 312 who 
got a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	The results after a year were about the same as they were at  
three months: For every 100 stroke patients treated with TPA, at 
least 11 who otherwise would have had died or had severe problems 
will come through with few or no symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a survey last year found that many doctors were still  
afraid to use TPA because of the danger that it can worsen strokes 
that are caused not by clots but by bleeding directly into the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug has to be given within three hours after a stroke, but  
after a CAT scan has been done to make sure that the stroke was 
caused by a blood clot.

<HEADLINE> Stars Face Sabres on Home Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars are used to making comebacks in  
playoff games. Now they'll try to do it in a series. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to do is score, get great opportunities, and we  
always seem to bounce back,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 1-0 in the Stanley Cup finals, the Stars face another  
test in their postseason adventure story when they meet the Buffalo 
Sabres tonight in Game 2 at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have made a habit of comebacks in the postseason,  
rallying to win five times when trailing at some point in the third 
period. That has tied an NHL record. 
</P>
<P>
	They almost did it again in Game 1 of the finals Tuesday night  
after the Sabres went ahead 2-1 in the third period. But they 
eventually lost 3-2 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize what we did wrong, and the coaches and players  
know how to correct it,'' Modano said. ``We've got to be more 
aggressive and feed off that. We've got to take more quality shots 
in front of the net and not leave that area until the puck does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars don't want to leave town without a victory. They have  
already lost their home-ice advantage and don't want to go to 
Buffalo for Games 3 and 4 trailing the best-of-7 series 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a desperate situation, trust me,'' Stars coach Ken  
Hitchcock said. ``I think our team recognizes that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Hitchcock felt that the Stars played a pretty good  
game in the opener, even while losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we played two great periods and we really started the  
third period with a real high level of determination, but I thought 
from about the 12-minute mark on we got conservative. We tried to 
protect a lead, and I think that was really to their benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Stars finished with the best record in the league, 14  
victories and 23 points better than the Sabres, they split the 
two-game season series with Buffalo. Hitchcock said there wasn't 
much to separate the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We watched Buffalo play a lot,'' Hitchcock said. ``I don't  
think (Tuesday's) game is any different. They are a team like us on 
the road. You hang around long enough, if the other team doesn't 
create a big enough gap then you give yourself a chance to come 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres might be feeling pretty lucky following their Game 1  
victory. They got off to one of their worst starts of the playoffs 
and gave the Stars 10 power-play opportunities, yet still managed 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars scored on only one of the man advantages. The Sabres,  
meanwhile, had four power plays and converted one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to set the tone and hit throughout the game,'' Sabres  
coach Lindy Ruff said. ``A couple of times we got a little bit too 
carried away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabres captain Mike Peca agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing for us (in Game 2) is to be more  
disciplined, and not give them so many power plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres were admittedly nervous before Game 1 -- even All-Star  
goalie Dominik Hasek said so -- and felt a sense of relief after 
winning. They immediately put the odds in their favor to win the 
Cup. Only 12 of 60 previous league champions have come back to win 
the Cup after dropping the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also gave the Sabres confidence in another way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it takes a little bit of pressure off,'' said Jason  
Woolley, who scored the overtime game-winner for Buffalo in the 
opener. ``We are are up one. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be even tougher, we know that. What a real  
big game it is for us, a chance to go up two-nothing and steal two 
from Dallas in their own building. That would be something great 
for us.''

<HEADLINE> Chain Accused of Selling Old Condoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rite Aid has promised to better educate  
staff about removing expired products from shelves after an 
investigation found California stores had stocked outdated condoms, 
baby formula and infant medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by a consumer's complaint in January, investigators  
found more than 200 outdated products in about 50 of the chain's 
660 stores in California. Some of the condoms were four years past 
their expiration date, Merced County District Attorney Gordon 
Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., is the nation's third-largest  
drugstore chain with more than 3,800 stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors from Merced, Alameda and Santa Barbara counties and  
the city of San Diego filed a consumer protection lawsuit Tuesday 
asking a judge to order Rite Aid to make restitution to victims and 
to pay civil penalties, which could run to $2,500 for each expired 
item sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had no reports of infants falling ill from outdated  
products, but they cautioned that formulas lose their nutritional 
value over time, and that condoms and spermicides lose their 
effectiveness after their expiration dates pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most astounding and disconcerting is that Rite Aid did  
not alert their customers'' -- even as ``they bragged in 
commercials'' that customers were the key to their success, Spencer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said its policy has always been to pull items off  
shelves 30 days before they expire; last month, that was changed to 
60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Rugen, a Rite Aid spokeswoman, said the company also  
posted signs advising customers that if they purchased expired 
infant formula, it would be replaced with fresh formula free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised and disappointed that a handful of attorneys  
have decided to take this action, despite everything we ... have 
done since we were first informed of the incidents,'' Ms. Rugen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer said the new policy apparently wasn't getting through to  
all Rite Aid stores. 
</P>
<P>
	When prosecutors notified Rite Aid of the expired products in  
February, the company gave written assurances in March that the 
formula had been removed from shelves as of Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequent investigations turned up more expired products as  
recently as May, Spencer said. ``To our knowledge, they have not 
taken any steps to inform their customers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the outdated items include the baby formulas  
Enfamil low iron, Enfamil LactoFree and Similac with iron; Ramses, 
Lifestyle and Sheik condoms; Advil; Clear Blue Easy pregnancy 
tests; and Ortho-Gynol spermicidal jelly.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Skakel Is Unfit To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Rushton Skakel barks and growls,  
steals food off people's plates in restaurants and has been known 
to rub bellies and noses with perfect strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, prosecutors in Connecticut believe the 74-year-old  
brother-in-law of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy may have some 
information about the 1975 slaying of a 15-year-old girl. Skakel's 
sons are suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney argued Wednesday that Skakel has brain damage and  
Alzheimer's-like dementia, making him mentally unfit to be 
questioned. The lawyer asked a state appeals court to throw out a 
judge's order compelling Skakel to travel to Connecticut to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man is totally out of control. He's in diapers and he  
can't carry on a conversation with anyone,'' attorney Richard Lubin 
told the three-judge panel of the 4th District Court of Appeal. 
``He is entitled not to be dragged to Connecticut when he's 
incompetent and incontinent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel was not in court. The judges did not indicate when they  
would rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel's sons, Michael and Thomas, have been identified as  
suspects in the slaying of Martha Moxley, who was bludgeoned with a 
golf club on her family's Greenwich, Conn., estate. Michael, who 
was 15 at the time, and Thomas, then 17, have denied any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-iron used in the slaying was matched to a set of clubs  
owned by the Skakel family, and the elder Skakel told authorities 
20 years ago that the club came from his house. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Skakel may know more than he has said. A  
vague affidavit by an investigator suggests Skakel might have 
overheard one of his sons discussing the death. 
</P>
<P>
	He may not be as crazy as his attorney would like the court to  
think, said James Carney, a Florida assistant attorney general. He 
pointed out that Skakel sat calmly through a four-hour hearing on 
his mental competency last October. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lubin noted Skakel did give a jovial belly-bump to a  
bailiff during a break in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into Martha's slaying was revived a year ago  
when a one-man grand jury was appointed and two books were 
published, including one by former Los Angeles Detective Mark 
Fuhrman. The grand jury investigation is still going on.

<HEADLINE> Park Suspended for Seven Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The message from NL president Leonard Coleman  
was clear: There is no kicking in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	For that matter, forearm shivers won't be tolerated, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park was suspended for seven  
games and fined $3,000 on Tuesday for his part in a fight with 
Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher, who wasn't punished. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension began with Tuesday night's game against the Texas  
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	A contrite Park said he wouldn't file an appeal, but still  
seemed puzzled by Belcher's actions before the incident, which 
occurred in the fifth inning of Saturday's game at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize for the bad news for (my) teammates,'' Park said.  
``I couldn't understand why he did it to me. I apologize for trying 
to hurt him. I was so mad about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park essentially repeated what he said the day of the fight,  
that Belcher tagged him hard following his sacrifice bunt, and when 
he asked him why, the Angels' pitcher used profanity in telling him 
to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected three or five games, seven games is so long,'' Park  
said. ``I'll forget about it after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park will be eligible to return June 17 against Pittsburgh at  
Dodger Stadium, and manager Davey Johnson said the 25-year-old 
right-hander from Korea will pitch that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Belcher refused to comment on the fine and suspension following  
Anaheim's 6-2 loss at San Francisco on Tuesday, but expressed anger 
Monday night in his first public comments on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy about what happened,'' Belcher said. ``The guy  
tried to take my head off. I just don't think there's any place for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, Coleman agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he understood  
Coleman's thinking on the matter and believed the decision was a 
fair one. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys know Chan Ho, he's a very good person,'' Malone said  
from Corning, N.Y. ``I would defend him all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was frustrated, he misunderstood what Belcher was  
doing and what he said. He reacted in the wrong way. He just made a 
mistake. He'll learn from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone said he regretted the incident took place for a reason  
altogether separate from the resulting suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it sets a good example,'' Malone said. ``Players  
are role models. We have to be examples. I just don't like to see 
it. I see the potential risk of serious injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight began after Belcher fielded Park's bunt and tagged him  
out. After a brief exchange of words, Park forearmed Belcher in the 
face and followed with a leaping kick. Both benches and bullpens 
emptied, and Park was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Walbeck had hit a grand slam off Park an inning earlier,  
the fourth grand slam allowed by Park this season, equaling a 
big-league record for grand slams allowed in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Park, 4-3 with a 4.84 ERA in 12 starts this year, will actually  
miss just one start. And because the Dodgers are off Thursday and 
Monday, it will allow them to go with a four-man rotation in his 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``All suspensions are stiff to me,'' Johnson said. ``There's  
nothing good about a suspension. We have some off days, we won't 
need an extra pitcher, that helps. Someone was looking out for us 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a difficult season so far, for whatever reason.  
There's still plenty of time left for him to have an excellent 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park was 14-8 with a 3.38 ERA in 1997, and 15-9 with a 3.71 ERA  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he respected Coleman's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``He did what he had to do,'' Johnson said. ``(But) it takes two  
to rumble. You don't get into a fight for no reason at all, you 
know what I'm saying? I know what it's like getting tagged hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's severe, seven games, but the schedule makes it  
easier. It's over and done with, let's turn the page and go home.''

<HEADLINE> Bravo Won't Air Teen Sniper Segment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Filmmaker Michael Moore's satirical story about  
a ``teen sniper school'' won't air this week because a cable 
network is worried about public reaction after the Columbine High 
School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-minute segment of Moore's series, ``The Awful Truth,''  
was to run Sunday on Bravo. It was filmed five months before the 
April 20 shooting in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said his satire takes easy access to guns to its ``logical  
extreme,'' by arming children and teaching them to be better shots 
as part of the school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bravo didn't object to the content, but felt the timing was  
inappropriate, spokeswoman Sommer Hixson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping after some time goes by the original intent of  
the satire will be more clear to viewers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling when viewers will get that chance; the  
season's last segment of ``The Awful Truth'' airs June 27 and Bravo 
hasn't decided whether to renew it. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine and the focus on violence in television has left  
programmers skittish lately. CBS cited the massacre in leaving a 
violent drama off its fall schedule, and the WB postponed the 
season-ending episode of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' because it 
depicted high school students taking up arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, there's been a booming business in bootleg  
``Buffy'' tapes circulating through the Internet after the episode 
aired in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, producer of the documentary ``Roger &AMP; Me,'' said in an  
e-mail message to fans that while he respected Bravo's point of 
view, he disagreed with the decision to censor ``The Awful Truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the main functions of satire is to confront the  
uncomfortable issues,'' he wrote. ``Satire is not supposed to be 
the kind of Comedy Lite you can find on every other channel. Satire 
assumes the audience has a brain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he offered to add a statement to his report that  
said, in effect, that it took 25 years after the King and Kennedy 
assassinations to get the Brady gun control bill passed, yet 
legislation happened much more quickly after shootings in Colorado 
and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the only way to get true gun control in this country  
is for there to be more school shootings,'' Moore offered to write. 
</P>
<P>
	Bravo didn't go for that, either.

<HEADLINE> TV Makers To Meet V-Chip Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- V-chips have made their way into a growing  
number of new television sets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission announced Wednesday that  
most television manufacturers have put the blocking technology in 
at least half of their new sets. They predicted TV makers should 
have few problems meeting a year-end deadline to install the 
blocking technology in all new televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	V-chips are intended to give viewers, primarily parents, the  
option of blocking shows they find objectionable. A 1996 
telecommunications law requires that all new TV sets 13 inches and 
larger must be equipped with the v-chip by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the FCC imposed a July 1 deadline on manufacturers to  
install the technology in at least half their new sets. Nearly all 
of them met the deadline, FCC Commissioner Gloria Tristani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The v-chip is about to become a reality,'' she said during a  
news conference where the technology was demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers in compliance represent 90 percent of all  
television sets sold in the country. Information was not available 
on the remaining 10 percent, but Tristani added that ``we have no 
reason to believe they won't comply with the deadlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panasonic announced that its 1999 television models are 100  
percent compliant with v-chip integration. 
</P>
<P>
	The v-chip works in coordination with an electronically coded TV  
ratings system. Most television and cable networks use letter 
notations or age-based ratings to flag violence, sexual situations, 
crude language and suggestive dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Tristani took aim at recent reports claiming that parents were  
slow to embrace the v-chip, saying ``the system hasn't even been in 
place yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's give the v-chip a chance before we rush to any judgments  
about what parents want,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics  
Manufacturers Association, announced his organization has launched 
a publicity campaign intended to educate consumers about v-chips 
and how they work. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will create a logo and sticker that retailers can use  
to help people identify v-chip equipped television sets.

<HEADLINE> Mexico 2, Argentina 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chicago (AP) -- Mexico and Argentina played to a 2-2 tie in an  
exhibition soccer game Wednesday night in front of a sellout crowd 
at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 64,433 in attendance were fans of Mexico, which used  
the game as a warmup for the Confederations Cup, while Argentina 
was preparing for the Copa America tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina was shorthanded the entire second half after Juan  
Sorin was ejected in the 45th minute. But Argentina went ahead 2-1 
when Gustavo Lopez took Cristian Gonzalez's centering pass and 
rolled the ball into the right side of the net in the 52nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico tied it on Paulo Cesar Chavez's header in the 77th  
minute. Isaac Terrazas lobbed the ball to the middle of the box 
where Chavez angled the ball into the right side of an open net. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico had the best of the offensive opportunities, outshooting  
Argentina 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the way, with 10 players, the team was able to play to  
a tie game,'' Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa said. ``It was very 
positive the way the team played today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico took a 1-0 lead in the 14th minute when Luis Hernandez  
knocked in his own rebound from the left side. Argentina tied it 
five minutes later when Julio Cruz took possession of Roberto 
Ayala's direct kick and shot the ball off the hands of goalie Jorge 
Campos into the left side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being our first game, and especially against an excellent team  
like Argentina, we did very well,'' Mexico coach Manuel Lapuente 
said. ``Perhaps we could have scored more goals, but overall the 
performance of our team was extremely good.''

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G's Fake-Fat Plant Producing Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. plant that makes  
olestra for the company failed to meet production expectations for 
the fat substitute during its first year, P&AMP;G's top executive said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olestra production at the Cincinnati plant was 30 percent to 40  
percent below what had been expected, Durk Jager, P&AMP;G's chief 
executive, told security analysts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jager said the company still has confidence in olestra's  
long-term prospects and may consider applying to the federal 
government for approval to use it in products other than snack 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration has permitted use of olestra,  
which is marketed under the trade name Olean, in chips since 
January 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G spent more than $200 million over 25 years in developing  
olestra. Frito-Lay Inc. sells Wow! chips containing olestra and P&AMP;G 
sells Pringles crisps that contain the substance. 
</P>
<P>
	A consumer advocacy group, the Center for Science in the Public  
Interest, has said there is a health hazard for people eating snack 
foods made with olestra. The group says olestra causes gas, 
bloating, diarrhea and nausea and blocks absorption of some 
nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA advisory committee endorsed olestra's safety in June  
1998. Fifteen of 18 members of the panel agreed with the statement 
that there is a ``reasonable certainty of no harm'' from olestra.

<HEADLINE> Marichal Won't Cooperate With Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Dominican Sports  
Minister and Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal said he will not 
talk to prosecutors investigating charges of corruption in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is probing accusations that administrators  
skimmed money through the purchase of sports equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal was to appear before the head of the Corruption  
Prevention Department on May 26 to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a victim of fame,'' Marichal said Wednesday in the Listin  
Diario newspaper. He denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mariano German Mejia said Marichal could face charges  
if he does not comply. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every citizen who is called before a public office must  
present himself to respond,'' prosecutor Mariano German Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
	An association that represents the country's cockfight  
organizers is also accusing Marichal of setting up some matches for 
his financial benefit. Cockfighting is legal in the Dominican 
Republic and is supervised by the sports minister. Marichal said 
those accusations are also baseless. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal posted a 243-142 record in his 16 seasons with the San  
Francisco Giants, Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers.

<HEADLINE> Mister Rogers Wins Pa. Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- It was a beautiful day in the governor's  
house as Mister Rogers received the Pennsylvania Founder's Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tom Ridge removed his suit jacket Tuesday and donned a red  
cardigan similar to the one Fred Rogers, 71, wears on ``Mister 
Rogers' Neighborhood,'' which is produced at Pittsburgh's public TV 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we honor a neighbor who has not only taught us right  
from wrong, but left from right,'' Ridge said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose Wednesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange as Venezuelan oil workers moved closer to a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, gold retreated on reports of small central  
bank sales, while sugar futures also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products rose after the Venezuelan oil workers  
union Fedepetrol threatened to strike on Monday unless the 
state-owned oil company reverses a decision to freeze wages for 
33,000 workers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela exports about 60 percent of its oil to the United  
States and competes with Saudi Arabia as the largest exporter to 
this country. A strike would have, at least in the short-term, some 
impact on available supplies, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and unleaded gasoline also were supported by reports a  
Mobil Corp. 200,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Joliet, Ill., had 
reduced processing rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin potential problems helped overcome initial weakness  
tied to the American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found gasoline demand last week -- during the peak  
Memorial Day holiday weekend -- actually fell to a two-month low. 
That report caused worries that summer driving demand will not be 
strong enough to reduce a year-over-year surplus that has been a 
drain on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for July delivery rose 33 cents to $17.99 a barrel; July  
unleaded gasoline rose .75 cent to 52.24 cents a gallon; July 
heating oil rose .88 cent to 42.93 cents a gallon; July natural gas 
rose .67 cents to $2.460 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures fell 3 percent on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York after Brazil, the world's biggest grower, took 
advantage of a recent rally to sell new supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is on tap to produce another record sugar crop, adding to  
already plentiful world supplies at a time when demand is expected 
to be relatively weak. Demand currently remains fairly strong amid 
heavy buying from Russian importers, who are working to beat new 
Aug. 1 duties on products from outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
	July raw sugar fell as much as 0.15 cent to 5.26 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold continued its retreat on the New York Mercantile Exchange,  
posting new 20-year lows once again amid market talk smaller 
European central banks may be quietly selling some of their 
stockpiles ahead of Britain's planned sale of more than half its 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold succumbed to unconfirmed reports that several tons of the  
metal had been sold on spot markets in Europe, adding to dealer 
sales out of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices have found little support in the past few weeks  
after Britain announced planned sales of its reserves beginning 
next month. The news reignited worries that many central banks will 
dump their vast holdings in favor of better-returning investments. 
</P>
<P>
	A further negative influence on the market came from Merrill  
Lynch metals analyst William O'Neill, who predicted gold could fall 
to $240 an ounce in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	August gold fell $2.70 to $261.10 an ounce.

	SEC Warns of 'Prime Bank' Notes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are warning the public  
against phony securities offerings known as ``prime bank'' notes, 
as they pursue charges against an attorney and a consultant accused 
of defrauding investors of $6.2 million in such a scheme. In a 
civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission charged attorney Lewis Allen Rivlin and 
consultant Edwin Earl Huling III, who worked at Rivlin's firm, with 
securities fraud. Rivlin and Huling denied the allegations. The SEC 
also charged Alfred Huascar Velarde, a former law partner of 
Rivlin, with aiding the fraudulent investment scheme. He settled 
out of court without admitting or denying the allegation.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An IBM manager acknowledged today that  
Microsoft never explicitly offered price discounts on Windows if 
IBM agreed to sacrifice its rival OS/2 computer software. Microsoft 
continued for a second day its aggressive questioning of Garry 
Norris, a mid-level IBM manager whose courtroom claims this week 
have been among the most sensational against Microsoft in the 
software company's antitrust trial. Norris earlier had cited a 
Microsoft contract offering discounts of $1 to $3 per copy of 
Windows, for example, if IBM were willing to adopt Windows ``as the 
standard operating system for IBM,'' and to mention Windows as the 
only operating system in IBM advertisements.

	Procter &AMP; Gamble To Cut 15,000 Jobs

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. said today it will  
eliminate 15,000 jobs worldwide over six years -- about 13 percent 
of its work force -- and close about 10 plants in a global 
restructuring program. The changes begin when the company's new 
fiscal year begins July 1. The restructuring will bring greater 
innovation, faster speed to market and greater growth,'' said Durk 
Jager, P&AMP;G's chief executive. It's the company's first major 
initiative since Jager, a 29-year P&AMP;G veteran, became CEO on Jan. 
However, investors gave the six-year plan a chilly reception as it 
became clear there would be no quick fixes. Procter &AMP; Gamble stock 
was down 2 9/16 to 92 1/4 today.

to enter the long-distance telephone market and provide more 
customers with high-speed Internet access. It mentioned the idea in 
a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
BellSouth, the Atlanta-based regional phone company, recently 
purchased a 10 percent stake in Qwest, the nation's fourth-largest 
long-distance company. At present, federal law prohibits BellSouth 
and the other ``Baby Bell'' phone companies created by the 1984 
breakup of AT&AMP;T from owning more than 10 percent of any 
long-distance carrier. BellSouth stock was down 1/16 at 46 1/16; 
Qwest was up 3 11/16 at 47.

of 2.6 percent this year for the Asia-Pacific region and 2.9 
percent next year.

maker, from offering sizable discounts to store owners who

Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. allege Philip Morris has used its market 
clout to monopolize the U.S. cigarette market, where it accounts 
for almost 54 percent of all retail sales. The three companies have

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Med School Eyes Wyo. Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASPER, Wyo. (AP) -- Wyoming has a shortage of doctors and no  
medical school. So Ross University, a for-profit medical school on 
the Caribbean island of Dominica, thought it had found a perfect 
place for a new campus far from the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's 80-year-old founder, Robert Ross, proposed to  
spend $25 million on opening a medical school just outside Casper 
and announced plans to start classes next spring. Local economic 
development officials, looking to end their city's dependence on 
the lagging oil industry, were delighted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the venture could be in critical condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Ross University would be the first for-profit medical school on  
U.S. soil in 90 years. And resistance to for-profit medical schools 
runs high in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The national accrediting agency for medical schools has refused  
to consider Ross' project. If a medical school is not accredited, 
its students cannot get federal loans, and states might refuse to 
license its graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	A medical school in Uganda recently delayed plans to build a  
branch campus in Washington state because of the accreditation 
hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerry Behrens, a Casper surgeon, said he is opposed to  
for-profit medical schools because ``the criteria to get into the 
school is a check that won't bounce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For-profit medical schools in the United States closed or became  
nonprofit institutions early in the 20th century after medical 
reformers concluded that for-profit schools might be cutting 
corners or lowering their standards for financial reasons. Since 
then, no American accreditation agencies have approved a for-profit 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were about to lay on an operating table with a scalpel  
about to invade your body, I would think you would want to know 
whether the doctor operating on you got a good education,'' said 
Dr. John Nelson of Salt Lake City, a member of the American Medical 
Association board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Although construction on the Casper campus has been pushed back  
from September to January, Ross said he is not giving up on his 
investment. Ross, a New Yorker who made millions selling petroleum, 
grain, semiconductors and other products but is not a physician, 
calls himself a ``revolutionist'' against the medical 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of hostility out there,'' he said. ``I feel  
sorry for them, picking on an old man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has enlisted the help of Wyoming's congressional delegation  
and received support from Gov. Jim Geringer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross University, nestled amid tropical blue waters and dense  
rain forests in Dominica, is one of about 20 or so for-profit 
medical schools that have sprung up in the Caribbean, Mexico and 
elsewhere to cater to students rejected by American schools. 
</P>
<P>
	It boasts more than 2,500 graduates licensed and practicing in  
the United States. The school says 92 percent of its students 
passed their U.S. basic-level tests on their first try last 
September -- slightly higher than the U.S. and Canadian average. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ross considered opening a for-profit campus in the United  
States, he looked at five states without medical schools before 
settling on Casper, a city of 47,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Simon, the university's president, said Casper was chosen  
because a Ross faculty member once practiced medicine here and knew 
of the state's need for doctors. Wyoming ranks 46th in the nation 
in availability of physicians, with one doctor for every 642 
people. Nationwide, there is one doctor for every 441 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Casper campus would train students in most of their first  
two years of basic science. Then Ross would fly them to Dominica to 
finish their studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's medical school accrediting agency, the Liaison  
Committee on Medical Education, rejected Ross' request for 
accreditation, saying the agency looks only at full, four-year 
programs. But Ross said he thinks the agency is biased against 
for-profit schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Casper like the idea that Ross promises to bring in  
1,000 students and create 200 jobs with a $9 million to $10 million 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	George Howley, director of the Casper Area Economic Development  
Alliance, said that doctors opposed to the project are worried 
about competition, not the quality of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	``To protect the income to the doctors is what it is,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, people like Jim Campbell are watching closely.  
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, 21, is a junior college student in Casper who waits on  
tables and repairs natural gas lines for a living. He dreams of 
being a surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	But his grade point average was just 0.5 in his first semester  
at Casper College. Now that he is getting nearly straight A's, he 
might need a school like Ross that could give him a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day I'm thinking about it, the fact that I'm one day  
closer to getting there, one day closer to reaching my goal,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Cigars Double Risk for Some Cancers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In yet another warning about the dangers of one of the hottest  
trends of the '90s, a study found that cigar smokers are twice as 
likely as nonsmokers to get cancer of the mouth, throat and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	They also run about 1 1/2 times the risk of all smoking-related  
cancers together and are more likely to develop heart disease or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, was conducted by Dr. Carlos Iribarren, an epidemiologist 
at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland, Calif., 
who examined the medical records of 1,546 regular cigar smokers and 
16,228 nonsmokers from 1971 through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cigar smokers smoked fewer than five a day.  
</P>
<P>
	The study expanded on one described by The Associated Press last  
year, when Iribarren presented data about 225 cigar smokers to the 
American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks aren't as high as they are for cigarette smokers  
because cigar smokers don't usually inhale the smoke and hold it in 
their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette smokers have about three times as high a risk of  
coronary heart disease as nonsmokers, 10 times the risk of lung 
cancer and 20 to 25 times the risk of coronary heart disease, 
Iribarren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But our study shows conclusively that there are very serious  
health consequences associated with chronic cigar use,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher, who has been trying to get the  
Federal Trade Commission to require warning labels on cigars like 
those on cigarettes, said: ``Cigar smoking seems to have become a 
fad. The implication is that people don't think its dangerous. This 
is more very solid evidence of the dangers of cigar smoking.''

	NATO Ambassadors Approve Peace Deal

<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO ambassadors quickly approved the  
peace deal signed by NATO and Yugoslavian generals Wednesday, and 
the alliance says it will suspend its bombing as soon as Serb 
troops begin to withdraw from Kosovo. ``Today is a great day for 
the alliance, but, much more importantly, it is a great day for the 
cause of justice for the people of Kosovo,'' Solana said. A Serb 
official said Belgrade would begin withdrawing its forces Thursday. 
President Clinton tempered his remarks on the deal, calling the

support reports of a massacre by Serb forces in Kosovo days after 
the NATO bombing campaign began. The first overhead photograph, 
taken May 15, shows neat lines of what are apparently individual 
graves, and the second, taken June 3, shows only a dark splotch 
where the graves had been. ``We have a picture that ... may suggest 
that an effort has been made to cover up this mass grave site,'' 
Bacon said.

millions of dollars from associates of the late dictator Gen. Sani 
Abacha, officials and state television said. President Olusegun 
Obasanjo, whose inauguration last month ended 15 years of military 
rule in this oil-rich West African country, forced each of the 29 
officers ranging from majors to generals into ``compulsory 
retirement.'' A new law authorized the immediate seizure of more 
than $420 million in a petroleum refinery, including $140 million 
held by Abacha's former national security advisor.

mobile-phone call foot the bill. The rules, which the FCC hopes to 
have in place by the first quarter of 2000, would enable wireless 
providers to have callers pay for mobile phone calls just as they 
do with regular phone calls. The commission sees the rules as a way 
to boost consumer use of wireless phones and foster competition

<HEADLINE> Butterflies React to Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Butterflies in Europe have shifted north during the past  
century, a possible sign that many other species are moving in 
response to global warming, scientists reported today in the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms that things are beginning to happen. If we can see  
it in butterflies, then it's likely to be happening in other 
groups,'' said Ian Woiwod, an entomologist at the Rothamstead 
Experimental Station in Britain who was not involved in the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers looked at 35 species of butterflies and found  
that 22 had either died out at the southern end of their ranges, or 
spread beyond their former northern boundary, or both. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rest, most had not moved, while two species had extended  
south. The butterflies' ranges had moved 20 to 150 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe is 1.4 degrees warmer than it was 100 years ago, and the  
average temperatures experienced by butterflies then can now be 
found 75 miles farther north. Temperatures are expected to increase 
an additional 4 to 8 degrees in the next century because of the 
greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfly enthusiasts in Sweden, Finland and Estonia can now  
find certain butterflies farther north. In some cases, they are 
seeing species new to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Heodes Tityrus, the sooty copper butterfly, has  
disappeared from its southern sites in Spain but established itself 
in Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied butterflies because they are known to be  
sensitive to the climate and have been followed by naturalists for 
a long time. Migratory butterflies and those strongly affected by 
other changes in the environment, like pollution and farming, were 
excluded from the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at the University of Texas,  
organized the project, which was aimed at detecting large-scale 
shifts in response to climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, experts in Washington, D.C., reported that  
populations of Alaska salmon are dying because of higher 
temperatures in the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Pictures, Ali in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Pictures has asked a federal judge  
to dismiss a $50 million lawsuit over the rights to a movie about 
Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, former Ali spiritual adviser Jabir Herbert  
Muhammad and Jason Hirschfeld, the son of Ali's former lawyer, 
allege they are partners with Ali in Muhammad Ali Productions Inc., 
a company created in 1988 to develop ``any authorized biographical 
or autobiographical story of the life and times of Ali.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia attorney Jim Quinn told U.S. District Judge Samuel  
Wilson on Wednesday that the case is really a breach-of-contract 
matter between Ali and the plaintiffs. The former heavyweight 
boxing champion is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Cooter, the attorney for the plaintiffs, argued Ali did not  
have the authority to sell the rights to his life story and that 
Columbia's movie, which is to star Will Smith, bars any hope of 
Muhammad or Hirschfeld making a film. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he would rule in several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Coppola Gets Passion for Fashion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Francis Ford Coppola has just been struck by  
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Not, as might be expected, for a new film. Nor for a literary  
magazine (he already has one). Nor a winery and food company 
(ditto). Not even a TV production (his latest, ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
Hyde,'' is airing throughout June on DirecTV). 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, this giant of American cinema, the director of ``The  
Godfather'' saga and ``Apocalypse Now,'' is brimming with passion 
for fashion. A female publicist's pinstriped suit has set Coppola 
to musing about an office dress code. 
</P>
<P>
	All the women at his American Zoetrope studio, he suggests,  
could be outfitted in uniforms. ``Jackets, and maybe those kind of 
flowing, 1930s pants,'' Coppola says, his enthusiasm growing along 
with the design's intricacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's a sensible idea (a woman executive in the room  
looks doubtful), this seems to be a truly Coppola moment, marked by 
enthusiasm that spills over from his best-known realm, film, into 
any other that strikes his fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	That spirit has turned him into a virtual conglomerate. His  
empire includes the San Francisco-based American Zoetrope with its 
film and TV productions; the nearby Niebaum-Coppola winery and the 
New York-based Zoetrope: All Story literary journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Coppola's level of participation depends on the specific  
venture. In the case of ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' for instance, 
he's listed as executive producer -- which, he acknowledges, can 
mean a limited presence. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, offered by DirecTV as a pay-per-view program, stars  
Adam Baldwin and Chang Tseng in a contemporary, Hong Kong-set twist 
on the classic tale. Peter Lenkov (``Demolition Man'') wrote the 
screenplay; Colin Budds directed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, in my position, when you're an executive producer,  
you try to be helpful, try to make sure the creators have what they 
need. You really give it over to the creative people,'' Coppola 
said on a visit to Zoetrope's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
	But what of the fact that his name is attached prominently to  
such projects? 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it's a little bit exploitative to make it sound as  
though someone did something they didn't,'' he said. But in the 
entertainment business, ``it means a lot to help people get going. 
So in that sense you're becoming a patron, hopefully, to creative 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's patron, as opposed to boss. Coppola is openly disdainful  
of mainstream Hollywood and a system he says gives unqualified 
executives power over artists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The film power structure is absolutely idiotic. Of all the  
people who are studio heads, I would say only Harvey Weinstein (of 
Miramax) has half a right to be a studio head. He's a show-business 
person who picks a picture with his own opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else, you just know that they're paid way beyond  
what they're worth because they're so terrified in their choices. 
So that cuts out the hope to do things in feature films that might 
push boundaries, although we keep trying,'' Coppola said. 
</P>
<P>
	His ire over studio practices led him to the courtroom. He sued  
Warner Bros., claiming it thwarted his chances to make a film based 
on the Pinocchio fairy tale, and won a multimillion-dollar jury 
verdict last year. (An appeal is pending.) 
</P>
<P>
	Television, he said, promises new frontiers.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an industry in tremendous flux and expansion. Here's  
something like DirecTV that didn't exist seven years ago, and 
suddenly it has 7 million subscribers,'' Coppola said. ``I'm always 
astonished at how people, the real so-called smart people, are 
handicapping these innovations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The power structure never see an innovation as having any  
potential. When it does, they scramble all their resources to try 
to control it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Control is part of the reason he branched out from moviemaking  
into winemaking: ``I'm a believer in being involved in competing 
things, so you're not just looking at the same six people who can 
determine your fate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He expresses admiration for longtime friend George Lucas, who  
flew solo on production of his new ``Star Wars'' film and, by 
managing without studios, ``demonstrated he could take the whole 
thing away from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when Coppola rhapsodizes about the joys of developing a  
palate for wine -- ``Once you make a friend with wine, like music, 
it can go as far as you want'' -- it's clear more than business is 
at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he's been thinking these days about what really counts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know people who are so rich and so successful and so  
miserable. You think this person has everything you could ever 
dream of, fame and fortune and talent and artistry and all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coppola knows all about gaining and losing riches. As one of  
America's boldest and most innovative filmmakers, he has gone more 
than once from box office triumph to the brink of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	What's missing for many Americans, he contends, is fulfillment.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the key word for me these days. What really is  
fulfillment, what do you really need? I bought a jet recently. I'm 
in L.A., I have this beautiful jet. I ask my son, 'You want to go 
with me, go fishing in Costa Rica?' He tells me 'I can't, dad.' 
</P>
<P>
	``So then what is fulfillment? It had nothing to do with the  
jet.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Boost Anti-Terror Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill approved Wednesday by a Senate panel  
would cut President Clinton's request for hiring local police 
officers while offering more help against terrorists, including a 
new counterterrorism laboratory at the site of the 1995 Oklahoma 
City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, coming soon after revelations of Chinese  
espionage at federal energy labs, would order the FBI to send at 
least 60 agents around the country to combat security breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would step up federal efforts against Internet  
crime, including $10 million to expand Securities Exchange 
Commission efforts to crack down on fraud involving electronic 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions were included in a $35.3 billion measure  
financing the departments of Commerce, Justice and State for the 
coming fiscal year. The bill was approved Wednesday by voice vote 
by the Senate Appropriations subcommittee overseeing those 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the subcommittee chairman, described  
some details. The rest came from a report on the bill obtained by 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which has not yet been crafted by the House, is  
likely to be one of the most controversial of the 13 annual 
spending bills Congress will write for fiscal 2000, which begins 
Oct. 1. Parts of it are likely to be changed substantially before 
it becomes law, including its price, which now is $5.5 billion 
below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would ignore Clinton's request for nearly $1.3 billion  
to continue hiring local police officers under his Community 
Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, program. The program, long one 
of the administration's top anti-crime initiatives, has been a 
repeated target of Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the three-year-old program already has been given  
enough money to hire 105,000 officers, or 5,000 more than Clinton 
initially proposed. The program was supposed to expire at the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Senate measure provides about $530 million to hire  
officers and supply them with advanced technology under other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost counterintelligence efforts, the bill directs the FBI  
to send at least 60 additional agents to field offices in 
Albuquerque, N.M.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Chicago; Houston; Los Angeles; 
New York; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C. The measure says 
security at Energy Department labs ``would be handled best by the 
FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would provide $205 million to help  
communities' counterterrorism efforts, including money for training 
and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $30 million would go for two counterterrorism labs to  
``research new technologies and threat reductions.'' The measure 
says one would be at the site of the Oklahoma City bombing; the 
other would be at Dartmouth College in Gregg's home state of New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides:  
</P>
<P>
	--$3.1 billion for the upcoming census, ignoring Clinton's recent  
request for $1.7 billion more. Clinton says the cost was increased 
by the Supreme Court's decision to forbid statistical sampling to 
augment the head count. Gregg said he had not had time to study 
Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	--$583 million -- $100 million more than last year -- to strengthen  
security at U.S. missions overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	--$100 million to help northwestern salmon populations recover.  
</P>
<P>
	--Extra money for the FBI and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America  
to develop programs to protect children using the Internet against 
potential abductors. 
</P>
<P>
	--Money to hire 1,000 additional border patrol agents.

<HEADLINE> Teens Pan ID Checks For Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Many young people had the same reaction to the new rules  
requiring unaccompanied teen-agers to show a photo ID to get into 
violent and sexually explicit films: No big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably just sneak in anyway,'' said one 16-year-old,  
standing in the lobby of a 24-screen theater complex in Columbus, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie theater owners insist, however, that the measures adopted  
during a White House ceremony Tuesday mean anyone under 17 won't 
get into R-rated films unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this will go a long way in carrying out our  
responsibilities to the parents of America,'' said William F. 
Kartozian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, 
which endorsed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The association represents some 20,000 movie screens, 65 percent  
of the national total. Kartozian said theaters owners will post 
signs announcing the new policy and advising young people to be 
ready to show ID. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said it would try to get all theaters -- as well  
as video store owners -- to follow suit. Many said they would. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Froehlich, director of marketing for General Cinema Movie  
Theaters in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., said ticket 
takers there already ask young people for identification. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' he said. ``We have to do it by virtue of where  
we're located here in the mall. It's something that has to be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Thomas, assistant manager of Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in New  
York City, said the theater hasn't asked for identification in the 
past, but would now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good idea,'' he said. ``It's hard to tell kids'  
ages sometimes. They all have beards or goatees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton asked the movie industry to tighten  
enforcement of the existing film rating system in the wake of the 
recent shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't have to worry about your G-rated kids getting  
into violent or suggestive R-rated movies,'' Clinton said. He said 
the typical American will view 40,000 dramatized murders by the age 
of 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Frizzell, 15, of Standish, Maine, said the policy will  
only encourage teen-agers to get fake ID's and sneak into movie 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a stupid idea,'' said Frizzell, who was hanging  
out in Boston's Harvard Square on Tuesday while visiting his older 
brother. ``You're going to get kids doing stupid things to get into 
R-rated movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frizzell said he tries to see only R-rated films.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Darby, 13, said his friends never have trouble getting  
into R-rated films, and sometimes get adults in line to pretend 
they are together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think kids are going to see R-rated films anyway,'' said  
Darby, waiting with a friend to see a movie at New York's Sony 
Lincoln Square in Manhattan. Even if young people can't get into 
the theater, they'll see violent movies on video or cable 
television, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darby said he doesn't think movie-violence makes children commit  
crime in real life, and said adults were focusing too much on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teens agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You see worse things every day out on the street,'' said  
14-year-old Jimmy Moore, in the lobby of the Columbus movie 
theater. ``At least here it's fake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Motion Picture Association of America initially had ratings  
of G, M, R and X. The M -- for mature audiences -- was changed to PG, 
for parental guidance suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, the PG rating was split to include a tougher PG-13 for  
a higher level of intensity. Six years later, the NC-17 category 
was created to separate films with strong adult content from porno 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, head of the association, applauded the new  
measures and called the agreement ``a big step forward.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Takes Stake in Personalized TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC is partnering with a fledgling technology  
company to sell digital video recorders that automatically find 
shows to fit the viewer's personal tastes and allow commercials to 
be skipped. 
</P>
<P>
	While the new recorders, created by TiVo Inc., could mean people  
will watch fewer ads, NBC is banking on the technology because the 
machines can choose ads targeted specifically to the interests of 
each viewer. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC expects consumers will buy millions of the new digital  
recorders in the same way they turned to VCRs during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Digital recording is going to happen. It's going to be a fact  
of life,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC Cable, which will make 
a multi-million dollar investment in TiVo and work with the company 
in refining the recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an integral part of television's future. By  
doing this investment, we are hooking up with the company we 
believe has the most momentum to grabbing that future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV networks are facing declining viewership due to heavy  
competition from cable TV and the Internet. Although advertising 
revenues are still on the rise, networks are now looking for new 
ways to generate revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies are also betting on making money from TiVo's  
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in TiVo, a small, privately held company based in  
Sunnyvale, Calif., include the consumer electronics maker Philips 
Electronics, the satellite TV company DirecTV, Showtime Networks, 
and Vulcan Ventures, the investment company run by Microsoft 
co-founder Paul Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	TiVo's main rival, Replay Networks Inc., of Mountain View,  
signed a deal Tuesday to have the electronics maker Panasonic 
manufacture its devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar to Replay Networks, TiVo's device stores TV shows on a  
high-capacity computer disk for viewers to watch when they're 
ready. The boxes can record 14 hours to 30 hours, depending on the 
size of the hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, which will sit atop the TV set like a cable TV box,  
also gives viewers controls to pause, rewind and ``instant replay'' 
television without using a videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	TiVo sells its recorders directly over the Internet and expects  
to have them in retail stores by July or August. The 14-hour 
version sells for $499 and the 30-hour box costs $999. Customers 
also pay a $9.95 monthly service fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay boxes are expected be in stores in time for the holiday  
shopping season. Replay's device costs from $699 to $1,499 
depending on storage capacity. There is no monthly service fee. 
</P>
<P>
	With the alliance, NBC will gain a prominent position on TiVo's  
electronic programming screen, which gives viewers a menu for 
programs they want to record. As they select programs, the box 
builds a profile of the viewer's preferences and will automatically 
record similar shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the TiVo and Replay boxes allow viewers to quickly bypass  
commercials in a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The critical issue for NBC was the concept of targeted  
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and TiVo plan to modify the system to allow the network to  
download large batches of ads onto the hard disk. The device would 
then pick ads that fit the viewer's personal profile and insert 
them into programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hope that by tailoring the ad package, viewers will be  
less likely to skip them. The digital recorders also create other 
opportunities, such as selling ads that would appear on the TiVo 
program schedule, said Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester 
Research in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all opportunities NBC would like to investigate as a  
potential bulwark against the loss of advertising,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also important for NBC: Unlike Replay, TiVo won't tout its  
commercial-killing capability, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``TiVo preserves our advertising model,'' he said during a  
conference call with reporters. ``Digital programming where ads 
would be automatically zapped would be anathema to what 
broadcasting is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practically speaking, the new technology means viewers will be  
watching fewer ads, said Bernoff. A Forrester study predicts that 
commercial viewing will decline by 8 percent during the next five 
years and 50 percent over 10 years as a result of digital 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a TiVo at home and I never watch commercials anymore,''  
said Bernoff.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Buys Business From CNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Allstate Corp. moved further Wednesday  
to take a stake in the independent agent market with the purchase 
of a CNA Financial Corp. unit that sells home and auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is designed to help Allstate become the leading  
provider of auto and homeowners insurance in the $45 billion 
independent agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate said the move will increase its total annual premium  
revenue from the independent agent channel to about $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company currently sells most of its policies through its own  
employees rather than independent agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate, based in this northern Chicago suburb, will pay $140  
million cash to CNA for the business. It is also committing about 
$950 million of its capital to support the business. The balance of 
the deal involves a marketing royalty Allstate will pay to CNA 
Insurance for the use of its brand name for the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is an important and complementary step in  
Allstate's goal of becoming the major force in the independent 
agent personal lines market,'' Edward Liddy, Allstate's chairman, 
president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based CNA's operation currently has annual premium  
revenue of $1.7 billion and distributes its auto and homeowners 
insurance products through a network of 3,800 independent agents in 
43 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of  
both companies, and is subject to various regulatory approvals. The 
transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate will establish a new business, CNA Personal Insurance,  
that will sell CNA personal lines insurance under its current brand 
name. The 2,000 employees of the existing CNA operation will 
transfer to the new business, the company said.

Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, 37, dressed in a ceremonial military suit draped with

	At Amman's hilltop Raghadan Palace, Abdullah inspected an honor  
guard before presiding over a gala reception of 800 dignitaries and 
representatives of ruling Gulf Arab countries.

	In the palace's ornate Throne Chamber, the king bestowed upon  
Rania the prestigious Hussein Ben Ali decoration to reward her for 
her social activities since becoming queen two months ago. 
</P>

	A tearful Rania kissed Abdullah as she accepted the $200,000

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Celebrates King's Ascension </HEADLINE>

<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Thousands of Jordanians thronged Amman's  
streets Wednesday to celebrate the accession of King Abdullah II to 
the throne he inherited four months ago from his late father, King 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah, 37, dressed in a ceremonial military suit draped with  
golden decorations, waved to his cheering subjects from the back of 
a convertible beige Buick that was part of his father's collection.

<HEADLINE> Golden Swimmer Van Dyken To Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The first American woman to win four gold  
medals in an Olympics, Amy Van Dyken returns to competition this 
weekend after a one-year layoff following shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to get back to this part of my life, I'm so excited  
that I can't really put it into words,'' said Van Dyken, one of 
several world champions who will be competing in the Charlotte 
UltraSwim starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken won golds in the 1996 Summer Games in the 50-meter  
freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly, and as a member of the 400 
freestyle and 400 medley relay teams. This weekend, however, she'll 
be competing only in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous, really nervous,'' she said. ``This is a different  
kind of nervous from Atlanta. In the Olympics I was nervous, but 
yet I was confident. Right now, I just don't know what to expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Van Dyken does know is that she has overcome the odds. The  
original prognosis following her injury was that she would never 
swim competitively again. 
</P>
<P>
	After injuring her right shoulder while lifting weights May 10,  
1997, Van Dyken couldn't take a single stroke in the pool without 
significant pain. But she refused to accept the opinion that her 
career was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	She was referred to Dr. Wayne Gersoff, the Colorado Rockies team  
physician, who told her he could fix the shoulder so she could 
return to competitive swimming. Damaged cartilage and other 
problems in the shoulder joint were repaired June 23, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken didn't even attempt to swim again until this past  
February. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I wasn't swimming, I kind of felt an emptiness because I  
knew I wasn't done,'' she said. ``When I found out I could swim 
again and not only swim but be competitive, I was absolutely 
ecstatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, 26, of Littleton, Colo., has undergone intense  
therapy and rehabilitation for several months. Her regimen included 
three-hours-a-day sessions with trainers from the Denver Broncos, 
helping her get into what she says is the best shape of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing she's behind on is pool time, and she's been  
catching up in that phase in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	After this weekend's Charlotte meet, Van Dyken has more events  
planned later this year, and if all goes well, she can shift her 
attention to the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I'm back doing this,'' she said. ``I'm not waking  
up at 5:30 in the morning and driving 53 miles to practice every 
day just to get back in shape or to look good in a bikini. I miss 
the competition, and if you're a competitor, you're thinking 
Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first things first. Van Dyken is still breaking through scar  
tissue in her surgically repaired shoulder, and she spends much of 
her days with an ice bag wrapped around the shoulder. She is taking 
anti-inflammatory medication and still has pain in the joint, but 
substantially less than before surgery. It is expected to subside 
within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	She harbors no thoughts about winning either event this weekend;  
simply earning a berth in a consolation final would be enough of a 
reward. 
</P>
<P>
	She has some other priorities for the weekend, including seeing  
all the people she hasn't seen for a year, putting on a racing suit 
again and catching up on the latest gossip. 
</P>
<P>
	``But most of all, I look forward to getting out there and doing  
what I do best, which is racing,'' she said. ``I get such a kick 
out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Czechs Qualify for Euro 2000 Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Czech Republic, runners-up four years ago to Germany, became  
the first team to qualify for the Euro 2000 Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs rallied to beat Scotland 3-2 Wednesday on a header by  
Jan Koller in the 87th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, which needed a win to become the second team to qualify --  
besides automatic qualifiers Belgium and the Netherlands -- drew 0-0 
against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup champion France continued to confound. The French  
edged Andorra 1-0 in Barcelona, Spain, on a penalty kick in the 
85th minute by Frank Leboeuf after Jose Manuel Garcia Luena was 
called for a hand ball. The French played with 10 men for more than 
an hour after Christophe Dugarry was sent off. 
</P>
<P>
	The win keeps France's hopes alive of qualifying, moving the  
team into second place in Group 4 behind Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	England's chances of reaching the final 16 next year received a  
severe setback with a 1-1 tie in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Shearer gave England a 1-0 lead in the 15th, but Bulgaria  
tied it three minutes later with Gerogi Markov scoring. Bulgaria's 
Martin Petrov was sent off in the 58th minute but the English still 
couldn't capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden, which did not play Wednesday, leads Group 5 with 13  
points and has all but qualified. Poland won 3-2 in Luxembourg and 
moved to 12 points. England has nine points with the tie.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Allow Carry-On Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Carry-on coffee has been cleared for take-off.  
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that  
passengers can keep the cups of coffee they've carried onto 
airliners despite rules saying that carry-on items must be put 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came after a flight attendant for Alaska Airlines  
complained that the FAA inspector overseeing the West Coast carrier 
was forcing it to collect carry-on coffee cups out of concerns that 
passengers could be splashed with hot liquid if a plane made a 
sudden stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors overseeing Alaska's competitors, especially those  
flying out of a coffee hot spot such as Seattle, did not have the 
same rule -- prompting complaints of unfairness. That triggered an 
agency review of the consistency and common sense of some rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memorandum being sent to the agency's airline inspectors,  
Nick Lacey, head of flight standards for the FAA, said passengers 
could keep their coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will also write to airlines saying they may want to  
evaluate their preflight routine so flight attendants are given an 
opportunity to ask passengers if they want to discard any carry-on 
items before take-off, said FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Still under review is the agency's policy regarding glassware,  
Duquette said. Some U.S. carriers have complained that they are at 
a disadvantage with foreign counterparts because the FAA requires 
them to collect all glassware before a plane begins taxiing. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines like to pamper passengers in first and business class  
with china, linen and crystal service, but the policy forces them 
to collect glasses and pour drinks into plastic cups once a plane 
leaves the gate. Until now, even those cups have had to be 
collected before take-off. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA rulebook says passengers must put all items in the  
overhead compartments or under the seat in front of them before 
take-off and landing. There are exceptions for such items as books 
or newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA rules also require airlines to collect ``service items,''  
which could range from a preflight drink to a food tray left over 
from the meal service. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules have come into question with the reduction in airline  
food service and the boom in airport concession stands. 
Increasingly, hungry travelers are bringing entire meals aboard 
their flights.

<HEADLINE> China's Bank Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's central bank cut interest rates for the  
fourth time in 16 months Wednesday in new attempt to get consumers 
to spend and revive flagging economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Bank of China, in a statement carried by state  
media, said that as of Thursday deposit rates at financial 
institutions will drop an average of 1 percentage point and lending 
rates by three-fourths of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	The reduction, rumored for weeks, is particularly aimed at  
reversing price deflation by getting Chinese to spend some of the 
$700 billion sitting in private bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, however, thought the cut would have little effect.  
Since the last interest rate drop, in December, prices have fallen 
with the retail price index in April 3.5 percent lower than a year 
earlier. Bank deposits, meanwhile, rose 19.2 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs have also quickened this year amid the free-market  
restructuring by state industries that has also eroded economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weak consumption is not because consumers don't have money but  
because they don't want to spend it,'' Shawn Xu, head of research 
at China International Capital Corp., told Dow Jones Newswires. 
``Their future income is more uncertain at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capital markets have responded to the rate cut. China's  
government-bond market fell Wednesday on profit-taking after sharp 
gains Tuesday on the rate cut rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects of cheaper borrowing costs -- for the state and Chinese  
companies -- have also helped boost stocks. The main A share indexes 
at the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges closed 1.1 percent and 1.2 
percent higher Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Ralph Ellison novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the past five years, John F. Callahan has  
had the literary world's most awesome, and controversial job. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ralph Ellison died, he left unfinished a novel he had  
worked on for 40 years, the intended successor to his celebrated 
``Invisible Man.'' The materials took months just to organize at 
the Library of Congress. They fill 10 boxes. They include 
everything from computer printouts to handwritten notes on the 
backs of envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was up to Callahan, Ellison's literary executor, to shape  
this into a single, publishable volume. Box by box, he sorted 
through the papers. He photocopied some 2,000 pages. He found up to 
25 drafts of individual scenes, drafts spanning decades, varying in 
both content and style. 
</P>
<P>
	And he discovered a project that Ellison hinted he had nearly  
completed was, in fact, not even close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me a while to realize how much I had to do. There were  
several potential novels,'' said Callahan, a professor of 
humanities at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when I thought, `Gee, is this going to work?'  
And there were times I was glad to be participating in this journey 
that was 40 years long and very, very deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellison's ``Invisible Man,'' published in 1952, is now regarded  
as one of the century's greatest novels. Its unnamed narrator's 
political and social education anticipated the struggles of the 
Civil Rights era and its language is still one of the great 
statements of literary integration, a melting pot of T.S. Eliot, 
jazz, Dostoevsky and black folklore. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``new'' novel, untitled in Ellison's lifetime, is called  
``Juneteenth.'' It is 350 pages and will have a first printing of 
100,000, almost ensuring best-seller status. Morgan Freeman is 
reportedly interested in starring in a film adaptation, with Quincy 
Jones and David Mamet also involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Among critics, ``Juneteenth'' is the most anticipated work of  
fiction of the year, maybe many years. It arrives mid-June 
(Juneteenth is slang for the day in 1865 that Union soldiers 
brought word to Texas of the Emancipation Proclamation) with the 
blessing of Ellison's widow, Fanny, and with a blurb from Nobel 
laureate Toni Morrison, who praises the book as a ``majestic 
narrative concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But does ``Juneteenth'' work as literature or is it simply a  
``concept''? With Callahan forced to make choices Ellison himself 
never got around to, the publication is causing as much discussion 
about posthumous works in general as about the novel itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those kinds of books make me nervous, because you don't know  
what's the work of the writer and what's the work of the editor,'' 
said critic Harold Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think when you're dealing with a work of genius you  
can't assume he would make the same decisions,'' said author and 
columnist Stanley Crouch, a friend of Ellison's. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might be able to do that with Mickey Spillane or  
Jacqueline Susann. But when you step into the ring with Ellison, or 
Hemingway, or Faulkner, the best thing for you to do is leave it 
lay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan doesn't claim to know what Ellison wanted, and it  
wouldn't necessarily matter; authors aren't always their own best 
critics. A dying Franz Kafka asked that the manuscripts of such 
classics-to-be as ``The Castle'' and ``The Trial'' be burned, and 
Virgil made a deathbed request that his epic poem, ``The Aeneid,'' 
be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	There are really two traditions of posthumous books. One is  
simply to publish them as the author left them; that's why ``The 
Castle'' and F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Last Tycoon'' have no 
endings. The other, more troublesome tradition, is to change them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Canterbury Tales,'' for example, was unfinished at the  
time of Chaucer's death and his executors had to organize the 
fragments. To this day, there is no definitive text. Several 
unfinished Ernest Hemingway novels, from ``Islands in the Stream'' 
to the upcoming ``True at First Light,'' have been edited 
posthumously -- to greatly mixed reactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellison actually left behind three sets of manuscripts, for an  
apparent trilogy, and no instructions on what to do should he die. 
According to Callahan, only volume two was near completion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unimaginable something like that would happen to me,''  
said Edward Mendelson, literary executor for the estate of W.H. 
Auden. ``It's like asking what I would do if Auden came from 
Mars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never dream of attempting what this brave person  
(Callahan) has attempted,'' said Henry Hardy, the longtime editor 
for Isaiah Berlin and now a literary trustee for the late 
philosopher's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, Berlin didn't leave any work in that sort of  
state. His problem was of reluctance to publish rather than getting 
things into a more or less publishable form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan, who first met the author in the 1970s, said Fanny  
Ellison talked to him about the book a few days after her husband's 
death, in 1994. She asked if Callahan could organize an accessible 
narrative, one with a beginning, middle and end. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed that they should try to satisfy both specialists and  
common readers. ``Juneteenth'' is intended for the large audience 
Ellison enjoyed for ``Invisible Man.'' Within the next few years, a 
longer, scholarly edition is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	But although the words in ``Juneteenth'' are all Ellison's,  
reviewers have been disappointed. The New York Times' Michiko 
Kakutani cited ``bravura'' writing by Ellison, but found the novel 
``sketchy'' and ``unconvincing.'' James Marcus, reviewing the book 
for Amazon.com, said Callahan's ``splice job -- which well may be 
the best one possible -- remains weak at the seams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the target of criticism and I should be the target,''  
Callahan said. ``And I don't mind, particularly when the gist of 
the criticism seems to be that Ralph's work is so wonderful. Ralph 
is one of the greatest American writers and I just want his work to 
get out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Juneteenth,'' Callahan began with Ellison's opening  
section of the first manuscript and segued to the second book, 
which had the clearest plot and featured the trilogy's central 
characters: the Rev. Alonzo Hickman, a black Baptist minister, and 
Sen. Adam Sunraider, a right-wing politician of uncertain racial 
background. 
</P>
<P>
	The novel opens with a young black man shooting Sunraider on the  
Senate floor. On his deathbed, the senator summons his old friend 
Hickman and their long, complicated relationship is revealed 
through flashbacks and interior monologues. 
</P>
<P>
	As in ``Invisible Man'' and so many of his essays, Ellison's  
themes in ``Juneteenth'' were identity and the mysterious history 
between American blacks and whites. He did not think of blacks as 
exiled Africans, but as quintessential Americans, their fates 
inseparable from their white compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was engaging in an examination of America and race that  
would have been so valuable to have in the '60s and '70s and 
'80s,'' said novelist Charles Johnson. ``If we could have just had 
this interjected into the discourse of race in America. But we 
didn't see any of this until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some friends of Ellison, ``Juneteenth'' is shadowed by  
what's left out. Author Albert Murray, who first met Ellison in the 
1930s, recalled many discussions about the work in progress. He 
imagined the finished work as similar to William Faulkner's 
``Snopes'' trilogy, interconnected stories that join a whole 
community of characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an overall conception of the book which was much more  
ambitious than the impression you get from `Juneteenth,''' said 
Murray, who will publish a collection of letters between himself 
and Ellison in conjunction with the paperback edition of 
``Juneteenth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As it stands, I think there are little holes in it.''  
</P>
<P>
	No one will ever know why Ellison couldn't finish the second  
novel, but one theory is that he had burdened himself with trying 
to top ``Invisible Man.'' For that job, even 40 years doesn't seem 
like enough time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its so rich, so inexhaustibly rich,'' said Johnson, whose  
novels include ``Middle Passage,'' winner of the 1990 National Book 
Award. ``You can go back to the novel over the course of a lifetime 
and make literary and historical discoveries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said that Ellison first showed him an excerpt from the  
next book in the mid-1950s and that they talked about it over a 
period of several years. Ellison would occasionally give readings 
from his ``work in progress'' and passages appeared in literary 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the novel, however, proved as elusive as the  
Invisible Man's search for community. Ellison was apparently close 
in the 1960s, until a fire destroyed much of the original 
manuscript. Endlessly revising and reconstructing, he kept working 
on it right up to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had the idea he had writer's block,'' Murray said.  
``What he had was the opposite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellison didn't stop publishing altogether after ``Invisible  
Man.'' In his lifetime, he came out with ``Shadow and Act'' and 
``Going to the Territory,'' both collections of essays, interviews 
and speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan owns a first edition of ``Going to the Territory,'' and  
the book is inscribed: ``For John Callahan,'' Ellison wrote, ``my 
friend, who knows the `territory' is an ideal place, ever to be 
sought, ever to be missed, but always there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As I worked on the manuscript,'' Callahan said, ``I began to  
think about what he wrote to me. The 'territory' began to stand for 
the novel -- always there, always to be sought. And I felt like one 
of these characters who was trying to make his way through the 
territory and get familiar with the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Ralph really knew the terrain. The novel in Ralph's mind  
-- THAT was an ideal novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Three excerpts from Ralph Ellison's novel ``Juneteenth'':  

</P>
<P>
	``They submitted patiently, amused that anyone should consider  
them capable of harm, and for the first time an emotion broke the 
immobility of their faces. They chuckled, winked and smiled, fully 
aware of the comic aspect of the situation. Here they were, quiet, 
old, and obviously religious black folk who, because they had 
attempted to see the man who was considered the most vehement enemy 
of their people in either house of Congress, were being 
energetically searched by uniformed security police, and they knew 
what the absurd outcome would be. They were found to be armed with 
nothing more dangerous than pieces of fried chicken and ham 
sandwiches, chocolate cake and sweet-potato fried pies.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Pink blossoms were thick in the tree, the petals scattered  
broadside upon the grass, and as I breathed them in the fragrance 
mixed wildly with her own and that cool touching and going of her 
peach-brown arm sang in me like passionate words whispered in a 
dark place. Who spread the petals along our path, my mind asked, 
who arched this afternoon above our heads? And looking down at her 
feet twinkling in and out below her long, ankle-length skirt, I 
said, 'How beautiful are your feet in shoes, Miss Teasing Brown.''' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	```Reverend Bliss,' Hickman was saying, `in the dark of night,  
alone in the desert of my own loneliness I have thought long upon 
this. I have thought upon you and me and all the old scriptural 
stories of Isaac and Joseph and upon our slave forefathers who 
killed their babies rather than have them lost in bondage, and upon 
my life here and the trials and tribulations and the jokes and 
laughter and all the endless turns-about that mark man's life in 
this world -- and each time I return, each time my mind returns and 
makes its painful way back to the mystery of you and the mystery of 
birth and resurrection and hope which now seems endless in its 
complication.'''

<HEADLINE> Caller to Mobile Phone May Soon Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The Federal Communications Commission plans to  
propose rules Thursday that would make it easier for wireless 
carriers to have callers -- rather than receivers -- of a 
mobile-phone call foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, which the FCC hopes to have in place by the first  
quarter of 2000, would enable wireless providers to have callers 
pay for mobile phone calls just as they do with regular phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission sees the rules as a way to boost consumer use of  
wireless phones and foster competition between providers of 
wireless and regular phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to introduce wireless services to a whole new class of  
consumers,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said in an interview 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the receiver of a mobile-phone call -- not  
the caller -- typically pays the charges. As a result, many 
Americans switch off their phones to avoid unwanted calls. In 
Europe and Asia, however, it's the caller who usually pays. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules, which will be open for comment following the  
announcement, don't force wireless carriers to charge callers but 
are supposed to make it easier for them to offer the ``calling 
party pays'' service. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the issues the FCC plans to address in reaching a final  
rule is how consumers would know whether they were calling a 
wireless phone, which might incur them greater charges than a call 
to a regular line. 
</P>
<P>
	An option is to have a notification voice message that tells  
callers they have reached a wireless number and how much they will 
be charged after they dial a wireless phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is to have a prefix number specifically set  
aside for use with wireless phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The single most important issue we have to deal with is how do  
we protect consumers,'' Kennard said. ``We want to make sure they 
know what they're getting into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the FCC will work with state regulators and consumer  
groups on how to inform customers of such a service. 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies now provide some form of the caller-pays  
approach, and others have test marketed the service in certain 
states. One issue the wireless industry will have to consider is 
how to handle billing, since companies will be charging callers who 
are not their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC hopes that by offering the service, wireless providers  
will be able to compete more effectively against regular telephone 
providers. Consumers might be more encouraged to use mobile phones 
-- even possibly as their primary phone -- if the do not have to pay 
to receive calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wireless phone should be a substitute, not just a complement,  
for wireline phones,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also planned to release a report Thursday on the  
wireless industry that shows competition growing among providers, 
an increase in the number of subscribers to wireless services and 
lower prices.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw Debut Might Draw Sellout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A few years ago, professional women's  
basketball routinely was played in front of a few scattered fans 
and thousands of empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport has come a long way fast. On Thursday night, the  
WNBA's Washington Mystics expect to draw a sellout crowd of more 
than 20,000 for their season opener against the Charlotte Sting -- 
and will be disappointed if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts will be going 'thump, thump,' '' said center  
Shalonda Enis, who thought 3,000 was a good turnout when she was 
playing the last 2 1/2 years for the ABL's Seattle Reign. 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to say the throngs are coming out to see No. 1 overall  
draft pick Chamique Holdsclaw make the most anticipated pro debut 
in women's basketball history, but the Mystics would probably have 
filled the MCI Center even if they didn't have the so-called female 
Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, despite a 3-27 record, the team averaged 15,910 fans  
and had two sellouts of 20,674 -- the largest crowds ever to watch a 
women's pro basketball game in the United States. The WNBA, only 
three years old, is healthy enough to make plans for four expansion 
teams next season. 
</P>
<P>
	For coach Nancy Darsch, it's the arrival of the big time  
happening before her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the potential was there,'' Darsch said. ``We've seen  
it in the college game at many different programs around the 
country. We saw in Atlanta in 1996 at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think there certainly still was some question as to  
who's going to come to the MCI Center in July. Who's going to go to 
Madison Square Garden in July? The fans have certainly answered 
that with an exclamation point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Rhonda Blades, playing with her third WNBA team in three  
years, realizes she arrived at just the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It don't really consider myself a pioneer, but in this league  
I've been there since the beginning,'' Blades said. ``It's 
wonderful not only for women's basketball, but for women's sports 
and women in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become the thing to do. You've got people like Chamique  
that come out and put their stamp on women's basketball. She 
appeals to a different crowd than even Rebecca Lobo did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the hype surrounding her, Holdsclaw has kept an even  
keel during the Mystics camp. The two-time player of the year from 
Tennessee realizes her game may be notch above the rest, but she's 
also tried to play down the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to say something about herself during the Mystics luncheon  
on Tuesday, Holdsclaw stood and said: ``I'm from Tennessee. I'm a 
rookie.''

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. said today it will  
eliminate 15,000 jobs worldwide over six years -- about 13 percent 
of its work force -- and close about 10 plants in a global

some of the damaging allegations Norris made during two days on the 
witness stand. Backed by handwritten notes, Norris testified at 
Microsoft's antitrust trial that the software giant offered 
valuable discounts for Windows if IBM agreed not to distribute 
rival software on its line of computers. But Norris, a mid-level 
manager, also backed off a central claim in his earlier testimony -- 
that Microsoft proposed an alliance in 1994 if IBM would abandon 
its rival OS/2 operating system and ``primarily promote'' Windows 
on its computers.

<HEADLINE> FAA Proposes Alaska Airlines Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed  
that Alaska Airlines pay a $44,000 fine for violations at the 
airline's Oakland, Calif., maintenance facility. 
</P>
<P>
	An FAA inspector originally recommended the fine be more than $1  
million. But the proposed penalty was reduced after it was 
determined that top officials at the Seattle-based Alaska Airlines 
were unaware of the violations, said Monroe Balton, deputy regional 
counsel of the FAA's Western Pacific office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the fine, the FAA has proposed revoking the  
federal mechanic's licenses of three Alaska managers at the Oakland 
hangar, the most severe sanction that can be taken against them.

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire Town Waiting for Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CASTLE, N.H. (AP) -- The smallest town in New Hampshire is  
bracing for something big. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Texas Gov. George W. Bush arrives Monday for his  
first presidential campaign trip to New Hampshire, journalists 
outnumber New Castle's 73 schoolchildren nearly two-to-one. 
</P>
<P>
	Has any other candidate -- declared or undeclared -- ever arrived  
with such fanfare? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not even close,'' said former Gov. Hugh Gregg. ``There's never  
been anyone who came in with all this backup, all this national 
support. It's entirely unheard of in New Hampshire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Castle is a picturesque island community just one square  
mile in size. By Wednesday morning, Bush's campaign staff already 
had rearranged the furniture in the town library, where Bush and 
his wife plan to read to a small group of kindergartners through 
second-graders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's taken on a life of its own,'' Police Chief Jim Murphy  
said of the visit. ``It's a challenge for a department our size, 
but I think we'll do as well as any big city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy expects 500 to 1,000 people to gather on the town common  
for Bush's early morning appearance Monday. Sheriff's deputies will 
be helping his three full-time and two part-time officers control 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush stayed in Texas to finish the legislative session,  
Republican leaders traveled to meet with him. But New Hampshire 
voters have a tradition of demanding one-on-one time with 
presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him a little bit on TV, he's an impressive man, but  
as for a definite opinion, right now I don't have one,'' said Joe 
Calderara, a retired town postmaster who now directs traffic into 
the park where Bush will speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Down at the post office, Gene Morrill said he's also waiting for  
some specifics about Bush's positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know about his father, we've heard of him, but we don't  
know anything about his political views,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush acknowledges that coming to the state so late will make it  
harder for him to engage in the retail politics New Hampshire 
prides itself on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just means I have to go up there a lot and shake as many  
hands as I can,'' he said Tuesday. ``My first hurdle is to tell 
people what's in my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's if he can get to them.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he has to fight through rope lines to talk to people,  
that's not a typical New Hampshire primary moment,'' said Tom Rath, 
a Concord lawyer and consultant to Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not begrudging the success the Bush folks have had in  
getting where they are today, but in the end the primary is going 
to turn on the normal way the New Hampshire primary moves forward: 
direct interaction with others, not total control of the agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dan Hughes, chairman of the New Castle Republicans, said  
Bush will have plenty of opportunity to connect with New Hampshire 
voters, even with hundreds of reporters looking over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's here to meet the people one-on-one and let them meet him.  
One-on-one, retail politics, that's what we do here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his pile of endorsements from around the state and the  
nation, Bush still has to prove himself, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to vote, I think,'' he said. The town may be  
called New Castle, he said, ``But we haven't had any coronations 
here that I remember.''

<HEADLINE> Inhofe To Protest Hormel Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dispute over President Clinton's  
ambassadorial appointment of an openly gay San Francisco 
philanthropist could wind up slowing a range of Senate 
confirmations sought by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the appointments that could be jeopardized: Lawrence  
Summers to be treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke to be 
ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., threatened Tuesday to  
single-handedly hold up ``every single presidential nomination'' to 
protest Clinton's appointment of James Hormel to be ambassador to 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired of waiting for the Senate to act after nearly two years  
had passed since he nominated Hormel, Clinton on Friday invoked a 
constitutional provision allowing him to install an official in a 
post during a congressional recess, sidestepping the Senate 
confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhofe, who had led the opposition to Hormel's confirmation,  
said the president ``has shown contempt for the Congress and the 
Constitution.'' He called the appointment, while Congress was on 
its one-week recess for Memorial Day, ``highly inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton originally submitted Hormel's nomination in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the so-called ``recess appointment,'' Hormel will be able  
to serve in the post until the end of 2000, without Senate 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., joined Inhofe in  
criticizing Clinton, saying the president's move to appoint Hormel 
was ``a subversion of the confirmation process.'' But Lott 
indicated he was unlikely to go along with Inhofe's blanket 
objection to presidential nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Lott conceded that Inhofe's tactics could dramatically  
slow down the confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said, ``It's hard to think that  
the Senate would allow itself to be blocked from fulfilling its 
constitutional responsibility because one member is upset because 
of a particular appointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the attention the Hormel appointment has received, the  
president ``has been extremely judicious in his use of recess 
appointments,'' Toiv said, adding that Clinton has made 57 such 
appointments in his 6 1/2 years in office, compared with President 
Reagan's 239 in eight years and President Bush's 78 in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, the former dean of the University of Chicago law school  
and a well-known San Francisco fund-raiser, will be the nation's 
first openly gay U.S. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	By custom, any senator can block a presidential nomination by  
placing a parliamentary ``hold'' on it. Inhofe said he was acting 
on a precedent set by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who in 1985 placed 
holds on Reagan's appointments until Reagan agreed to refrain from 
making recess appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is no formal rule on such ``holds,'' and they do  
not have to be honored by the Senate majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, despite his own opposition to Hormel's nomination, told  
reporters it ``would not be my inclination'' to allow any single 
senator to single-handedly block every nomination. ``I wouldn't 
honor a hold indefinitely,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he conceded that Inhofe had the right to use delaying  
tactics to slow down nominations on a case-by-case basis -- tactics 
that require a 60-vote majority in the 100-member Senate to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a Lott spokesman, said late Tuesday that Lott  
hoped to work things out with Inhofe so that all nominations 
weren't blocked. ``There are a lot of important nominations coming 
down the pike,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said Lott shared Inhofe's objections to Clinton's  
decision to use a recess appointment for Hormel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel supporters have claimed he would have been confirmed if  
the nomination had ever come to the floor for a vote.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Limit on Balkans Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House cheered the Kosovo peace pact  
Wednesday even as it debated legislation that would restrict funds 
for the Balkans. Members also voted to tighten security at the 
nation's nuclear labs and demand a withdrawal of American troops 
from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of last month's congressional report on Chinese  
espionage, the House approved a series of measures to beef up 
counterintelligence and to keep closer watch on technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, the House voted 227-198 to pull the permanent  
force of U.S. troops out of Haiti by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to leave our troops in Haiti in an open-ended  
deployment,'' said House International Relations Committee Chairman 
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents complained that the peacekeeping force in Haiti  
numbered fewer than 500 troops. ``Haiti does not have an army now 
because they agreed to get rid of it,'' said Rep. John Conyers, 
D-Mich. ``Our troops are not in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-led chamber also rejected, as it has done in past  
years, a proposal to liberalize the ban on abortions at military 
hospitals overseas. It turned back, 225-203, a proposal to allow 
the procedues if the woman paid for it with her own funds. 
</P>
<P>
	With a Kosovo peace accord now in hand, Democrats and some  
Republicans hoped on Thursday to strip from the $288.8 billion 
defense authorization bill a provision denying funds for military 
or peacekeeping operations after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	That provision, strongly opposed by the White House, would  
``pull defeat from victory,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, 
senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House broke into bipartisan applause when Skelton announced  
Wednesday afternoon that a peace accord had been signed. ``I 
thought the House should know that,'' Skelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, House conservatives rebelled against an effort  
by House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to remove the provision 
from the bill after strenuous administration objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the provision would prohibit U.S. funds from being  
used for either combat or peacekeeping operations in any part of 
Yugoslavia beyond the Sept. 30 end of the present fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	If the president wanted to continue such operations, however, he  
could cite national security grounds and submit separate 
legislation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, expressed support for the provision -- but agreed the 
peace agreement might changes some votes on a series of 
Kosovo-related measures due up on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, meanwhile, praised the peace agreement. ``I hope the  
people of Yugoslavia see this as an opportunity to replace their 
leadership, especially Mr. Milosevic,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said that it was ``inappropriate and  
ill-advised'' for the House to be considering a cutoff of Kosovo 
funds at the same time that peace plans were being made final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes the House a laughing stock,'' Frost said.  
</P>
<P>
	A vote on an effort to delete the provision was expected on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-led chamber has not been supportive of the NATO  
air campaign. On a tie vote in late April, it withheld support for 
the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted 428 to 0 for a package of amendments  
from members of a House committee that last month concluded China 
stole U.S. nuclear secrets over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The package beefs up counterintelligence programs at the Energy  
Department, requires polygraph tests of employees at national 
laboratories, restricts lab visits by foreigners and requires a 
barrage of new reports to Congress on technology exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a balanced response to an urgent problem,'' said Rep.  
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., the chairman of the committee and the 
author of the amendments. ``Our report found wholesale inexcusable 
national security weaknesses ... at our laboratories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Cox  
committee, said the package ``will help solve the glaring security 
problems we have at the laboratories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dicks also said President Clinton and Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson already had put into practice many of the security 
measures. ``Let's stay away from the blame game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, meanwhile, told reporters the administration was  
ready to accept most of the proposals offered by Cox and Dicks. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that he hoped some changes still could be made in  
the proposal in the legislation for a moratorium on foreign 
laboratory visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation imposes a 90-day ban on such visits. The House  
rejected, 266-159, an even tougher amendment by Rep. Jim Ryun, 
R-Kan., for a two-year moratorium on visits to labs by foreigners 
from ``sensitive countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation includes nearly $40 million for  
counterintelligence activities at U.S. labs, about three times the 
president's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying defense bill also includes a 4.8 percent military  
pay raise for 2000, as does a Senate-passed measure, up from the 
4.4 percent proposed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration claims the pay package is expensive and could  
create a disparity with civilian pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also liberalizes the military retirement system,  
as does the Senate bill -- allowing military personnel to be able to 
retire after 20 years at 50 percent pay, up from the 40 percent 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provides $400 million more for ballistic missile defense  
programs than the $4.3 billion sought by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is HR 1401.

	SALISBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Anne Sheafe Miller, the first patient  
saved by penicillin when it was considered an experimental drug, 
died Monday. She was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Miller made medical history in 1942 as she lay near death  
in New Haven Hospital. She suffered from a streptococcal infection, 
her temperature spiking to nearly 107. Treatment with sulfa drugs, 
surgery and blood transfusions all failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Her doctors then tried a small amount of penicillin, an obscure,  
experimental drug at the time. Overnight, her temperature dropped 
sharply and she began a rapid recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Miller's chart from the hospital, later renamed Yale-New  
Haven Hospital, is in the Smithsonian Institution.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Say `Hasek Had Easy Night' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres can heap as much credit as they  
like on Dominik Hasek for their Game 1 victory in the Stanley Cup 
finals. The Dallas Stars still won't agree that he beat them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas players remained convinced Wednesday that they were to  
blame for their 3-2 loss because they didn't put enough pressure on 
Hasek. He was looking directly at most of the 35 shots he stopped 
and rarely faced more than one per possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he (Hasek) was a factor at all,'' said Joe  
Nieuwendyk, the Stars' leading playoff scorer. ``I don't think we 
went through enough of their people in order to get better scoring 
chances against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said Hasek ``had an easy night.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make life a lot more difficult for him,''  
Hitchcock said. ``I don't mean to the point where we're running 
him; I mean we have to be in position where we own the loose pucks 
around him. That's our game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had more first-shot opportunities than probably any game in  
the playoffs. But that doesn't matter. He's going to make those 
saves. We've got to get him out of position if we're going to 
score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hasek is known as The Dominator, the Stars aren't  
intimidated by him. They had beaten him four of their last five 
meetings before Game 1, with a long list of players having scored 
against the NHL's reigning two-time MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull put the puck between Hasek's legs midway through the  
first period on Dallas' first power play. The Stars had a man 
advantage nine more times, but couldn't capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek wasn't at his highlight-reel best, but was always in  
proper position to block the puck, even on the several occassions 
when he lost his stick. Dallas never caught him leaning the wrong 
way mainly because he didn't let the Stars get to many rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care who the goalie is, if you make it tough for him  
to see the first shot, the second and third chances are going to be 
there,'' Dallas center Mike Modano said. ``You've got to play for 
your space in front of the net, then you've got to stay there until 
someone clears you out or Hasek freezes the puck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's play kept the Sabres one shot from tying the game and  
they finally got it midway through the third period. Then Buffalo 
went ahead a few minutes later. Dallas capitalized on an empty net 
to tie the game with 48.3 seconds left. Jason Woolley won it with 
4:30 left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars had several point-blank chances to beat Hasek in the  
extra period, but whiffed each time. 
</P>
<P>
	When losing to a team with a top goaltender, players often fall  
into the trap of believing the goalie beat them. That idea can 
snowball to the point where players become tentative, fearing they 
have to make the perfect shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Joseph got into the Stars' heads two years ago when  
Edmonton knocked Dallas out of the playoffs in the first round. 
Since then, the Stars have been wary of giving goalies too much 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody who says Buffalo's goaltender won the game,  
they're not looking at the other 19 guys,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's 
a big part of their team, but they've got other people who stepped 
up and they did. Our players recognize that.''

<HEADLINE> Brain Damage-Cancer Defense Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Testicular cancer can lead to seizures, memory loss and dementia  
long before the cancer is detected, researchers reported today in 
the third study to link brain damage to an immune system attack on 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The brain damage apparently is caused not by the cancer itself,  
but by an overly aggressive attack by body's own immune system on a 
protein produced by tumors, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's New England Journal of Medicine, researchers said men  
with testicular cancer and damage to one of the brain's emotional 
centers had a particular type of antibody in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The antibody was found in most of the men's blood long before  
the cancer was detected, suggesting the antibodies could be used to 
give patients an early warning of testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Darnell of Rockefeller University, who has performed  
similar research but was not involved in this study, said these 
rare brain disorders could provide clues necessary to develop tumor 
vaccines and treatments for other degenerative brain diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very important models for how an immune response in  
the body can get into the brain and cause degeneration,'' he said. 
``This is very important for multiple sclerosis and maybe other 
degenerative diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers think the biological double-whammy happens because a  
tumor sometimes creates a protein normally found only in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the immune system ordinarily doesn't come across those  
proteins, it attacks them as invaders. But since the same protein 
is in the brain, the brain also is attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Raymond Voltz and colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering  
Cancer Center in New York tested samples from 986 cancer patients 
for antibodies to brain proteins. 
</P>
<P>
	One was a man who had testicular cancer and brain problems  
caused by inflammation in the limbic system, a part of the brain 
important in regulating emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	They found an antibody they had never seen before, and checked  
it against serum from 12 other men. All 12 had both testicular 
cancer and a related inflammation in either the limbic system or 
the brain stem. Nine of them also had the antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 10 men with the antibodies didn't have any symptoms  
of cancer when they went to the doctor for brain problems. The 
cancer was found six months later, on average, and as long as three 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Voltz and his colleagues compared the study group with several  
other types of patients, including those with tumor-related brain 
damage and people who had cancer but no brain damage. The antibody 
was unique to the combination of testicular cancer and inflammation 
of the limbic system or the brain stem. 
</P>
<P>
	This suggests that patients, especially young men, who have  
symptoms of this type of inflammation should be tested for the 
antibodies as an early check for testicular cancer, the doctors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnell reported a similar link to brain damage among breast and  
ovarian cancer patients last fall. A third study reported the link 
in patients with small-cell lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study with breast and ovarian cancer, the patients' blood  
contained immune system T-cells that had attacked both the tumor 
and the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls movement. 
The patients couldn't walk because their legs and arms jerked as if 
they were being shocked, and they had trouble controlling their eye 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers in the new study said they did not know whether  
the brain damage is caused by the antibody, a similar killer T-cell 
response, or both.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Release Windows Update </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. on Thursday will release  
Windows 98 Second Edition, an upgrade that makes minor changes to 
its personal computer operating system, fixes some glitches and 
combines some previously available improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The major tweak to the software is a feature that allows  
multiple computers to simultaneously use a single Internet 
connection, a first step toward building a home computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Nichols, Microsoft product manager for Windows 98, said the  
new version would go on sale at thousands of retail outlets and 
will be the operating system shipped with virtually all new PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols said Microsoft hopes the new edition will persuade the  
millions of consumers who still run older versions of Windows -- 
Version 3.1 and Windows 95 -- to upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many of the features offered in the new software  
already are available free from Microsoft's Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated retail price for the upgrade for older versions of  
Windows is $109, though the software typically sells at around $89 
in stores. Existing users of Windows 98 can get a CD-ROM with the 
new features for $19.95 plus shipping and handling, direct from 
Microsoft at www.microsoft.com/windows98/. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief improvement in Second Edition is technology to allow  
home users to share a single connection to the Internet. It's 
primarily designed for users who have cable or high-speed telephone 
access to the Internet, Nichols said; a 28.8 baud modem connection 
through a normal telephone line would be halved to 14.4 with two 
simultaneous users. 
</P>
<P>
	The software also expands the range of devices, such as digital  
camcorders, that can be easily plugged into the system. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade includes Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5 Web  
browser, NetMeeting video conferencing software and Windows Media 
Player, all of which are now available as free upgrades to Windows 
98. It also has Windows 98 Service Pack 1, which fixes bugs and 
other problems including some Year 2000 compatibility issues, in 
the existing operating system. The service pack likewise will be 
made available free from Microsoft to Windows 98 users. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet connection sharing software is not being given  
away, and Nichols said Microsoft hopes it and the ease of having 
all the upgrades on one disk will persuade users to spend $19.95. 
The CD-ROM package also includes an instruction manual. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Microsoft said it would bring out a new  
version of Windows for consumers in 2000, but it will be based on 
the Windows 98 code and not the more sophisticated Windows 2000 
operating system as originally planned. Microsoft plans to 
introduce Windows 2000, a long-delayed system aimed primarily at 
high-powered workstations and computer networks, later this year.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble To Cut 15,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. said today it will  
eliminate 15,000 jobs worldwide over six years -- about 13 percent 
of its work force -- and close about 10 plants in a global 
restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are to be implemented beginning this year,  
management of the consumer products maker said today. They are part 
of what P&AMP;G calls its Organization 2005 program designed to 
increase sales, get new products to market more quickly, cut costs 
and make the company more responsive to market changes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the company's first major initiative since Durk Jager, a  
29-year P&AMP;G veteran, became chief executive on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, the company will move from four business  
units based on geographic regions to seven global business units 
based on product lines. The company will also establish new market 
development organizations to tailor sales programs for local 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organization 2005 marks the most dramatic change to P&AMP;G's  
structure, work processes and culture in the company's history,'' 
Jager said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will cost Procter &AMP; Gamble $1.9 billion after taxes.  
Management expects that it will generate after-tax savings of $900 
million annually by fiscal 2004.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Y2K Litigation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is grappling with a Y2K litigation  
bill that business groups say could save them from billions of 
dollars in lawsuits but that the Clinton administration says 
undermines defendant rights and faces a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing twice before to advance the bill, the Senate  
resumed debate today with the chief sponsor, Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., accepting Democratic changes that might make it more 
palatable to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The revisions, including eliminating most punitive damage  
limits, ``represent significant compromise,'' McCain said. ``I do 
not believe that any additional compromises are necessary or 
warranted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which has passed the House in a different version,  
aims to stop frivolous lawsuits by people trying to take advantage 
of computer breakdowns on Jan. 1, 2000, by encouraging mediation 
and giving companies 90 days to fix computer problems before they 
can be taken to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies will be deterred from working on the technical glitch,  
said National Association of Manufacturers President Jerry 
Jasinowski, if ``everyone is looking over their shoulder to see who 
is going to sue them next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats, who twice before blocked motions to proceed  
with the bill, agreed to resume debate on it today. Their previous 
votes to block progress were directed more at conflicts with the 
Republican leadership on other issues rather than opposition to the 
bill, which Democrats have helped craft. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher Dodd of  
Connecticut have worked with McCain to alter provisions that 
consumer groups and the administration say could inhibit the legal 
rights of people to seek redress for damages. The administration 
insists they still haven't gone far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is expected to approve changes backed by Dodd that  
would impose punitive damage caps only on small businesses. The 
original bill capped punitive damage awards for all businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Major business groups, at a news conference Tuesday to urge  
action on the legislation, said they would support the modified 
Senate bill even though it wasn't at strong as the House-passed 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a party to what will come out of the Senate,'' said  
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue. ``Everybody 
is very united on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only opposition, he said, comes from ``people who have on  
their track shoes and are ready to get into the courthouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders warn that disruptions arising from computers  
that read only the last two digits in dates and mistake the year 
2000 for 1900 could lead to lawsuits that outstrip asbestos, 
tobacco and breast implant lawsuits combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say those concerns are exaggerated and the real  
purpose of the bill is to move toward overall tort changes long 
sought by the business community but strongly opposed by consumer 
groups, trial attorneys and the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But Donohue said supporters have been careful to make clear that  
this is a one-time measure concerned only with the Y2K issue. ``We 
are not using this as a subterfuge or cover to get a lot of other 
tort reform,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Fire Cadet Arrested for Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A former fire cadet was arrested Tuesday on  
an arson charge after authorities became suspicious of his ability 
to identify where fires started while buildings were still burning. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Scott, 19, showed up at fires wearing a T-shirt with  
``Fire Department'' on it, carried a sophisticated scanner and 
identified himself as a volunteer firefighter, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott began to pinpoint where fires started while the structures  
were still burning, causing investigators to be suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some red flags went off at that point,'' investigator Scott  
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott participated in a cadet program for people ages 13 to 18  
at Bethel Township Fire Department, but he was never a volunteer 
firefighter, said Chief Cathy Reittinger. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked to leave about two years ago, Ms. Reittinger said.  
She would not say why Scott was dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Americans Seek Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joseph Smallhoover says the fact that he has  
lived abroad for more than a dozen years doesn't mean he's given up 
on America. 
</P>
<P>
	But he feels as though the government has abandoned him and  
countless other overseas Americans by not including them in the 
population counts done once every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer practicing in France, Smallhoover is part of an effort  
by millions of private Americans living outside of the country to 
be included in the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal employees and their dependents abroad who live either on  
embassy grounds or military installations were counted in 1990 and 
will be next year. But other Americans overseas weren't counted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is as if we are being treated as the black sheep of the  
family,'' Smallhoover, chairman of the group Democrats Abroad, said 
Wednesday during a break in a hearing by the House Government 
Reform Committee's census panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be outside of the country, but we have not given up our  
ties to America,'' added Smallhoover, who is from Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	His group is part of the Census 2000 Coalition, which has  
drafted a plan that it says will allow them to be included in the 
population count that begins next April. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director, said it was too  
late in the process to change plans for the 2000 census without 
jeopardizing its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau staff recently discussed the plan with representatives  
from the coalition but concluded that the agency ``cannot credibly 
enumerate the population of American citizens living abroad,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are concerns about the bureau's ability to correct  
invalid responses and how to conduct what essentially would be a 
worldwide count, Prewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the number of private American citizens living in  
other countries range anywhere from 3 million to 10 million, 
various witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt said the bureau tried to count them in 1960 and 1970,  
but was disappointed with the results. He did not rule out future 
counts, however, and told Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, the 
panel's top Democrat, that he would support legislation she is 
drafting for a census in 2003 of private Americans overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House  
International Committee, introduced a nonbinding ``sense of the 
Congress'' resolution urging the Census Bureau to include all 
Americans living abroad in its population counts. 
</P>
<P>
	He said existing policy was ``inconsistent'' and ``incoherent.''  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the census panel, said  
Maloney's effort, if enacted, could lay the groundwork for counting 
these Americans in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to come up with a way to count overseas citizens,'' he  
said. ``They vote and they pay taxes, a lot of them, and they have 
every right to be counted. We need to find a way to do it, 
certainly, for 2010.''

<HEADLINE> CNN's 'Moneyline' Host Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prominent TV financial journalist Lou Dobbs has  
quit CNN to launch a new Internet venture devoted to the coverage 
of outer space. 
</P>
<P>
	His resignation comes after reports he had been clashing with  
CNN's top executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs has been host of CNN's nightly financial wrapup show,  
``Moneyline,'' and is also president of the spinoff financial 
network, CNNfn. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs will leave his position on Friday to launch Space.com, a  
Web site for news, entertainment and educational content on outer 
space, CNN said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Dobbs said he was looking forward to the  
opportunity to build ``the world's leading Web site on space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I leave with the utmost respect for the organization, and for  
the news professionals it has been my pleasure to work alongside,'' 
Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, Dobbs was involved in an unusually public  
tiff with CNN president Rick Kaplan. A visibly unhappy Dobbs 
interrupted ``Moneyline'' to cover a presidential news conference 
from Colorado, telling viewers it was under Kaplan's orders. 
</P>
<P>
	It prompted a Kaplan deputy to issue memos stating that CNN's  
executive producers have the authority to break into ``Moneyline'' 
to cover news when warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs and Kaplan did not return telephone calls seeking  
additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
	There reportedly has been ongoing tension between Dobbs and  
Kaplan, with the Wall Street Journal saying that Dobbs had 
complained internally about money being spent on ``NewsStand,'' the 
newsmagazine series that Kaplan has championed. 
</P>
<P>
	CNNfn has run a distant second in influence to CNBC, the cable  
leader in business news. CNBC is seen in 69 million homes, while 
CNNfn is available in less than 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Dobbs' ``Moneyline,'' shown weeknights for an hour at 6:30  
p.m., draws more than twice as many viewers as CNBC's competing 
``Business Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the people who helped put business news on the  
map in television,'' said George Jamison, a CNBC spokesman. ``He 
was a strong competitor and a respected journalist. This is a big 
loss for CNN and CNNfn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbs joined CNN in its inception in 1980 as chief economics  
correspondent and anchor of ``Moneyline.'' Over the past two 
decades, he has served in numerous roles and was responsible for 
CNNfn's launch in December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second resignation of a prominent on-air CNN  
personality this spring. International correspondent Peter Arnett, 
who was out of favor at the network following last year's 
``NewsStand'' report about Vietnam veterans that was later 
retracted, also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bohrman, executive vice president of CNNfn, will oversee  
the financial network. Jeff Gralnick, executive vice president, CNN 
financial news, will be in charge of ``Moneyline'' and other 
financial news programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Willow Bay, who is host of two ``NewsStand'' editions, and  
others will serve as interim anchors for ``Moneyline,'' CNN said. 
On Tuesday, Tony Guida hosted ``Moneyline.''

<HEADLINE> Hard Times for CBS Evening News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The bottom is dropping out at the ``CBS Evening  
News,'' once locked in a close ratings competition with its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady ratings downturn at Dan Rather's signature show has  
accelerated in recent weeks to near-record lows. The network 
promises to sharpen the show this summer, but is at a loss to 
explain the slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive producer Al Ortiz said he believed it began when  
viewers grew bored with the Monica Lewinsky story. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABC came back from that and we never did. We're not entirely  
sure why,'' Ortiz said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``CBS Evening News'' ratings this week were down 17 percent  
from the year before, according to Nielsen Media Research. NBC was 
down 4 percent and ABC 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather's broadcast was hot early in 1998, occasionally winning  
the closely watched ratings competition. CBS suggested then that 
viewers were attracted to its no-nonsense approach, with less 
reliance on features than its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can no longer make that unique claim,'' said Andrew  
Tyndall, who studies the content of evening newscasts for a weekly 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``CBS Evening News'' has done more lifestyle and health care  
features during the past year, Tyndall said. Ortiz said there 
hasn't been any conscious change in focus. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also may be suffering from its lack of strong news platforms  
to drive viewers to the evening show. Ratings leader NBC starts its 
day with the powerful ``Today'' show, keeps its correspondents 
working on MSNBC during the day and covers big stories in prime 
time on ``Dateline NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has no cable outlet, its morning show trails badly in the  
ratings and its newsmagazines, while popular, tend to play off the 
news less than competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a big story going on ... and you start your day  
with another network, it's tough to draw people over to us at 6:30 
in the evening,'' Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, a former Washington bureau chief, took over as top  
executive last August from Jeff Fager, who runs ``60 Minutes II.'' 
Some insiders suggest Ortiz, while a respected newsman, is hurt by 
his lack of experience in running a show. The former 
second-in-command at ``48 Hours,'' Jim Murphy, was recently added 
to Ortiz's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	During May, CBS achieved its second-lowest weekly rating ever  
for the news show and also tied its mark for third-lowest rating. 
Its lowest rating ever came in July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS tends to be hurt this time of year because its strength is  
in Southern markets, which are hit by the traditional summer 
downturn in viewership sooner than Northern cities, network 
researcher David Poltrack said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a seasonal aspect to it, but clearly we're not  
satisfied with being in third place,'' he said.

	Group: Every Kosovo Albanian Moved  
</P>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- A U.N. refugee agency says ``virtually  
all'' Kosovo Albanians have been displaced, and now the aid workers 
will try to rebuild the war-torn province with the end of the 
NATO-Yugoslavia conflict apparently in sight. Humanitarian agencies 
are stepping up plans for emergency food, medicine and shelter 
inside Kosovo as well as an orderly return of some 860,000 
refugees. The U.N. World Food Program appealed for nearly a 
quarter-billion dollars to fund Kosovo emergency operations from 
now to the end of the year, saying it expects to help care for 1.5 
million people inside and outside the southern Serb province where 
NATO bombings began March 24. 

</P>
<P>
	Talks Over Kosovo Deal Drag On  
</P>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Overnight talks between Yugoslav and  
NATO generals over Serb military withdrawal from Kosovo dragged 
into today with no word of progress on an agreement setting the 
stage for an end to Western air attacks and the return of refugees. 
The Serbian news agency reported that key members of the Yugoslav 
delegation left the negotiations to consult with the Belgrade 
government, but now the talks have resumed. A NATO official said 
the major stumbling blocks were over the timing of the Yugoslav 
withdrawal from Kosovo and the sequence of events surrounding it -- 
including an end to the NATO bombing campaign and U.N. Security 
Council approval of the peacekeeping force. 

</P>
<P>
	Russia: Kosovo Crisis Hurts US Ties  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov  
today said differences with the United States over Kosovo had 
damaged the relationship between the countries. Ivanov said the 
``negative atmosphere'' will linger even after the bombing of 
Yugoslavia ends. Russia has been a vocal opponent of the airstrikes 
against the Serbs since they began March 24, and had not supported

	Belgium Returns Food to Shelves  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Belgian government today lifted a  
ban that will allow poultry farmers to once again prepare chickens 
to be sold to food markets, and is expected to lift similar bans on 
the slaughter of pigs and cattle later today. Officials say they 
are confident they have done enough to pinpoint the source and 
spread of dioxin-tainted feed that caused the government to order 
stores to take chickens and eggs, pork, cattle and dairy products 
off the shelves. But the 15-nation European Union says its ban on 
Belgian food imports continues. Egypt, Bulgaria, Thailand and the 
Philippines also have banned Belgian food products.

<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Rite Aid chain of drug stores has  
promised to better educate staff about removing expired products 
from shelves after an investigation found California stores had 
stocked outdated condoms, baby formula and infant medications. 
Prompted by a customer complaint, investigators found more than 200 
outdated products in about 50 of the chain's 660 stores in 
California. A Rite Aid spokeswoman said the company also posted 
signs advising customers that if they purchased expired products, 
they would be replaced with fresh ones free of charge.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Jason Woolley's goal at 15:30 of overtime gave the  
Buffalo Sabres a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars last night in 
Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals. Dallas' Jere Lehtinen tied the 
score with just 49 seconds left in regulation. Sabres goalie 
Dominik Hasek stopped 35 shots and held the Stars to only one 
power-play conversion in 10 opportunities in Buffalo's first 
Stanley Cup game in 24 years. Game 2 is tomorrow night in Dallas.

	Talks Over Kosovo Deal Drag On  
</P>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Yugoslav and NATO generals negotiated  
all night until dawn today on a plan to withdraw Serbian troops 
from Kosovo. After nearly 10 hours of talks, no agreement had been 
reached, but further talks were to be held today. Still, a NATO 
official, expressed optimism that an agreement would be concluded 
later today between British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson and the 
Yugoslavs. The official said the major stumbling blocks were over 
the timing of the Yugoslav withdrawal from Kosovo and the sequence 
of events surrounding it -- including an end to the NATO bombing 
campaign and U.N. Security Council approval of the peacekeeping 
force. 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Council Waits on Resolution Debate  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATION (AP) -- The Security Council is waiting for a halt  
to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia -- Russia and China's key demand -- 
before it will discuss a resolution ending the Kosovo conflict. The 
council did not schedule any talks on the draft resolution for 
today, apparently waiting for the outcome of a meeting between NATO 
and Yugoslav military chiefs. If Belgrade signs the military 
agreement and starts to withdraw, NATO will stop bombing -- paving 
the way for a council meeting on the Kosovo peace resolution.

	Russia: Kosovo Crisis Hurts US Ties

	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov

``negative atmosphere'' will linger even after the bombing of 
Yugoslavia ends. Russia has been a vocal opponent of the airstrikes 
against the Serbs since they began March 24, and had not supported 
a plan for NATO to lead a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. But Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin finally relented after protracted 
negotiations at an eight-nation foreign ministers meeting here and 
agreed on the text of a resolution to be taken up by the U.N.

morning explosion occurred near a hospital in a northern suburb of 
Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. A member of the Iranian exile group

<HEADLINE> No Charges Filed Over Schiavo's Bag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- No federal charges will be filed against  
former inspector general Mary Schiavo, whose unaccompanied bag at 
the Columbus airport disrupted operations, the U.S. attorney said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bag, which was being used by Ms. Schiavo and a television  
station for a story on airport security, was found in a passenger 
area of Port Columbus International Airport on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officials took it to a runway, which they closed for  
about four hours while investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Sharon Zealey said in a statement that what  
happened was ``extremely disruptive for law enforcement and 
travelers.'' But she said prosecutors could not prove that Ms. 
Schiavo acted with criminal intent to damage the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	A message seeking comment from Ms. Schiavo, former inspector  
general of the U.S. Transportation Department, was not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	She has said she attempted to put an unaccompanied suitcase  
packed with harmless items on a plane the day the runway shut down. 
She said the bag was clearly marked with her name and address, and 
claimed that airport officials called the bomb squad to make a 
scene that would discredit her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo has said she was hoping to determine whether the bag  
would be allowed to leave with the flight even though its owner was 
not on board. Bags are matched to passengers on international 
flights, but checks are not required for domestic passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	WCMH-TV reported that it had told airport officials it was doing  
a story on airport security. Station president and general manager 
Michael Jack said Wednesday that its news department was vindicated 
by the federal prosecutor's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  
criticizing the Federal Aviation Administration on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, she has published a book accusing the FAA of sloppy  
inspections, lax airport security and disregard for bogus airplane 
parts.

<HEADLINE> EU Investigates Exxon-Mobil Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators are opening  
an in-depth investigation of the proposed $84 billion merger 
between Exxon and Mobil, the two biggest U.S. oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to launch a second-phase probe, announced  
Wednesday, was widely expected by market analysts and competition 
lawyers. Wednesday marked the end of the EU's initial one-month 
inquiry into the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission said it will be examining the merger's  
competitive impact on the exploration, development and production 
of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the distribution of 
natural gas in the Netherlands and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also focus on how the deal might affect the lubricants  
supply chain and the refining and marketing of motor fuels in 
countries including Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and France. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Commission will now continue a detailed fact-finding  
operation using as a legal test the likelihood that the merger 
might create or reinforce a dominant position,'' the EU executive 
body said. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by the two companies said they expected the EU  
decision to launch a second-phase investigation, considering the 
size and complexity of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such an inquiry had been anticipated,'' the companies said.  
``It is unrealistic to expect the Commission to assess this merger 
and digest the large amount of information provided by Exxon and 
Mobil in a 30-day period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expect the regulatory review by both EU  
and U.S. authorities to be completed by around the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned merger, announced in December, would create the  
world's sixth-largest oil producer and one of the largest companies 
overall with about $150 billion in combined 1998 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly approved the  
marriage last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU Commission said it will continue to cooperate with the  
U.S. Federal Trade Commission and with Canadian competition 
authorities over the deal.

<HEADLINE> Senate Bill Would Cut Police Hires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's plan for hiring local  
police officers would be slashed while efforts to combat crime on 
the Internet would be increased under legislation approved by a 
Senate subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, more money would be spent fighting terrorists,  
including building a counterterrorism laboratory at the site of the 
1995 Oklahoma City bombing. And in reaction to allegations of 
Chinese spying at federal energy labs, the FBI would be ordered to 
disperse at least 60 agents around the country to combat espionage 
at those sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions were part of a $35.3 billion measure financing  
the departments of Commerce, Justice and State for fiscal 2000, 
which begins Oct. 1. The bill was approved Wednesday by voice vote 
by the Senate Appropriations Committee's subcommittee that oversees 
those agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the subcommittee chairman, described  
some details. The rest came from a report on the bill obtained by 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, not yet crafted in the House, will be one of the  
most controversial of the 13 annual spending bills Congress will 
write for fiscal 2000. Parts of it will probably be changed 
substantially before it becomes law, including its price tag, which 
is currently $5.5 billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill ignores Clinton's request for nearly $1.3 billion to  
continue hiring local police officers under his Community Oriented 
Policing Services, or COPS, program. The program has long been a 
top administration anti-crime initiative, and a repeated target of 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the measure provides about $530 million to hire  
officers and supply them with advanced technology under other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the three-year-old program has already been given  
enough money to hire 105,000 officers, or 5,000 more than Clinton 
initially proposed. The program was supposed to expire at the end 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost counterintelligence efforts, the bill directs the FBI  
to send at least 60 additional agents to field offices in 
Albuquerque, N.M.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Chicago; Houston; Los Angeles; 
New York; San Francisco, and Washington. The measure says security 
at Energy Department labs ``would be handled best by the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would also provide $205 million to help communities'  
counterterrorism efforts, including money for training and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Included is $30 million for two counterterrorism labs that the  
measure says would ``research new technologies and threat 
reductions.'' The measure says one would be at the site of the 
Oklahoma City bombing; the other would be at Dartmouth College in 
Gregg's home state of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides $3.1 billion for the upcoming census,  
ignoring Clinton's recent request for $1.7 billion more. Clinton 
says the cost was increased by the Supreme Court's decision to 
forbid statistical sampling to augment the head count. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said he had not had time to study Clinton's request.

<HEADLINE> Senate: No Payments to Rebuild Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is insisting that the United States  
not be billed for any costs associated with rebuilding the rest of 
Serbia under a Kosovo peace plan, as long as Slobodan Milosevic 
remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebuilding should primarily be done with European money,''  
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, speaking with reporters, said some European leaders  
were anticipating that the United States would pay up to half the 
costs of repairing the damage from NATO airstrikes that began March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	The prohibition, which had wide bipartisan support, was part of  
a $265 billion defense spending bill approved Tuesday by the Senate 
by a 93-4 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is expected to consider a similar provision later in  
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the peace plan now being finalized holds, ``the problem  
is Milosevic,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and other Senate leaders say they want to see Milosevic  
arrested and tried on his indictment by an international war crimes 
tribunal -- although Lott did not specify how Milosevic might be 
apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense spending measure includes funds to pay for a 4.8  
percent across-the-board pay raise for the military, up from the 
4.4 percent hike proposed by President Clinton, and is $1.4 billion 
higher overall for the year than Clinton's budget for the fiscal 
year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also endorses a Pentagon plan to lease, for  
about $50 million a year, six new business jets for the use of its 
top admirals and generals. An effort to reject the proposal, which 
occupied most of Tuesday's debate on the defense bill, was defeated 
66-31. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, led  
the unsuccessful effort to delete the provision authorizing the Air 
Force plan to lease six Gulfstream ``V'' executive business jets 
for the military's commanders in chief at a cost of about $500 
million over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have one -- to go back and forth to Iowa,'' said  
Harkin, standing alongside large color photographs of the sleek, 
top-of-the-line aircraft during Senate debate. ``I wouldn't have to 
go through Chicago anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin, a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War, said the Pentagon  
already had more than 300 ``administrative aircraft,'' including 
more than 100 business-style jets, and didn't need to lease new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stevens, a former military pilot himself in World War II,  
said the nation's four-star commanders currently were forced to fly 
in ``old dumbos,'' some of them converted 707 passenger jets as 
much as 35 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're big, they're old, they're costly to maintain,''  
Stevens said. Allowing the Pentagon to lease the jets would enable 
the military ``to reduce the cost and put our people immediately 
into more cost effective, quiet, efficient planes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the current fleet of  
planes used by the Pentagon's top commanders was aging and had 
``outmoded navigation and security systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander.  
``cannot make a trip across the Atlantic without a refueling stop'' 
in his current plane, a military version of a DC-9. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also approved $220 million for four of Boeing Co.'s  
F-15 fighter planes, a move designed to keep the line open through 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Flagging sales of the company's premier aircraft last month  
triggered major cuts in the company's St. Louis work force, with 
layoffs of 6,500 to 7,000 workers over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli government recently postponed a $2.5 billion F-15  
purchase, just two weeks after Boeing lost the $3.5 billion sale of 
the aircraft to Greece, which instead signed a contract to buy 
Lockheed Martin's F-16, an advanced fighter.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris, Big Tobacco in Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Marlboro and other Philip Morris brands  
would gain control of two-thirds of the U.S. cigarette market if 
allowed to give big discounts to stores that prominently display 
its brands, rivals warned a court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and  
Williamson Tobacco Corp. asked U.S. District Judge Frank Bullock 
for a preliminary injunction to stop Philip Morris from using its 
``Retail Leaders'' marketing campaign until there is a jury trial 
on their lawsuit challenging the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs charged that the Philip Morris program violates  
federal and state antitrust laws. A witness for Philip Morris said 
the marketing effort doesn't prevent retailers from making their 
own decisions on where to display products and advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	First implemented by Philip Morris last fall, the marketing  
program entitles retailers to rebates of $5.50 or more per 
cigarette carton and additional payments for devoting their most 
prominent counter space to Philip Morris products. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris products now account for nearly 54 percent of all  
U.S. retail cigarette sales. Witnesses for the plaintiffs testified 
Wednesday that the new marketing initiative could give Philip 
Morris a market share of 60 percent to 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolf Provan, director of trade strategy for Brown and  
Williamson, testified that store placement has grown crucial now 
that the industry agreed to curtail advertising as part of a $206 
billion settlement with 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris' program would make smaller cigarette-makers  
``practically invisible'' by relegating their products to the least 
conspicuous shelves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is about Philip Morris' exercise of market power to  
unreasonably restrict the advertising by its competitors,'' Richard 
Cooper, an RJR attorney, said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are best served when retailers can present cigarette  
brands in the best interests of the consumer, not Philip Morris,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first defense witness, James Mortensen, a co-creator of  
``Retail Leaders'' for Philip Morris, said each participating 
retailer can decide where a product or advertisement is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, the decision is up to the retailer,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But under cross-examination by Cooper, Mortensen acknowledged  
that the program prohibited retailers from accepting any offer to 
improve the positioning of a rival product. 
</P>
<P>
	If a retailer accepted such an offer, said Mortensen, he no  
longer would be considered a ``Retail Leaders'' participant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Barger, chief operating officer of Morgan Oil &AMP; Propane of  
Waynesville, N.C., testified that he decided against participating 
in the program, even though his 22-store chain would have received 
up to $500,000 in financial incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the incentives, known as ``buy-downs,'' would have made  
it possible for his Convenience King stores to sell Philip Morris 
cigarettes at a lower price, but that he would have had to 
virtually stop selling rival brands. He couldn't do it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to offer as many tobacco products as we can,'' Barger  
said, adding that vendors of beer, soft drinks and snack food never 
set conditions on displaying and selling rival products like Philip 
Morris did. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Spell, Lorillard's executive vice president of sales and  
marketing, said ``Retail Leaders'' has had a disastrous affect on 
his company, with 4,000 of its 88,000 accounts lost in the last 60 
to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in management with this company for 20 years, and  
never during my tenure have I seen this kind of decrease,'' Spell 
said, adding that Lorillard could lose 75 percent of its contract 
agreements because of Philip Morris' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony was scheduled to continue Thursday. It was unclear  
whether Bullock would issue an oral ruling at the hearing's 
conclusion, or rule in writing later.

<HEADLINE> Adobe Sets Up Web Office in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Adobe Systems Inc., will set up a new corporate  
division in Seattle to focus on the company's move to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Adobe, a San Jose, Calif.-based maker of publishing and graphics  
software, already has about 500 employees in its Seattle office and 
plans to add at least 50 jobs to its new Internet Products Group 
this year, Hank Skorny, head of the new division, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Adobe cut 9 percent of its worldwide workforce  
in a move to reposition the company for the Internet. Ten of the 
250 jobs eliminated were in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Adobe makes the PhotoShop, PageMaker and Illustrator software  
products. Its new division will expand Adobes' GoLive product for 
creating Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the company opened a 245,000-square-foot office at  
the north end of the Fremont Bridge in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Gwynn Nears Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn's quest for 3,000 hits will resume  
Thursday. Not surprisingly, he wanted to return Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was irritable when approached by reporters before  
Wednesday night's game against Oakland, which means he obviously 
feels he's ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't ask me nothin'. Talk to the people in charge,'' said  
Gwynn, who is 25 hits short of becoming the 22nd player to get 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on starting him tomorrow,'' manager Bruce Bochy said.  
``He wants to play tonight. It's the old adage, give him one more 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn strained his left calf muscle coming out of the batter's  
box in the first inning of San Diego's 5-4 victory over Cincinnati 
on May 21 and was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres will no doubt be eager to welcome back a veteran, let  
alone one of Gwynn's stature. Gwynn is one of four starters 
currently on the disabled list. That list doesn't include catcher 
Carlos Hernandez, who's out for the season after tearing his left 
Achilles' tendon in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best hitter in the game,'' general manager Kevin  
Towers said. ``You get him back in our lineup and that's a 
considerable amount of offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was hitting .333 and in a 7-for-41 slump when he was hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn has batted .375 (3-for-8) against Oakland right-hander Gil  
Heredia, who is scheduled to start Thursday afternoon's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn is on pace to get his 3,000th hit against the Los Angeles  
Dodgers on July 1, the last day of a seven-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	The original prognosis was that Gwynn, 39, might be out until  
mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Todd Hutcheson said Gwynn did different running drills  
on Tuesday and repeated them on Wednesday, such as simulating 
hitting the ball and coming out of the box and running to first, 
and simulating going after fly balls and balls down the line in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done everything we've asked him to do and he says he  
feels pretty good,'' Hutcheson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's come on faster than I thought,'' Hutcheson said. ``Five  
days ago we let him come out and start doing some light jogging and 
stuff and he came in the following day and was sore and had a 
little bit of swelling, and we're like, `OK, let's back off.' We 
backed him off for one day and he came in the next day and started 
running again and he's progressed really good since then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres likely will option either Mike Darr or Gary Matthews  
Jr. back to Triple-A Las Vegas. They are among the four rookie 
position players on the 25-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, an MRI exam on second baseman Quilvio Veras'  
right knee showed no major ligament or cartilage damage, Hutcheson 
said. Veras has been bothered by calf and hamstring injuries and 
the Padres wanted to make sure there were no problems in the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't started since May 28. He's pinch-hit six times since.

<HEADLINE> Sampras To Play for Davis Cup Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- In a change of heart, Pete Sampras will  
play Davis Cup for the United States after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras will join Jim Courier and Todd Martin on the team  
scheduled to face Australia July 16-18 at the Longwood Cricket 
Club, team captain Tom Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a telephone conference Wednesday, Sampras said he  
approached Courier and Martin about joining the team after 
Courier's dramatic upset victory against Great Britain in April. 
That win advanced the U.S. team to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I am playing ... is seeing what Todd and Jim did in  
England. It was great to watch,'' Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, who helped the U.S. team win the Davis Cup in 1992 and  
1995 and last played in the tournament in 1997, said he will play 
doubles only because Courier and Martin have earned the singles' 
slots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like they did all the hard work and I'm here for the  
glory,'' Sampras said. ``I'm just glad to be a part of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when pressed, Sampras and other team members agreed that the  
pairings could change, especially if the U.S. team wins in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,'' Gullikson said.  
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been decided with whom Sampras -- an 11-time Grand Slam  
tournament winner -- might play, but a possible partner is Martin, 
with whom Sampras has played before, team members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Sampras refused to play Davis Cup, a decision  
that was derided by many, including Courier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some players feel it's a sacrifice and don't see the big  
picture and don't see that it's much more important than going 
playing in Hong Kong,'' Courier said at the time. ``Some of the 
most memorable moments you'll ever have in your career are playing 
Davis Cup, and it's much more important for me to play, apparently, 
than it is for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Courier won both of his singles matches, including a  
thrilling five-setter over Greg Rusedski in the decisive fifth 
match to put the United States in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as good as it gets,'' Courier said at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, who had complained that the Davis Cup had lost its  
public appeal in the United States, apparently agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	One more player will be selected for the U.S. team before a July  
6 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	That person will be ``a very good doubles player'' like Alex  
O'Brien, Justin Gimelstob or Richey Reneberg, Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
	If victorious, the U.S. team will play the winner of the  
quarterfinal match between Russia and the Slovak Republic on Sept. 
24-26.

<HEADLINE> Miller, Davis Can't Save Indiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- No matter what the Indiana Pacers did, the  
New York Knicks had the answer as they regained the upper hand in 
the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Miller, whose heroics were missing in the first four  
games of the series, scored 30 points and Dale Davis tied a 
career-playoff high with 18 rebounds. Still, the Pacers lost the 
home court advantage in the best-of-7 series as the Knicks grabbed 
a 101-94 victory Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York played excellent defense,'' Miller said after Indiana  
shot 42 percent for the game. ``They did an excellent job of that, 
capitalizing on it, getting out on the break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers, seeking to reach the NBA Finals for the first time  
ever, scored the game's first nine points and led 28-14 after 
shooting 56 percent in the first quarter while New York was limited 
to 24 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	But, it was exactly the opposite in the second quarter when  
Indiana hit just 4-of-20 shots from the field and missed 
three-of-eight free throws. New York, meanwhile, rallied to knot 
the game 42-42 at halftime when it shot 56 percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with Dale,'' coach Larry Bird said. ``I thought  
Reggie really battled. Our bench really wasn't there. We built the 
14-point lead, made some substitutions in the second quarter and we 
got absolutely nothing out of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a frequent tormentor of the Knicks in four previous  
playoff series between the teams, scored 10 points in less than 
five minutes of the third quarter. His two consecutive long jumpers 
put Indiana ahead 67-61 with 1:58 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana took its final lead at 80-79 on a 3-point play by  
Miller, who was 9-of-19 from the field and 10-of-11 from the free 
throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	New York scored 18 points on fast breaks, while Indiana had only  
two on the break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lose the ball game with those numbers,'' said  
Miller, who downplayed his own scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather had the 12 I had in New York. We won the ball  
game,'' he said in reference to Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 is Friday night in New York and the Knicks can become the  
first eighth-seeded team in the playoffs to reach the NBA Finals 
with a victory at Madison Square Garden. If Indiana wins, the 
series returns here for Game 7 on Sunday, with a well-rested San 
Antonio team awaiting the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who set the franchise record of 18 rebounds against  
Atlanta in 1994, also didn't care to discuss his individual 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to come out aggressive. I did that,'' said Davis, who  
fell one point short of a double-double in the first half. ``The 
bottom line is we didn't get the win and I take responsibility for 
that along with the rest of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still not out of it. They have to beat us Friday and I  
feel we can bring the series back to our home court,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	But home court hasn't been that big advantage in the series. The  
home team has lost three of the five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play like there is no tomorrow. We had a great  
opportunity tonight, but they took it away from us,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a one-game season for us,'' Miller said. ``We've got to  
put it all on the line. ... It's going to be electric in there 
(Madison Square Garden), a fantastic atmosphere, and personally I'm 
looking forward to it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Kosovo Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today welcomed the Serb  
troop withdrawal agreement and said NATO will ``watch carefully'' 
to make sure the forces leave Kosovo peacefully according to the 
agreed timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after announcement of the signing of the accord, Clinton  
said the agreement ``is another important step toward achieving our 
objectives in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the agreement, signed in Macedonia, lays out the  
details to meet essential conditions for peace: the rapid, orderly 
withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo and the deployment of an 
international security force with NATO at its core. Clinton said 
there would be a unified NATO chain of command allowing the 
Kosovars to ``return home safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our allies will watch carefully to see whether the Serb  
forces are peacefully leaving Kosovo in accordance with the agreed 
timetable,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made clear to the leaders of the Kosovo Liberation  
Army that we expect them not to hinder the Serb withdrawal,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was notified of the agreement during a visit to  
the National Institutes of Health in nearby Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters he was ``very pleased.''

<HEADLINE> Gallagher Waiver Keeps Him on Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Jim Gallagher took a special one-time  
exemption to remain on the PGA Tour this year. He still has a lot 
of work left to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Gallagher was on of the tour's top players. Now  
he's simply fighting to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a slow process from where I was,'' said Gallagher, who at  
38 should be at his peak. ``I've got to get back and win some 
tournaments. That's what I want to do. It's almost like crawling 
and walking and doing the whole process again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher's last victory was at the 1995 FedEx St. Jude Classic  
in Memphis, Tenn., where he plays again this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995. when he won more than $1 million for the second time  
in three years, Gallagher has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	The exemption he got for winning the 1995 tournament expired at  
the end of the 1998 season. He then dropped below the top 125 money 
winners on Tour for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of having to return to the Tour Qualifying School last  
winter, Gallagher opted instead to take a one-time exemption for 
players among the top 50 on the PGA Tour career money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to do it, it's part of the deal,'' Gallagher said  
of the one-time exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get back to playing at the level I want to  
play. Everything else will take care of itself. I've got a bunch 
more years to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid Q-School again this year, Gallagher will have to win a  
tournament or at least get back into the top 125 money winners. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's tournament is the 15th of the season for Gallagher,  
who has made just six of 14 cuts so far. He has won $107,238, which 
is 140th on the current money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gallagher is comfortable with his game.  
</P>
<P>
	After some tinkering -- switching putters and changing the heads  
on his irons for much of last year -- he has returned to his 
original clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even remember what I have played the last two years,''  
Gallagher said. ``You just have got to stick with 14 clubs and go 
play. I think I've done that the last four to five tournaments. 
That's something I haven't been able to say for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gallagher figured out that the equipment changes were not  
making things better, the main cause of his problems became 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the equipment stuff got me swinging bad, I had to get  
back to swinging the way Jim Gallagher used to swing ... and that's 
what takes some time to do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Newark, N.J., Sues Gun Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey's largest city on Wednesday  
became the latest in the nation to sue the firearms industry to 
recover costs associated with gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark's lawsuit against 28 gun makers, two industry groups and  
two distributors claims that manufacturers purposely sold unsafe 
weapons, failed to exert proper control over their distribution and 
falsely advertised that guns increase home security. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit did not specify how much money the city is seeking,  
although Mayor Sharpe James said he wanted ``far in excess of $100 
million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two dozen cities and counties around the nation have  
similar suits pending. In each, the gun manufacturers say they 
should not be held responsible for accidents or criminal acts.

<HEADLINE> Depleted Indians Hobbling Along </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Wil Cordero was laid out on an operating table  
across town while Travis Fryman sprawled on a couch in the 
clubhouse resting his aching back. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the state of the Cleveland Indians these days.  
Baseball's best team is a little banged up. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, who broke his left wrist in two places while making a  
sliding catch Tuesday night against Milwaukee, had a screw inserted 
into the radius bone of his wrist on Wednesday and is expected to 
be sidelined for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 10 weeks as far as I know,'' Indians manager Mike  
Hargrove said, shrugging his shoulders at his team's latest 
setback. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries and suspensions have forced Hargrove to plug holes on  
his roster all season. He has fielded his opening-day lineup only 
four times this year, a surprising fact considering how well the 
Indians have played. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, leading the AL Central by nine games, is currently  
without four regulars. Catcher Sandy Alomar had knee surgery and 
isn't expected back until at least the All-Star break; Fryman is 
day-to-day with back spasms; Manny Ramirez is serving a three-game 
suspension for charging the mound; and Cordero is out until at 
least August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are also without reliever Mark Langston (elbow  
inflammation) and outfielder Mark Whiten (broken foot). 
</P>
<P>
	When he filled out his lineup card for Wednesday night's game  
against Milwaukee, Hargrove jotted down a couple of names that less 
than 24 hours ago were playing for the Buffalo Bisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we still have a pretty good ballclub,'' Hargrove said.  
``I think our starting rotation is starting to straighten out and 
we still have four or five guys in the lineup that are hitting the 
ball pretty well. It's not a shell of the ballclub. Is it the 
ballclub we projected having in spring training? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, replaced in the lineup by Jeff Manto on Wednesday, had  
an MRI on his ailing back and said it revealed no new problems. He 
has had a fractured vertebrae in his back since he was 15, but only 
in the past two years has it flared up during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is currently taking an oral medication to reduce the  
inflammation, and said if it doesn't feel better, doctors would 
consider giving him an injection. But only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed because I felt good all year,'' he  
said talking to reporters flat on his back. ``It's aggravating but 
there's not much else I can do except make sure I get rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Cordero out and Fryman uncertain, the Indians recalled  
Manto and Jacob Cruz from Triple-A Buffalo and optioned Jolbert 
Cabrera to Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said Cruz would see spot duty in left and center field  
and could even see time at designated hitter. Cruz started in left 
Wednesday with Richie Sexson, who entered Wednesday night in an 
0-for-24 dive, at DH. 
</P>
<P>
	Manto, 34, played for the Indians during parts of the last two  
seasons. He was hitting .322 with 16 homers and 34 RBIs for the 
Bisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Manto, who can play two outfield positions, first and third as  
well as emergency catcher, has bounced back and forth to the minors 
so many times he says he and Hargrove have a special way of 
communicating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me and him are on eye contact,'' Manto said. ``One wink you're  
OK, two winks and you're on your way back down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, 26, was hitting .278 with seven homers and 28 RBIs for  
Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Examine Launch Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- An independent panel of experts  
is expected to report by the fall on Boeing Co.'s recent space 
launch failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will review the processes involved in Boeing's Delta,  
Sea Launch and Inertial Upper Stage programs, the company said 
Tuesday. Its review is separate from government investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was commissioned by James F. Albaugh, president of  
Boeing Space and Communications Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will be headed by Sheila E. Widnall, former secretary  
of the Air Force and currently a professor at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's new Delta III rocket failed to put a satellite in the  
proper orbit last month, and the Delta III's debut last August 
ended in an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an early analysis of an April 9 failure of a launch of  
Lockheed Martin's big Titan IV rocket implicated the Boeing-built 
upper stage. The new head of Lockheed Martin Astronautics has 
similarly vowed to thoroughly review its programs.

<HEADLINE> IBM Says No Microsoft Quid Pro Quo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. confronted an IBM manager in  
court today with documents it said contradicted his claim that the 
software giant offered price discounts on Windows if IBM would 
agree not to distribute rival Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's Garry Norris was asked to explain an e-mail from another  
IBM employee that appeared to contradict Norris' claim Microsoft 
had pressured IBM to distribute Microsoft's Internet Explorer 
software instead software by rival Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no proposal on the table from Microsoft to  
exclusively bundle IE on the PC Co. line,'' IBM's Scott Bosworth 
wrote in the April 1997 e-mail. The e-mail was sent shortly after 
Norris was transferred within International Business Machines Corp. 
to another division. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess after I left, they took it off the table,'' Norris  
shrugged when asked by a Microsoft attorney about Bosworth's memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, a mid-level executive, insisted his handwritten notes  
from a meeting a month earlier with Microsoft were accurate. In 
those notes, Norris wrote that Microsoft offered to increase 
rebates available under its Market Development Agreements if IBM 
promised not to distribute Netscape's software. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Netscape &AMP; receive more MDA $ across the PC Co.,'' he  
wrote. Norris' notes support one of the government's central claims 
against Microsoft: that it illegally wields its influence over its 
dominant Windows operating system to crush competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Rick Pepperman appeared exasperated with the  
answers Norris gave to his questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Norris had accommodated the Justice  
Department's lawyer with rich answers and an unfailing memory. But 
he resisted Pepperman on every response. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperman also confronted Norris with an e-mail summary by  
another IBM employee of the disputed March 1997 meeting in which 
there was no mention of any offer from Microsoft regarding 
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris described the e-mail as a ``partial summary'' and said he  
called his colleague on the telephone, who told him he wanted 
Norris to ``handle that'' with senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Norris acknowledged that the software giant  
never explicitly offered price discounts on Windows if IBM agreed 
to sacrifice its rival OS/2 computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris earlier had cited a Microsoft contract offering discounts  
of $1 to $3 per copy of Windows, for example, if IBM were willing 
to adopt Windows ``as the standard operating system for IBM,'' and 
to mention Windows as the only operating system in IBM 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	The government suggested -- and Norris agreed -- that the  
contractual clauses actually were incentives for IBM to abandon its 
OS/2 software, which directly competed with Windows. Norris said 
IBM never agreed to those provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were several provisions in it, for example, that would  
have required us to reduce or eliminate our shipments of OS/2, one 
of which I can specifically recall where it said, make Windows 95 
the standard operating system of your company,'' Norris testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris conceded Wednesday the contract does not explicitly  
require IBM to reduce or stop sales of its software. But he 
maintained that the cumulative effect of the contract ``has the 
effect of killing OS/2 in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told by Microsoft they wanted us to drop, stop  
shipping OS/2,'' Norris said.

<HEADLINE> School: Teacher Gave Bomb Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM HARBOR, Fla. (AP) -- A high school social studies teacher is  
accused of showing his class how to make a pipe bomb and where to 
place it for maximum injuries and damage to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Falls of Palm Harbor University High presented the  
lesson a day after the massacre at Columbine High School in 
Colorado, according to a school district investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pinellas County school superintendent has recommended that  
Falls be suspended for 10 days, meaning he would lose $1,430. 
</P>
<P>
	Falls, 38, has requested a hearing. He did not return a call for  
comment from the St. Petersburg Times. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an account provided by the school board, Falls  
discussed the Columbine shootings in several classes, calling it a 
travesty and emphasizing the importance of students being aware of 
their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at students' request, Falls allegedly drew a diagram of a  
pipe bomb on the chalkboard ``and described its components in 
detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also ``initiated a discussion explaining to students exactly  
where a pipe bomb should be placed at Palm Harbor University High 
School in order to maximize impact and why such a placement would 
be most effective in causing injury or harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A parent contacted school administrators in this Gulf Coast  
community near Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Jade Moore, executive director of the teachers union, defended  
Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he advocated building a pipe bomb, that would be one thing.  
Or if the students were prone to do that, that's one thing. But 
explaining it, discussing it, that's topical,'' Moore said. ``It 
sounds to me like he was probably exercising his First Amendment 
right to academic freedom.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Patient-Restraint Case Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The family of a woman who died in  
restraints at a state-run mental hospital won a $300,000 settlement 
and a promise to place a memorial to her at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The state admitted no liability. But since the woman's death,  
Central State Hospital has agreed to reduce the use of patient 
seclusion and restraint, increase staff size and move some patients 
into community care. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Huntley, 31, who had a personality disorder and mild  
retardation, died in 1996 in solitary confinement at Central State, 
her arms and legs strapped to a bed. She spent 300 hours in 
restraints during her final month, including two stretches of 4 1/2 
days straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Her former attending physician had warned that she could die in  
restraints because she had asthma, epileptic seizures and a heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	William Arthur Griggs Jr., Ms. Huntley's brother, alleged that  
the state mental health department breached accepted standards of 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	The family had sought $2.45 million.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Advance at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Thursday morning  
ahead of the release of a key Japanese economic indicator later in 
the day. Tokyo stocks advanced moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.64 yen at late morning, down 0.74 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also lower than its late New York level 
of 118.93 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.66 points, or 0.74 percent, to  
16,746.16 at the end of the morning session. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 59.58 points, or 0.04 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar initially edged higher on  
buying mainly from Japanese importers and institutional investors, 
and some foreign funds, but soon slipped back. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar would remain in a relatively narrow  
range prior to the release of Japan's gross domestic product data 
for the first quarter of this year, traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's direction would be determined by the release of the  
figures, due out later Thursday, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 124.21 yen, down  
from 124.88 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices on the Tokyo stock market posted moderate gains  
despite a fall overnight on Wall Street as foreign investors were 
buying steel issues and other shares with larger market 
capitalization and blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained light as many investors were eagerly awaiting  
the GDP release. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.35 points  
to close at 10,690.29 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 11.69 points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,354.20 
points. The TOPIX was up 3.37 points, or 0.03 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.5250 percent from  
Wednesday's finish of 1.5750 percent, driving its price up to 98.91 
yen from 98.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> Louima Cops Face Additional Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With two convictions already in hand prosecutors  
say they will continue to pursue charges against other police 
officers who they say lied about the assault of a Haitian immigrant 
to protect one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over,'' prosecutor Kenneth Thompson said Tuesday  
after a jury found Officer Charles Schwarz guilty of holding down 
Abner Louima while Officer Justin Volpe sodomized him with a broken 
broomstick in a precinct bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict was returned in Brooklyn federal court two weeks  
after Volpe pleaded guilty to the attack that prompted a national 
outcry and widespread demonstrations against police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other officers were acquitted Tuesday on charges they  
violated Louima's civil rights following his arrest at a nightclub 
on Aug. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz and two of the acquitted officers, Thomas Wiese and  
Thomas Bruder, still face charges they conspired to obstruct 
justice by claiming Schwarz was never in the bathroom. U.S. 
Attorney Zachary Carter said he expects that case to go to trial, 
but didn't say when. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's piling on,'' said Bruder's attorney, Stuart  
London. ``Enough is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury of eight whites, three Hispanics and one black  
deliberated 18 hours over three days in federal court. The 
33-year-old Schwarz sat impassively as the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz, like Volpe, could get life in prison. His attorney,  
Stephen Worth, said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say something that I've never said before: The jury  
reached the wrong verdict,'' Worth said. ``I'm sure they were under 
pressure to convict somebody, but they got it wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, agreed, saying Volpe told  
prosecutors the name of a second officer in the bathroom, and it 
wasn't Schwarz. He refused to name the officer. Volpe also has 
refused to name the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Alan Vinegrad dismissed Kornberg and Volpe -- whom he  
called ``the perpetrator of one of the most horrific sexual 
assaults in modern history '' -- as not credible. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, 32, was not in the courtroom for the verdict but said  
later the decision fell short of what he had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident in the end that complete justice will be done  
in my case,'' said Louima, who is suing the city for $155 million. 
``I hope what comes out of my case is change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz was acquitted of beating Louima inside a police car  
prior to the bathroom attack. Also cleared in that attack were 
Wiese, 35, and Bruder, 33. Their sergeant, Michael Bellomo, 37, was 
acquitted of lying to cover up the arrests of Louima and another 
Haitian man, Patrick Antoine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did nothing wrong that night,'' Bruder said outside the  
courtroom, where he hugged Wiese. ``I didn't do anything wrong. I 
treated Mr. Louima like a gentleman that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima had testified that Bruder came to his aid after the  
bathroom attack by taking off his handcuffs and helping him dress. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima had testified he was arrested, beaten and finally  
tortured with a broken broomstick in a filthy bathroom stall, 
suffering severe internal injuries including a ruptured bladder and 
colon. 
</P>
<P>
	The account was supported by the testimony of four police  
officers credited with shattering the so-called ``blue wall of 
silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was interrupted May 25 by Volpe's dramatic guilty  
plea. The stocky, square-jawed patrolman admitted he attacked 
Louima in a blind rage because he mistakenly thought Louima had hit 
him outside the nightclub.

<HEADLINE> Tony Awards Falter in TV Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The people who run the Tony Awards are singing a  
new song: ``Come Back, Rosie!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Rosie O'Donnell as host, ratings for Broadway's annual  
awards show plummeted this year. O'Donnell's work on the show the 
past two years had led to a mini-revival of the Tonys as a 
television attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night's show, which had no host, drew an estimated 9.15  
million viewers. That was the second smallest audience since the 
show began being telecast in 1974. Only the 1996 show, one year 
before O'Donnell took over, was smaller at 8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During O'Donnell's first year as host, the Tony Awards drew 12.9  
million viewers. She said she had other obligations and couldn't do 
it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was the Nielsen Media Research ratings champ with a 7.2  
rating and 13 share, even though it was the week broadcast networks 
began their annual summer slumber. CBS was second with a 6.8 rating 
and 13 share, ABC had a 5.9 rating and 11 share, and Fox was at 4.8 
and 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Those top four networks had 34.3 million people watching during  
an average minute of prime-time broadcasting last week, a sharp 
drop from the season average of 47.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share, UPN had a 1.6 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.0 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News was at 5.8 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 31-June 6, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Frasier,'' NBC, 10.2; ``ER,'' NBC, 10.1; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 10.0; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 9.9; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 9.9; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 9.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 9.6; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.4; ``Law &AMP; 
Order,'' NBC, 9.2; ``20/20-Friday,'' ABC, 8.9.

<HEADLINE> Mom's Friend Accused in Tot's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A 300-pound man fatally punched his  
girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter, then tossed the child out a 
second-story window to make it appear she died from the fall, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Trigg, 30, allegedly told police he punched the girl  
because he was angry when she kept crying after defecating in an 
upstairs bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with first-degree murder. The child's mother,  
April Reeves, 23, was charged with aggravated child neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	The toddler, April Casey, was with her 3-year-old brother in an  
upstairs bedroom when the girl's mother left for work Saturday. The 
children were in the care of Trigg, who also was caring for their 
11-month-old son, Eric Trigg Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Trigg, an assistant football coach at Plant High School,  
originally told Ms. Reeves he was sleeping when April fell from the 
window. The toddler lay on the ground for several hours before her 
mother found her after returning from work. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves was charged with neglect because police said she had  
witnessed Trigg abuse the children in the past but did nothing to 
stop him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Children and Families took the other children  
into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant High School football coach Darlee Nelson, who said he has  
known Trigg for more than 10 years, described him as a motivated 
instructor, well-liked by students.

<HEADLINE> Study: Stroke Drug's Effects Linger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TPA, a lifesaving drug that has revolutionized emergency-room  
treatment of strokes, isn't just a short-term fix. 
</P>
<P>
	A study found that patients treated with TPA within three hours  
after a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain are less likely 
to be severely disabled a year afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were reported in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine by Dr. Thomas G. Kwiatkowski of Long Island Jewish Medical 
Center and doctors at eight other hospitals around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The clot-dissolving medicine is the only drug approved for  
treating strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved TPA, or tissue  
plasminogen activator, for stroke treatment in 1995, after a 
three-month study showed that it saves lives. The latest study was 
a one-year follow-up involving 312 patients who got TPA and 312 who 
got a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	The results after a year were about the same as they were at  
three months: For every 100 stroke patients treated with TPA, at 
least 11 who otherwise would have had died or had severe problems 
will come through with few or no symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a survey last year found that many doctors were still  
afraid to use TPA because of the danger that it can worsen strokes 
that are caused not by clots but by bleeding directly into the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug has to be given within three hours after a stroke, but  
after a CAT scan has been done to make sure that the stroke was 
caused by a blood clot. 
</P>
<P>
	About 600,000 people a year suffer strokes.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Skakel Is Unfit To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The elderly brother-in-law of the  
late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy is not trying to hide anything by 
refusing to testify about a 1975 murder in which his sons are 
suspects, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushton Skakel is mentally ill -- he barks, refuses to bathe and  
rubs noses and bellies with strangers -- and is incompetent to be 
forced before a Connecticut grand jury, Richard Lubin told a state 
appeals court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is entitled not to be dragged to Connecticut when he's  
incompetent and incontinent,'' Lubin said of Skakel. ``That doesn't 
mean he has something to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe Skakel may have information about the death  
of 15-year-old Martha Moxley, of Greenwich, Conn., who was 
bludgeoned on her family's estate with a 6-iron that Skakel 
admitted two decades ago came from a set of golf clubs in his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney argued the 74-year-old Skakel has brain damage and  
Alzheimer's-like dementia, causing him to make up stories. Lubin 
asked the appeals court to throw out a judge's order compelling 
Skakel to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel was not in court. The judges did not indicate when they  
would rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel's sons, Michael and Thomas, have been identified as  
suspects in Moxley's slaying. Michael, who was 15 at the time, and 
Thomas, then 17, have denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued the elder Skakel may know more than he has  
said. An affidavit by an investigator suggests Skakel might have 
overheard one of his sons discussing the death. 
</P>
<P>
	He may not be as mentally impaired as his attorney described,  
said James Carney, a Florida assistant attorney general. He said 
Skakel sat calmly through a four-hour hearing on his mental 
competency last October. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lubin noted Skakel gave a belly-bump to a bailiff  
during a break in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation into Moxley's slaying was revived a year ago  
when a one-man grand jury was appointed and two books were 
published, including one by former Los Angeles Detective Mark 
Fuhrman. The grand jury investigation is continuing.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Embrace Standup Comedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Nearly two hours before Steve Muturi told  
his first joke, the nightclub's 60 tables were already taken. An 
hour later, the rows of seats in front of the stage were filled. 
When it seemed no more people could squeeze in, hundreds still 
waited outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Stand-up comedy has come to Nairobi, and Kenyans aren't about to  
let a little discomfort spoil the fun. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of nearly 1,900 that jammed the nightclub at the  
Carnivore restaurant hooted the moment Muturi jumped on the stage. 
He warned them to drive carefully if they planned to attend an 
upcoming political protest, a rally most assumed would be dispersed 
by police swinging clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need anybody to get hurt on the way there. There will  
be ample opportunity to get hurt when you are there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd broke into deafening laughter.  
</P>
<P>
	Such political humor is relatively new to Kenya, made possible  
by a more relaxed government attitude to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedy is certainly not new to Kenya. Children's games, bawdy  
songs and humorous plays are part of traditional entertainment. In 
recent years, street comedians have acted out skits in return for 
loose change. 
</P>
<P>
	But simply telling jokes in front of a crowd was nearly unheard  
of before Muturi started the monthly comedy night at the Carnivore 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the $3 cover charge puts the show out of reach for most  
Kenyans, the audience has gone from 250 in the beginning to more 
than 2,000 for some shows, the restaurant says. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were curious to see how a man standing alone on a stage  
could make them laugh with nothing but words. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen this anywhere before except maybe on the  
television talk shows,'' said Nate Thayan, 28, a lecturer in 
accounting at Strathmore College. But the jokes on those talk 
shows, imported from the United States and Europe, just aren't very 
funny to Kenyans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Carnivore, many of the jokes were about universal things --  
annoying relatives, cockroaches and failed relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Muturi sang a spoof of Bobby McFerrin's ``Don't Worry, Be  
Happy,'' and the delighted crowd joined in for the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
	``In your life you have some trouble, when you marry you make it  
double. Don't marry, be happy,'' he sang. 
</P>
<P>
	But jokes about ethnic differences and local politicians marked  
much of the humor as uniquely Kenyan. 
</P>
<P>
	Shabbir Ansari played an interviewer astonished at politician  
Raila Odinga's explanation that he is in the opposition because his 
father was opposition, his grandfather was opposition and his 
great-grandfather was opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are trying to tell me your father was a thief, and your  
grandfather was a thief, what would that make you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, then I would be KANU,'' he said, referring to the ruling  
Kenya African National Union party. 
</P>
<P>
	Ansari would not have dared tell that joke in public five years  
ago when criticism of the government often would provoke a visit 
from police. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedians used to send up the powerful for friends and at small  
parties. Now, they do it in front of hundreds of paying fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Muturi interspersed an imitation of a Kenyan police officer  
reading a suspect his rights with a rapid-fire impression of 
President Daniel arap Moi explaining those rights out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
	He put on glasses and mocked Kenya's on-again, off-again vice  
president, George Saitoti, pledging his undying love for the ruling 
party -- after recently being reappointed to his post. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no longer any sacred cows. You can imitate  
absolutely everybody,'' said Ian Mbugua, the host of the show and a 
veteran actor. ``I don't think we could have picked a better time 
to introduce standup comedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With corruption, poverty and ethnic tensions dogging Kenya,  
comedy found a ready market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to let off steam,'' Mbugua said. ``People need to  
forget their problems and laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the dark, cavernous club, customers pressed up against the  
stage and overflowed into an outdoor garden. Many fans had to watch 
on closed-circuit television at bars scattered throughout the club. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience was a rarely seen cross-section of Kenya's  
stratified society -- black, white and Indian Kenyans and foreigners 
sending out huge waves of laughter, the approval of an audience 
seeing something unique. 
</P>
<P>
	Ansari's humor targets all ethnic groups.  
</P>
<P>
	He tells jokes about Kenyan Asians, whose ancestors came from  
the Indian subcontinent; about Kenyan tribes that believe in 
ghosts; even about the pope, not usually a topic of Kenyan 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ansari, the 47-year-old general manager of a tour company, was  
sitting in the audience at one of the early comedy shows when a 
call went out for volunteers to tell a joke. Now he is a regular 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
	But few are following his lead.  
</P>
<P>
	Muturi has put ads in newspapers looking for fresh blood. He  
appeals to audience members to try the craft. But with no tradition 
of standup comedy, Kenya has a very small pool of entertainers to 
draw on. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite the big audiences, only a few clubs and hotel  
lounges are experimenting with comedy nights, leaving professional 
comedians searching for places to perform, said Dominic Kibuika, 
leader of the Black Angels, a well-known group of street comedians. 
</P>
<P>
	The troupe recently began performing its rapid-fire Swahili  
banter at Carnivore. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the street, I can't make good money, but when I come here,  
they know what comedy is. They know what art is,'' Kibuika said.

<HEADLINE> Dole Mutes Criticism of Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole is campaigning cautiously -- to  
the point of erasing an impression she'd had harsh words for 
front-running rival George W. Bush, even muffling her criticism of 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Bob, was sharp with his words, quick with a  
wisecrack, in Congress, as Senate leader, and in his campaigns for 
president and vice president. At times, those traits led him into 
political trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In her quest to succeed him as the Republican presidential  
nominee, Mrs. Dole is proceeding with care. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you feel strongly about something, you have a passion for  
it, and you provide strong leadership,'' she said. But her style, 
and her words, are restrained, as she tries to move up the polling 
and money ladder that puts Bush well ahead at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush is doing his thing. I'm doing mine,'' she said in  
an interview with The Associated Press. ``I stay focused. I'm not 
going to be distracted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, she said, she wasn't aiming at Bush when she said that to  
lead on an issue like gun control legislation takes more than 
``sitting on the sidelines seeing which direction the gun smoke is 
blowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She delivered the line at Yale University three weeks ago, and  
it was read as a jibe at the Texas governor, who is only now 
preparing to begin his active campaign, in Iowa and New Hampshire 
this weekend and next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, now, that was not a certain candidate,'' she said.  
``That was a general statement. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I like George Bush. He's a friend,'' she said. ``We've  
campaigned together. I think he'll be a fine candidate. That was 
not aimed at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was running, Bob Dole talked tough. In 1988, before he  
lost the nomination to Bush's father, Dole darkly told the elder 
Bush to ``stop lying about my record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Bob Dole was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 1976,  
the name Bush or Dole has been on every Republican ticket, three 
winners and three losers. For 2000, George W. Bush and Elizabeth 
Dole are ranked one-two in the GOP polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has a hefty lead in raising funds, $7.6 million in the  
first three months of 1999, more than 11 times what Mrs. Dole 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The next finance reports are due at the end of the month. ``I  
think it's looking good,'' Mrs. Dole said, while declining to say 
how much her campaign is raising now. ``I feel that we're going to 
have the money we need to be a viable candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole is helping, she said, telephoning donors in her behalf,  
although he dislikes asking people for money. He's also appearing 
at four fund-raising events this month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, he's not appearing with her. ``Now, we have on  
purpose thought it was best for me to start out solo, to establish 
myself rather than having Bob out there in the first few months,'' 
she said. ``But certainly he's going to be supporting me big time 
in any way that he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is Mrs. Dole's first elective venture. She served in two  
Cabinet posts, then became president of the American Red Cross, 
taking a leave of absence to campaign with, and for, her husband in 
his losing 1996 bid for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	To this point, Bob Dole's most visible role in her campaign was  
a gaffe; a New York Times interview in which he said he might 
donate to Sen. John McCain's GOP campaign to keep a good man in the 
race -- although he'd check with his wife first. Mrs. Dole said her 
comments about sending him to the woodshed were just jokes, that 
the whole episode was overblown and humor was the best way to 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're buddies from the Senate,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Bob Dole also pointed in that May 16 interview to what could  
be a problem for his wife's campaign; exploratory so far, although 
she said she's planning to announce full candidacy in the late 
summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's no response out there, or if it looks impossible,  
this is not her whole life,'' Dole said. ``If she can't raise the 
money, obviously it's pretty hard to be a candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she can. That's crucial, and so is a clear message,  
drawing lines on issues to spell out what she'd do differently from 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
	A sharper message than she left by suggesting that she'd like to  
go off the record before criticizing Clinton. ``Okay, let's leave 
it on the record,'' she then said. ``But I do think that there are 
some instances where the president should, both on some domestic 
matters and also foreign policy, where we need stronger leadership, 
where there is too much waiting to see which way the polls are 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a Republican, that's caution plus.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Criticize Gun Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even before they had seen House Republicans'  
final gun control bill, President Clinton and congressional 
Democrats on Wednesday accused the GOP of conspiring to water down 
Senate-passed firearms restrictions in a new version ``plainly 
ghostwritten by the NRA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic, horrible example of how Washington is out  
of touch with the rest of America, and it is time the rest of 
America corrected it,'' Clinton said of the still-unreleased 
Republican gun legislation during an afternoon discussion with 
civil rights and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a bill plainly ghostwritten by the NRA,'' Clinton said.  
``They have been calling the shots on this issue for decades now, 
and we have failed to do what is manifestly in the interests of our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who will  
co-sponsor the bill with Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., when it goes 
to the floor on Tuesday, staunchly denied the powerful National 
Rifle Association dominated the drafting process. He acknowledged 
that the bill is a compromise ``between a lot of people,'' 
including the NRA, but bristled at the suggestion that the gun 
lobby wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, Hyde said, were ``fantasizing.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA is a legitimate organization; they made known their  
views,'' said Hyde, who has upset the interest group in the past by 
sponsoring gun control legislation. ``The NRA did not write our 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations flew as the House takes its turn at cracking  
down on juvenile violence two months after two Littleton, Colo., 
high school students murdered 12 of their classmates and a teacher 
before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate started the process last month when it narrowly  
passed legislation that would require mandatory background checks 
on all firearms transactions at gun shows and pawn shops; safety 
locks or other devices to be sold with guns; a ban on the 
importation of high-capacity ammunition clips; mandatory prison 
sentences for felons committing crimes with guns; and a lifetime 
ban on gun ownership for any juvenile convicted of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure does not contain a provision to raise the  
minimum age for possession of handguns from 18 to 21, which is 
supported by Clinton, Hyde and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
But others in the Republican leadership oppose that provision, and 
its prospects in the House are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to spare House members and the public the lengthy  
and politically perilous debate over the issue suffered by senators 
last month, House GOP leaders plan to bypass normal committee 
consideration of the measure and send the bill straight to the 
floor next week. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan could work to the Democrats' political advantage  
because it gives them a wider television audience for the debate as 
they prepare to overcome the GOP's slim House majority in next 
year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a coordinated media attack yesterday, Democrats  
complained that Republicans had put off a vote only to allow the 
NRA time to launch its massive lobbying campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said that while the  
Hyde-McCollum bill addresses the group's demands -- such as defining 
gun shows more narrowly than the Senate version -- the sponsors have 
not agreed to other requests. LaPierre said they include shortening 
the deadline for the results of a background check from three days 
to one. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats slapped the NRA's name on the legislation  
nonetheless. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., told reporters the House 
version of the bill would exempt handguns from the requirement that 
trigger locks be sold with firearms.

<HEADLINE> Nagy Steps to Plate in White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- When the dinner invitation arrived with a  
return address of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Charles Nagy figured 
somebody was having some fun with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House was holding a dinner for Hungarian President  
Arpad Goncz, and President Clinton and the first lady were 
requesting Nagy's presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a joke at first,'' the Cleveland Indians  
pitcher said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't, and with the Indians' permission, Nagy dined with  
dignitaries on Tuesday night in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy, whose family came from Hungary, and his wife, Jackie, were  
invited after a local woman who works in foreign affairs submitted 
his name to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I didn't steal any china,'' Nagy said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said going to the White House didn't really involve much  
planning at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go there, they tell you where to go. You bring your  
invitation and you just show up,'' he said. ``It was nice. They had 
all the rooms open so we could walk around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy said he talked briefly with the Clintons when he went  
through the president's receiving line, but he and Goncz didn't 
chat. 
</P>
<P>
	``He only speaks a little English and I don't speak any  
Hungarian, so there wasn't much to talk about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During dinner, Nagy was split up from his wife and sat next to  
Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. Actor Tony Curtis was among the 150 
guests who dined on ``little lamb chops with some salmon 
appetizers'' and were entertained by singer Judy Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy said he did talk some baseball with a few of the guests,  
many of whom were fans of the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the Secret Service guys wanted to fill me in that we  
lost last night,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fox Withdraws From Broadcast Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Fox television network has pulled out of a  
broadcasting lobby group over a dispute on rules governing 
ownership of television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., wanted the  
National Association of Broadcasters to push for greater 
deregulation in the broadcast industry, especially a rule that 
prevents a single company from owning stations that reach more than 
35 percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox already reaches just under 35 percent of U.S. homes with the  
22 stations it owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Other networks have also protested the ownership rule, but  
locally owned stations have been opposed to increasing the cap 
because they fear that increased concentration of TV ownership 
could give the networks more clout over smaller stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Binzel, the chief lobbyist for News Corp. in Washington,  
said the company had general disagreements with the NAB over 
legislative issues but the ownership rule was the main sticking 
point behind its decision to leave the NAB, effective Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a basic decision that it didn't seem to make sense to  
pay dues to a trade association that was opposed to our No. 1 
legislative priority,'' Binzel said. 
</P>
<P>
	NAB spokesman Dennis Wharton said that Fox's departure would  
have a ``minimal'' financial impact on the group since the four 
major networks together contribute less than 4 percent of the 
group's annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I concede that we as an industry are stronger when we speak  
with a united voice, but the strength of the NAB comes from the 
fact that our member stations are in virtually every city, district 
and county in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS and NBC all remain members of the NAB. ABC quit the  
group in the early 90s over another policy disagreement but 
rejoined the group a year and a half later. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAB, based in Washington, represents 1,200 TV stations  
across the country and more than 5,000 radio stations.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The state government said  
Wednesday it plans to embark on a vast emergency job creation 
program to combat record unemployment in the greater Sao Paulo 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the state will create 50,000 temporary jobs  
involving street cleaning, construction and gardening to combat 
unemployment levels that have topped 20 percent this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 600,000 people are expected to apply for the jobs, which  
will be awarded on the basis of need. Special preference will be 
given to heads of families, especially women with a large number of 
children and the long-term unemployed.

	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Immigration authorities detained 270  
Central Americans on Wednesday as they were waiting for a bus to 
carry them north toward the United States, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the single largest detention of illegal immigrants by the  
National Migration Institute in Tabasco state, said Esteban Vega 
Franco, an official of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities found the 221 men and 49 women hiding among the  
brush at a ranch about 30 miles outside of Jalapa, Tabasco. Local 
residents had alerted police early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and  
Nicaragua said they each paid $1,000 to smugglers to transport them 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Tabasco, which sits north of Chiapas state and  
Guatemala, detained 15,000 illegal immigrants in 1998. So far this 
year they have caught 2,500. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Police searched for more than 100  
inmates who were still at large Wednesday after escaping from a 
maximum-security jail in what officials said was the largest prison 
break in Brazilian history. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, state security officials lowered the number of  
escapees to 315 from 345 following a recount. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of prison guards, the inmates fled late Sunday  
afternoon from the jail in Putim, a poor rural district on the 
outskirts of Sao Jose dos Campos, 55 miles northeast of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau's director Marco Vinicio Petrelluzzi said guards left  
the prison's inner doors open, making it easy for most of the 
prison's 456 inmates to run out the main gate. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, a total of 2,147 inmates have escaped from  
prisons and precinct jails in Sao Paulo state, according to 
official police figures. In 1998, the total was 5,888.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble To Cut 15,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble, maker of the household  
mainstays Tide, Crest, Pringles and Pampers, will eliminate 15,000 
jobs and close 10 plants in a revamp designed to cut costs, 
introduce new products faster, and increase sales. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G has been criticized for its slow-moving bureaucracy, and  
Wall Street has been waiting for changes by its new chief Durk 
Jager. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors gave the six-year plan a chilly reception, sending  
P&AMP;G stock tumbling Wednesday, as it became clear there would be no 
quick fixes and as Jager said it would be an ``enormous challenge'' 
to meet previous goals for sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G management said the ``Organization 2005'' restructuring is  
essential if the company is to meet its stated goal of improving 
profits and doubling its worldwide sales within 10 years -- despite 
intense competition in U.S. and foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result will be bigger innovation, faster speed to market  
and greater growth,'' said Jager, who took over Jan. 1 as P&AMP;G's 
chief executive. The 29-year veteran at P&AMP;G said it will be the 
most dramatic change ever in the way the company does business. 
</P>
<P>
	The worldwide cuts amount to 13 percent of P&AMP;G's work force of  
110,000 people. That includes 4,300 jobs in North America, among 
them 1,900 in the Cincinnati area, P&AMP;G's corporate headquarters 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said 10,000 jobs would be eliminated by the middle of 2001,  
with the remaining 5,000 jobs to be cut after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Jager said the estimate of about 10 plant closings includes one  
in Wakefield in the United Kingdom, which the company announced was 
closing two weeks ago. He declined to identify other plants being 
shuttered but said they would probably include some from the baby 
care, feminine protection and hair care businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, which bid up P&AMP;G stock late last week in  
anticipation of the restructuring, sent the shares tumbling 
Wednesday after details of the reorganization were disclosed. P&AMP;G's 
stock closed down $2.56 1/4, or 2.7 percent, at $92.25 a share 
Wednesday -- after dipping as low as $90.50, a 4.5 percent decline -- 
in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Hughes of Stein, Roe &AMP; Farnham, one of the analysts at the  
company's briefing in New York, said he was disappointed that P&AMP;G 
is still expecting sluggish revenue growth and that the 
reorganization won't produce quick improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's former chief executive, John Pepper, had said in  
1995 that P&AMP;G sales would double to $70 billion in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jager said at Wednesday's analysts' meeting that reaching  
that goal would be an ``enormous challenge'' requiring sales growth 
of 9 percent a year. The company now expects long-term sales growth 
of 6 percent to 8 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jager said the company has fallen short of its sales growth  
goals for the past six quarters due to economic weakness abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Clayton Daley said sales this quarter  
are expected to match or come in slightly below last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jager said $70 billion remains Procter's ``stretch goal,'' but  
conceded the new growth forecasts would leave it at about $60 
billion by the middle of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Lane of the investment advisory firm Lane Capital said  
P&AMP;G was on the right track in trying to get sales growth from 
managing its brands better but that ``it's going to take time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Maneaty, an analyst at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., said, however,  
that she was encouraged with what she heard. ``Anything that will 
make them nimbler to market'' is a plus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company with annual sales of more than $37 billion has more  
than 300 brands and reaches more than 140 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes take effect when the company's new fiscal year  
begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, P&AMP;G will move from four business units based  
on geographic regions to seven global business units based on 
product lines. The company also will tailor sales programs for 
local markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will cost Procter &AMP; Gamble $1.9 billion after taxes.  
Management expects that it will generate after-tax savings of $900 
million annually by the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said 42 percent of the work force reduction will occur in  
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 29 percent in North America, 16 
percent in Latin America and 13 percent in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jager said some workers will be laid off, but that P&AMP;G will try  
to make maximum use of retirements, relocations, voluntary 
departures and reductions in hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Management has been preparing for the new organizational design  
for months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company told shareholders in September that it planned  
corporate structural changes including forming business units based 
on products instead of regions, improving marketing and 
streamlining its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major restructuring was a 1993 reorganization that was  
designed to reduce expenses to 12 percent of sales. That program 
involved closing 30 plants and eliminating 13,000 positions 
throughout the world. Most of those job cuts came from early 
retirements, attrition and voluntary separation packages.

	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- They were mugged by a tough goalie and  
Philadelphia's Broad Street Bullies in 1975. Now the French 
Connection line of Rick Martin, Rene Robert and Gil Perreault looks 
toward a Stanley Cup 24 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	During a series in which a player killed a bat with his stick  
and then the fog rolled in, an image that persists is of the 
beating endured by the French Connection line at the hands of the 
Flyers and goalie Bernie Parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, Perreault and Robert teamed to give the Sabres 738 goals  
and 1,681 points from 1972 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The finesse line led Buffalo to six playoff appearances and its  
first trip to the Stanley Cup finals. The Sabres lost in six 
bruising games as the Flyers won their second straight Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers' roughhouse antics disrupted the French Connection.  
The Sabres' heralded line managed only four goals and seven assists 
in the series. Martin led with two goals and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all intimidation,'' Martin said. ``They bluffed their  
way to two Stanley Cups. You don't mind getting hit, but it was 
pretty chippy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What would kill the pain of that Stanley Cup loss? A Buffalo  
victory over Dallas 24 years later. And three of the swiftest and 
most prolific scorers ever assembled on one line like the Sabres' 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are going to do it,'' Martin said before Buffalo's  
3-2 overtime victory in Game 1 on Tuesday night. ``They're 
balanced, they have their feet on the ground and they have the 
goalie. The Sabres will win in six games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert oozes disappointment when tapped for his most poignant  
memory of the 1975 championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost,'' he said. ``I'd like to see the guys finish the job  
that we started 24 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something missing,'' Perreault said. ``I hope they  
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's three French Canadians all were among the NHL's top 10  
scorers in the 1974-75 regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Orr led the league with 135 points on 46 goals and 89  
assists. Robert was seventh with 100 points (40-60), Perreault 
ninth with 96 (39-57). Martin led the team in goals with 52 and was 
10th in the league with 95 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres had been winless in nine games in Philadelphia  
(0-8-1) stretching back to March 1973 when the 1975 Cup final 
began. Parent stole the first game in Philadelphia, making 22 saves 
in the first two periods. He also had some luck when Perreault 
broke in alone but failed to get off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to deke him and left the puck,'' said Perreault, whose  
team lost that game 4-2 and dropped the second 2-1. ``You need some 
luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Sabres have the same kind of dominating goaltender as  
the Flyers had then. Dominik Hasek was credited with stealing the 
first game of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal from the Ottawa 
Senators. He's been hot despite a groin injury that forced him to 
sit out the first two games of the Eastern Conference final in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek kept Buffalo close on Tuesday with some brilliant saves  
through the first two periods until the Sabres could muster some 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best goalie I've ever seen put pads on,'' Martin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's team finally got to Parent in Game 3 in Buffalo's  
non-air conditioned arena. The heat, humidity and inferior 
dehumidifiers made the setting more appropriate for a horror movie 
than a Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	Play was stopped several times so workers and players could  
skate around with sheets and blankets in tow to disperse a thick 
fog. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bat that had been fluttering around distracting  
players and fans strayed too close to Sabres forward Jim Lorentz. 
He reached up with his stick and swatted it while awaiting a 
faceoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Problem solved. But nobody wanted to touch the dead bat.  
Finally, Philadelphia's Rick MacLeish deposited the slain intruder 
in the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	The fog proved a bigger distraction for Parent. Robert scored  
the game-winner in overtime from a nearly impossible angle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went between his pads and the post,'' Robert recalled. ``It  
was pure luck. Any other time I wouldn't have shot the puck, but 
because of the fog you could score from anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres prevailed in Game 4 but lost the next two and the  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to make it to the finals,'' Martin said. ``It was  
probably the lowest feeling to lose.''

<HEADLINE> Tony Awards Falter in TV Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The people who run the Tony Awards are singing a  
new song: ``Come Back, Rosie!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Rosie O'Donnell as host, ratings for Broadway's annual  
awards show plummeted this year. O'Donnell's work on the show the 
past two years had led to a mini-revival of the Tonys as a 
television attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday night's show, which had no host, drew an estimated 9.15  
million viewers. That was the second smallest audience since the 
show began being telecast in 1974. Only the 1996 show, one year 
before O'Donnell took over, was smaller at 8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During O'Donnell's first year as host, the Tony Awards drew 12.9  
million viewers. She said she had other obligations and couldn't do 
it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was the Nielsen Media Research ratings champ with a 7.2  
rating and 13 share, even though it was the week broadcast networks 
began their annual summer slumber. CBS was second with a 6.8 rating 
and 13 share, ABC had a 5.9 rating and 11 share, and Fox was at 4.8 
and 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Those top four networks had 34.3 million people watching during  
an average minute of prime-time broadcasting last week, a sharp 
drop from the season average of 47.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating and 4  
share, UPN had a 1.6 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
7.0 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.7 
rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News was at 5.8 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 31-June 6, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Frasier,'' NBC, 10.2; ``ER,'' NBC, 10.1; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 10.0; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 9.9; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 9.9; ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 9.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 9.6; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.4; ``Law &AMP; 
Order,'' NBC, 9.2; ``20/20-Friday,'' ABC, 8.9.

<HEADLINE> TV Makers To Meet V-Chip Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most television manufacturers have put v-chips  
in at least half their new sets and should have few problems 
meeting a year-end deadline to install the blocking technology in 
all new televisions, federal regulators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	V-chips are intended to give viewers, primarily parents, the  
option of blocking shows they find objectionable. A 1996 
telecommunications law requires that all new TV sets 13 inches and 
larger must be equipped with v-chip by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a July  
1 deadline on manufacturers to install the technology in at least 
half their new sets. Nearly all of them met the deadline, FCC 
Commissioner Gloria Tristani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The v-chip is about to become a reality,'' she said during a  
news conference where the technology was demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers in compliance represent 90 percent of all  
television sets sold in the country. Information was not available 
on the remaining 10 percent, but Tristani added that ``we have no 
reason to believe they won't comply with the deadlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Panasonic announced that all of its 1999 sets are 100 percent  
compliant with v-chip integration. 
</P>
<P>
	The v-chip works in coordination with an electronically coded TV  
ratings system. Most television and cable networks use letter 
notations or age-based ratings to flag violence, sexual situations, 
crude language and suggestive dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Tristani took aim at recent reports claiming that parents were  
slow to embrace the v-chip, saying ``the system hasn't even been in 
place yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's give the v-chip a chance before we rush to any judgments  
about what parents want,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics  
Manufacturers Association, announced his organization has launched 
a publicity campaign intended to educate consumers about v-chips 
and how they work. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will create a logo and sticker that retailers can use  
to help people identify v-chip equipped television sets.

<HEADLINE> Grains Move Lower; Soybeans Advance / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures retreated Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade amid forecasts for improved weather later this week 
in Midwest growing regions. Soybeans advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain prices were pressured by private and government forecasts  
for cooler weather and much-needed rains later this week. Prices 
had been rising as temperatures sharply in parts of the Midwest, 
possibly stressing young crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans found support on government figures showing strong  
exports in the past week. That is significant, given heavy 
competition from bumper South American production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1/4 cent to $2.55 a bushel; July corn  
fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; July oats were unchanged at 
$1.25 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to $4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell 0.05 cent to 66.35 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 0.25 cent to 77.27 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 0.33 cent to 50.77 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 0.43 
cent to 50.05 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Puts Money Where Its Mouth Is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Battery-powered toothbrushes. Tongue  
scrapers. Tongue brushes. Fingertip stick-on toothbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans put a lot of money into their mouths -- $1.6 billion on  
toothpaste alone last year. Companies eager for a bite of that were 
out in force for the North American Chain Drug Store marketplace 
conference in New Orleans this week. 
</P>
<P>
	You could choose from several styles of plastic or metal gizmos  
designed to scrape plaque and sulfur-producing bacteria from the 
tiny cracks and fissures in your tongue -- not to mention a flat 
round brush intended for the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Each company, of course, was selling its product as the one and  
only best. And they weren't shy about bad-mouthing the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Clifford Yudelman of San Diego, whose tongue scraper is a  
long oval ring with a handle that goes out and down, said a 
competitor's tongue brush had such coarse bristles it left his 
tongue raw. 
</P>
<P>
	No, no -- you need bristles to get into the crevices, said Tom  
Oechslin of Peak Enterprises Inc. He took a display card off the 
wall and scrapes its flat edge down the length of a 4-foot-long 3-D 
hard plastic tongue draped on one wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were a tabletop, you could squeegee it off,'' he said.  
``But the tongue has a lot of nooks and crannies where germs hide 
under plaque.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bristles have to be stiffish, because toothbrush bristles  
just splay across the tongue and never get into the places they're 
needed most, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slight tenderness and/or bleeding may occur at first, but  
should stop with regular brushing,'' the display card notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans spent $1.23 billion on toothbrushes and dental  
accessories last year, up 13.7 percent from 1997, according to 
Information Resources Inc. of Chicago, and more than $600 million 
on mouthwash. 
</P>
<P>
	The tongue scrapers and brushes both spring from one simple  
idea: the bacteria that cause bad breath hide out in the tongue. 
Get them out of the mouth, and the breath becomes sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
	All are designed to stay flat on the tongue to prevent gagging.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John J. Colomb III, a New Orleans dentist, found the brush a  
bit more interesting than the scrapers, but said he'd want clinical 
tests before recommending any of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I usually just tell my patients to use their toothbrushes,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 79.15; Nasdaq Up 23.69 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks dropped once again today as  
investors maintained their watch on inflation and its effect on the 
bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 79.15 at 10,686.49 after falling 143.74 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 1.70 at 1,315.63. The Nasdaq composite index was up 
23.69 at 2,498.25 as some major technology names attracted buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to hold  
off inflation have rattled stock and bond prices in recent weeks. 
On Tuesday, the declining price of the 30-year Treasury bond pushed 
its yield briefly above the psychologically important 6 percent 
barrier. It held there today as prices continued to slip. Bond 
prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure of 6 percent is weighing on investors,'' said  
Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates often lower corporate profits, and in turn  
push stock prices down. A yield of 6 percent might also prompt some 
stock investors to switch to bonds because at that level, they 
offer a more stable, guaranteed return than volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say stocks may have trouble picking up momentum at  
least until Friday, when the government will report on producer 
prices. The report is expected to offer the latest suggestion of 
whether inflation is indeed rising. 
</P>
<P>
	However, shares of technology bellwethers were mostly higher  
today after the Semiconductor Industry Association said 1999 sales 
are expected to grow faster than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said growing acceptance of the Internet and electronic  
commerce is driving chip sales. Chip maker Intel rose 1 9/16 to 
53 1/4, and Applied Materials, maker of chip components, rose 1 5/8 to 63 
7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, research firm International Data Corp. issued a positive  
forecast for global shipments of personal computers, boosting PC 
makers including Dell, which added 1 5/16 to trade at 35 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications, a provider of long-distance telephone and  
Internet services, rose 2 9/16 to 45 7/8 on the Nasdaq after the 
regional phone company BellSouth said it was considering purchasing 
Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble led the Dow lower, slipping 3 to 91 13/16. The  
company announced a restructuring that will eliminate 15,000 jobs 
and close 10 plants worldwide over six years. Some analysts said 
the plan wouldn't help much in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman Kodak, another Dow component, gained 9/16 to 70 1/16  
following word that chairman and chief executive officer George 
Fisher will step down as CEO at the end of the year. Fisher will be 
replaced by longtime Kodak executive Daniel Carp, but remain as 
chairman until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow could not break out of its negative band today,  
analysts were reluctant to forecast a selloff of Tuesday's 
magnitude. Volume remained extremely light as investors continued 
to hold off on any new positions until they receive a clearer 
indication of the Fed's next move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lack of volume almost always defines minimal conviction,''  
said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; 
Co. in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 512.6 
million shares, behind Tuesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.72 at 629.05, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.19 at 771.73.

<HEADLINE> Agent Accused of Stealing Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A drug agent stole 650 pounds of cocaine from  
the Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement's Riverside office in 1997, 
making it look like a forced burglary, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Lonergan presented a methodical  
overview of evidence she said made it obvious that Richard Wayne 
Parker was a dirty cop who stole the cocaine on July 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	When Parker was arrested at his San Juan Capistrano home,  
authorities found $600,000 in cash in some of the eight vehicles he 
had recently purchased, the prosecutor said Tuesday in closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have his spending which is way above his legitimate  
income,'' she told jurors. ``You have cocaine found in his gym 
bags. You have a whole series of items found in his house that had 
cocaine on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, 44, had been with the bureau for 10 years when he was  
arrested last year. In addition to drug charges, he is accused of 
money laundering and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend he stole the cocaine and used a former  
girlfriend, Monica Pitto, and two co-defendants to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Richard Hamar said only tiny amounts of cocaine  
were found in Parker's home, amounts that could be found in the 
home of any drug agent who regularly handled narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker had a weakness for women and spent money on them but  
never became a drug dealer, Hamar said. He said Parker's payments 
for such things as a stripper's $1,000-a-month apartment don't make 
him a criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a neon sign blaring at you, 'Not guilty,''' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pitto pleaded guilty to conspiracy and testified for the  
prosecution that Parker sold her cocaine that she sold to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker testified during the six-week trial that Ms. Pitto, a  
former banker, asked him to store large amounts of cash for her, 
assuring him the money came from legitimate business transactions.

<HEADLINE> Brain Damage-Cancer Defense Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have discovered that testicular cancer can lead to  
brain damage, seizures, memory loss and dementia long before the 
cancer is even detected. 
</P>
<P>
	The brain damage apparently is caused not by the cancer itself,  
but by an overly aggressive attack by body's own immune system on a 
protein produced by tumors, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York  
report that men with testicular cancer and damage to one of the 
brain's emotional centers had a particular type of antibody in 
their blood. The antibody was found in most of the men's blood long 
before the cancer was detected. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggests that these antibodies could be used to give  
patients an early warning of testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine is the  
third to link brain damage to an immune system attack on cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Darnell of Rockefeller University, who has performed  
similar research but was not involved in this study, said these 
rare brain disorders could provide clues necessary to develop tumor 
vaccines and treatments for other degenerative brain diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very important models for how an immune response in  
the body can get into the brain and cause degeneration,'' he said. 
``This is very important for multiple sclerosis and maybe other 
degenerative diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers think the biological double whammy occurs because a  
tumor sometimes creates a protein normally found only in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the immune system ordinarily doesn't come across those  
proteins, it attacks them as invaders. But since the same protein 
is in the brain, the brain also is attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Raymond Voltz and colleagues at Sloan-Kettering tested  
samples from 986 cancer patients for antibodies to brain proteins. 
</P>
<P>
	One was a man who had testicular cancer and brain problems  
caused by inflammation in the limbic system, a part of the brain 
important in regulating emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	They found an antibody they had never seen before, and checked  
it against serum from 12 other men. All 12 had both testicular 
cancer and a related inflammation in either the limbic system or 
the brain stem. Nine of them also had the antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the 10 men with the antibodies didn't have any symptoms  
of cancer when they went to the doctor for brain problems. The 
cancer was found six months later, on average, and as long as three 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Voltz and his colleagues compared the study group with several  
other types of patients, including those with tumor-related brain 
damage and people who had cancer but no brain damage. The antibody 
was unique to the combination of testicular cancer and inflammation 
of the limbic system or the brain stem. 
</P>
<P>
	This suggests that patients, especially young men, who have  
symptoms of this type of inflammation should be tested for the 
antibodies as an early check for testicular cancer, the doctors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnell reported a similar link to brain damage among breast and  
ovarian cancer patients last fall. A third study reported the link 
in patients with small-cell lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study with breast and ovarian cancer, the patients' blood  
contained immune system T-cells that had attacked both the tumor 
and the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls movement. 
The patients couldn't walk because their legs and arms jerked as if 
they were being shocked, and they had trouble controlling their eye 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers in the new study said they did not know whether  
the brain damage is caused by the antibody, a similar killer T-cell 
response, or both.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Laura Meckler, an Associated Press reporter  
based in Washington, has received the $10,000 Livingston Award for 
national reporting for a series of articles on the uneven success 
of organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Livingston awards are presented annually to outstanding  
journalists under the age of 35. This year's presentation ceremony 
was Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Meckler, 30, used the four-part series to identify problems  
in the organ-transplant system, including the 4,000 patients who 
die each year when organs do not reach them in time. The articles 
presented the first national ranking of organ banks. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS newsman Mike Wallace described Ms. Meckler's meticulous  
reporting on organ transplants and said she combined the tools of 
narrative storytelling and computer-assisted research to tell the 
most human of stories, involving life and death. 
</P>
<P>
	Also receiving $10,000 Livingston Awards for articles written in  
1998 were: 
</P>
<P>
	--For local reporting: Jo Becker, 31, of the St. Petersburg  
Times. Her series of articles ``documented miscarriages of suburban 
governance that forced officials from their jobs, caused pollution 
to be cleaned up and saved taxpayers money on a public real estate 
transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--For international reporting: Elizabeth Rubin, 33, a  
contributing editor of Harper's and The Forward. Her winning 
article, ``Our Children are Killing Us,'' appeared in The New 
Yorker. It described ``the operations of an army in northern Uganda 
that is staffed mainly by Ugandan children kidnapped from their 
families and trained to prey on their own communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles R. Eisendrath, director of the Livingston Awards, said  
it was the first time in the 18-year history of the honors that all 
three had gone to women journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Tom Brokaw of NBC News presented $5,000 awards to  
two senior journalists recognized as ``superb on-the-job mentors.'' 
They are Mary McGrory, a columnist for The Washington Post; and 
Thomas Winship, former editor of The Boston Globe.

<HEADLINE> Texas A&AMP;M Coach Has Gehrig Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Texas A&AMP;M quarterbacks coach Ray  
Dorr has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, head 
coach R.C. Slocum announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorr learned he had ALS after recent medical tests in Houston.  
ALS is commonly known as ``Lou Gehrig's disease,'' a rare and 
incurable disease named after the New York Yankee first baseman who 
died of the disease in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorr has coached at the collegiate level for 32 years, including  
stints at Akron, Kent State, Washington, Southern Illinois, 
Southern California and Kentucky. He has been with the Aggies since 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorr said he will continue to coach as long as his health  
permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching football is something that I love, and I'm looking  
forward to this challenge,'' Dorr said.

<HEADLINE> Cigars Double Risk for Some Cancers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cigar smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to get cancer of  
the mouth, throat and lungs, researchers reported today in the 
latest warning about the dangers of one of the hottest trends of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	The smokers also run about 1 1/2 times the risk of all  
smoking-related cancers together and are more likely to develop 
heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,  
was conducted by Dr. Carlos Iribarren, an epidemiologist at the 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland, Calif., who 
examined the medical records of 1,546 regular cigar smokers and 
16,228 nonsmokers from 1971 through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cigar smokers smoked fewer than five a day.  
</P>
<P>
	The study expanded on one described by The Associated Press last  
year, when Iribarren presented data about 225 cigar smokers to the 
American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The risks aren't as high as they are for cigarette smokers  
because cigar smokers don't usually inhale the smoke and hold it in 
their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette smokers have about three times as high a risk of  
coronary heart disease as nonsmokers, 10 times the risk of lung 
cancer and 20 to 25 times the risk of cardiac lung disease, 
Iribarren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But our study shows conclusively that there are very serious  
health consequences associated with chronic cigar use,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher, who has been trying to get the  
Federal Trade Commission to require warning labels on cigars like 
those on cigarettes, said: ``Cigar smoking seems to have become a 
fad. The implication is that people don't think its dangerous. This 
is more very solid evidence of the dangers of cigar smoking.''

<HEADLINE>  Bush Takes Birthday Dive From Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Saying he felt like a spring colt,  
by golly, former President Bush marked his 75th birthday Wednesday 
by jumping from a plane 13,000 feet over his presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just had one of the biggest thrills of my life,'' Bush  
said after he completed a 4,500-foot free fall and then parachuted 
to a landing on a grass field across the street from the library at 
Texas A&AMP;M University. He said it was ``just totally exhilarating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who turns 75 Saturday, added: ``If somebody doesn't like  
that or thinks it's frivolous, my answer is: Old guys can still do 
stuff. You might as well go for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a spring colt,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Bush's third jump ever and second in two years.  
</P>
<P>
	The first was into the Pacific Ocean in 1944, during World War  
II, when he bailed out of his torpedo bomber after it was disabled 
by Japanese fire. He promised himself that someday he would 
parachute for fun, and so he did two years ago in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Wednesday's jump he told his wife, Barbara, it would be  
the last. But afterward, he said it had been such a thrill he may 
do it again when he's 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush said: ``I've already told him he can do it when he's  
80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's jump was dubbed Operation Spring Colt by the U.S.  
Parachute Association, which organized it. About 1,500 people 
watched under partly cloudy skies in near-90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was absolutely fantastic,'' said Jack Guy, 76, of  
Atlanta, who flew with Bush in World War II and saw his plane go 
down in the Pacific. ``I wish I could do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just after 10 a.m. and at 13,000 feet over College Station,  
about 85 miles northwest of Houston, Bush, wearing a white jumpsuit 
trimmed with red and blue and with his name stitched on the left 
side, got to the open door of the white twin-engine plane and 
peered out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look down from 13,000 feet ... Oh my God!'' he said.  
``Once you're out, there's no fear or scariness. We were rolling 
around in the sky. It was heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with his jump in Arizona, two skydiving masters held on to  
Bush until he gave a hand signal indicating he was OK. Then they 
drifted away and Bush pulled the chute himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After circling the area with the chute unfurled, he closed in on  
the landing site. He touched the ground with his feet and landed on 
his backside. Several supporters helped him up.

<HEADLINE> Butterflies React to Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Butterfly populations in Europe have shifted north during the  
past century, a possible sign that many other animal species are 
moving in response to global warming, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms that things are beginning to happen. If we can see  
it in butterflies, then it's likely to be happening in other 
groups,'' said Ian Woiwod, an entomologist at the Rothamstead 
Experimental Station in Britain who was not involved in the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,  
researchers looked at 35 species of butterflies and found that 22 
had either died out at the southern end of their ranges, or spread 
beyond their former northern boundary, or both. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rest, most had not moved, while two species had extended  
south. 
</P>
<P>
	The butterflies' ranges had moved 20 to 150 miles.  
</P>
<P>
	Europe is 1.4 degrees warmer than it was 100 years ago, and the  
average temperatures experienced by butterflies then can now be 
found 75 miles farther north. Temperatures are expected to increase 
an additional 4 to 8 degrees in the next century because of the 
greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterly enthusiasts in Sweden, Finland and Estonia can now find  
certain butterflies farther north. In some cases, they are seeing 
species new to the country. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Heodes Tityrus, the sooty copper butterfly, has  
disappeared from its southern sites in Spain but established itself 
in Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied butterflies because they are known to be  
sensitive to the climate and have been followed by naturalists for 
a long time. Migratory butterflies and those strongly affected by 
other changes in the environment, like pollution and farming, were 
excluded from the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at the University of Texas at  
Austin, organized the project, which was aimed at detecting 
large-scale shifts in response to climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	She went to Europe, where many countries have  
government-sponsored programs that count butterflies. Some of the 
programs gather sightings from thousands of amateur collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	She got butterfly specialists in Britain, France, Spain, Sweden,  
Finland and Estonia to pool their data. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, experts in Washington, D.C., reported that  
populations of Alaska salmon are dying because of higher 
temperatures in the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Stars Lament Missed Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The veteran Dallas Stars made a rookie mistake in  
Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals. They got comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, in the first appearance in the championship series,  
passively protected an early one-goal lead instead of aggressively 
trying to extend it, then paid the price when the Buffalo Sabres 
rallied for a 3-2 overtime victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no passion in our game, and to me that is  
unacceptable,'' forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``We've got an older 
team, so we know when we do something wrong. Right now, there's no 
excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull put Dallas ahead 1-0 with a power-play goal midway  
through the first period. The Stars had nine more power plays, 
including the rare benefit of two in overtime, and they struck out 
on all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we'd have gotten a second goal, maybe things would have  
been different,'' forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We've got to make 
more of our opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars went into the third period ahead 1-0, a margin that  
has been good enough this postseason. They had won all five games 
when they were leading after two periods, and with eight former Cup 
winners, things seemed in control. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, they got sloppy. Goalie Ed Belfour was under pressure  
for the first time all game, and Buffalo capitalized with two goals 
in a span of 5:04 to take a 2-1 lead with 6:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
	``The third period was a bad period,'' center Mike Modano said.  
``We got away from our style of play. We lost our edge and let them 
back into the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas went with an empty net with a little over a minute left,  
and the extra skater paid off when Jere Lehtinen scored with 48 
seconds left to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were the more aggressive team in the extra period, but  
again they couldn't find the big play, not even during the four 
minutes they played with the man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what you do with them, not how many you get,'' forward  
Jamie Langenbrunner said. ``And we didn't do anything with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres ended it when Jason Woolley knocked the puck between  
Belfour's legs with 4:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo was playing for the first time in eight days, while  
Dallas was coming off a rough seven-game series against Colorado 
that ended Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Stars refused to blame fatigue for this loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time to worry about being tired,'' Modano  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres credited goalie Dominik Hasek for keeping them in the  
game after the early goal. Dallas players said he got off easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we shot a lot of pucks right at him,'' captain Derian  
Hatcher said. ``Not to take anything away from him, but I don't 
think we forced him to make too many spectacular saves. We have to 
make it tougher on Dominik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't getting second and third chances on him,''  
Langenbrunner said. ``When we did, we didn't put it away on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has an uphill battle if it's going to win the first  
Stanley Cup in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 12 of 60 teams have overcome 1-0 deficits in the finals.  
Buffalo now holds the home-ice advantage, and the Sabres are 7-0 at 
Marine Midland Arena this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had our backs to the wall before,'' Carbonneau said.  
``And we've come through every time.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor Wants End to Drinking on Porch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORREST CITY, Ark. (AP) -- The mayor here says he is tired of  
driving down the street and seeing folks sitting on their front 
porch drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
	So Mayor Larry Bryant wants the city's police department to  
issue citations for public drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can drive down the street in my vehicle with my child and  
see people drinking, they should be stopped,'' Bryant said. ``To 
me, if I can see them, it is public. Where are my rights as a 
parent and citizen to not have to subject my child to this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	City Attorney Knox Kinney said he doubts the charge citations  
would hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't see officers arresting people on their front  
porches with a beer in their hands, if they aren't causing some 
other sort of problem as well,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NHL Boss Hasn't Been Lucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There are plenty of tools a shrewd commissioner can call on to  
make his game go. Unfortunately for NHL boss Gary Bettman, luck 
hasn't been one of them. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
	The past four seasons, Bettman has tinkered with almost  
everything connected to hockey but the puck and the national 
anthems. He's made moves to increase scoring, clamp down on 
fighting, stabilize franchises in Canada and plant flags in the 
soil for expanding globally by test-marketing the game at the 
Olympics. He's faced down labor strife and insolvent owners and 
kept the game always moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to the league's showcase series, fate seems to  
be waiting for him with a cross-check. Because the past four 
seasons, Bettman might just as well have handed the winners of the 
Stanley Cup a broom along with the trophy. When he needed drama the 
most what he got were sweeps. First, New Jersey, then Colorado, 
then Detroit twice. What happened Tuesday night in Game 1 of this 
year's finals, though, suggests his fortunes are about to change. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's 3-2 overtime win in Dallas practically guarantees the  
series won't be slipping into that well-worn groove. That's not to 
say there wasn't plenty that was familiar about the way things 
turned out. Winning is a definite possibility on any night that 
your goalie stops 35 of 37 shots -- which happens to be most nights 
when your goalie is Dominik Hasek. But the Stars bring so much more 
ammunition to the showdown than the Sabres do that this one won't 
be Buffalo in four-and-out. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this means,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said in assessing  
the win, ``is that we can't get swept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed a definite possibility going in, what with Buffalo a  
seventh-place team in the East matched against the Stars. It wasn't 
just that Dallas roared back to beat the Avalanche and represent 
the West, whose teams swept the last three Stanley Cups. The Stars 
had also won the league's Presidents' Trophy as the top team with 
114 points in the regular season, and they have a goalie, Eddie 
Belfour, who has looked every bit as formidable as Hasek scaling 
the playoff pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour and Hasek trying to climb over each other to get to the  
top is a great story line by itself. Both are now 34, both have won 
Vezina and Jennings trophies, and this is hardly the first time 
they stood in one another's way. They tried sharing a job in 
Chicago in 1992, and it ended in disaster, depending on who you 
talk to, because Belfour had the starting job and Hasek desperately 
wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until they met in this year's series, the only Stanley Cup  
experience either goalie had was gained during an unmercifully 
brief sweep of the Blackhawks by the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992. 
In that sense, at least, Hasek looked the much better prepared 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lying on his side, he made a brilliant kick save with his right  
pad on Pat Verbeek with some five minutes left in the overtime. 
Less than a minute later, Buffalo's Curtis Brown held the puck 
along the right boards and spotted teammate Jason Woolley coming 
off the bench and barreling down the slot toward the Dallas net. He 
sent the puck to Woolley, who redirected it past Belfour in one 
sweeping motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock summed up the sudden turn of events  
just as deftly: ``Chances missed on the other end will come back to 
haunt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettman would do well to remember those words, especially with  
his state-of-the-game message set for delivery today. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest buzz hockey generated this season was when it said  
goodbye to Wayne Gretzky, a mixed blessing if there ever was one. 
Its TV ratings were up on one network and down on another. Almost 
18 million people showed up at the rinks to watch the game, so much 
better in person, which remains both a strength and a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the series, Hitchcock acknowledged how important it  
was to come up with an appealing matchup. He practically apologized 
for the defensive styles both Buffalo and Dallas played, saying, 
``This isn't going to be a series made for television. If you look 
for `Champions on Ice,' you're watching the wrong game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bettman has said repeatedly that speed and physical play,  
racheted up a notch or two by the intensity playoffs bestow on the 
game, is all he needs to sell it. That -- and a series long enough 
to hold the public's attention.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Takes Birthday Dive From Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Saying he felt like a spring colt,  
by golly, former President Bush marked his 75th birthday Wednesday 
by jumping from a plane 13,000 feet over his presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just had one of the biggest thrills of my life,'' Bush  
said after he completed a 4,500-foot free fall and then parachuted 
to a landing on a grass field across the street from the library at 
Texas A&AMP;M University. He said it was ``just totally exhilarating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who turns 75 Saturday, added: ``If somebody doesn't like  
that or thinks it's frivolous, my answer is: Old guys can still do 
stuff. You might as well go for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a spring colt,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Bush's third jump ever and second in two years.  
</P>
<P>
	The first was into the Pacific Ocean in 1944, during World War  
II, when he bailed out of his torpedo bomber after it was disabled 
by Japanese fire. He promised himself that someday he would 
parachute for fun, and so he did two years ago in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Wednesday's jump he told his wife, Barbara, it would be  
the last. But afterward, he said it had been such a thrill he may 
do it again when he's 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush said: ``I've already told him he can do it when he's  
80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's jump was dubbed Operation Spring Colt by the U.S.  
Parachute Association, which organized it. About 1,500 people 
watched under partly cloudy skies in near-90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was absolutely fantastic,'' said Jack Guy, 76, of  
Atlanta, who flew with Bush in World War II and saw his plane go 
down in the Pacific. ``I wish I could do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just after 10 a.m. and at 13,000 feet over College Station,  
about 85 miles northwest of Houston, Bush, wearing a white jumpsuit 
trimmed with red and blue and with his name stitched on the left 
side, got to the open door of the white twin-engine plane and 
peered out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look down from 13,000 feet ... Oh my God!'' he said.  
``Once you're out, there's no fear or scariness. We were rolling 
around in the sky. It was heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with his jump in Arizona, two skydiving masters held on to  
Bush until he gave a hand signal indicating he was OK. Then they 
drifted away and Bush pulled the chute himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After circling the area with the chute unfurled, he closed in on  
the landing site. He touched the ground with his feet and landed on 
his backside. Several supporters helped him up.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Considers Acquiring Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- BellSouth Corp. is weighing plans to buy the  
remaining 90 percent of Qwest Communications International Inc. to 
enter the long-distance telephone market and provide more customers 
with high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  
BellSouth said it ``has considered and continues to explore'' 
various alternatives, including ``transactions which may result in 
the acquisition of a control position in or combination with'' 
Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth, the Atlanta-based regional phone company, recently  
purchased a 10 percent stake in Qwest, the nation's fourth-largest 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler Gronbach, a spokesman for Denver-based Qwest, said,  
``We're not going to comment on any kind of speculation.'' Tim 
Klein, a spokesman from BellSouth, said he would not comment beyond 
the filing, which was dated May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies won't be walking to the altar soon, however,  
because a federal law prohibits BellSouth and the other ``Baby 
Bell'' phone companies created by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T from 
owning more than 10 percent of any long-distance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Federal Communications Commission quashed  
efforts by two other Baby Bells to repackage and sell Qwest's 
long-distance service. The agency ruled that Ameritech and U S West 
must first open their local markets to competition before they can 
offer long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, most telecom experts expect one of the Baby Bells  
to get approval to enter the long-distance market by the end of the 
year -- a ruling that could open the door for others. 
</P>
<P>
	That being the case, any deal between BellSouth and Qwest  
``could not possibly happen until 2000,'' said Tom Jenkins, a 
senior partner at TeleChoice Inc., a consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
	An interesting twist, he said, would be if Qwest offered to buy  
BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	With a market value of $30 billion, Qwest is about one-third the  
size of BellSouth. Still, such a deal wouldn't be unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Global Crossing Ltd., an upstart phone carrier based  
in Bermuda, made a $35 billion offer for Denver-based U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth and Qwest would complement one another. BellSouth not  
only provides local phone service, but also has interests in 
wireless communications and cable and digital TV. Qwest offers 
long-distance calling and high-speed Internet service, and is 
building a fiber optic network in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exactly the kind of deal BellSouth needs to do,'' said  
Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecom analyst. ``We see companies 
like U S West and Global Crossing blending old and new, and even 
though investors don't always understand it, it's the right thing 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be changing. Amid news of BellSouth's filing, Qwest's  
shares rose $3.68 3/4, or 8.5 percent, to $47 in Wednesday's trading 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. BellSouth's shares dipped 6 1/4 cents to 
$46.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Groups Protest Phone Fee Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Giving up on help from regulators, consumer  
groups want Congress to intervene against increases in phone rate 
fees paid by consumers and businesses that are to take effect July 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Wednesday to key lawmakers, Consumers Union and  
the Consumer Federation of America protested the Federal 
Communications Commission rate pricing plan and said the fee 
increases would add $1 billion a year to consumer phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Those costs include an increase in the charges paid by long  
distance companies to local phone companies to connect long 
distance calls and a 20-cent increase in the fee that funds the 
wiring of schools and libraries, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is time for Congress to reverse these  
regressive, unfair rate increases that result from FCC's 
policies,'' the groups wrote Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of 
the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups contends that policies enacted by the FCC since 1996  
have resulted in an additional $3 being tagged on to the monthly 
phone bill of average residential long distance customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This system isn't fair to consumers and it goes against what  
Congress intended the FCC to do,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director 
of Consumers Union. The groups also say the flat rate fees 
particularly hurt those consumers who do not make a high number of 
long distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard denied the flat rate charges have hurt  
consumers, saying the alternative could be higher per-minute costs 
for calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``American consumers are paying less for long distance today  
than they ever have in history,'' Kennard said Wednesday. ``Long 
distance rates have been plummeting as a result of the 
pro-competitive policies of the FCC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance company Sprint also defended the flat rate  
charges, saying the line item charges on phone bills eliminate 
hidden charges being squeezed into per minute long-distance rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under this structure consumers now know what they are paying  
for,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard did add that he is planning to look at whether consumers  
making few long-distance calls are being disadvantaged by the flat 
rate charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to look intensively at this class of consumers,''  
Kennard said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Dedicates Vaccine Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton dedicated a new vaccine  
research center in honor of former Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers and 
his wife, Betty, on Wednesday and urged a renewed commitment to 
discovery of a vaccination against the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50,000 square-foot National Institutes of Health facility,  
expected to be completed next year in Bethesda, Md., will house 100 
scientists and support staff. Clinton said he expected the center 
to work toward the goal he set of developing an AIDS vaccine within 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until an AIDS vaccine is tested and approved it will remain  
the primary mission of the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research 
Center,'' Clinton said. ``I am confident that this is a place where 
miracles will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the concern that Bumpers, who preceded Clinton as  
Arkansas' governor, showed for ensuring that the state's 
schoolchildren received standard vaccinations opened his eyes to 
the importance of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long, long time, Hillary and I have been inspired by  
Dale and Betty's personal crusade,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Court Sets Aside Media Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has set aside its own  
ruling in a case where NBC television was ordered to turn over an 
unbroadcast tape made for a story about Louisiana state police. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals had ruled in September that NBC  
had to hand over the videotape made for an NBC ``Dateline'' segment 
of an officer pulling over a car. NBC was investigating whether 
police were making decisions based on race, nationality or 
out-of-state plates. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape was demanded by lawyers for a Hispanic couple who are  
suing a Louisiana deputy sheriff, alleging civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for NBC argued the First Amendment provided qualified  
privilege on material reporters get from nonconfidential sources. 
The court found otherwise in September in a ruling seen as making 
it easier for lawyers to obtain unpublished notes and videotapes 
from journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	But on June 1 the court vacated its ruling, saying it may need  
to rehear the issue. The latter ruling instructed lower court 
judges to no longer use the September ruling as a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to further illumination of the issue  
from the Court of Appeals,'' said Susan Weiner, a lawyer for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly from the journalist's perspective, the law in the  
circuit prior to this decision has appeared to recognize greater 
protection for journalist's work products, notes and tapes,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists have already reaped a benefit from the June 1 order.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the appeals court vacated a contempt finding  
involving The Wall Street Journal that was based on the higher 
court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, a lower court judge refused to let Dow Jones &AMP;  
Co., publisher of the Journal, to quash a subpoena for a reporter's 
notes. The subpoena was lodged by defendants in a securities action 
brought by stockholders of Centennial Technologies Inc.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Criticize Gun Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Democrats and President Clinton  
are complaining that the National Rifle Association is writing the 
House's gun control bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a bill plainly ghostwritten by the NRA,'' President  
Clinton said Wednesday. ``They have been calling the shots on this 
issue for decades now and we have failed to do what is manifestly 
in the interests of our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans fired right back, with Rep. Henry Hyde saying  
Democrats were ``fantasizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA is a legitimate organization; they made known their  
views,'' said Hyde, who has inflamed the interest group in the past 
by authoring gun control legislation. ``The NRA did not write our 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations are flying as the House takes its turn at  
cracking down on juvenile violence two months after two high school 
students in Littleton, Colo., murdered 12 of their classmates and a 
teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate started the process last month when it narrowly  
passed legislation that would require mandatory background checks 
on all firearms transactions at gun shows and pawn shops; safety 
locks or other devices to be sold with all new handguns; a ban on 
the importation of high capacity ammunition clips; mandatory prison 
sentences for felons committing crimes with guns, and a lifetime 
ban on gun ownership for any juvenile convicted of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure did not contain a provision to raise the  
minimum age for possession of handguns from 18 to 21, which is 
supported by Clinton, Hyde and House Speaker Dennis Hastert. But 
others in the Republican leadership oppose that provision, and its 
fate in the House is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP gun legislation has yet to be unveiled, but Hyde,  
R-Ill., who will co-sponsor the bill with Rep. Bill McCollum, 
R-Fla., when it comes to the floor next week, bristled at the 
suggestion that the NRA dominated the drafting process. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bill was a compromise ``between a lot of people,''  
including the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to spare House members a lengthy and politically  
perilous debate over the issue, as occurred in the Senate last 
month, House GOP leaders plan to bypass normal committee 
consideration of the measure and send the bill straight to the 
floor on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan could work to the Democrats' political advantage  
because it gives them a wider television audience, which they think 
may help them overcome the GOP's six-seat House majority in next 
year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a coordinated media attack yesterday, Democrats still  
complained that Republicans had put off a vote only to allow the 
NRA time to launch a massive lobbying campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said that while the  
Hyde-McCollum bill addressed the group's demands, such as more 
narrowly defining gun shows than the Senate version, the sponsors 
had not agreed to other requests. LaPierre said they included 
shortening the deadline for the results of a background check from 
three days to one.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Warns of Lower Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Confirming suspicions, Lockheed Martin on  
Wednesday warned that launch failures and problems with cargo plane 
and anti-missile programs have hurt the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	The news that the company will post an unexpected loss for this  
quarter and disappointing profits over the next two years sent its 
shares plunging as much as 16.5 percent. Analysts, however, said 
Lockheed's stumbles weren't indicative of industrywide troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	In its stunning announcement before financial markets opened,  
Lockheed said it expects to lose between 10 cents and 15 cents a 
share in the second quarter. Wall Street analysts had been 
expecting a profit of 72 cents a share, according to a survey by 
First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Botched rocket launches were clearly a factor in the financial  
setback. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed has suffered four failed satellite launches in the past  
eight months, which have destroyed both rockets and satellites. It 
has asked a panel of experts to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts, however, also blamed what they said were  
inefficiencies in the growing company, which employs more than 
161,000 people worldwide and had sales of more than $26 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Friedman, an analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity Group  
in New York, said Lockheed was trying to do too many things at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
	Launch failures are the ``nature of this business. You're  
building very complicated sophisticated machinery, and there's 
always a big chance these things can fail,'' Friedman said. ``But 
they also don't seem to have a handle on the cost structure of 
several of their defense programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Lockheed Martin reported second quarter earnings of  
$289 million or $1.52 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed lost $87 million, or 23 cents a share, in the first  
quarter of this year, however, blaming a $355 million charge for 
business start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's announcement included a projection that 1999  
earnings would be about $1.50 a share, or $1.60 a share lower than 
analysts expected. The company said its financial review indicated 
annual earnings would be reduced by 85 cents a share because of 
delays, failures and other performance issues. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 70 cents was attributable to production of fewer  
of the new C-130J military transports than projected, and 31 cents 
was related to the exclusion of previously announced portfolio 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed had previously warned that it would update its  
quarterly and year-end earnings forecasts before their release, but 
the amount stunned some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed stock plunged in heavy trading on the New York Stock  
Exchange, closing down 13.8 percent, or by $5.56 1/4 at $34.87 1/2 a 
share. At one point, Lockheed fell as low as $33.75. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, they're not getting the financial information they  
need on a timely basis,'' said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst 
with JSA Research in Newport, Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company appeared to have trouble coordinating its  
various branches and quality control systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These systems have to be consolidated efficiently so that the  
company can have a good idea of what it's doing,'' Nisbet said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Morgan Stanley analyst Pierre Chao said Lockheed's  
revised projections were overly cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was clearly a performance problem. And there was a  
certain amount of bad luck, but the management team was really 
forceful in saying `We screwed up, here's the fix and we'll be 
responsible if the fix doesn't work,''' Chao said. ``By the time we 
get to the third and fourth quarters, and certainly 2000, it won't 
be as bad as they are saying now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chao said the company has already replaced the management teams  
of its space and C-130J teams. It also has announced changes in 
financial systems within its aeronautics division and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not expect further warnings.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's always the cockroach theory, once you see one it means  
there's more, and that's what has been going on for a while, but 
what they did with this today put an end to that...'' Chao said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's chairman and chief executive, Vance Coffman, said the  
company is prepared to make further changes to improve its 
performance but that it also has bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand for our products and services is very strong and our  
technology is second to none at a time when defense outlays are 
likely to increase,'' Coffman said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Urges Consultation on N. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House International Relations Committee  
chairman Benjamin Gilman said Wednesday he is concerned that the 
Clinton administration is forging a new policy toward North Korea 
without adequate consultation with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman, R-N.Y., outlined his criticism in a statement after  
former Defense Secretary William Perry gave Gilman and other 
members of Congress an update on the North Korea policy review he 
initiated eight months ago at the request of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman said he was concerned that the administration has  
``actually completed its review and is moving forward with quiet 
diplomatic initiatives with North Korea'' without close 
consultation with the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that legislation approved last year called for the  
development of a bipartisan approach to North Korea as a means of 
easing differences between the administration and the Congress on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman's statement did not criticize Perry directly and was  
devoted largely to procedural issues, not substance. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department had no immediate response to Gilman's  
statement but an administration official disputed the suggestion 
that the administration is pursuing a new policy. He said Perry has 
yet to make recommendations on policy changes to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his review, Perry visited North Korea two weeks ago.  
He said immediately after the visit that he explored with North 
Korean officials the possibility of a ``major expansion'' in U.S. 
relations with North Korea if U.S. and allied concerns about North 
Korea's missile and nuclear programs were addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern is North Korea's development of long-range  
ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry said he traveled to Pyongyang as a presidential envoy and  
not as a negotiator. ``It will take some time for the DPRK (North 
Korea) to further reflect on the views I expressed and for us to 
reflect on our visit,'' he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Gilman said, ``North Korea continues to be a  
grave threat to its neighbors, to American troops in the region and 
to U.S. national security interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said North Korea policy must be based on a step-by-step  
program of ``conditional reciprocity'' that is backed by 
strengthened conventional deterrence as well as a missile defense 
system in the region.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler May Up Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler may start including suppliers and  
dealers in its health care coverage as part of a pilot program to 
buy health care services in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker wants to start the program by the end of the year  
with an unspecified number of its suppliers, company officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler will select suppliers and dealers, which  
together represent more than five million workers, to participate 
in the program. That would give DaimlerChrysler more leverage with 
its health care providers in negotiating costs and demanding 
quality improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees from participating companies would not necessarily  
receive the same benefits as DaimlerChrysler workers, but their 
employers would likely save money. 
</P>
<P>
	The program initially would focus on reducing one component of  
the company's rising health care costs, like health maintenance 
organizations or prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs will be asking the automaker for premium increases that  
range from 6 percent to 30 percent when negotiations begin 
Wednesday, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's pharmaceutical costs have risen an average of 15  
percent annually for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler projects its health care tab to jump 7 percent  
this year. The company spends about $1.3 billion on health care for 
its 400,000 U.S. employees, retirees and their dependents.

<HEADLINE> Chain Accused of Selling Old Condoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rite Aid has promised to better educate  
staff about removing expired products from shelves after an 
investigation found California stores had stocked outdated condoms, 
baby formula and infant medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by a consumer's complaint in January, investigators  
found more than 200 outdated products in about 50 of the chain's 
660 stores in California. Some of the condoms were four years past 
their expiration date, Merced County District Attorney Gordon 
Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., is the nation's third-largest  
drugstore chain with more than 3,800 stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors from Merced, Alameda and Santa Barbara counties and  
the city of San Diego filed a consumer protection lawsuit Tuesday 
asking a judge to order Rite Aid to make restitution to victims and 
to pay civil penalties, which could run to $2,500 for each expired 
item sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had no reports of infants falling ill from outdated  
products, but they cautioned that formulas lose their nutritional 
value over time, and that condoms and spermicides lose their 
effectiveness after their expiration dates pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most astounding and disconcerting is that Rite Aid did  
not alert their customers'' -- even as ``they bragged in 
commercials'' that customers were the key to their success, Spencer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid said its policy has always been to pull items off  
shelves 30 days before they expire; last month, that was changed to 
60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Rugen, a Rite Aid spokeswoman, said the company also  
posted signs advising customers that if they purchased expired 
infant formula, it would be replaced with fresh formula free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised and disappointed that a handful of attorneys  
have decided to take this action, despite everything we ... have 
done since we were first informed of the incidents,'' Ms. Rugen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer said the new policy apparently wasn't getting through to  
all Rite Aid stores. 
</P>
<P>
	When prosecutors notified Rite Aid of the expired products in  
February, the company gave written assurances in March that the 
formula had been removed from shelves as of Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequent investigations turned up more expired products as  
recently as May, Spencer said. ``To our knowledge, they have not 
taken any steps to inform their customers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the outdated items include the baby formulas  
Enfamil low iron, Enfamil LactoFree and Similac with iron; Ramses, 
Lifestyle and Sheik condoms; Advil; Clear Blue Easy pregnancy 
tests; and Ortho-Gynol spermicidal jelly.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves on Y2K Litigation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rejected a Y2K litigation measure  
Wednesday that had the blessing of the White House. It also moved 
closer to passing a bill threatened by a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides in the debate said the objective was to blunt what  
many in the business community fear could be a flood of lawsuits 
rising from disruptions caused by the year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	After daylong debate, the Senate defeated, 57-41, a substitute  
bill proposed by Sen. John Kerry that the Massachusetts Democrat 
said would have better protected consumer interests, while winning 
President Clinton's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	That vote put the base bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., on a path toward passage, possibly as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two measures were similar in establishing a 90-day waiting  
period to allow companies to fix computer problems and encourage 
dispute resolution. They also put limits on class action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the McCain bill sets punitive damage caps for  
plaintiffs with 50 or fewer employees, Kerry's measure would have 
eliminated all such caps and exempted individual consumers from the 
limits in the bill. The two measures also differed on language; 
McCain wanted to make most defendants liable only in proportion to 
the damage they cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said that the McCain bill would warrant a  
veto because it takes away too many consumer legal rights to seek 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has agreed to considerable changes in his  
legislation since it cleared his Commerce Committee early this 
year, said he would not abide further compromises: ``This bill must 
not be further emasculated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of  
Commerce, a leading advocate of lawsuit legislation, said the vote 
against Kerry proved that ``senators realize that the thoughtful 
compromise'' McCain had worked out was ``the substantive bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., urged support for Kerry's measure  
because ``we need a bill that the president will sign. Otherwise we 
are just playing politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The McCain measure had the backing of numerous Democrats,  
including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher Dodd of 
Connecticut, who helped insert language limiting punitive damage 
caps to small businesses and ensuring that company directors are 
liable for actions they take that might cause harm to others. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Democrat to speak out against the need for lawsuit  
controls was Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Hollings said 
trial lawyers and punitive damage awards are essential to consumer 
interests in America and linked enthusiasm for a litigation bill to 
the political contributions of the high tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silicon Valley has got the money and people are falling over  
pell-mell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved by voice an amendment by Sen. Wayne Allard,  
R-Colo., to prevent the legislation from preempting state laws that 
take stronger steps to block Y2K litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would have to be reconciled with a House version  
that passed last month and drew greater criticism from the 
administration for sacrificing consumer interests. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 96.

<HEADLINE>  Group: Every Kosovo Albanian Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- International aid agencies are stockpiling  
everything from flour to diapers as they prepare to re-enter a 
Kosovo of burned villages, looted stores and hundreds of thousands 
of uprooted ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are now internally  
displaced people. They will be our priority,'' Anna Di Lellio, a 
spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of the 11-week-old conflict in sight, humanitarian  
agencies are stepping up plans for emergency food, medicine and 
shelter inside Kosovo as well as an orderly return of some 860,000 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, the United Nations refugee agency appealed for nearly  
a quarter-billion dollars to fund Kosovo emergency operations from 
now to the end of the year, saying it expects to help care for 1.5 
million people inside and outside the southern Serb province where 
NATO bombings began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be spending $10 million a week until the end of  
December,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Kukes, a C-130 Hercules transport from the United Arab  
Emirates Air Force landed on a dirt airstrip Tuesday to begin a 
relief shuttle to this key frontier town packed with more than 
100,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The first airlift from the capital of Tirana carried food and  
other aid for the Kukes refugees. But future flights could bring 
supplies as well as NATO troops for the Kosovo operation. Kukes is 
15 miles from the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	Planning by WFP and the UNHCR is based on the assumption that  
most, if not all, refugees will return within three months of a 
peace pact being negotiated now between NATO and Yugoslav 
authorities and the establishment of an international military 
force inside Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But before the first refugees start heading home, WFP estimates  
it will daily have to truck in about 1,000 metric tons of food to 
feed the IDPs, or internally displaced persons. It is also 
considering air drops of food into remoter areas and preparing a 
helicopter to rush aid to the worst IDP cases. 
</P>
<P>
	One million daily ration packets have already sent to Macedonia,  
Greece and Italy for later disbursement in Kosovo, and four movable 
bakeries run by the British agency War Child are preparing to 
distribute freshly baked bread -- a staple of the Kosovo diet -- from 
the back of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a huge problem,'' Di Lellio said. ``We know 50  
percent of the houses have been destroyed. We know businesses have 
been destroyed. People have been scavenging for food for a month. 
We will basically enter a territory without food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest UNHCR plans calls for agencies to provide returnees  
with not only food but kitchen sets, baby kits, school materials, 
blankets, candles and basic material for shelter. Some 15,000 
winterized tents will be sent, in the event more permanent shelters 
cannot be put up by the advent of cold months. 
</P>
<P>
	The WFP and UNHCR will establish offices in seven Kosovo  
locations -- the capital Pristina, Pec, Kosovska, Mitrovica, 
Djakovica, Urosevac and Gnjilane. The UNHCR will initially send 350 
personnel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes House Gun Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bitterly evoking the Colorado school massacre,  
President Clinton accused House Republicans today of pushing a 
watered- down gun-control bill ``plainly ghostwritten'' by the 
National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, internal Republican polling shows strong  
support nationwide for a series of gun-control measures, including 
an increase in the allowable age for handgun purchases from 18 to 
21. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to let the NRA call the shots on this issue,'' the  
president said at an afternoon roundtable discussion with civil 
rights and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the American people care about it, if we can still remember  
Littleton -- it hasn't even been two months -- then we ought to speak 
up and be heard. This is a classic, horrible example of how 
Washington is out of touch with the rest of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' own polls suggested Clinton was striking a  
popular chord as he lobbed the first volley in what promises to be 
a highly charged political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP survey, conducted late last month in the wake of the  
Littleton, Colo., high school shootings, also found lopsided public 
backing for mandatory background checks for gun show sales, safety 
devices for guns and mandatory sentences for felons who commit 
their crimes with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Backing for all these provisions was in the range of 80 percent,  
according to the survey, which was taken for the National 
Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of the House 
GOP. A copy of the survey was made available to The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The material is in circulation at the same time the National  
Rifle Association, a reliable financial backer of Republicans in 
recent campaigns, is mounting a lobbying effort to derail the 
proposed mandatory background check provision. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders reversed course on Tuesday, deciding to send  
the issue directly to the floor next week and bypass the Judiciary 
Committee. ``If you're a member (of Congress) one vote on these 
issues is better than two,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the 
Judiciary Committee chairman, in a reference to the political 
potency of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said the decision by Republicans  
``indicates to me once again that the delay wasn't to go through 
the committee. The delay was to allow the NRA to lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde dismissed that as ``their typical knee-jerk reaction.''  
</P>
<P>
	Officials in both parties said the outcome of the debate is  
unpredictable, given the narrow party breakdown in the House and 
the existence of dissenting blocs within each party. Republicans 
hold 223 seats, and Democrats hold 211, with one Democratic-leaning 
independent. But Democrats say roughly two or three dozen of their 
rank-and-file can be expected to oppose strong gun control 
provisions. A similarly-sized group of Republicans is likely to 
support them. 
</P>
<P>
	One GOP lawmaker, Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, said during  
the day she wanted the House to pass ``what the Senate passed, at a 
minimum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the proposed mandatory background check for all  
gun show purchases; safety locks or other devices to be sold with 
guns; a ban on the importation of high capacity ammunition clips; 
mandatory prison sentences for felons committing crimes with guns, 
and a lifetime ban on gun ownership for any juvenile convicted of a 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure does not contain the provision to raise the  
minimum age for possession of handguns from 18 to 21, and the issue 
appears to divide Republicans in the House. Hyde supports such a 
provision, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., spoke 
favorably of it last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun control debate will play out in the House as a part of a  
broader response to the Littleton shootings. Republicans will bring 
legislation to the floor to crack down on juvenile crime, and gun 
control provisions will be debated as proposed amendments. Terms 
for debate have not been set, but it is possible the GOP leadership 
will call on the House to vote on three or four competing packages 
of gun proposals, without possibility of amending any of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde also will seek votes on a variety of provisions aimed at  
curtailing the violence that youth are exposed to.

<HEADLINE> Miami Eager To End CWS Frustration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Manny Crespo always finds himself torn  
whenever friends or family ask about his College World Series 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	For most college baseball players, even one CWS trip would be a  
career high point. At Miami, it's only a starting point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so bittersweet going there,'' said Crespo, the  
Hurricanes' second baseman, recalling last year's short stay when 
Miami was ousted in three games. ``We had the best team you could 
imagine -- the best hitters, great pitching. To get flattened like 
that was hard to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crespo's words sum up the frustration of the entire Miami  
program over the past half-decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes (46-13), seeded No. 1, begin their sixth  
consecutive CWS appearance against Rice (58-13) in Friday's opening 
round at Omaha, Neb. Only Oklahoma State's seven straight trips 
from 1981-87 is longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's Jim Morris is the only coach to earn a College World  
Series berth in each of his first six seasons at a school. But he 
has yet to win the national title that would put his stamp on the 
program Ron Fraser built into a perennial visitor to Omaha, winning 
two championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten as close as you can get since I've been here,''  
Morris said. ``Now we need to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Morris arrived in 1994, the Hurricanes have been the CWS  
runner-up once, finished third twice and fifth twice. Twice in the 
past three years, though, they came away feeling they should have 
had more. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Hurricanes were one out from celebrating their  
first title since 1985 when Warren Morris won the championship for 
LSU with a ninth-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Miami came to Omaha with an offensive juggernaut. Led  
by top major-league draft pick Pat Burrell and slugger Aubrey Huff, 
the Hurricanes set school records for homers, RBIs, total bases, 
runs per game and slugging percentage. But they managed just eight 
runs in three CWS games, fewer than their single-game average. 
</P>
<P>
	``When those guys couldn't produce for us, it was like, who's  
going to do it?'' Crespo said. 
</P>
<P>
	These Hurricanes won't overwhelm opponents as in previous years,  
but the expectations remain high. Miami has won seven straight 
games and 20 of their past 24, including a three-game roll through 
the Coral Gables regional and a two-game sweep of Wake Forest in 
the super regional. 
</P>
<P>
	That's despite a spate of injuries that forced constant  
juggling. Catcher Russ Jacobson was lost to a forearm injury in 
May. Crespo, third baseman Lale Esquivel and outfielder Mike 
Rodriguez all have missed time. Four pitchers were lost for the 
season, and top starters Alex Santos, Darryl Roque and Darin 
Spassoff each was briefly sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, this is only the second Miami club to hit 100 homers in  
a season and its .335 team batting average is second in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a lot of big guys, but it was a blessing in  
disguise,'' said David Gil, the only starter to make it through the 
year unscathed. ``These guys have experience and they know how to 
produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said these Hurricanes ``believe in a different person  
every day. One day it might be Manny Crespo to get the game-winning 
hit. The next day it'll be another guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, where lesser trophies become janitorial supplies, it  
won't mean much without a championship. This is the place where 
Morris once found the door to the Hurricanes' clubhouse lavatory 
propped open by the 1974 NCAA runner-up trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	If you believe in omens, it took the venerable Fraser six trips  
to the College World Series before he won one. When Morris hears 
this, he breaks into a wide grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really? I didn't realize that,'' he said. ``Hey, anything to  
be compared with Ron Fraser in a positive light.''

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds wanted to come back, and the  
San Francisco Giants needed him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing an intense rehabilitation and returning three weeks  
sooner than expected, Bonds was activated from the disabled list 
Wednesday and was in the lineup against the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven weeks ago he had surgery to remove a bone spur and repair  
a triceps tendon in his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry's a great player for a reason,'' Giants first baseman  
J.T. Snow said. ``A lot of that is God-given talent. The other part 
of that is work ethic and desire. And Barry works hard. He's been 
in here every day working on that elbow. You keep yourself in good 
shape, you bounce back a little faster back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Bonds' first stay on the disabled list as a Giant and  
just the second of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian Sabean said Bonds was determined to get  
back as quickly as possible, but the team and Bonds himself wanted 
to make sure he was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more relief than anxiety,'' Sabean said. ``He wouldn't  
put himself in a danger zone, nor would our medical people even 
think about putting him out there if wasn't able to do what he 
needed to do as an everyday baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bonds returned, the Giants lost right fielder Ellis Burks,  
who took Bonds' place on the disabled list, heightening the team's 
need for Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Burks went on the 15-day DL because of an inflamed right knee.  
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to have Barry back but it feels bad to have  
Ellis out,'' San Francisco manager Dusty Baker said. ``Hopefully, 
in another couple of weeks, we'll be whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Bonds last played April 17 and he underwent  
surgery three days later. He missed 47 games, during which San 
Francisco went 24-22 to stay in the thick of the NL West race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We more than held our own, and we haven't played our best  
baseball yet,'' Sabean said. ``It's a testament to those guys who 
helped us stay afloat and kept us moving forward. It's a long year 
and injuries are part of the game but they should be proud of what 
they've accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Baker: ``Nobody could take the place of Barry but we had  
some guys come through big time in his absence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds had been off to one of the best starts before the injury.  
In the first 12 games of the season, he batted .366 with six 
doubles, four home runs, 12 RBIs, 11 walks and a then NL-leading 
.805 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Burks was hitting .250 with seven home runs and 27 RBIs in 51  
games but had been plagued by sore knees. He had surgery on both 
knees during the winter and missed much of spring training. Burks 
had said he has been bothered by lingering soreness this season.

<HEADLINE> Stars Lament Missed Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The veteran Dallas Stars made a rookie mistake in  
Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals. They got comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, in the first appearance in the championship series,  
passively protected an early one-goal lead instead of aggressively 
trying to extend it, then paid the price when the Buffalo Sabres 
rallied for a 3-2 overtime victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no passion in our game, and to me that is  
unacceptable,'' forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``We've got an older 
team, so we know when we do something wrong. Right now, there's no 
excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull put Dallas ahead 1-0 with a power-play goal midway  
through the first period. The Stars had nine more power plays, 
including the rare benefit of two in overtime, and they struck out 
on all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we'd have gotten a second goal, maybe things would have  
been different,'' forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We've got to make 
more of our opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars went into the third period ahead 1-0, a margin that  
has been good enough this postseason. They had won all five games 
when they were leading after two periods, and with eight former Cup 
winners, things seemed in control. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, they got sloppy. Goalie Ed Belfour was under pressure  
for the first time all game, and Buffalo capitalized with two goals 
in a span of 5:04 to take a 2-1 lead with 6:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
	``The third period was a bad period,'' center Mike Modano said.  
``We got away from our style of play. We lost our edge and let them 
back into the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas went with an empty net with a little over a minute left,  
and the extra skater paid off when Jere Lehtinen scored with 48 
seconds left to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were the more aggressive team in the extra period, but  
again they couldn't find the big play, not even during the four 
minutes they played with the man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what you do with them, not how many you get,'' forward  
Jamie Langenbrunner said. ``And we didn't do anything with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres ended it when Jason Woolley knocked the puck between  
Belfour's legs with 4:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo was playing for the first time in eight days, while  
Dallas was coming off a rough seven-game series against Colorado 
that ended Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Stars refused to blame fatigue for this loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time to worry about being tired,'' Modano  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres credited goalie Dominik Hasek for keeping them in the  
game after the early goal. Dallas players said he got off easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we shot a lot of pucks right at him,'' captain Derian  
Hatcher said. ``Not to take anything away from him, but I don't 
think we forced him to make too many spectacular saves. We have to 
make it tougher on Dominik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't getting second and third chances on him,''  
Langenbrunner said. ``When we did, we didn't put it away on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has an uphill battle if it's going to win the first  
Stanley Cup in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 12 of 60 teams have overcome 1-0 deficits in the finals.  
Buffalo now holds the home-ice advantage, and the Sabres are 7-0 at 
Marine Midland Arena this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had our backs to the wall before,'' Carbonneau said.  
``And we've come through every time.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Are Down / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices fell Wednesday, boosting 30-year  
bond yields above 6 percent to their highest level in 13 months, 
amid growing belief that the Federal Reserve will raise interest 
rates at its meeting later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32  
point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.02 percent from Tuesday's 5.99 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold Treasurys Wednesday to make room for new  
corporate bond sales coming to the market, including a $3 billion 
two- and 10-year deal from Freddie Mac, as well as a $1.5 billion 
five-year deal from Bank of America. The corporate deals put 
pressure on the Treasurys because they usually carry higher yields 
than U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond yields have risen in recent weeks, a signal that investors  
expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates later 
this month. The Fed, which already has adopted a bias toward 
raising interest rates to contain inflation, is scheduled to meet 
on June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Wednesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell between 3/32 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities fell between 9/32 point and 13/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.59 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday's rate to 4.47 
percent. Six-month yields were 4.97 percent, as the discount rose 
0.02 percentage points to 4.78 percent. One-year yields were 5.09 
percent as the discount rose by 0.04 percentage point from late 
Tuesday to 4.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.69 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 19/32 to 120 7/16. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.46 percent, up from 5.43 percent late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Report: NBC To Buy Stake in TiVo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC will announce today it is buying a  
multimillion-dollar stake in TiVo Inc., a firm which markets a 
device that allows television viewers to program their shows and 
skip commercials, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunnyvale-based TiVo Inc. sells a set-top box that gives  
viewers control to pause, rewind and ``instant replay'' live 
television without using a videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and TiVo officials declined to specify the network's cash  
investment, but the Times reported unidentified sources put the 
deal in the millions. With the alliance, NBC will get a prominent 
position on TiVo's electronic programming screen which allows 
viewers to select which programs they want to record. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar to its competitor Replay Networks, TiVo's device diverts  
the TV signal to a high-capacity hard disk for viewers to watch 
when they're ready. The device connects to a telephone line, which 
downloads commands from the company to the set-top boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	While the alliance could potentially pit two competing  
interests, a network which relies on commercials to pay for 
programming and a device which allows viewers to leapfrog through 
the advertisements, an NBC official told the paper that the network 
cannot ignore viewer demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't underestimate the appetite of the American viewer  
for more choice,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC cable and head 
of the network's Internet operations. Rogers is leading the 
investment and joining TiVo's board, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't just sit there and not participate,'' Rogers said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogers also said allowing viewers to record NBC programs and  
watch them when they're ready will allow programmers and 
advertisers to reach larger audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	The TiVo box, which has 14 hours of recording time, has a $499  
initial price tag and about a $10 monthly fee. The Replay box 
starts at $699 for 10 hours of capacity and has no monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2004, 14 million television viewers will be using the  
devices, known as personal video recorders, to control their 
programming, according to Forrester Research analyst Josh Bernoff.

<HEADLINE> New Drugs Blamed in 'Sleep Attacks' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two new drugs for Parkinson's disease may  
cause narcolepsy-like ``sleep attacks,'' according to doctors who 
say eight of their patients were in auto accidents after the drugs 
abruptly put them to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration is talking with the  
manufacturers about whether the drugs need additional warning 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steven Frucht of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New  
York, who reported the eight cases in the journal Neurology, said 
Parkinson's patients should not overreact to the warning and stop 
taking the drugs, which can be very helpful for treating 
Parkinson's symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to discuss this possibility frankly with patients  
before starting this medication,'' advised Frucht, who still 
prescribes the medicines. Patients, he added, should talk with 
their doctors about whether they feel sedated or ever have suffered 
a sleep attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight men taking the drug Mirapex, known chemically as  
pramipexole, suffered sleep attacks while driving that resulted in 
accidents, although none was injured, Frucht reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Four also experienced sleep attacks during business meetings and  
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Six stopped taking Mirapex and two others reduced the dose, and  
the sleep attacks stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	But one former Mirapex patient then switched to a second  
Parkinson's drug called Requip, known chemically as ropinirole, and 
suffered another sleep attack while driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect appears rare: Over 100,000 Americans take these  
drugs, and the FDA said it knew of no additional cases. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``unless you ask, many patients won't report this,'' Frucht  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the FDA approved Mirapex and Requip in 1997, it noted on  
the drugs' labels that they occasionally cause drowsiness, and 
driving is not a good idea until patients have taken the medicines 
long enough to tell if they are susceptible. 
</P>
<P>
	But that drowsy feeling that even over-the-counter drugs like  
antihistamines often cause is very different from a sleep attack, 
said Frucht, describing the attacks as overwhelming and 
irresistible sleepiness that comes on without warning. 
</P>
<P>
	How long patients must take the drugs to see if they will be  
affected is questionable, he added. Frucht noted that the eight 
patients who had car wrecks had taken the medicines anywhere from 
one month to 14 months before the sleep attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``A sleep attack is for all intents and purposes meaningless if  
you're sitting in front of the TV,'' Frucht said. ``But they're 
driving on the highway. The next thing they knew they'd hit the car 
next to them, or the passenger screamed at them that they're going 
off the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frucht and colleagues at three Parkinson's centers alerted the  
drugs' manufacturers -- Pharmacia &AMP; UpJohn for Mirapex and 
SmithKline Beecham for Requip -- to the eight patients they treated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia &AMP; UpJohn said it is investigating whether the patients  
just were drowsy from the drugs and driving made it worse, or if 
they indeed experienced the abrupt attacks Frucht described. If so, 
the next question is whether the patients took additional 
medications that interacted with the Parkinson's drug to cause the 
sleep attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 500,000 and 1.5 million Americans have Parkinson's,  
which causes progressive muscle rigidity, tremors and difficulty 
moving as they slowly lose a vital brain chemical called dopamine. 
Mirapex and Requip work by mimicking dopamine.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Are Mixed; Dow down 12.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as  
investors continued their watch on inflation and its effect on the 
bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 12.45 at 3,412.38. The blue-chip index lost 143.74 points on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 5.08 at 1,322.41, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 25.70 at 2,500.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to hold  
off inflation have rattled the stock and bond markets in recent 
weeks. On Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond briefly 
broke through the psychologically important 6 percent barrier, and 
held there this morning as prices continued to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
	A yield of 6 percent makes bonds more attractive to investors  
because at that level, they offer a more stable, guaranteed return 
than volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say stocks may have trouble picking up momentum at  
least until Friday, when the government will report on producer 
prices. The report is expected to offer the latest suggestion of 
whether inflation has indeed crept into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble led the Dow lower, slipping 1 1/8 to 93 11/16. The  
company announced a restructuring that will eliminate 15,000 jobs 
and close 10 plants worldwide over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest rose 1 13/16 to 45 1/8 on the Nasdaq amid speculation that it  
will be acquired by BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 77.9 million 
shares, well behind Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.32 at 632.09, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.82 at 773.74. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.04 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.3 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Trump, Maples Officially Divorced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With a judge's signature, actress Marla Maples  
became the ex-wife of Donald Trump today. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's divorce was granted on the grounds that the two had  
lived apart for more than a year, a valid reason under New York 
law, said Maples' lawyer, William Beslow. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, 52, filed for divorce from Maples, 35, three months after  
they separated in mid-1997. Proceedings were stalled after Maples 
decided to fight a prenuptial agreement that gave her about $2 
million in the event of a divorce. She threw in the towel last 
week, leading a judge to sign the divorce decree Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After giving Donald two years to honor the verbal commitments  
he made to me during our 12-year relationship, I decided to walk 
away completely under the terms of the prenuptial agreement that 
had been placed before me just five days before our 1993 wedding,'' 
Maples said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Maples' $2 million settlement was a far cry from the more than  
$25 million that Trump's first wife, Ivana, got in her divorce 
settlement after nearly 15 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Maples, who had a daughter by Trump two months before they  
married in December 1993, said she signed the premarital agreement 
without reading it. Trump gave her ``verbal commitments'' to pay 
``substantially in excess of'' the prenuptial agreement, Beslow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Maples endured a scandal as ``the other woman'' for  
dating Trump while he was still married, and because she stood by 
him when he was nearly bankrupt, the prenuptial agreement is 
``unfair,'' Beslow said.

<HEADLINE> Dept.'s Espionage Review Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said  
Wednesday he has turned over an internal investigation into 
mishandling of the China espionage case to the department's 
inspector general, delaying its release for at least 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited review of the Energy Department's response to  
the alleged theft of nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos nuclear 
weapons laboratory in New Mexico had been expected to be released 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``More questions need to be asked. ... I want to do this right.  
Careers are at stake,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has said the mishandling of the case involving a  
three-year espionage investigation of a Los Alamos scientist would 
result in firings and demotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be disciplining. There will be terminations,''  
Richardson reiterated Wednesday, speaking to reporters after a 
three-hour appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richardson said a draft of the internal report given to him  
on Monday ``did not effectively or adequately deal'' with the 
actions of personnel at the agency's headquarters in Washington. He 
said he had accepted findings involving Los Alamos employees, but 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've now asked the inspector general's office to do a  
comprehensive report that will be due in 30 days,'' he told 
reporters. Richardson refused to discuss whose job might be in 
jeopardy or whether any senior officials, still at the department, 
might be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal investigation has focused on why a Los Alamos  
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was allowed to keep his top-secret job and 
access to the country's most sensitive nuclear secrets while under 
investigation by the FBI since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was fired last March for security violations. He has not  
been charged with a crime and has denied giving secrets to China or 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the FBI informed senior Energy Department officials on  
several occasions that Lee's transfer to a less sensitive job would 
not jeopardize the espionage investigation. But that information 
was not relayed clearly to Los Alamos managers. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal investigation has sought to determine the reason  
for what Richardson has called a ``communications breakdown'' 
involving the Lee case. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the report is examining charges by a DOE  
intelligence officer, Notra Trulock, that he had been blocked by 
former Deputy Energy Secretary Elizabeth Moler from making concerns 
of lax security and the Lee espionage case known to then-Energy 
Secretary Frederico Pena and to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler, who has since left the department, has denied any such  
interference. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock in late May was given a $10,000 Energy Department award  
for his persistence in exposing the security problems. Richardson 
said Wednesday, ``He's a member of my team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in testimony before the Senate Intelligence  
Committee, Richardson argued Wednesday against a Senate proposal 
for a largely autonomous agency within the Energy Department to 
oversee the government's nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would create a Nuclear Security Administration that  
would have authority over its own budget within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., said the measure would ``ensure the  
safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal'' by providing 
clear lines of authority and accountability without interference 
from other offices of the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson called the proposal ``a step toward military control  
of nuclear weapons development'' that said it would undermine his 
attempt to gain more control over the nuclear labs including 
security and counterintelligence activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need any more fiefdoms at the Department of Energy,''  
Richardson said.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Agbayani Injured in BP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets sensation Benny Agbayani bruised  
his right eye in batting practice Tuesday when he hit a ball off 
the cage and it bounced back into his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips said X-rays were negative and  
showed only a contusion. Agbayani is day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good news,'' Phillips said. ``He has no blurred  
vision. There is a little swelling on the bottom part of his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani will undergo a CT scan on Thursday to make sure there  
is no fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	The batting cage the Mets use is three years old, and Phillips  
said the team will add padding to make sure this doesn't happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Agbayani was replaced in the starting lineup by Roger Cedeno.  
Agbayani was hitting .409 with eight homers and 15 RBIs in 66 
at-bats.

<HEADLINE> On Show: Diego Rivera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Diego Rivera revolutionized art with his  
sprawling, political murals in his native Mexico. But his body of 
work shows more nuanced -- and perhaps surprising -- examples that 
draw on surrealist and cubist styles rarely exhibited outside his 
inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
	Those works and others appear in the first U.S. retrospective of  
the Mexican artist in more than a decade at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. The exhibit showcases Rivera's often overlooked 
talent for drawing and portraiture, and for cubism, surrealism and 
other art movements. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the surprises include delicate and intimate pencil  
drawings and pointillist-technique paintings in which Rivera used 
spots of colors similar in style to French painter Georges Seurat. 
Also on display are the works for which Rivera is renowned -- Indian 
girls and women with ribboned and braided hair holding calla 
lilies, and his heroically proportioned portrayals of common people 
such as ``The Tortilla Maker'' in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution'' follows the highly  
successful Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso exhibits at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art. With the advertising support from 
Spanish-language media, the exhibit promises to be another 
blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rivera's magic, emotion and artistic skill transcend all  
languages and cultures and provide a background against which we 
can truly appreciate Mexico's contributions to modern culture,'' 
said Patricia Ramos, spokeswoman for KMEX-TV, which is advertising 
the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The mention of ``Revolution'' in the exhibit's title is not only  
a nod to Rivera's leftist politics and socialist ideals in his 
murals but an homage to Rivera's part in the modern art movement. 
He gives his own touch to the flattened, geometric, puzzle-like 
look of cubist painting, a 20th-century style made famous by 
Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zapatista Landscape (The Guerrilla)'' of 1915 is considered  
Rivera's cubist masterpiece. It shows Mexican revolutionary 
Emiliano Zapata with a serape and rifle. The serape and colors of 
Mexico's flag appear again in three other cubist works. 
</P>
<P>
	The fantastic and sometimes nightmarish world of surrealism is  
more connected to the names Salvador Dali and Frida Kahlo, one of 
Rivera's four wives. He married and divorced Kahlo twice. The Los 
Angeles exhibit features only one easel painting of her, a 1939 
portrait, which was a promised gift to the museum from Bernard 
Lewin and his late wife, Edith. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera's surrealist work is often sensuous and hilarious. His  
1947 ``Temptations of St. Anthony'' uses radishes in erotic poses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bilingual exhibit of 100 paintings, prints and drawings goes  
through Aug. 16. It is the first major retrospective in the United 
States of Rivera's work in 13 years and a first for Los Angeles, 
said Lynn Zelevansky, the museum's contemporary art curator. Many 
of the works were long kept in private collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The show debuted at the Cleveland Museum of Art in February and  
will go to the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in September and the 
Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit has special resonance in Los Angeles, where  
Mexican-Americans are more than 40 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diego Rivera helped others know Mexico at the time,'' said  
Augustin Arteaga, director of the Museum of the Palace of Fine Arts 
in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Diego Maria Rivera in Guanajuato, Mexico, in 1886, his  
talents were profound enough to secure a place at the national arts 
school at age 11. At 20, he left to study in Spain. He returned to 
Mexico after 15 years and, for the next decade, was part of what 
some call the Mexican Renaissance. He died in Mexico City in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	His circle of friends included Picasso and Piet Mondrian,  
composer Aaron Copland, actors Charlie Chaplin and Paulette 
Goddard, and titans of U.S. industry such as the Fords and 
Rockefellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his paintings reflect these friendships. ``Nocturnal  
Landscape'' shows peasants in trees illuminated by an unearthly 
glow.They are villagers watching director John Huston and star 
Humphrey Bogart filming ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the preview, filmmaker Jay Dunn picked out his favorite  
Rivera, a 1942 work called ``Seller of Calla Lilies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the colors. It just sort of glows. I love the way her  
feet are folded,'' he said. ``To me that is just so peaceful, so 
warm and simple.''

<HEADLINE> Banks Ready for Interest-Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Banks are prepared for the possibility of  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan raising U.S. interest 
rates, leaders said Wednesday at the conclusion of the three-day 
International Monetary Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan held a closed-door panel discussion with some of his  
international counterparts, including European Central Bank 
President Willem F. Duisenberg and the heads of the Bank of 
England, Bank of Japan, Deutsche Bundesbank and Bank of France. 
Greenspan and the others declined to comment publicly about the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas ``Sandy'' Warner III, chairman of J.P. Morgan, told  
reporters afterward that he expected a Federal Reserve interest 
rate hike as early as the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said he feared that the U.S. economy may be growing too  
fast compared with the rest of the world, and that higher interest 
rates could rein in the growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoh Kurosawa, board chairman of the Industrial Bank of Japan,  
cited a need for regulatory stability after a turmoil-filled year 
that has included Russian and Brazilian economic crises, hedge fund 
problems, war in Kosovo, the birth of the Euro and launching of the 
European Central Bank since the IMC met last June in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it most significant for us now to reconfirm the  
mission and the role of the central banks,'' Kurosawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillermo Ortiz, governor of the Banco de Mexico in Mexico City,  
sounded a cautionary note, saying Federal Reserve action could 
threaten the success of monetary policy measures that were 
beginning to succeed in slowing Mexico's inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on track towards achieving our 13 percent inflation  
target,'' Ortiz said in remarks released after a Tuesday panel 
discussion. ``This gloomy, but better-than-expected, regional 
outlook could be threatened by ... the possibility of a U.S. 
monetary tightening, given the dependence of Latin American 
countries on capital inflows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The yearly conference was started by big U.S. banks in the 1950s  
as a forum ``where they could talk candidly with their counterparts 
in banks outside of the U.S.,'' according to the American Bankers 
Association, which helps organize the meetings.

<HEADLINE> Cox, MP3.com Plan Music Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cox Interactive Media Inc. and MP3.com Inc. today  
announced a joint venture to create and operate a number of 
music-related Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox Interactive Media, which operates a network of 30 local Web  
sites, will invest $45 million in MP3.com, one of the leaders in 
online music distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies will make equal investments in the joint  
venture, according to a statement released by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, David E. Easterly, president and chief  
operating officer of Cox Enterprises Inc., will join MP3.com's 
board of directors. Cox Enterprises Inc., based in Atlanta, is the 
parent company of Cox Interactive Media. 
</P>
<P>
	MP3.com, based in San Diego, Calif., offers a music catalog with  
more than 56,000 songs by 11,000 artists that can be downloaded for 
free. The music is stored in a file format called MP3, which offers 
near-CD quality sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry has blamed MP3 technology for increased  
song piracy, and Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment 
have recently teamed up with software companies to develop secure 
methods of selling and distributing music online. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some recording artists have signaled a growing  
acceptance of MP3 technology. MP3.com is sponsoring a summer 
concert tour featuring Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Warns of World Economy Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is threatening to set off a  
devastating chain-reaction of trade protectionism by pushing ahead 
with a bill to sharply limit foreign steel shipments into the 
United States, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivering what is expected to be one of his last speeches as a  
member of President Clinton's Cabinet, Rubin said he was worried 
about demands for the erection of trade barriers in the United 
States and a retreat from further integrating the United States 
into the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our country, some argue that we should turn inward and  
retreat from the world,'' Rubin said in a speech to the Bretton 
Woods Committee, a group that supports international lending 
agencies such as the World Bank. ``I believe ... just the opposite 
-- that we turn inward at our peril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he was particularly concerned by a House-passed  
measure that would impose quotas on shipments of foreign steel into 
the United States. U.S. steel companies argue that without 
increased protection from cheap imported steel, they will be forced 
to lay off thousands of American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin and others in the administration contend that the bill is  
clearly in violation of global trading rules administered by the 
World Trade Organization and would trigger copycat protectionist 
moves by other countries against American exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure passed the House by a 289-141 vote in March, and  
Senate supporters are hoping for a vote in the full Senate later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Rubin said ``that bill could well pass the  
Senate, and such action in the strongest major economy in the world 
creates a real risk of strengthening the already increased 
protectionist pressure being felt around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said congressional approval of the quotas ``could set off  
a wave of market-access restrictions'' around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Rubin, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, one of the  
supporters of the steel quota measure, said, ``Free trade does not 
mean free to subsidize, free to dump or free to distort the market. 
Ohio Valley steel has suffered long enough from dumping. Senate 
action is long overdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's comments marked the second effort by a top economic  
policy-maker to blunt rising protectionist pressures spawned by a 
U.S. trade deficit that has soared to record levels because of the 
global currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned in two major  
speeches in recent weeks that increased protectionism threatens the 
prosperity Americans are now enjoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing Greenspan's comments, Rubin said, ``We must broaden  
understanding of our stake in the global economy. That 
understanding is not broadly shared among the American people and 
... the voices of those advocating that we turn inward are growing 
more numerous and getting stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the finance ministers of the world's seven richest  
industrial countries will take up a U.S.-supported agenda for 
overhauling the global financial architecture during meetings 
Saturday in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	That session will lay the groundwork for discussions by Clinton  
and the other countries' leaders at their annual economic summit 
June 18-20 in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the proposals being put forward to prevent or at  
least better handle future Asian-style currency crises represented 
``not a dramatic single initiative of some sort, but a powerful 
program of measures to be implemented and improved upon over 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These measures have focused in such areas as improving the  
quality of economic data released by developing countries so 
foreign investors are not caught off guard, as they were in Asian 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said the economic summit would also focus on  
reconstruction needs in the Balkans and proposals to reduce debt 
levels of the world's poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> Father Thrown Out of Kid's Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- The father of Australian tennis  
player Jelena Dokic was ejected from his daughter's match after 
shouting at officials. He later was arrested for jumping on a car, 
lying on the road and blocking traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Dokic had been drinking and was arrested ``for his  
own safety.'' He was not charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Damir Dokic was removed from the grounds by security guards at  
the DFS Classic at Edgbaston on Tuesday, and banned from the rest 
of the Wimbledon warmup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament officials said the 40-year-old Aussie was wrestled to  
the ground while hundreds of spectators looked on after he had 
shouted abuse at tennis officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Dokic, of Serbian heritage, also shouted insults  
in apparent reference to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he went out of the match he went on a little rampage,  
lying down in the street and blocking traffic and jumping on the 
hood of a car,'' WTA Tour spokesman Joe Favorito said today. ``He 
was apparently lying in front of traffic babbling about how good 
Australia was and how bad England was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspector Bob Peebles of the West Midlands police department  
said Dokic was held in custody for about three hours and ``released 
without charges when he sobered up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTA Tour said: ``Mr Dokic's conduct will be closely  
monitored and further incidents at any time could result in an 
extension of the ban or the revocation of any or all privileges at 
future WTA Tour events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conduct of players' parents has been a major issue for the  
women's tour in recent years. Jim Pierce, father of Mary Pierce, 
was banned from the tour from 1993-98 for what officials said was 
abusive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Jelena Dokic, 17, is ranked No. 137 in the world and is regarded  
as a promising young player on the WTA Tour. She won the U.S. Open 
junior title last year and finished 1998 as the world's top-ranked 
junior. She turned pro in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Jelena Dokic's first-round match Tuesday against Rita Grande of  
Italy was suspended because of rain with Dokic leading the third 
set 2-1. When play resumed Wednesday, Grande rallied to win 2-6, 
6-3, 9-7.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Order Targets Race Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton instructed federal law  
agencies Wednesday to collect race and gender data on people they 
stop or arrest, in a move to end racial profiling by police. ``It 
is wrong, it is destructive, and it must stop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said at meeting of police and civil rights activists  
that while his executive order would cover ``only a fraction'' of 
the nation's law officers, he hoped it would spur state and local 
agencies to begin collecting such data, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have an obligation to move beyond anecdotes to find out  
exactly who is being stopped and why,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police shootings this year have killed young blacks in New York,  
Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif., and traffic stops based on a 
driver's race -- an occurrence known casually as ``driving while 
black'' -- have prompted a national outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury, Justice and Interior departments will develop,  
within 120 days, a plan for collecting data on the race, gender and 
ethnicity of people agency officers stop to question or arrest. 
Field tests on those plans would begin within 60 days after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Shuford, the American Civil Liberties Union's lead  
attorney on racial profiling cases, said Clinton's order would have 
``a domino effect'' at the state and local levels, and would 
alleviate the problem in federal jurisdictions wherever it arises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever you have a predominantly white environment and there  
are people of color, they're going to be scrutinized beyond what is 
necessary. So if it's in a park, yes, it could happen in the Park 
Service,'' Shuford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton's order ... confirms what people of color have said  
for a long time, and it starts the process of getting documentation 
to support those allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also voiced support for legislation by Rep. John  
Conyers, D-Mich., to provide funds for states to collect similar 
data. Law enforcement officials generally have resisted such 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our opinion on this hasn't changed,'' said Robert Scully,  
executive director of the National Association of Police 
Organizations, which represents 4,000 police groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are laws on the books for people who feel they are being  
harassed, and vehicles for them to file complaints,'' Scully said 
Wednesday. ``It would be better to invest more time in the laws 
already on the books rather than add another burden to law 
enforcement officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's order covers federal officers such as the police who  
patrol national parks, and the Customs agents and Immigration and 
Naturalization officials monitoring U.S. ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service is facing a class-action lawsuit by nearly  
100 black women who say they were singled out for searches because 
of their race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials said 50,892 of 71.5 million international air  
travelers were subjected to a body search, mainly simple pat-downs, 
during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and Hispanic travelers were subjected to 43 percent of  
body searches last year, according to an analysis presented to 
Congress earlier this year by a Cornell University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has appointed a panel to  
review policies and procedures used by Customs inspectors; a report 
is expected in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., is planning to introduce  
legislation that would require detained travelers have access to a 
lawyer within 24 hours, and that a magistrate approve any detention 
that lasts longer than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said legislation is necessary because Clinton's order does  
not address the civil liberties issues behind Customs detentions. 
He said he is responding to media reports which showed blacks made 
up 90 percent of passengers X-rayed for drugs at Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport, while only 20 percent of detained blacks 
were found to be carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recounted how he once asked a group of black journalists  
how many of them had ever been stopped by police ``in their minds 
for no reason other than the color of their skin.'' All of them 
raised their hands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of Congress can tell this story. Students. Professors.  
Even off-duty police officers can tell this story,'' Clinton said. 
``No person of color is immune from such humiliating experiences.''

	NATO Ambassadors Approve Peace Deal  
</P>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO ambassadors quickly approved the  
peace deal signed Wednesday by NATO and Yugoslavian generals, 
Secretary-General Javier Solana said after a late-night meeting in 
Brussels. The alliance will suspend the bombing of Yugoslavia as 
soon as Serb troops begin to withdraw from Kosovo, Solana said. In 
Belgrade and the Kosovo capital Pristina, people celebrated by 
firing weapons in the air and honking horns. Refugees in northern 
Albania embraced one another when they heard news of the agreement. 
A Serb official said Belgrade would begin withdrawing its forces 
Thursday.

<P>
	Skepticism Greets Kosovo Agreement  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid growing expectations of peace, President  
Clinton welcomed Yugoslavia's troop withdrawal agreement Wednesday 
but said NATO ``will watch carefully'' to see if Serb troops leave 
war-shattered Kosovo peacefully. The Pentagon said a bombing pause 
could come within 24 hours. ``If the Serbs live up to what they 
have signed, this will end the killing and begin the peace,'' 
Defense Secretary William Cohen said. He said ``NATO will pause and 
then end its air campaign'' if the Serbs pull out on schedule. The 
United States has promised to contribute 7,000 troops to a 
50,000-member peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Some troops stationed 
on ships docked in Greece are expected to disembark and begin 
moving toward Macedonia early Thursday.

<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- A sightseeing helicopter crashed into a  
glacier today, killing all seven people aboard. The helicopter went 
down with six tourists and a pilot near Herbert Glacier, 20 miles 
north of the popular tourist destination of Juneau. The cause had 
yet to be determined. The weather was cloudy in Juneau, and fog was 
also present. Tourists frequently hire helicopters to view the 
area's spectacular glaciers, forests and fjords.

	Study: Stroke Drug's Effects Linger

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TPA, a lifesaving drug that has revolutionized  
emergency-room treatment of strokes, isn't just a short-term fix. A 
study found that patients treated with TPA within three hours after 
a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain are less likely to be 
severely disabled a year afterward. The findings are to be 
published in tomorrow's New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. 
Thomas G. Kwiatkowski of Long Island Jewish Medical Center and 
doctors at eight other hospitals around the country.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rallied but failed to lift the  
broader market today as the threat of higher interest rates kept 
investors on edge and alert to changes in bond market yields. The 
Dow Jones industrial average ended down 75.35 at 10,690.29. On the 
NYSE, losers led gainers 1,556-1,389. The Nasdaq composite index, 
which includes a large number of technology stocks, rose 31.90 to

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds returned from a seven-week stay  
on the disabled list and immediately showed his trademark defensive 
flair with a nice running catch, but the Anaheim Angels still 
managed a 2-1 win over San Francisco today. Bonds was cold at the 
plate, going hitless in four at-bats as Tim Belcher limited the 
Giants to one run in eight innings.

<HEADLINE> Dog, Cat Fur Products May Be Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Selling or making products with dog or cat fur  
should be a federal crime, two members of Congress said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., and Rep. Jerry Kleczka, D-Wis., are  
introducing legislation that calls for a maximum $25,000 fine or up 
to a year in prison for people convicted of manufacturing, 
transporting or selling clothing, toys or other items made with the 
fur or skins of dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that pets are being killed in the United  
States for their fur, but DNA tests on furs have confirmed that 
products made with dog or cat hair have been sold in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Although slaughtering the animals for their fur or their meat is  
a common practice overseas, it is not acceptable in the United 
States, Roth and Kleczka said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important occasion, one that runs to the heart  
of who we are and what we hold dear and meaningful in our lives,'' 
Roth said as Colby, Kleczka's pet Sheltie, barked at reporters 
attending a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a special relationship between men and children and  
their family pets -- but especially their dogs and cats,'' Roth 
said. ``No matter where in the world this merchandise is made, 
there will be no legitimate market for it here. ... I want to 
ensure that the U.S. market does not encourage the slaughter of 
dogs or cats for their fur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Roth, Kleczka and officials of the  
Humane Society of the United States displayed two stuffed cats made 
with cat hair, a coat trimmed in dog hair and a full-length woman's 
coat made of hair from tabby cats. 
</P>
<P>
	The fur also can be found in gloves, fur linings and insoles for  
shoes and boots. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2 million dogs and cats are killed each year --  
often in inhumane ways -- primarily in China and other Asian 
countries for the international fur trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers of clothing often are unaware that their purchases  
include dog and cat hair because they are intentionally mislabeled 
with exotic ``fantasy names'' -- such as Asian jackal, sobaki, 
wildcat, goyangi and katzenfelle -- to make them more attractive to 
American consumers, said Richard Swain Jr., the Humane Society's 
vice president for investigative services. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-month investigation by the Humane Society revealed that  
some of the products had been sold to Burlington Coat Factory, to 
the surprise of the company's officials, Swain, a former police 
officer, said. Since then, the company has joined the group 
campaigning against the products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Humane Society investigators also discovered that dog and cat  
fur sometimes is dyed and processed to resemble fur from other 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-years of police work did not prepare me for what I saw  
in China,'' Swain said. ``The suffering of the dogs and cats who 
are killed for their fur was horrible to witness and is something I 
will never forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Roth and Kleczka bills would require that all fur or  
fur-lined products be labeled accurately, regardless of their cost. 
The Humane Society also said current U.S. laws are ineffective 
because they generally do not apply to products that costs less 
than $150.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Scrutinizes Calif. Gun Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis, hoping to keep guns  
owned by the state from reaching the streets, has asked state 
agencies to tell him how they get rid of thousands of old weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who has already ordered the Corrections Department to  
stop selling used and damaged guns to gun dealers, wants to know 
how other agencies dispose of their old or outdated weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration then will decide how to proceed, his office  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor does not want to exacerbate a problem by having  
guns going from state agencies to individuals who then put them on 
California streets,'' spokesman Michael Bustamante said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, the Corrections Department has sold about  
1,600 of its old weapons but had halted the practice before Davis' 
order to cease sales. However, at least three other state agencies 
have sold or traded guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Highway Patrol traded 4,046 confiscated rifles,  
pistols and handguns last July to a private dealer for new service 
weapons. The April massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo., has focused attention on the number of guns on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a lot of latitude under the law, and we thought,  
`Hey, let's just trade some of them,' and it obviously backfired,'' 
CHP Deputy Commissioner Bill Carlson said. ``What happened in 
Colorado really drove up the sensitivity about guns. ... If 
something happened with one of those guns, it would be horrible.''

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Defends Slow Vote Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian election officials insisted  
today there was nothing sinister about the extra time it was taking 
to count votes from the country's first democratic election in 44 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But election observers and opposition parties were not so sure,  
especially given Indonesia's long history of vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the polls closed Monday, only 5.3 percent of the  
113 million ballots had been tabulated, raising suspicion over the 
fairness of the result. Before the election, officials promised to 
have half the votes counted by late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Election officials blamed the delays on laborious checks against  
cheating, their own lack of experience and logistical challenges in 
a nation of 210 million people and 13,000 islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to understand that across the country, we have workers  
who are not capable of doing speedy work,'' said Rudini, chairman 
of the General Election Commission, or KPU. ``There is no political 
background to the delays. The election commission has opted for 
accuracy, not speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudini, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.  
</P>
<P>
	Election officials also noted that 60 percent of the votes were  
cast in rural or remote villages without fax machines or computers 
to relay counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign observers, who reported Monday that the election  
appeared to go smoothly with only scattered irregularities, were 
more cautious today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely concerned about the slowness with which the  
count has taken place,'' said John G. Morgan, head of a team of 
monitors from the European Union. ``We also have reports of 
discrepancies in the vote tallies. If this is true, it will cast 
grave doubt on the whole process. The slowness itself engenders 
mistrust and doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Carter and the Washington-based National  
Democratic Institute for International Affairs issued a joint 
statement saying that while the election was ``largely peaceful and 
free of violence,'' the counting process should be expedited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing delays could give rise to confusion and tensions  
among contestants and the public,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the reform party of opposition leader Megawati  
Sukarnoputri was leading in the early results, it criticized the 
count. Laksamana Sukardi, the treasurer of Megawati's Indonesian 
Democratic Party for Struggle, said the delay might mean 
vote-rigging was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of results had begun to dampen some of the enthusiasm  
for Monday's peaceful election. Turnout was more than 96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta stock market, which had jumped 12.2 percent Tuesday  
on the peaceable balloting, fell 1.4 percent today. The nation's 
currency, the rupiah, fell 2.6 percent against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, supporters of the ruling Golkar Party demonstrated  
today for faster vote tabulation and four dozen students demanded 
an independence referendum for Aceh province, where a violent 
separatist movement led many people to stay away from the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote will determine 462 of Parliament's 500 seats. The rest  
will go to appointees of the powerful military, which cannot vote. 
The legislators will join 200 government appointees in choosing a 
new president in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's vote was the first since former President Suharto  
resigned in May 1998 amid riots and pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's only open election was in 1955, just after the  
country gained independence. Elections held since were largely 
rigged in favor of government candidates.

<HEADLINE> US Didn't Obtain Lab Visit Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department has not been following  
its own rules for licensing visits to its nuclear weapons labs by 
foreign nationals who come in contact with sensitive information, 
the department's inspector general says. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspector General Gregory H. Friedman found that the U.S.  
sponsors of the visits -- who are responsible for requesting the 
licenses -- often fail to do so because of confusing regulations, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday, was  
prepared for a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A special House committee last month detailed a 20-year campaign  
by China to steal nuclear secrets and criticized lax security at 
the Energy Department laboratories visited by the foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department, in a response attached to the inspector  
general's findings, said it is updating its export guidelines, 
which ``will, among other things, clarify requirements'' for the 
laboratory visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new policy will clarify where export control review  
responsibility lies ... and ensure that consideration of export 
license requirements is part of the visits and assignments 
process,'' the response said. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``deemed export license'' is required for visits by foreign  
nationals who might gain access to information or technology that 
would require a license if shipped to the foreign country. Examples 
are information that could have a dual military and civilian use, 
and technologies that are regulated by the State Department through 
placement on a ``munitions list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report reviewed the license system for visits of at least 30  
days to four Energy Department laboratories: Los Alamos and Sandia 
in New Mexico; Lawrence Livermore in California, and Oak Ridge in 
Tennessee. The report did not consider whether the foreigners 
should have been at the labs in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman found that neither Energy Department nor Commerce  
Department guidance ``was clear regarding when a deemed export 
license would be required for an assignment involving a foreign 
national.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors of the visitors, known as ``hosts,'' were relied  
upon to determine whether there were export concerns raised by the 
visit -- but ``several hosts were not aware of, or did not 
understand, the requirements,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found ... that 13 of the 17 hosts we interviewed said that  
they were not responsible for making this determination,'' Friedman 
found. ``In addition, when asked who certifies that no license is 
required, four of the 17 hosts said that they did not know or were 
not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the uncertainty over the need for licenses, five hosts  
at Oak Ridge said the six foreign nationals they were hosting were 
affiliated with a nuclear facility or ``nuclear end-user in their 
home countries,'' the report said. ``However, none of these hosts 
had considered applying for deemed export licenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A contractor at Livermore told investigators that lab employees  
``routinely struggle to try to determine if and when a deemed 
export license might be required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said their names were officially listed as the hosts of  
record, but the actual sponsors were others. In one case a Chinese 
national was the actual host of another Chinese national, despite a 
requirement that the host should be a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an advisory board said in a report Tuesday that the  
continuation of the Energy Department's foreign visitor program 
``is invaluable to this country'' and should be continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``International scientific collaborations with foreign  
governments and scientists for research and development ... support 
the department's diverse mission areas of national security, energy 
resources, science and environmental quality,'' said the Secretary 
of Energy Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in March had asked the advisory  
panel to examine the issue of foreign visitor exchanges involving 
the government's research laboratories.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers assistant general  
manager John Blackwell has been relieved of his duties, club 
president and general manager Bob Clarke said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our feeling that we have three people and really only  
enough work for two people to divide,'' said Clarke. ``The work 
that John was doing, which he did very well, will be passed on to a 
couple of other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell had spent the previous nine seasons as assistant  
general manager of the Flyers and was involved in training camp 
preparation, scouting supervision and staff training. Blackwell 
came to the Flyers after 18 years with the Edmonton Oilers.

<HEADLINE> Indoor Football Player Paralyzed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Chris Beard, a former LSU player now a  
defensive back in the Indoor Professional Football League, is 
paralyzed and on a respirator after being hurt in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Beard injured his neck while making a tackle for the Bayou Beast  
Saturday night against Texas and underwent surgery Monday, said 
Beast general manager-coach Ted Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Beard cannot move his arms or legs, cannot speak and is on a  
respirator in the intensive care unit of Our Lady of the Lake 
Hospital, Knapp said. Beard was listed in guarded condition 
Wednesday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knapp said Beard has full movement in his shoulder and full  
movement in his neck and head. When not on pain or sleeping 
medication, he recognizes everyone and is comfortable, according to 
Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our information was there was no severance of the spinal cord,  
but severe trauma, which is good news,'' Knapp said.

<P>
 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	 *In the spotlight:* Greg Kinnear, born June 17, 1964.  
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Kinnear was born in Logansport, Ind., the son  
of a State Department diplomat. He grew up in Logansport, 
Washington, D.C., Beirut and Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinnear hosted ``School Daze With Greg Kinnear'' on Armed Forces  
Radio while he was a high school student in Athens. He studied 
broadcast journalism at the University of Arizona and expected, 
Kinnear has said, ``to have a respectable career in television 
news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he found work in acting and as a game-show host before  
signing on as a reporter for Movietime, forerunner to E! 
Entertainment Television. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinnear lost his job when Movietime was sold. He hosted the  
short-lived ``Best of the Worst,'' a celebration of the ridiculous 
and inane in American culture, on Fox television. Then E! rehired 
him for ``Talk Soup.'' Kinnear later moved to NBC to host ``Later 
With Greg Kinnear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Acting Roles:* Kinnear appeared in ``Murder in Mississippi''  
and ``Based on an Untrue Story,'' both TV films. His acting skills 
didn't attract media attention until he appeared in Sydney 
Pollack's 1995 remake of ``Sabrina.'' Starring roles in ``Dear 
God'' and ``A Smile Like Yours'' followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinnear was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ``As Good As  
It Gets'' with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. He appeared in 
``You've Got Mail,'' starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Upcoming Films:* ``Nurse Betty,'' a comedy about a widow's  
post-traumatic obsession with a soap star, and ``Mystery Men,'' the

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Cos. Accuse Philip Morris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Three cigarette companies urged a judge  
today to stop Philip Morris Inc., the world's largest cigarette 
maker, from offering sizable discounts to store owners who 
prominently display Marlboro and other Philip Morris brands. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown and  
Williamson Tobacco Corp. allege Philip Morris has used its market 
clout to monopolize the U.S. cigarette market, where it accounts 
for almost 54 percent of all retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies have asked for a jury trial and unspecified  
damages. Their lawsuits have since been consolidated into a single 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies want U.S. District Judge Frank Bulock to put an  
immediate stop to Philip Morris' ``Retail Leaders'' marketing 
program, which they claim violates federal and state antitrust 
laws. It was unclear whether Bullock would issue an oral ruling at 
the hearing's conclusion, which may come Thursday, or rule in 
writing later. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is about Philip Morris' exercise of market power to  
unreasonably restrict the advertising by its competitors,'' Richard 
Cooper, an RJR attorney, said in his opening statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are best served when retailers can present cigarette  
brands in the best interests of the consumer, not Philip Morris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiff companies' lawyers unveiled a model of a retail  
store to show the alleged disadvantage at which Philip Morris' 
program places its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness was Brian Stockdale, RJR's vice president for  
trade marketing, who said if Philip Morris is permitted to go ahead 
with the marketing program, it could gain control of 60 percent to 
70 percent of the national cigarette market. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris would squeeze out competitors by relegating them  
to less advantageous displays in store cases, Stockdale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris has disputed the claims in court filings.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Retail Leaders program does not require that participating  
retailers offer only Philip Morris promotions at any time. And the 
Retail Leaders program does not preclude participating retailers 
from providing `visible' space to non-Philip Morris brands,'' said 
a Philip Morris memorandum.

<HEADLINE> With Best Out, Rose Gets the Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose is convinced point guard is his  
best position. A groin injury to Travis Best is giving him a chance 
to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who struggled earlier in the Eastern Conference finals, is  
getting time at point guard behind Mark Jackson as the Indiana 
Pacers attempt to move past the New York Knicks and reach the NBA 
Finals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Best missed his second consecutive game Wednesday night and Rose  
hoped to duplicate his Game 4 performance in Game 5 of the 
best-of-7 series. Rose came off the bench to score a game-high 19 
points Monday as Indiana evened the series 2-2 with a 90-78 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 Rose, who began his NBA career at point guard with  
Denver, was particularly effective in the fourth quarter. In the 
final 12 minutes, he had nine points as Indiana kept the Knicks 
from staging a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jalen likes to play the point. When he gets the opportunity to  
play the point, he plays a little better,'' said coach Larry Bird, 
who has used Rose mainly at small forward the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird decided to use Rose at the point when New York began  
pressuring Jackson in the backcourt, frequently double-teaming or 
trapping him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We brought Jalen in to help us out, and his whole game turned  
around,'' Bird said. ``He likes to have the ball in his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana entered Wednesday night's Game 5 at Market Square Arena  
having won 12 of its last 13 playoff games at home. The Knicks won 
Game 1 there, 93-90. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a complete basketball team, guys that are not caught  
up in minutes, numbers. We are just caught up in winning,'' Jackson 
said. ``We needed something from Jalen, and he delivered. That's 
been this team's story all along. It's a credit to guys like Jalen, 
who can start on just about any team. He does so many things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose smiles when asked if he enjoys coming off the bench and not  
getting much time at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be lying to you if I said I don't want to start, or if I'd  
be happy at point guard,'' he said. ``But, I don't make those 
decisions. The important thing is we've got a chance to play for a 
world championship. There are a lot of people who have played in 
this league, who never had that chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it is within our reach, all we've got to do is kick it  
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the series, Bird was critical of Rose for trying to  
play one-on-one too often and sat him down for much of the opening 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we're winning. We're in the conference  
finals. Let's roll,'' Rose said. ``Coach does a lot of things to 
motivate. He really doesn't have to tell me when I'm playing badly, 
but he has his ways and I can live with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is Indiana's second-leading scorer in the playoffs with a  
12.4 average. His contributions go beyond points. He's tied for 
third on the team in both steals (10) and assists (27). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just excited about playing, contributing. Think about how  
many players are home today, watching us on television,'' Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would prefer to start or finish a game, Rose said,  
``That's a trick question. ... finishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did that Monday, coming off the bench to play 35 minutes,  
hitting 8-of-14 shots and pulling down six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's definitely a boost to my confidence,'' Rose said, ``but  
then I'm always confident.''
