<HEADLINE> Russian General Urges Rebels to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian commander said
Tuesday that much of Grozny is now under federal control and that
it would be senseless for the Chechen rebels to continue resisting.
</P>
<P>
"A large part of Khankala, where Severny airport is located,
and Staropromyslovsky, Novopromyslovsky and all other districts of
the Chechen capital have been liberated from rebel formations,"
First Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff Colonel-General
Valery Manilov told a press conference in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels remaining in the city, who have become "more
stubborn and less reasonable," are moving towards the center of
Grozny. Some are trying to flee the city, mostly during the night.
</P>
<P>
"But the federal troops are prepared for this and will not
allow the rebels' massive exodus from the city," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rebels' resistance in Grozny "is absolutely
senseless." "They should better walk out with a white flag, lay
down their arms and surrender."
</P>
<P>
The general said federal troops are fully capable of liberating
Grozny quickly but consideration has been taken to avoid
casualties of civilians remaining there.
</P>
<P>
Special operations involving about 1,500 Chechen volunteers led
by former Grozny Mayor Bislan Gantamirov is underway.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of federal interior troops and special
units, the volunteers are doing "successfully enough" in mopping
up operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the federal troops in North
Caucasus said Tuesday that they have demolished the headquarters
of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov in the mountains of south
Chechnya a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sukhoi-24 frontline bombers, Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft and
combat helicopters destroyed 18 militant strongholds, three
reinforced firing positions, two mobile air defense installations
and four trucks, Interfax reported.

OTTAWA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's prairie province
Alberta is experiencing a warmest winter with a record 20.6
degrees Celsius registered Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's weather system reported 20.6 C for Claresholm, 19.
5 C for Calgary and 16.7 C for the provincial capital Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
In all, the province saw 24 of its communities have
temperatures shattering records dating back to 1913, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The warm temperatures kept firefighters busy corralling a
series of grass fires while skating rinks were reduced to puddles
in the major cities of the province.
</P>
<P>
In Saskatoon, ice carvers labored on an 11-meter-long sculpture
in the hope that temperatures would drop overnight to keep the ice
clear and strong for this week's Saskatchewan International Ice
Festival.
</P>
<P>
Monday's warm air came from the Rockies in the east. The local

<HEADLINE> Unity Kicks Off Putin Campaign for Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Unity election bloc
said Tuesday that it would be transformed into a political
movement with the chief task of pushing Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin into the Kremlin in next year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Unity, a pro-Kremlin center-right bloc headed by popular
Minister for Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu, finished second
in the parliamentary elections on December 19. It was established
about three months ago.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Tuesday, Shoigu said Unity would be the power base
of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during the 2000 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Many call us Putin's party and that is true," he said. "Putin'
s ties with Unity are not prompted by temporary political
considerations, and this is an indication of a very important
tendency."
</P>
<P>
Putin, who took office as prime minister last August, has been
designated by President Boris Yeltsin as his preferred successor.
His popularity has since soared amid a military campaign against
rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu said that voters' support for Unity in the State Duma
elections "was virtually a vote of confidence in the Putin
government."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the participants unanimously approved a
resolution to transform Unity into a political movement. A
founding congress will be convened early next year.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu was reelected leader of Unity. Putin, who was present at
the meeting, said he would like to have Shoigu remain in his
cabinet. He added that the minister "has become a well-known
person in Russia who enjoys popularity and deserved respect."
</P>
<P>
However, Shoigu must decide for himself whether to remain
minister or become a member of the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu called for the formation of local grassroots branches
before March, when the presidential race formally begins.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Tuesday praised the military for their performance in the assaults
against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, presenting state awards in the Kremlin to servicemen
who distinguished themselves in the North Caucasus, said the
efficient operations of the military have boosted public respect
for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that unlike the last Chechen war of 1994-1996, the army
's conduct this time has been "impeccable and absolutely compliant
with the instructions of the president and government."
</P>
<P>
Russian federal forces have taken control of much of Chechnya
and authorities predicted that Grozny, the regional capital, would
be liberated within weeks.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched in September following Chechen rebels
' armed incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series of

<HEADLINE> Rocket Launch From Plesetsk Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The first launch of a booster-
rocket converted from an intercontinental ballistic missile from
the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia was postponed
indefinitely for technical difficulties, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Rokot, designed under a conversion program based on the SS-
18 ICBM, was scheduled to blast off from an open launch pad in
Plesetsk with a military satellite at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
During a comprehensive test for last Wednesday, a failure in
the countdown graph caused the irregular operation of onboard
electric equipment and unplanned dropping of the nose cone,
Interfax reported, citing the Khrunichev research and production
space center, the Rokot's manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The center said additional examinations and tests of Rokot and
its booster engine Briz-K would be made and a report on their
further use would be drawn.
</P>
<P>
Rokot was successfully launched three times before, in 1990,
1991 and 1994, from a silo in Baikonur. However, in silo launches,
satellites come under strong acoustic loads, increasing the
firmness requirements for satellites and their parts, Interfax
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Rebound in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The association said that sales of existing single-family homes
rose 6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
5.09 million units.
</P>
<P>
The association expects existing-home sales to total a record 5.
18 million units this year, which would be a 4.4 percent increase
over last year's record of 4.97 million units.
</P>
<P>
November's increase was stronger than many analysts forecast.
The main reason is that consumers rushed to buy existing homes
before mortgage rates climbed higher, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.74
percent in November, up from 6.87 percent in November 1998, the
association said, citing figures from Freddie Mac, the mortgage
company.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times
this year in an effort to slow the red-hot economy and keep
inflation at bay. Those increases have made borrowing more
expensive for consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
In November, sales were up in all parts of the country. The
Midwest posted the biggest gain with sales rising 12.5 percent to
an annual rate of 1.17 million units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national median sales price for existing homes
increased 3.3 percent to 133,700 dollars in November over the same
month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
At the end of November there were 1.78 million existing homes
available for sale, which represents a 4.3 month supply, the
lowest in five years, at the current sales pace, the association
said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Chief Warns Against Trained Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of professionally
trained terrorists appeared to be behind the recent spate of
bombings in Cape Town, a tourist resort in South Africa, national
police commissioner George Fivaz said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a visit to the Silverton police station in
Pretoria, he said a number of suspects had been identified "and we
are checking on them."
</P>
<P>
Fivaz said he was convinced that the group, which he declined
to identify, had received professional training in urban terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Our detectives are in possession of many positive clues, and
are working on it," he said. "Hopefully we will very soon be in a
position to announce something more positive. We are very hopeful.
"
</P>
<P>
In the latest attack, seven police officers were injured in a
bomb blast outside Manos restaurant in Greenpoint on Christmas Eve
in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
They were responding to a telephonic bomb threat. Moments after
they arrived at the restaurant and got out of their vehicles to
investigate, the bomb, placed in a blue bin, was detonated by
cellphone.
</P>
<P>
Other Cape Town bombings over the past 18 months included a
blast at the Planet Hollywood restaurant on the Waterfront in
August last year, which killed two people and injured 23 others.
</P>
<P>
More recently, nine people were injured in an explosion at the
gay Blah Bar in Green Point on November 6, followed three weeks
later by a pipe bomb at the St Elmo's pizza outlet on the Camps
Bay beachfront in which 48 people were hurt.
</P>
<P>
Fivaz said suspects had been arrested in all of the bombings
except for the latest three and the attack on Planet Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to remain calm, saying, "We are going
to break the back of this."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Reports Progress of Kosovo Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan's report, however, raised concern about the security
situation for Kosovo Serbs, Roma and other minority groups.
Despite the efforts of the international peacekeeping force,
called KFOR, and UNMIK, he said, "The level and nature of the
violence in Kosovo, especially against vulnerable minorities,
remains unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government has repeatedly accused KFOR and UNMIK
of the failure to respect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity as required by the June 10 Security Council resolution,
which authorizes the presence of UNMIK and KFOR in Kosovo, a
Serbian province, and the failure to keep non-Albanians from being
intimidated and expelled from their homes.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that more resources are needed, and emphasized the
need for the rapid deployment of international police officers and
support for the Kosovo Police Service. He also recommended the
strengthening of Kosovo's judiciary and penal system.
</P>
<P>
"A strong response is needed in order to address the problem of
unofficial law enforcement actors that have been reported to
operate within the area," he warned.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, at least 810,000 refugees have
returned to their homes in Kosovo, and efforts have increased to
provide emergency housing rehabilitation for returnees.
</P>
<P>
Most of the occupants of the 50,000 houses deemed beyond repair
in Kosovo are already living with host families for the winter
season, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to consider the report in its
consultation scheduled for Wednesday, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In Pristina, capital of the Yugoslav province, the Interim
Administration Council met Tuesday for its third session, at which
it discussed the draft resolution on establishing the Joint
Interim Administrative Structure. The Council also unanimously
condemned the "violent attack" committed in Vitina, a Kosovo
region, Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Reaches Second-Highest Level Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence rose
again in December, reaching the second-highest level ever in the
32-year history of the Conference Board's monthly index.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent research group in the United
States, said in a survey Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence
Index closed at 141.4, up from 137 in November. The index's all-
time high of 142.3 was registered in October 1968.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are in very good spirits as the 20th century comes
to a close," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's
Consumer Research Center. "Healthy paychecks, continued low
inflation, and continued job opportunities will keep the economic
expansion on its record-breaking course."
</P>
<P>
The survey said consumers have become more optimistic about
business prospects. Some 17.6 percent look for conditions to
improve over the next six months, up from 17 percent in November
and only 4.9 percent expect business conditions to deteriorate,
down from 5.7 percent in the previous month, it said.
</P>
<P>
Consumers also have positive views about current business
conditions, the survey said, adding that some 46.8 percent of all
consumers say current conditions are "good," rising from 41.3
percent in November, and consumers believing that current jobs are
"plentiful" rose to 51 percent, up from 48.1 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S.
overall economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the high reading would spark fears about
inflation, which would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates to cool off the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve
has raised rates three times this year in an effort to keep
inflation under control.

The U.N. chief "looks forward to a new era in which they will
continue to work together productively, as they did this year to
solve the issue of East Timor," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Portugal officially announced in New York Tuesday
that they agreed to re-establish diplomatic relations at the
ambassadorial level as of December 28 when the two countries'
representatives to the United Nations signed a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique, issued at the U.N. headquarters here,
said the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries "will contribute to the promotion of stable and mutually
beneficial relations based on the historic ties" between them.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic ties between the two countries were broken in 1975
after Indonesian troops entered East Timor following an internal
rift in the territory which had been under Portugal for about four
centuries.
</P>
<P>
As U.N.-sponsored negotiations between the two countries gained
momentum on the future of East Timor, Indonesia and Portugal set
up interest sections in each other's capitals early this year.
</P>
<P>
Final agreement was reached after Indonesian troops left East
Timor in September following an August 30 referendum favoring
independence in the territory of some 800,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Independence is expected to take place in East Timor after a U.
N. transitional administration ends mandate there in two to three
years.

ATHENS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Culture Minister
Elizabeth Papazoi Tuesday announced the detailed program for the

<HEADLINE> Chile, Mercosur to Unify Inflation Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chile and the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur) will seek a standard way to estimate inflation
in the subregion within the next three years
</P>
<P>
National Statistics Institute (INE) director Maximo Aguilera
said Tuesday that Chilean representatives will formally join in
the next days the inflation approval process in the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Chilean representatives acted only as observers
in Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the inflation index between Chile and Mercosur
is still far in the future, according to the INE director, but the
advance will depend on the first phase of the work and the needs
expressed by the governments of the region of having a harmonized
Consumer Prices Index.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, made up of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay,
with Chile and Bolivia as associate partners, expects to have
uniform standards and a fluid exchange of the indexes and
macroeconomic plans of the States.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Hopes to Avoid Armed Conflict: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan foreign vice
minister Guillermo Arguello Poessy said Tuesday that his country
will request the intervention of the Organization of American
States (OAS) for the prevention of an armed conflict with Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Arguello quoted reports about the deployment of Honduran troops
toward the border between the two countries and the refurbishing
of air strips and war bases in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua-Honduras relations became tense when the Honduran
congress ratified November 30 a maritime limits treaty with
Colombia that ignores Nicaraguan rights over 130,000 square
kilometers of continental platform in the Caribbean sea, said
Arguello.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre and his
Honduran counterpart Roberto Flores on Wednesday will discuss the
prevention of the start of a war in Miami, according to Arguello.
</P>
<P>
"We expect this theme to be discussed in the meeting of the
Honduran and Nicaraguan foreign ministers in the next days and
confrontations that imperil the hemispheric peace to be avoided,"
said Arguello.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the proposals Nicaragua will take to the
meeting this Wednesday is the solution of the conflict in a
peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
Arguello said that Nicaragua will try to avoid any armed
conflict in the border zone that could cause an irreparable damage
to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan military authorities have reported that some 300
Honduran soldiers have taken positions in their country that
threaten 85 communities of Miskito Indians living on Nicaraguan
territory bordering with Honduras.

ROME, December 28 (Xinhua) -- High winds and seas were
battering the west coast of Italy, wreaking havoc from north to
the south.
</P>
<P>
In the northern region of Piedmont, roofs were blown off and
heavy snow and fallen trees shut down roads.
</P>
<P>
The port of Livorno is still blocked by high winds and in the
city, firemen sought to remove fallen trees, signposts, chimneys
and cornices.
</P>
<P>
The rail line along the west coast and linking Genoa with Rome
was blocked for over an hour when trees were blown down on the
tracks near the Tuscan town of Rosignano.
</P>
<P>
The power is down on electric trains between Rome and Naples.
</P>
<P>
In Rome itself, firemen were removing fallen branches and roof
tiles and were taking down billboards threatening to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds were also hampering flights in and out of Rome's
international airport at Fiumicino.
</P>
<P>
Navigation between Naples and the islands has been stopped
because of winds travelling up to 30 knots.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Maintain Oil Output Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will maintain the
agreement on oil output reduction among independent producers and
within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC),
Mines and Energy Minister Alvaro Silva Calderon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The recent natural disaster that affected Venezuela will not be
used by the moment as an argument to propose within the OPEC an
authorization for the South American nation to extract crude above
the 2.72 million barrels a day, in force between April 1, 1999,
and March 31, 2000, said Silva.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the government is working on a plan to
obtain the resources to assist the victims and to reconstruct the
zones affected by recent torrential rain and flood, but assured
that the oil output reduction will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 people dead in the recent tragedy in the Western
Hemisphere's largest oil producer and exporter.
</P>
<P>
OPEC will analyze the situation of the international oil market
in March of 2000, to determine whether to maintain or abandon the
agreements to diminish production, according to the Mines and
Energy minister.
</P>
<P>
Silva Calderon said that the reason of the cuts has been the
recovery of the prices, so the impact an additional volume of oil
would have on the oil quotations in the world market must be
analyzed very carefully.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Ranks First in L. American Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will achieve this
year an 8.3 percent economic growth rhythm which puts it in first
place in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank of Costa Rica recent reports show that the Central
American country foreign trade continued growing at a rhythm of 22.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade total volume amounted to 11.961 billion dollars,
with a 333 million dollar surplus, for the first time in its
history.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry maintained a 10 percent growth and will
produce approximately one billion dollars in foreign currency in
1999, becoming one of the main generators of income for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican agriculture will grow some four percent, despite
the drop in the international prices.
</P>
<P>
This year's inflation will be 10 percent, lower than the 17
percent registered during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Costa Ricans per capita income will grow 2.1 percent, while the

financial deficit will remain at four percent, the same as last
year.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank and Finance Ministry specialists consider that the
rapid development of foreign investments, foreign trade, and the
tourism industry, are the three main causes that promote the rapid
growth of the Costa Rican economy.
</P>
<P>
However, they say that the financial deficit and the heavy
burden of the foreign debt would be the factors that might thwart
the further development of the country economy.
</P>
<P>
And from a general point of view, the economic development has
had some kind of imbalance between the several sectors of the
Costa Rican economy.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Francisco Javier

Tuesday by an armed group, the police said on Tuesday.
</P>

The armed men shot at Gomez and threw a hand grenade at him.

The mayor was taken in a critical state to a hospital in Pasto,

Ecuador, said the sources.

<P>
NEW YORK, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching a
new closing high.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session, the Dow index rose 85.63 at 11,476.71,
surpassing the record closing high of 11,405.76, set last Thursday.
The blue chip index moved above 11,500 for the first time earlier
in the session today.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 0.56 at 1,457.66 and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite

index crossed the 4,000 milestone, reaching 4,022.11 points but
retreated later into the negative territory.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index was helped to move higher after the New York-
based Conference Board said the U.S. consumer confidence rose
again in December, reaching the second-highest reading ever posted
in the 32-year history of the board's monthly index. Analysts said
investors were buying in anticipation of strong gains at the start
of the new year in defiance of the possibility that the high
reading would prompt Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to
cool off the U.S. economy.

The Nasdaq index fell on profit taking. The index rose 222.32
points in the five previous sessions
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Latest "Star Wars" Movie Becomes Box-Office Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. movie industry is
putting the wraps on its second straight record-breaking year,
said a report from Hollywood Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales in the United States totaled 7.5 billion U.S.
dollars, up from 6.95 billion dollars in 1998. Taking inflation
into account, the movie business in 1999 fell well below
Hollywood's golden years in the 1930s and 1940s. But 1999 ticket
sales of roughly 1.5 billion dollars, at home and abroad, were the
highest in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
"People are going to movies in numbers we've not seen in four
decades," said Jim Kozak, spokesman for the National Association
of Theatre Owners.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen movies, led by the latest "Star Wars" installment,
topped the 100 million dollar mark in 1999, compared with 11 at
the same point last year.
</P>
<P>
"Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace," became the year's
box-office champion with 430 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The Sixth Sense" with a plot twist worthy of Rod Serling came
out of nowhere to become the year's second-highest-grossing movie
at 275 million dollars. It stars Bruce Willis and is about a boy
who can talk with the dead.
</P>
<P>
"The Blair Witch Project," a small-budget independent film,
used a jerky home-video style and a guerrilla marketing campaign
on the Internet to become a 14-million-dollar blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
Certainly 1999 had its share of conventional hits, including
the romantic comedies "Runaway Bride" and "Notting Hill," the
animated "Tarzan" and "Toy Story 2," and franchise films such as
the James Bond flick "The World Is Not Enough" and "Austin Powers:
The Spy Who Shagged Me."
</P>
<P>
Fans of "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" can pencil
in the date April 4, 2000 -- the day the George Lucas digital
extravaganza will be available on VHS, according to The Hollywood
Reporter.

ADDIS ABABA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's export volume
declined by 15.6 percent in the 1998-1999 fiscal year, said
official statistics published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia earned only 3.2 billion birr( 400 million U.S. dollars)
of the targeted export revenue of 5.2 billion birr (650 million
dollars), said the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Coffee, the country's primary export item, suffered a heavy

only exported 16,136 tons of coffee compared to the targeted 40,
000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Dips to 4.5 Percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment rate
improved slightly in November to 4.5 percent, down from the 4.6
percent in October, the Management and Coordination Agency said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to a record high of 4.
9 percent in June and July, while it declined to 4.7 percent in
August and 4.6 percent in September and October.
</P>
<P>
"There are signs of improvement," an agency official said,
citing an increase of 210,000 in the number of part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
The overall employment condition "still remains severe compared
with figures at the beginning of this year," the official said,
referring to a 4.4-percent jobless rate in January.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the jobless rate for men increased 0.1
percentage point in November to 4.7 percent, reflecting the
declining number of workers in the manufacturing sector as well as
worsening employment rates among males aged 15 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for women dropped 0.3 percentage point to 4.2
percent, mainly due to more part-time jobs in the service sector
and improving employment rates among females aged 25 to 44.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed workers who are looking for jobs
totaled 2.95 million in November, up 40,000 from the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it is the first time since January that the number of
unemployed has fallen below three million, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Ministry said in a separate report that
the ratio of job offers to job seekers improved 0.01 point in
November to 0.49, or 49 job offers per 100 job seekers, rising for
the third straight month.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops have
totally controlled its borders with Namibia after conquering the
town of Jamba in the southeast region of the country, official
sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 rebel soldiers laid down their arms and surrendered to
the government troops, while others had been expelled out of the
town located in the southeast Province of Cuando Cubango, which
borders with Zambia in the east and Namibia in the south,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The victory of the government troops in the border region led
to the start of a blockade enforced by the Armed Forces of Angola
(FAA) along the Angolan-Namibian frontier, which will accelerate
the peace process in the southwest African country, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Headquarters of the General Staff, the FAA had
successfully captured the border towns of Cuangar and Calai before
the operation in Jamba, cutting off the rebels' communication with
their comrades in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Jamba, an area created by the Savimbists, was considered by the
government as a strategic bastion and principal headquarters of
the rebels since 1992, which facilitate the rebels' acquisition of
military supplies.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 people were killed
in southwest France as a second violent storm battered the country
Monday and Tuesday, following the first Atlantic storm that
ravaged northern France on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people killed since Saturday night in France has
amounted to 65 and the number of people missing and injured is
unknown yet, according to official reports.
</P>
<P>
12 people were found killed Tuesday in the province of Charente-
Maritime, which was worst struck by the storm Monday night, said
the local government.
</P>
<P>
11 others were killed in the regions of Aquitaine, Poitou-
Charente and Limousin in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
Alain Jeppe, mayor of Bordeaux which is the biggest city of
southwest France, also former French prime minister, described the
storm as the worst disaster suffered by the region in its recent
history.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionelde Jospin Tuesday visited the port
city of La Rochelle in Charente-Maritime, which was greatly hit by
the storm.
</P>
<P>
Jospin was on a tour of double emergency mission to the western
coast, which is also under the threat of "black wave" oil
pollution from the Sunken tanker "Erika".
</P>
<P>
The second storm led to cancellation of most train schedules in
southwest France and 10,000 passengers there were given temporary
shelters by the state railway company SNCF.
</P>
<P>
Air France also canceled 10 percent of its flights Tuesday
morning, mainly toward the southern part of the country such as
Marseille, Nice, Bordeaux and Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
In Clermont-Ferrand City in the central mountainous region of
Massif, the local airport was forced to close as the roof of an
air control tower was torn off by the wind.
</P>
<P>
The two storm attacks damaged about one fourth of high tension
wires in France and as a result, 3.4 million residences were
deprived of electricity supply Tuesday morning, said the state
electricity company EDF.
</P>
<P>
The electricity supply in Bordeaux and Lyon was most heavily
disturbed, said the EDF, which has asked for its British, German,
Spanish and other European counterparts to send emergency aid in
materials, including pylons, cables and electro-genetic groups
badly in need.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac visited the national center of the EDF
in Saint-Denis outside Paris Tuesday to learn about the damages
caused by the storms.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- France called on the European
Union (EU) Tuesday to start the process of consultation with Cote
d'Ivoire, which has gone through a military coup d'etat, pressing
the junta to hand back its power to a civilian government as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention requires the EU to hold a 30-day
consultation with an African country where a coup has taken place,
before deciding whether to suspend economic aid and impose
sanctions on that country.
</P>
<P>
The EU has in recent years resorted to such consultations with
Niger, Guinea-Bissau, Togo and the Comoros, as is required by
Article 366 of the Lome Convention which was adopted by EU and
African countries in 1995.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine has contacted his
counterparts of other EU countries, asking them that this process
be engaged, said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau Secret.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that it would help lead to a negotiated return to the
constitutional legality (in Cote d'Ivoire)," she said.
</P>
<P>
France, the biggest credit provider of Cote d'Ivoire, has not
threatened to impose sanctions on Cote d'Ivoire after General
Robert Guei overthrew President Henri Konan Bedie last weekend in
Abidjan in a bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
French troops deployed in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal have also
lifted their alert, which was put on temporarily after the coup
took place.

KAMPALA -- The European Union (EU) is set to lift its ban on

has said.

<P>
State Minister for Fisheries Fred Mukisa made the remarks when
reacting to news that a similar ban on Tanzania has been lifted,
according to a Monitor daily report.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member European bloc clamped a total ban on fish exports
from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in March 1999 following reports of
poison being used to trap fish in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Fish export is the country's third largest foreign exchange
earner following coffee and tourism. The EU ban reportedly causes
loss of some one million U.S. dollars each week. About 700,000
people are engaged in fishery-related industries across the
country. (EU-Ban-Fish)

<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China has launched massive
housing construction projects this year and made remarkable
progress in improving housing conditions for urban residents, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Construction Conference, Minister of
Construction Yu Zhengsheng said that the vigorous new housing
reform policy, which is designed to stop housing allocation as a
means of welfare, has stimulated housing construction nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Per capita living space for city dwellers has gone up from 9.3
sq m in 1998 to the current 9.6 sq m, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
During the January-November period this year, China built
housing with a total 569 million sq m in floor space, up 15.7
percent over the same period last year. The country also witnessed
sharp rises in housing space completed or sold, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained rational growth in housing construction
and investment this year, with affordable housing as main target
for housing investment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, individual buyers account for more than 80 percent of
those who bought housing.

<HEADLINE> Law Sure to Beat Cults: Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- As different countries in the
world step up the fight against dangerous religious organizations,
cults will ultimately lose their battles with the law.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Edition of the People's Daily, the leading
newspaper in China, made the comments today in a signed article
headlined "Law Is Sure to Beat Cults."
</P>
<P>
In July, China launched a nationwide campaign against Falun
Gong and other cult groups. They asked Interpol, the international
police body, to help arrest Li Hongzhi, head of the Falun Gong "
research society." Chinese authorities have since arrested and
sentenced a number of key members of the cult.
</P>
<P>
"No countries have been lenient in dealing with cults," the
article said, noting that cults have been popular in developed
countries since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, there are 2,000 to 5,000 cult groups,
involving 10 million to 20 million people. France has 172 such
organizations with 160,000 followers. The Japanese Aum Supreme
Truth has lured 14,000 in Japan and 35,000 in Russia and another
large number in foreign countries. In recent years, China has also
been plagued with various kinds of cults.
</P>
<P>
It is not strange to have cults, either in Europe and the
United States or in China, the article said, calling them a
product of history. In modern society, some people cannot handle
the increasing stresses of society and thus have lost their
spiritual way, it said.
</P>
<P>
All cult groups share the same characteristics: advocating
worship for the cult leader, practicing spiritual control over the
members, fabricating evil theories, collecting funds from the
followers, organizing underground groups and threatening society,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
However, no government has shown mercy toward cult activities.
The U.S. government has on several occasions used its military to
combat cults, while other western countries, including Japan and
Italy, have also taken steps to deal with evil religious
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Law Sure to Beat Cults: Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article condemned the Falun Gong organization, which has
two million members, blaming it for disrupting society in the
guise of a religious group or meditation training center, and
holding it responsible for profiting from illegal activities,
causing over 1,400 deaths, and plotting 78 unlawful gatherings.
</P>
<P>
The article challenged Falun Gong as a form of meditation
incorporating deep-breathing exercises, saying the cult leader, Li
Hongzhi, had learned deep-breathing techniques just two months
before claiming he was a "great master" of the practice.
</P>
<P>
Li told his followers that all existing sciences are not
scientific and mankind could not be free from danger until he, the
"great master," opens a "heavenly eye" on the head of the people,
installs a "Wheel of Buddha" in their stomach, or "releases their
souls from purgatory at a higher level."
</P>
<P>
Li has stolen the Buddhist term "Wheel of Buddha" and created
an evil cult disguise as a mixture of Buddhism and Taoism, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
Not only has Li shamefully borrowed religious terms to describe
the beliefs of the Falun Gong, but he has also accused major
religions of being "low-level" and incapable of true forgiveness
for wayward believers, the article said.

<P>
The government treatment of Falun Gong is an internal affair of
China, the article emphasized. Meanwhile, the government has
always adhered to the principle of governing by law in dealing
with the cult, it added.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the two million Falun Gong believers are
unaware of the true nature of the cult and have followed it
blindly, the article said. The government has made distinctions
between daily fitness routines and cult practices, between
ordinary and key members of the cult, between normal, legal
religious activities and the activities organized by Falun Gong,
and between those who made mistakes before the ban on the cult and
those who made mistakes after the ban.
</P>
<P>
Former Falun Gong practitioners who have left the cult body and
no longer participate in the activities will not be punished. Most
of them are now leading a normal life.
</P>
<P>
The article criticized the governments of the United States and
some other western countries for their groundless criticism of
China's anti-cult campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, the United States has led the western
countries to intervene China's internal battles against Falun Gong,
issuing a government report, in September, a Congress hearing, in
October, and imposing a recent government sanction, according to
the article.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate
passed a joint bill attacking China's anti-Falun Gong drive and
showing outright support for the Chinese cult. The U.S. government
has even granted refugee status to some Falun Gong members.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it said, the U.S. government has warned Americans
of possible cult activities to endanger society on the eve of the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The real aim of the U.S. government's backing of Falun Gong is
to aid hostile forces in China and block social and economic
development in the country, the article said.

<P>
Cults have to be dealt with in two ways -- prevention and
crackdowns, the article said, adding that this is the practice of
all countries.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, thousands of non-government organizations
have been working to raise public awareness about the dangers of
false religions and the harm done to victims of cult groups. More
than 10,000 Americans have signed a petition against cults.
</P>
<P>
The Aum Supreme Truth in Japan is now closely watched by police
and judicial departments as well as ordinary people. In the United
Kingdom, a special non-government body has been set up to discuss
the issue with young people.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Chinese government has
set the abolishing of cults as a key task for law-enforcement
departments and adopted the principle of "combining prevention and
crackdowns, with prevention as the primary focus."
</P>
<P>
The Ninth National People's Congress Standing Committee passed
a resolution urging governments and judicial departments at all
levels to prevent the emergence and spread of cults and make this
a long-term task in order to maintain social stability, according
to the article.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a French anti-cult organization official who proposed
that international cooperation is necessary for fighting cults as
many of them have formed transnational networks. Some large cult
bodies have been known to set up their headquarters in countries
with a lax legal system.

<HEADLINE> Mountain-locked Chinese City on Fast Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Panzhihua, a major steel
producer of China, is on a fast development track with an
electrified railway opening to the public and construction of an
airport starting today.
</P>
<P>
The electrified railway, running about 760 kilometers south to
Panzhihua from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, is expected
to dramatically improve transportation to and from this mountain-
locked area.
</P>
<P>
Located at the juncture of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the
southwest, Panzhihua is known for its production of vanadium and
titanium steel, as well as abundant natural resources such as coal
and nonferrous metal.
</P>
<P>
But limited transportation access due to unfavorable land
conditions has long bottlenecked the development of this area.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure work has been ranked high among issues of the
local government since the central government decided to shift
more focus onto the vast western region.
</P>
<P>
The town with a population of 500,000 will become a
transportation hub when another part of electrified railway
connecting it with Kunming, capital of Yunnan, is completed. The
train speed on the Chengdu-Kunming railway will be raised from 30
km per hour to 60 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Panzhihua Airport under construction will make it
easier for residents there to get to Beijing, Chengdu, Kunming and
other key Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The airport, which is designed to handle Boeing planes 300,000
passengers yearly, will cost a total of 820 million yuan (about
100 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Mainland Tourists to Macao to Double in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Macao's tourist market is
expected to be boosted by less government restrictions in the
Chinese mainland areas, and the number of mainland tourists may
hit 3 million in 2000, analysts said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao to China and the massive press report on
Macao in the past year will also spur interests of mainlanders,
said a bylined article in Tuesday's Macao Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Due to the handover factor, mainland tourists skyrocketed to 1.
324 million in the first 10 months this year, doubling that in the
same period of 1998. The upsurge of travelers was due to
relaxation of government permits ahead of the handover.
</P>
<P>
The number of mainland tourists has maintained a steady growth
in the past several years, making the mainland market one of the
three most important ones for Macao. The other two markets are
Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tourist agencies in Macao are also actively marketing their
services in mainland areas in hope of better performance, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
has stressed that it is necessary for the country's National
People's Congress (NPC) to learn from useful experience of
parliaments of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made the remarks in
the preface of a newly-compiled book on the parliaments of 100
countries, which is expected to go on sale nationwide on January 1.
</P>
<P>
As a fundamental political system of the country, the People's
Congress has been a historical choice of the Chinese nation, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
History has proved that the system has promoted democracy and
is suitable for China's specific conditions, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
In the course of improving the system, it is also essential to
learn from outside experiences that could be applied to this
country, Li said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the NPC is conducting active exchanges with
parliaments of other countries. The book will be beneficial to the
study of foreign parliaments, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The book is compiled jointly by the International News
Department of the Xinhua News Agency and the Beijing Municipal
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
It contains information about the history, status, role,
election, legislation process and features of parliaments of 100
countries.

BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said here today that public opinion must be
fully reflected in the committee's decisions.

For the past several years, the CPPCC has done much to truly
capture public sentiment in its work, and has accumulated a lot of
valuable experience in the process, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In reflecting public opinion, it is extremely important that
the information is true. Otherwise, it will result in misleadings.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK Toys, Games Fair to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong toys and games
fair, the third largest of its kind worldwide, is expected to open
on January 10, 2000 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center, providing a glimpse of the trends ahead in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The four-day fair, which is organized by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC), will be attended by a total of 1,560 of
exhibitors from 29 countries and regions, with an increase of
seven percent compared with the last fair.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong continues to be the world's largest toy exporter in
terms of total exports, with the U.S. accounted for nearly 50
percent of the pie, and this is followed by the EU, which
accounted for 25 percent, said Edmund Young, the chairman of the
TDC's Toys Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for toys sales in the U.S. next year will be
bright amid strong consumer demand," Young said adding that
encouraging sales during Thanksgiving and Christmas in the U.S. is
evident that the demand for toys and games will continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over 30 percent of the production of Hong
Kong's toy manufacturers in China's mainland have been exported
directly from China this year, Young said. As a result, the
statistics of Hong Kong toys exports can be no longer reflect the
real growth of the industry, Young added.
</P>
<P>
"With taste for toys fast changing, product trends in general
will be more difficult to predict, though the fad for Pokemon will
likely continue in 2000," Young said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Hong Kong traders capable of meeting short-notice
orders with mass customization will likely thrive better in an
increasingly price-competitive market, Young noted.
</P>
<P>
With "e-tailing" getting more popular, Hong Kong traders may
benefit from looking into being suppliers of non-traditional toy
retailers, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the exhibition, there will be a China toys retail
market study tour to Guangzhou for exhibitors and buyers,
according to Young.

BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has encouraged millions of farmers in China to improve production -
- and in turn their standard of living -- through more education.
</P>

He said improvement of farmers' overall quality through

"For China, which has 900 million of its 1.2 billion people
living in rural areas, issues concerning the agricultural industry
and farmers are key issues," Jiang commented in a preface to a
series of textbooks of basic knowledge for Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
The content of the newly-published textbooks varies from
practical techniques for planting, cultivating, and processing of
farming products, to marketing and management skills. The books
also include chapters on health care, family planning,

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Rapid Growth in Exports in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has witnessed an
accelerated growth in exports and imports in November 1999,
according to the external trade figures released Tuesday by the
Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the value of total exports in November
1999 increased by 10.3 percent over a year earlier to 124.7
billion HK dollars (15.98 billion U.S. dollars), with a 11.5
percent rise in the value of re-exports and a 2.3 percent rise in
that of domestic exports.
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports in November 1999 increased
by 9.9 percent over a year earlier to 125.1 billion HK dollars (16.
03 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest trade figures, a government
secretariat spokesman said that total exports continued to
accelerate in growth in November, for five months in a row since
July this year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman attributed the good export performance in recent
months mainly to the back of rising demand in Asia as well as
increased import absorption in Europe. Also of particular note was
the rebound in domestic exports to positive growth in November
1999, the first increase since December 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Imports have likewise accelerated to a double-digit growth in
November, he said, adding that this was underpinned mainly by the
strong growth in re-exports, but a further pick-up in imports
retained for local use reflecting an improving domestic demand
also contributed.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Turns Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry has
gone from the red to the black, raking in a profit of 116 million
yuan (14 million U.S. dollars) in the first 11 months of the year
after six straight years of losses.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned today from the State Administration of Textile
Industry that downsizing and restructuring have turned the
industry around in two years and achieved the profit target a year
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of the year, the whole industry saw its
profits go up 2.9 billion yuan over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, the assets/liability rate of the State-
owned textile enterprises dropped 1.2 percent over the same period
of last year, while their product/sales rate went up 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 regions of the country saw profits in their
textile industry, with the provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong
recording a profit of over 300 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry headed into its slump in 1993. By the
end of 1996, the industry netted a total loss of 8.3 billion yuan.
This prompted the central government to designate the industry as
a crack in the country's State-owned enterprises' restructuring
plan.
</P>
<P>
Measures such as reducing the amount of spindles used, halting
repetitious construction, and beefing up of management have
created a better condition for the industry.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the productivity of the industry rose by the end
of November 25 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, favorable government policies such the
introduction of rebates, along with the improvement of some Asian
economies, also helped the industry.
</P>
<P>
But more time and effort is needed to completely overhaul the
industry, especially those enterprises located in the central and
western parts of the country, officials from the administration
noted.

JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Likud leader Ariel Sharon Monday put an end to any suggestion
that the Likud could replace Shas in the Barak government. He made
this remark immediately after Shas threatened to quit the coalition
because its budget demands were not being met.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has agreed to give the Palestinian National Authority
civil control in Jerusalem's northern Arab neighborhoods of Beit
Hanina and Shuafat similar to the control that the Palestinians
exercise in Area B of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and joint
control of the Atarot airport in northern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- As Five Hezbollah prisoners released by Israel landed at the
Beirut airport Monday, Israel hope to receive information on the
fate of the missing Israel Air Force navigator Ron Arad as an
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak expressed his confidence that the
budget disputes with Shas will be resolved in time and the 2000
state budget will be passed before the Thursday night deadline.

<HEADLINE> Headscarves Banned in University Classes in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's High Court of Appeals
has ruled that female university students cannot wear headscarves
to attend classes, according to a report of the Anatolia News
Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A female student at Istanbul University filed a law-suit against
Rector Kemal Alemdaroglu, charging him for damages caused by not
allowing her to attend classes and the university administration
for denying her entrance to exams unless she agreed to take off her
headscarf. The student further charged that the ban imposed on her
was based on a regulation issued by the rector personally.
</P>
<P>
The local court adjudicated that the decision adopted by
Alemdaroglu was in perfect compliance with current laws and
regulations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The court also dismissed her claim, saying that "Alemdaroglu is
a civil servant and is not personally responsible for damages
caused to others in the course of performing his official duties."
It added that the damages may be claimed from the university
administration.
</P>
<P>
The student refused to accept the local court ruling and
appealed to the High Court, which, however, upheld the lower
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Appeals maintained that the instructions
issued by the rector of Istanbul University requests that a female
student wearing a headscarf and a male students with a beard should
be refused entrance to classes and that any students who challenge
these directives be reported to the university administration.
</P>
<P>
The High Court explained that the girl student failed to adhere
to the school regulations issued by the rector and she ought to
bear the consequence.
</P>
<P>
The High Court further maintained that the headscarf could not
be considered acceptable as stipulated in the dress code for
university students. Therefore directives issued by the rector were
not discretionary in nature, but in conformity with valid laws and
regulations currently in force in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Under its 1924 and 1961 constitutions, Turkey adopted a
political system of democracy, secularism and law, despite that 99
percent of the population are Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Israel Proposes Settlement of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel has proposed to give
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) civilian control over
Jerusalem's northern Arab neighborhood of Beit Hanina and Shaufat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has also proposed to have a joint control with
the PNA of the small Atarot Airport in northern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel's willingness to cede civilian control over the areas was
conveyed to the Palestinians during talks between the two sides on
an eventual framework agreement, the local daily Haaretz quoted
reliable Israeli sources as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal does not involve any concession of Israeli
sovereignty in these areas, nor does it grant the PNA any
responsibility for security.
</P>
<P>
But, almost all areas of day-to-day life, such as planning and
construction, financial administration, sanitation, municipal
supervision, health services, patrolmen and other areas currently
under the auspices of the Jerusalem municipality, would be
transferred to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
This arrangement implies de jure recognition of the ties that
already exist between various Arab Jerusalem neighborhoods and the
PNA. It will also set clear guidelines for what the Palestinian
security services, already active in East Jerusalem, may and may
not do within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
Oded Eran, head of the Israeli negotiating team, has already
handed over details of the proposal to his Palestinian counterpart
Yasser Abed Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Palestinian sources as saying that Israel
intimated that sovereignty over these areas would also be
discussed, but at a much later date. They also are of the opinion
that the Beit Hanina-Shuafat proposal was a test case for other
Arab neighborhood in the city that would follow suit later on.
</P>
<P>
As part of the proposal, Israel wants to broaden the city limits
of Jerusalem to include the West Bank Jewish settlements such as
Maaleh Adumim, Givat Ze'ev and Beitar, while at the same time
allowing Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem to become part of the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also suggested that the Abu Dis neighborhood, east
of Jerusalem or Aram, north of Jerusalem, serve as the capital of
the PNA and be called Al Quds. Such a proposal would create two
Jerusalems, one Israeli and the other Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
All the Arab residents of East Jerusalem, those who remain
within the borders of the Israeli Jerusalem as well as those who
live in the areas controlled by the PNA, will be eligible to vote
for and be elected to the institutions of a future Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
As for the Old City, it proposed to give various religious joint
sovereignty over the city and divesting it of all political
sovereignty. Even under this type of arrangement, the overall
security responsibility for the Old City would remain in the hands
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is one of the several key issues to be solved during
the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks under the newly signed
Sharm el Sheikh peace deal, which asks the two sides to reach a
framework agreement on final-status by next February and a final
peace treaty by September.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether this proposal could be accepted by the
Palestinian side, which wants to establish an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects Major Cabinet Reshuffle in Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh is expected to reshuffle his 24-member cabinet in the
coming weeks to garner more support for his social, economic and
administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming reshuffle, the second since he took office in
March, will touch at least six portfolios though no exact date has
been set yet, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi is widely expected to loose
his portfolio as he had submitted his resignation after accusing
Rawabdeh of meddling in daily affairs of his ministry. Lawzi is
currently in London for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
In August, Rawabdeh accepted the resignation of Minister of
Youth and Sports Mohammad Kheir Mamser in what was seen as the
first cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Mamser resigned after failing to persuade Kuwait to take part in
the ninth Pan-Arab Games in Amman. Kuwait boycotted the games in
protest against the participation of Iraq, which invaded the tiny
emirate in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, a 60-year-old career politician, has been under fire
from the parliament and the public for a series of moves, including
the privatization of state enterprises and a recent crackdown on
Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement.
</P>
<P>
In September the Jordanian authorities arrested 24 Hamas members
after closing all Hamas offices in the kingdom at the request of
the government. Four Hamas leaders were later expelled to Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Hamas opposes the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians and is critical of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with the
Jewish state. Engaged in a holy war to liberate all territories
occupied by Israel, Hamas enjoys public sympathy in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh himself is rumored to lose his job in the upcoming
government reshuffle, but the speculations subsided after King
Abdullah renewed his confidence in Rawabdeh earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, in a letter, asked Rawabdeh to carry on with his
job despite "skepticism and doubts raised here and there regarding
our achievement."
</P>
<P>
The Rawabdeh government has made economic development its top
priority and the kingdom is apparently emerging from a 10-year
economic stagnation since the 1990 Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Renovate Water Supply Networks in Capital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has launched a
rehabilitation program on the worn-out water supply systems to curb
rampant water losses and leakage in the capital city of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water and Irrigation has floated tenders worth
150 million Jordanian dinars (210 million U.S. dollars) to repair
or replace the water networks in the capital, and the repair works
will start in March 2000, ministry officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be funded through grants and soft
loans from the United States, Japan, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts said at least 25 percent of water leakage
nationwide is caused by the ageing pipelines, costing the state
treasury millions of dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
In Amman, nearly half of the drinking water leaked to the ground
through the outdated pipelines, and the renovation program had long
been delayed due to lack of fund, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is an arid country, depending mainly on rainwater to meet
its water needs for human, agricultural and industrial
consumptions.
</P>
<P>
However, the kingdom was hit in 1999 by a worst regional drought
in half a century.
</P>
<P>
The government has been under fire for not shutting down private
and unlicensed wells, which had been over-tapping the scarce and
non-renewable underground water in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed there are some 400 unlicensed wells in
addition to 1,254 privately-run wells across the kingdom.

JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Shas

resolve their budget disputes to keep Shas in the government,
Education Ministry officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The budget allocation of about 12.1 million U.S. dollars to the
Shas educational network was a financial compromise to the
coalition partner, who threatened to quit the government Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is still subject to approval of Shas leaders, but
Shas agreed to postpone submitting their resignation letter by an

<HEADLINE> Shas Resolves Rift with Israeli Education Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Shas
party and Israeli Education Ministry reached an agreement to
resolve their budget disputes, largely steering clear of a
government crisis.
</P>
<P>
Education Ministry officials said Tuesday that the deal is still
awaiting approval by Shas leaders, who threatened to leave the
coalition government earlier on Monday if their budget demands are
not met.
</P>
<P>
Shas's sudden announcement meant that Prime Minister Ehud Barak-
led coalition could lose its majority in the knesset (parliament)
before it is to make tough decisions to strike a peace deal with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
However the agreement reached with a Treasury team was a
financial compromise to end the crisis. It will allocate 51 million
shekel (about 12 million U.S. dollars) to shas' ailing educational
network in a period of four years.
</P>
<P>
Shas representatives agreed that the party will raise some 28
million shekel (about 6.7 million dollars) by itself to cover the
100 million shekel (about 23.8 million dollars) debt of the
religious school system. They also agreed on measures to reform the
educational network.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the allocation for Shas's school system
in next year's budget will be 160 million shekel (about 38 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party's officials said the deal with Shas
showed that Prime Minister Ehud Barak is capable of being pressured
and blackmailed.
</P>
<P>
Knesset member Eliezer Zandberg from the Shinui faction said
that the agreement proved to be a "blackmail pay". He added that
Barak capitulated that he will be unable to conduct negotiation
with Syria if Shas is against him.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday morning, Shas leader Eli Yishai announced his
party is quitting the coalition at the request by party spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
</P>
<P>
This threatened the future of the Barak government, the passage
of the year 2000 state budget and of the coming peace agreement
with Syria which would include troop withdrawal form the Golan
Heights.

<HEADLINE> Main Kuwaiti Government Sectors Y2K Ready: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait announced Tuesday
that main and vital government installations have been technically
prepared to cope with the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem.
</P>
<P>
All studies and tests conducted on the government departments
proved these sectors are well prepared for the millennium glitch,
said Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Deifallah Sharar at a
National Assembly (Parliament) session.
</P>
<P>
Sharar, also minister of state for cabinet and National Assembly
affairs, singled out the banking, oil, security and economic
sectors as Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has set up a special team to follow up on
measures that have been taken by foreign countries to deal with the
prospected Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The bug dates back to the early days of computer programming
when only the last two numbers of the year were used in most
software. If the problem is not solved, some computers will read
2000 as 1900 and shut off or give wrong answers when the new
century starts.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Planning Ministry formed a work team in August in
charge of examining the systems of the computers used by government
bodies and mapping out an emergency strategy to cope with the
expected problem.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, several key government departments such as
Communications Ministry, Finance Ministry and the Kuwait Stock
Exchange (KSE) have made separate announcements that all their
computers are Y2K compliant.

<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is expected to produce 1.32 million tons of sugar
in the 1999-2000 fiscal year starting July, up from 1.25 million
tons in the previous fiscal year, The Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade and Supply usually buys 550,000
to 600,000 tons of sugar each year and sells them to low-income
consumers in ratio at a subsidized price of 0.55 Egyptian pounds
(0.16 U.S. dollars) every kilogram, compared to the market price of
about 1.3 pounds (0.38 dollars) one kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the world's seventh largest sugar importer, imports 700,
000 to 1.3 million tons of sugar in a year, a major cause for a
stock of about 1 million tons, according to the International Sugar
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has raised import duties on white sugar
to 26 percent from 10 percent and on raw sugar to 24 percent from 5
percent in a bid to protect the local industry, the English-
language paper said.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Inter-state and foreign trade of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) member states remained stable in the past five years,
said a report by the Riyadh-based Economic Office on Foreign and
Inter-state Trade among the six GCC states.
</P>
<P>
These countries have been successful in tapping more overseas
markets with greater competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Exports volume of the GCC states over the past year has exceeded
90 billion U.S. dollars with Japan and the European Union standing
as the major importers of GCC products.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan said that the
GCC summit, which was held in Riyadh on November 27-29, has
resolved the issue of national labor force movement among GCC
states.
</P>
<P>
The movement of Gulf national labor force has become a
legitimate right, the Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom Tuesday quoted the
GCC official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Workers now can enjoy the right to own real estate, to purchase
shares, to open bank branches, and to enjoy the benefits of loans,
health services and education. Such working rights do not prevail
in other Arab states, said the official.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The median overnight interbank rate on the Egyptian
pound rose to 16 percent Monday, its highest level this year, from
15-7/8 percent on Sunday in a very tight market, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
Overnight rates were between 15-1/2 and 16-1/2 percent versus
15-1/2 to 16-1/2 percent on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three of seven banks reported one-week rates between 16 and 16-
1/2 percent against Sunday's 15-3/4 and 16-1/2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Support Efforts for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan on Tuesday
reiterated support for all efforts that could lead to progress in
the peace talks between Arab countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein exchanged views on
the latest developments of the Middle East peace process, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are negotiating with Israel for a final peace
agreement, and Syria and Israel have agreed to continue peace talks
on January 3 after resuming negotiations on December 15 after a gap
of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which follows Syria's foreign policy, especially in the
Middle East peace process, also is expected to restart talks with
Israel following progress in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Abdullah underlined that the two countries will
continue efforts in helping advance the peace negotiations on all

<P>
They also reviewed a number of issues in the Arab world and

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Transport Minister Resigns Over Row With PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein issued a royal decree Tuesday to accept the resignation of
Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi, who had been at odds with Prime
Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
The decree named Minister of Posts and Telecommunication Jamal
Sarayreh as acting minister of transport, Jordan's official news
agency said, without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement is apparently the start of a widely anticipated
major reshuffle to the 24-member cabinet headed by Rawabdeh. At
least six portfolios are targeted for the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Lawzi submitted his resignation earlier this month after
accusing Rawabdeh of meddling in daily affairs of his ministry.
Lawzi is currently in Britain on vacation.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle is aimed at garnering support for various
social, economic and administrative reforms carried out by the
Rawabdeh government.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, 60, has been under fire from the parliament and the
public for a series of moves, including the privatization of state
enterprises and a recent crackdown on the militant Palestinian
group Hamas members sheltering in the kingdom, where 60 percent of
the population are Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Following orders from the government, police arrested 24 Hamas
members after closing all Hamas offices in the country. Four Hamas
leaders were later expelled to Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Hamas are opposed to the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians and is also critical of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty
with the Jewish state. Hamas calls for a holy war to liberate all
territories occupied by Israel, and it enjoyed public sympathies in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh himself had also been rumored to lose his job in the
cabinet reshuffle, but the speculations came to a halt after King
Abdullah renewed his confidence on Rawabdeh earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The monarch asked Rawabdeh in a letter to carry on his duties
despite "skepticism and doubts raised here and there regarding our
achievements."
</P>
<P>
Jordanian king has the constitutional rights of appointing or
dismissing governments.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has taken economic development as his top priority
after he took office in March, and the kingdom is seemingly
emerging from a 10-year economic stagnation since the 1990 Gulf
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Practising Piracy in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday accused the U.
S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf of practising piracy against a
cargo ship carrying rice imported by Iraq under the oil-for-food
program with U.N..
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Iraqi trade ministry told the Iraqi News
Agency that on December 19, the U.S. naval forces intercepted and
detained a cargo ship carrying 14, 538 tons of imported rice from
Vietnam, and heading for southern Iraq's Umm Qasr port.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the cargo ship has not been released
yet. He slammed the U.S. piracy practice as "unjustifiable,
inhuman and immoral," saying it was not the first time that the U.
S. navy in the Gulf did so.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq nine years ago shortly after
it invaded Kuwait, but it adopted a oil-for-food deal on Iraq in
1996, which allows Iraq to export limited amount of oil every six
months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
"This piracy practice reflects the hostile U.S. policy toward
the Iraqi people suffering under the U.N. embargo," the spokesman
said, adding the U.S. aims to prolong the embargo and the suffering
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also rapped the U.S. envoy at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee of deliberately blocking the approval of Iraqi contracts
signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal has entered its seventh phase as of
December 12.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Free Third Batch of Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official said
on Tuesday that Israel will free the third batch of 26 prisoners
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Prisoner Affairs of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Hisham Abdul Raziq said the prisoners
comprise members from various Palestinian factions, including
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction and the
militant Islamic Jihad and Hamas groups.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's security cabinet agreed on
the release two days ago, Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel had released two batches of 350 palestinian prisoners
under the latest Palestinian-Israeli Sharm El Sheikh deal. It also
promised in the deal to free an unspecific additional number of
prisoners by the start of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan,
which began on December 9.
</P>
<P>
The release was delayed due to differences between the
Palestinians and Israel over whom should be freed. There are still
1,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, according to
Palestinian estimates.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Continue Peace Talks Despite Obstacles: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
underlined on Tuesday that the Palestinians see peace as a
strategic option and will continue peace talks with Israel although
the process is faced with hardships and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are working to seek a just and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East, Arafat told reporters after a meeting
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and President Hosni
Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Egypt, arrived in Cairo earlier in
the day. He will meet with Mubarak on Wednesday to brief him on the
latest development of the negotiations on the Palestinian track and
seek advice from the Egyptian leader, who plays an active role in
mediating the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed frustration over the ups and downs of the peace
talks with Israel, saying that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations
are undergoing precarious condition and both sides have been moving
in a vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of delaying troops withdrawal from the West
Bank under the September Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum and continuing
settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks for a final peace deal and over issues in the
interim period achieved no noticeable progress despite tight
deadlines for a framework agreement in February and a permanent
peace deal next September.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader stressed that the peace process is based
on the land-for-peace principle, adopted by the 1991 Madrid peace
conference and the United Nations Security Council resolutions 242
and 338.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on the Arab countries to forge a united stance in
a bid to support the Palestinian people in their peace talks with
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Cairo for Talks With Mubarak on Mideast Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Cairo on Tuesday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was accompanied by his deputy Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu
Mazen, and several ministers, will brief Mubarak on his recent
meetings and contacts with world leaders on the Middle East peace
process, notably a message from U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reassured Arafat in the message that the United States
and he personally will continue efforts to help push forward the
peace drive on the Palestinian track, al Qedra was quoted as saying
by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will also keep Mubarak posted on Israel's failure to
honor Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum, referring to the delay in troops
withdrawal from the West Bank and the release of Palestinian
prisoners, the Palestinian diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released 350 Palestinian prisoners in two stages
since the deal was signed in September. But the two sides failed to
agree on the list of a third batch, postponing the release that was
to have taken place before the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan
beginning two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to coordinate stance in the peace
process with Mubarak, who, as president of the first Arab country
to sign a peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in
mediating the Mideast peace process.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Tuesday called on Iran to use its influence to help
settle the hijack of an Indian airline plane by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov made the call in a verbal message through Russian
ambassador Konstantin Shuvalov to his Iranian counterpart Minister
Kamal Kharrazi, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Indian airliner, hijacked on Friday en route to New Delhi
from the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, has stayed at the Kandahar

through India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, where the
hijackers released 27 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 passengers and crew of the plane were still held
hostage.
</P>
<P>
The five Muslim hijackers have demanded the release of a
Pakistani cleric, who has been jailed in the Indian-controlled
Kashmir since 1994 on separatist charges, and 35 other hard-core
Islamic militants held in Indian jails. They also demanded a ransom
of 200 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Greater Hope on Cyprus Issue: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Acting Resident
Representative James Holger Tuesday said that for the first time
there are elements pointing to the direction of a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
Holger said "I think there is greater hope than what we had in the
past."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he recalled a statement by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan that reaching a settlement on Cyprus issue "will
be a long process."
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to be realistic. It's bad to be a pessimist but
equally bad to set one's expectatiosn too high," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriots
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after an abortive pro-Athens coup by
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between President Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash were held earlier this month
in New York in an effort to pave the way for substantive
negotiations to reach a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
Holger said small adjustments to the dates of the second round
of the proximity talks are being discussed, which he expects the U.
N. headquarters to announce in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Holger is scheduled to meet Denktash later Tuesday.

KHARTOUM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese First Vice President

<HEADLINE> Israel Returns Bodies of 2 Hezbollah Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel Tuesday returned the
bodies of two Hezbollah fighters killed in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the Israelis
handed the corpses of 24-year-old Moussa Ahmed and 23-year-old
Hassan Salameh to the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), which then gave them to Hezbollah's south commander Nabil
Qaouq.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said in a statement that it was acting as a neutral
intermediary at the request of all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah will hold a funeral in Beirut for the two killed in
fighting Israeli troops near Rab Tlateen near the Lebanese-Israeli
border on December 9, on Wednesday before they are buried in their
hometowns in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
guerrilla war trying to drive Israelis out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over came only one day after Israel freed five
Hezbollah guerrillas from its jails. They all had been held without
trial for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel agreed on an informal two-day cease-fire in
south Lebanon in order to allow Hezbollah to recover the bodies of
the group's six killed members.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments in the south are seen as a goodwill
gesture by Israel ahead of further peace talks with Syria, an
undisputed power broker in Lebanon. The talks will take place on
January 3 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said they hope to get information about
the whereabouts of Ron Arab, an Israeli airman who has been missing
since his airplane was shot down over Lebanon in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Shas Resolves Rift With Israeli Education Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
religious Shas Party and Israeli Education Ministry have agreed on
a recovery plan for Shas' ailing educational network to resolve
their budget disputes which has led to a government crisis,
Education Ministry officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shas leaders apparently have accepted the plan, as Shas Chairman
Eli Yishai didn't hand over the party's resignation letter for
quitting the ruling coalition as he had threatened Monday,
according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Yishai visited Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office again on
Tuesday. After the meeting, Yishai revealed that Barak has ordered
Finance Ministry officials to speed up negotiations on boosting
welfare and religious budget.
</P>
<P>
Yishai, who also served as Labor and Social Affairs Minister,
required the Treasury to provide hundreds of millions shekels in
new allocations for social welfare and religious activities.
</P>
<P>
But political analysts believe that the real reason behind Shas'
attitude change was the recovery plan for its religious school
system, which will get allocation of 51 million shekels (about 12.1
million U.S. dollars) in the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
The plan also promised that next year's budget for the religious
school system will be 160 million shekels (about 38 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In return, Shas representatives agreed that the party will raise
some 28 million shekels (about 6.7 million dollars) by itself for
covering the debt of 100 million shekels (about 23.8 million
dollars) of the religious school network. They also acceded to take
some measures to reform the educational network.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the agreement, the opposition Likud Party's
officials said the deal with Shas shows that Barak is "capable of
being pressured and blackmailed."
</P>
<P>
Knesset (parliament) member Eliezer Zandberg from the Shinui
faction said that the agreement proves to be a "blackmail pay." He
added that Barak capitulated to the fact that he will be unable to
conduct negotiations with Syria if Shas is against him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some analysts believe the crisis is not really over
because there is still no solid confirmation about Shas' final
decision.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton, who secured the resumption
of peace talks between Israel and Syria recently, called Barak
Tuesday to inquire how serious the crisis is and express his
concern about the effect of the crisis on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It is worried that Shas' leaving the coalition may harm Israel's
chance for reaching a peace agreement with Syria on Israel's
withdrawal form the Golan Heights, which it seized from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday morning, Yishai announced that his party is
quitting the coalition at the request of Shas spiritual leader
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.
</P>
<P>
If Shas, the third largest party in the Knesset with 17 seats,
jump off the boat, the Barak government would have only 51 seats in
the 120-seat Knesset and became minority.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Libya Urged to Bridge Gap Among Sudan's Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese opposition leader
called on Egypt and Libya Tuesday to exert efforts to help bridge
the gap among the parties related to the Sudanese peace process.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Mohamed
Othman Merghani, leader of Sudan's National Democratic Alliance
(NDA), said NDA wants Egypt and Libya to help bring closer the
views of the concerned parties before they go to a peace
conference, called for in an Egyptian-Libyan initiative on Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Merghani, who arrived in Cairo earlier in the day, told
reporters that his alliance has not yet named its representatives
to the preparatory meeting of the peace conference due to
differences over the peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed earlier this year a five-point peace
plan calling for an end to Sudan's 16-year-old civil war and the
convocation of the peace conference to be attended by all parties
related to the Sudanese issue to seek national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties which
form the NDA with the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) have accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
But the SPLA, which has been fighting for greater autonomy for
the mostly Christian and animist south, has rejected the
initiative, largely out of fear that it will not guarantee the
group's rights.
</P>
<P>
The alliance has officially requested Cairo and Tripoli to study
its viewpoint, Merghani said, expressing hope that the two peace
sponsors will work to reach positive results and open a new chapter
in Sudan's situation.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has said it favors the role played by the Eastern
African Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in
mediating between it and the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt and Libya argue that IGAD's mediation is not
comprehensive as it excludes Sudan's Muslim opposition parties,
which want to share power with the government.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has voiced repeatedly its keenness on helping safeguard
Sudan's unity and territorial integrity and has been mediating
between the Sudanese government and the opposition, out of fear
that possible disintegration of Sudan may endanger its major water
source, the Nile.

<HEADLINE> Production, Sales of Manufacturing Sector Up in Oct. in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Growing demand for export
products continued to boost the manufacturing sector's growth in
the Philippines, with volumes of both production and net sales in
October rising by 8.7 percent and 13.5 percent respectively, from
last year's levels, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement released here, National Statistics Office
(NSO said eight out of 16 sectors posted year-on-year increases in
volume of production led by transport equipment which increased by
63.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive month of positive growth in the
volume index replicating the performance from March to May this
year, said the statement based on the results of a monthly survey.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors which exhibited double-digit increases include
bacco, 27.5 percent; miscellaneous manufactures 16.9 percent; wood
and wood products, 14.3 percent; basic metals, 14.3 percent; and
electrical machinery 12.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, seven sectors exhibited increases
in the volume of net sales led by miscellaneous manufactures which
increased by 107 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors that recorded double-digit increases were wood
and wood products, 100.9 percent; electrical machinery, 60.6
percent; chemicals 23.9 percent; petroleum products, 18.4 percent;
food manufacturing, 10.6 percent; and basic metals, 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
This can be attributed to the resumption of operations in some
key establishments and increase in demand for the products, the
NSO said.
</P>
<P>
The same data indicate the values of production and net sales
of the sector also rose by 15.6 percent and 22.9 percent
respectively in October.
</P>
<P>
They were still led by transport equipment, miscellaneous
manufactures, petroleum products, electrical machinery, tobacco,
wood and wood products.
</P>
<P>
Responding establishments operating below 70 percent capacity
were 50 percent in October 1999 compared to 41.7 percent a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
About 14.3 percent operated at full capacity compared to 17.3
percent in October in 1998, the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian negotiators held new
talks Tuesday with hijackers holding 160 people in hostage on a
plane in Afghanistan's Kandahar in a bid to end the five-day
crisis, sources from the southern Afghan city said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators spoke to the hijackers for two hours in two rounds
of "confidence-building discussions" Monday night,the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to establish a rapport," said a member of the
Indian delegation.
</P>
<P>
A third round of talks began shortly after 10 a.m. (0530 GMT)
Tuesday at the Kandahar airport, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member Indian negotiating team arrived in Kandahar
Monday afternoon, three days after the plane landed there on
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia have been urging the
Indian government to take expeditious actions to resolve the
prolonged crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Now the matter is between the Indian government and the
terrorists," Taliban's Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil told
the Afghan Islamic Press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's talks were delayed after the aircraft's
communications system stopped working when the plane ran out of
fuel, Mutawakil said.
</P>
<P>
The engines on the Airbus-300 have been running since it landed
in Kandahar early Saturday. But they stopped early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hand-held radios were delivered to the hijackers on the
aircraft so talks could begin.
</P>
<P>
U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan Erick de Mul has been at the
airport since Sunday. Diplomats from Belgium, Italy,France and
Switzerland were also in Kandahar, to help with their nationals
among the passengers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Regrets over Indian Plane Hijack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday expressed regret over the hijacking of an
Indian Airlines plane last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very much saddened by this," he said in an interview
with Radio Television Malaysia (RTM) at his office in Putrajaya
near here. The interview was released by Bernama news agency
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said: "The idea of taking hostages in order to obtain
certain concession is something that is very unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir hoped that negotiations with the hijackers would
continue and some kind of settlement would prevail.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said: "The world must set an example that nobody, not
even nations, should hold as hostage any other nation or people in
order to achieve a certain aim."
</P>
<P>
The Airbus-300 airliner with 189 people on board was reportedly
seized by the hijackers on Friday as it entered Indian airspace
after taking off from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport
in Nepal.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Ministry of
Finance (MOF) Tuesday announced that agencies under its wings are
Y2K ready with comprehensive preparations made.
</P>
<P>
The agencies under the ministry include the Inland Revenue
Board (IRB), Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Accountant-General
Department, Royal Customs and Excise Department, Bank Simpanan
Nasional (BSN), Housing Loan Section and Valuation and Property
Services Department.
</P>
<P>
The agencies have taken all relevant measures to tackle the Y2K
problems and ensure application systems, software, hardware and
non-IT equipment are Y2K ready, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Steps have also been taken to ensure their business partners
have achieved Y2K ready status, it said.
</P>
<P>
Simulation tests on the change of the critical date to January
1, 2000 from December 31, 1999 and to February 29, 2000 from
February 28, 1999, have been completed and showed robust results,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that these agencies and their branches had
established Y2K contingency plans and developed their respective '
Y2K Command Center' plus trial runs.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that apart from these agencies, banking
agencies, insurance and the capital market such as Bank Negara
Malaysia (BNM),the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) and
Securities Commission(SC) are Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
All the three agencies have declared December 31, 1999 as a non-
transaction day for the banking, insurance and capital market
sectors to enable them to sum up their year-end transactions,
conduct data backups and printing of reports required under the
Y2K contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
These agencies should be able to render services if the Y2K
crisis occurs and ensure that at least the minimum level of
services could be provided, it said.

The agency quoted Immigration Commissioner Rufus Rodriguez as
saying that of the total, 45 were already deported to their
country of origin.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that based on the records of the bureau's
intelligence division, the fugitives have standing warrants of
arrest for involvement in heinous crimes such as drug trafficking,
gun smuggling, large-scale fraud and murder.
</P>
<P>
The most controversial of the fugitives, according to Rodriguez,
is Richard Dean Pedriolli, a notorious American gun smuggler who
was arrested on April 20 by joint elements of the bureau and the U.
S. Marshall Service.
</P>
<P>
Pedriolli was tagged as one of the top 15 most wanted fugitives
in the United States who was charged before a California District
Court and ordered arrested for unlawful export of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Other American fugitives were deported for trafficking illegal
drugs.

Minister Alwi Shihab said in a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the signing of this communique the diplomatic
ties between two countries would be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
"With normalization of diplomatic relationship (with Portugal)
Indonesia will get many advantage, as Portugal will become the
chairman of European Union in January 2000," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be good for Indonesia as such a move will boost our
lobby in Europe," Shihab said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the House of Representatives (DPR) Commission I for
foreign affairs Yasril Ananta Baharuddin, who also attended in the
press conference, said, "the House can understand the government
decision (to restore diplomatic ties with Portugal). We understand
and we support (the government)," Baharuddin told reporters.

The diplomatic ties between two countries had been frozen by
Lisbon in 1975 following East Timor, a former Portuguese colony,
integrated into Indonesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
fixed a target to provide one telephone for every 125 people by
2002 and one telephone for every 100 people by 2005, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the newly-installed 10,000-line digital telephone
exchange in the old part of the capital city, the prime minister
said the government has a plan to install 800,000 telephones by
2000 and 160,000 by 2005, under its national telephone policies.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-line exchange is part of the Greater Dhaka Telephone
Project, which is being implemented at a cost of 6.37 billion taka
(about 124.9 million U.S. dollars) with Japanese financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a remarkable day for the residents of the old city as
they previously faced unbearable inconveniences with their age-old
and dilapidated analogue telephone service," she said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is one telephone set for about every 200
people in the country, which has about 600,000 telephones
including 470,000 installed by the state-owned Bangladesh
Telephone and Telegraph Board, 30,000 by two private organizations
and nearly 100,000 by four cellular phone companies, according to
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,381 card phone booths in the country and another
300 new booths would be set up soon, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government is working to formulate a telecom regulatory
commission under assistance from the World Bank which would, under
open competition, ensure development of telecommunications
infrastructure in the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
Digital telephone services would be installed in headquarters
of 58 of the country's 64 districts by the year 2001, and the
government is actively considering to install satellite telephone
and personal handy phone systems in the country, said Post and
Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim.

<HEADLINE> Viagra Causes 2 Deaths in Malaysia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Two men have died in
Malaysia after taking Viagra pills since the anti-impotence drug
hit the local market in April, according to Health Minister Chua
Jui Meng Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One case involved a 30-year old man who died after taking two
Viagra pills before having sex while another Viagra-related case
involved a 60-year old man who died of a heart attack after taking
the drug, Chua told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The two deaths were among 20 cases reported to the Health
Ministry that people suffered adverse effects from the drug, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "It is timely to remind the Malaysian public
again that taking Viagra without a doctor's prescription can be
fatal."
</P>
<P>
He said since Viagra was registered for sale in Malaysia, over
38,000 pills had been sold to health professionals to be
prescribed to patients.
</P>
<P>
The drug has a tendency to react with other medication taken by
patients with medical problems like blood disorder, eye disease
and kidney failure, thus creating a serious adverse reaction.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Is Adequately Y2K Prepared: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Y2K Contingency
Task Force reassured the public Tuesday that the ongoing
preparations for possible millennium bug are only for insurance
and do not indicate any impending disaster.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio speech, National Security Adviser Alexander
Aguirre, who heads the task force, dismissed speculations in some
quarters that the preparations betray the failure of efforts to
prevent the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
"We have made preparations because there could be some
accidents, there might be some problems that are not Y2K-related
or there might be one or two units or entities that are not Y2K-
ready so there might be some problems. But just the same we have
to be ready because that is how it should be," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
He said this is the reason why his office has been coordinating
with the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) and
Regional Disaster Coordinating Councils.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre maintained that the government and the private sector
are ready for the millennium bug in the seven mission-critical
sectors -- government services, health care, transportation,
telecommunications, utilities, finance and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a Y2K Action Center headed by Aguirre and Secretary
Filemon Uriarte of the Department of Science and Technology
started operating on a 24-hour basis.
</P>
<P>
The center has links to the NDCC to ensure quick response and
action to any emergency that may arise on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the Y2K Contingency Task Force is coordinating
with the media as well to allay public fears on the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
"We are just making sure. This will be nationwide. But our aim
is more to prevent confusion rather than expect a full-scale
disaster," he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces New Insurance Intermediaries  Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Starting from the last day
of this year, all registered insurance brokers in Singapore must
meet a minimum paid-up capital, maintain a net asset value and
professional indemnity insurance cover, submit audited annual
returns and pay an annual fee.
</P>
<P>
These newly-adopted requirements are contained in the Insurance
Intermediaries Act and new Insurance Intermediaries Regulations
announced Tuesday by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the
central bank of the city state.
</P>
<P>
MAS stated that brokers wanting to carry on insurance business
in Singapore will have to register with MAS and comply with the
regulatory requirements stipulated in the act and the new
regulations both of which will take effect from December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under newly-stipulated regulations, the minimum paid-up capital
the direct general, general and life reinsurance brokers have to
meet is 300,000 Singapore dollars (one Singapore dollar equals 0.
58 U.S.dollar). For direct life brokers the minimum paid-up
capital stands at 100,000 Singapore dollars, which will be
increased progressively to 300,000 Singapore dollars over a five-
year period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all brokers must maintain a net asset value of at
least 50 percent of their minimum paid-up capital at all times and
keep professional indemnity covers with deductible, if any, of not
more than 20 percent of the net asset value of the company. The
minimum cover for direct general, general and life reinsurance
brokers is one million Singapore dollars while for direct life
brokers is 500,000 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, all registered insurance brokers must submit
audited annual returns to MAS within 6 months from the close of
their accounting period and pay an annual fee which amounts to 7,
000 Singapore dollars for registered directed general insurance
brokers, 5,000 Singapore dollars for general reinsurance and
direct life insurance brokers, 2,500 Singapore dollars for life
reinsurance brokers. An agent or broker registered to place
business with Lloyd's in London will be required to pay an annual
fee of 5,000 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arising from the introduction of the new Insurance
Intermediaries Regulations, MAS introduced two consequential
amendments to the existing Insurance Regulations, repealing
Regulations 30 and 33 of the Insurance Regulations which provide
for exemption for overseas placement of direct insurance risks
with Protection &AMP; Indemnity Clubs and payment of annual fees to
act as agent or broker for Lloyed's in London respectively.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The hijackers of the Indian
Airline aircraft Tuesday rejected India's plea for the release of
children with their mothers being held hostage for the last five
days, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Indian negotiators have asked the
hijackers to "spell out what their expectations are and we are
awaiting their response."
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to divulge details of the talks between
the Indian negotiating team and the hijackers, owing to "delicate
and sensitive" nature of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India was exploring the option with Taliban for
storming the aircraft, he said, "It is difficult for me to discuss
the strategy or tactics to ensure safety and security of the
hostages and earliest termination of the hijacking."
</P>
<P>
He said that New Delhi was appreciative of the warning given by
the Taliban authorities that they would storm the aircraft if any
harm was done to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban is fully cooperating with the negotiating team,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Claims Doors Are Open to Local Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that doors remain open to the country's rebel party -- the
National Democratic Front (NDF) as far as peace talks with the
government are concerned.
</P>
<P>
National Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio
speech that the decision of the NDF's armed group to hold talks
with government should encourage the NDF to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The government cut off peace talks with the NDF of Netherlands-
based Jose Sison earlier this year after Sison stopped the peace
process to protest the ratification by the Senate of the
Philippine-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement on May 27.
</P>
<P>
"President Joseph Estrada has always kept the door open. Local
peace initiatives are welcome, and we hope the NDF will be
encouraged to renew peace talks with the government," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF's armed groups reportedly expressed the willingness on
Sunday to conduct peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
After been informed of their position, Estrada voiced welcome
to the development, saying it is a good welcome to the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the positive developments at home should encourage
the NDF to pursue the peace process with the government, rather
than give up on it at this stage.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the NDF must show some goodwill to prove its
sincerity in the peace process. But there is still no comment from
Sison, chief of the foreign-based NDF.

<HEADLINE> UN for Early Solution to Indian Plane Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Refusing to speculate on the
identity of hijackers of an Indian airliner, U.N. Coordinator for
Afghanistan Eric de Mul Tuesday hoped the on-going talks between
the hijackers and the Indian team lead to an early solution.
</P>
<P>
Mul made this remarks while talking to reporters at the
Islamabad airport soon after his return from southern Afghan city
of Kandahar, where more than 150 people have been held hostage on
the Indian plane.
</P>
<P>
To a question, he said hijackers speak English and Urdu. When
asked who they were, he replied, "I would not speculate on that."
</P>
<P>
"The Indian team continues to negotiate with the hijackers and
I am hopeful that they would be successful," he said, adding that
the Indian negotiators seemed to be experienced people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indian team held two rounds of talks through
walkie talkie at the airport on Monday night and one was going on
Tuesday when he was leaving Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he indicates any progress in the talks, the U.N.
coordinator said it is difficult to say anything at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the demands of the hijackers, Mul said, they told
him they would not like to repeat these which were well known to
the Indian government. He said the hijackers were demanding the "
release of a number of people jailed in India."
</P>
<P>
Mul said their demands have been conveyed to the Indian
authorities through different channels.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India was ready to accept their demands, Mul said, "I
think they are negotiating. It is not for me to say something. It
is not fair."
</P>
<P>
He said the good news was that the hijackers Tuesday morning
had allowed the supply of water and food in the plane because
earlier they had refused it.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Taliban role during the crisis, Eric said
they are working very hard and want immediate end to the problem.
</P>
<P>
About the U.N. role in the crisis, he said the United Nations
is now satisfied that the two sides would settle the problem and
it is trying to help in humanitarian aspect. "We have been able in
access and mobilizing the U.N. community and the International
Committee of Red Cross," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eric said he would either return to Kandahar on Wednesday or
Thursday.

NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Hijackers of the Indian
Airlines airbus have demanded release of 35 other hard-core jailed

<HEADLINE> India Using Hijacking to Malign Pakistan: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf Tuesday said he was suspicious of India'
s handling of the hijacking incident and stated "India may be
using the episode to malign Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"This was very odd, I would say, they allowed it (the plane) to
take off from Amritsar and they are telling us not let it take off
(from Lahore)," he was quoted by the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan as saying.
</P>
<P>
At Dubai, again, Musharraf said, the Indian government did not
ask United Arab Emirates authorities not to allow the plane to
take off. On the other hand, he said, the Indian authorities asked
Taliban authorities to prevent the plane from taking off in
Kandahar of southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"So this is what is causing a lot of suspicion, that they
wanted this plane to land either at Pakistan or in Afghanistan and
not anywhere else not even in India."
</P>
<P>
"Disowning their own plane and their own passengers and
therefore the ulterior motive or may be their intention of as
usual creating this hysteria of terrorism and trying to link
Pakistan or Taliban with terrorism that is the suspicion that one
get," Musharraf observed.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive quashed Indian charges that four of the
hijackers were Pakistani nationals. "I do not think this is
correct at all. I really do not know how they got these names and
how they are saying that because right from the beginning
throughout where they got their passengers."
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian officials had not even started negotiations
with hijackers when they leveled this charge. "I don't know how
they got this information. So I think this all is fabricated."
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said Pakistan had cooperated with India totally and "
we would like to cooperate with them totally. It's they who should
be responsible and they must deal with and resolve it. We will
cooperate with them."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan government has absolutely no involvement in this
whole operation and nothing has been done and we do not really
know the facts and the people who have hijacked," he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Must Adapt to Changing World: Lee Kuan Yew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore must change and
adapt to a changing world featured by the rapid advancement of
technology and economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
This was the advice offered by Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew to his fellow citizens while delivering a keynote speech
at a local Millennium celebration dinner on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need to change and adapt as the world around us changes,"
said Lee, founding father of the island state, at the dinner
hosted by Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that Singapore's sound fundamentals and rational
policies have contributed to the country's "V-shaped" recoveries
from the two recessions in 1985 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Remaining relevance to the world is one of the key factors for
the success of Singapore, he said.
</P>
<P>
But in a dynamically changing environment powered by hastening
technological advancement, the danger of becoming irrelevant is
high, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has to be nimble to take advantage of the rapidly
changing environment as the world's economy becomes increasingly
global, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to remain plugged into this global network, and be a
node in the international flow of trade, investment, knowledge and
technology," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
This requires Singaporeans to keep their markets and minds open,
to welcome foreign companies and talents, and be receptive to new
technology and ideas, he added.
</P>
<P>
World-class foreign talents will be a key to Singapore's future
success as the country is facing greater challenge from the best
multinational companies in the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Youth Convention Held in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATMANDU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever world youth
convention kicked off here Tuesday with the theme of "The Global
Youth and Twenty-First Century: Meeting of Minds on the Roof of
the World".
</P>
<P>
Altogether 140 delegates from 30 countries are participating
the week-long conference.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the meeting is to strengthen the bond of
friendship and unity among the youth of the world, regardless of
their race, religion, country and occupation, according to the
National Youth Forum Nepal (NYFN), the organizer of the convention.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to introduce Nepal's distinct social, cultural and
ecological wealth to the youth of the world, said NYFN.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Minister of Youth, Sports and
Culture Sharad Singh Bhandari said world youth have the
responsibility to preserve social values and human civilizations,
which are endangered by the development of science and technology,
although it has brought the world with prosperity.
</P>
<P>
This convention will provide a most proper forum for world
youth to share views on issues most concerned by the human beings,
such as world peace, human health, environment, HIV/AIDS, drug
abuses and so on, said Bhandari.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will hold seminars and present working papers on
five themes: global peace, world environment, drug abuse and HIV/
AIDS, human rights and cultural harmony.
</P>
<P>
Held at the turn of the new millennium, the convention is
expected to provide an opportunity for world youth to share,
understand, experience and appreciate diverse culture, traditions
and beliefs and human values along with a deeper understanding of
humanity, said the organizer.

<HEADLINE> Spain to Inject $10m into Kenyan Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish government will
fund a 740 million shillings (10 million U.S. dollars)
power-generating project in western Kenya, Kenyan Energy Minister
Yekoyada Masakhalia has said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Kenya Times quoted Masakhalia as saying the
installation of electricity is to be implemented within four
months.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the country would also receive the power under
the Rural Electrification Program initiated by his government, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with the French government to fund another rural
electrification project were virtually complete, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Masakhalia noted that the demand for electricity in
rural areas is still far from being satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Due to persistent droughts in the east African country, Kenya
has imposed power rationing since last September, which has
hampered the industrial sector and caused inconvenience to
residents' daily life.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Checking Rampant AIDS In Africa Calls for Intl Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Addressing the 11th
International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(ICASA) in Lusaka, Zambia in September, U.N. AIDS agency chief
Peter Piot called for measures with full human and financial
support to target the AIDS problem in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is a state of emergency," he said. "That requires emergency
measures, with full human and financial support. That is the only
way we might make progress."
</P>
<P>
 Africa, particularly the southern part of Africa, holds the
majority of the world's hard-hit countries. According to the
Joint U.N. Program on HIV/ AIDS, there are some 22.5 million
people living in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected with the
virus, which has killed some 11.5 million people. In 1998 alone,
AIDS killed an estimated two million Africans, or 5,500 a day.
</P>
<P>
In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and Zambia, current
estimates show that between 20 to 26 percent of people aged 15-49
are living with HIV and AIDS. AIDS is wiping out their development
gains and sharply shortening their life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, a total of 11.2 million children
has been orphaned by AIDS so far and by the end of the year 2000,
the number of AIDS orphans will rise to more than 13 million, most
of them living in sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations took an innovative approach in 1996, drawing
six organizations -- the UNICEF, the United Nations Devel -- together
in a joint and co-sponsored program, the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
In order to mobilize more resources, African countries,
together with UNAIDS co-sponsors and bilateral development
agencies, resort to international assistance for fighting against
AIDS in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In January 1999, leaders from over 20 African countries and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) held a summit in Algiers,
vowing to push forward regional and international partnership in
an effort to curb the No.1 killer in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a broad cross-section of African NGOs resolved in
Dakar, Senegal, in August this year to play an active role in
promoting the goals and activities of the International
Partnership against AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The International Partnership against AIDS in Africa is working
to fight the epidemic through strong national programs backed by
four main lines of action: encouraging visible and sustained
political support, helping to develop nationally-negotiated joint
plans of action, increasing financial resources and strengthening
national and regional technical capacity.
</P>
<P>
Experience from some African countries show that when
governments commit their political prestige and financial
resources, fully involve civil society and respond to the disease
through a wide range of prevention, care and support activities,
the rate of new infections can be slowed and societies can begin
to cope effectively with the HIV epidemic.
</P>
<P>
As one of the first countries in Africa where HIV was
recognized, the effect of the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was once
severe.
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, the Ugandan government responded to the AIDS
epidemic by becoming one of the first countries in Africa to
collaborate with the WHO to create a national AIDS control
program, which involves 13 AIDS Control Programs operating out of
12 government ministries.
</P>
<P>
Through carrying out extensive education campaigns aimed at
preventing further spread of HIV, promoting safer sexual behavior,
condom education and distribution and offering HIV counselling and
testing, there have been sharp declines in the rate of HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, for the first time, the National AIDS Control
Program, supported by the UNAIDS, carried out this year an
extensive consultation with a wide range of stake-holders,
including the business sector represented by the Zambia
Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Zambia
Federation of Employers and the Zambia Congress of Trade Union
from which emerged the process of developing a National Strategy
Plan for 1999- 2000.
</P>
<P>
All participants welcomed the establishment of a business
coalition on HIV/AIDS in the country to support and facilitate
activities on a regular basis. Some people described the positive
response by the business sector to form a coalition to fight the
pandemic as the only and last solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
However, despite these efforts and the progress made, the AIDS
problem still remains a dooming threat, with the situation worse
than ever.
</P>
<P>
The strongly felt negative consequences of the deadly AIDS
pandemic today will be present for many more years to come, not
only for the African continent, but for the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the whole regional and international community must
be galvanized to help resolve this problem.
</P>
<P>
"We must all join hands of the people of the world against a
silent killer that threatens our lives and the very fabric of our
existence," stressed South African President Thabo Mbeki while
marking the World AIDS Day on December 1.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Accord Drafting Committees to Resume Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The four committees
assigned to prepare a draft accord for the Burundi peace process
will resume consultations in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha
on 15 January next year, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The consultations would go on in the absence of the newly-
appointed international mediator, former South African President
Nelson Mandela, the independent Guardian newspaper quoted sources
of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) as saying in Dar
es Salaam on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources from the opposition group said the January
consultations will shed light on the possibility of reaching the
final solution to the Burundi conflict by March.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the groundwork should be accomplished
before Mandela joins the Arusha peace negotiations as
international mediator after replacing former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, who died in October.
</P>
<P>
After Mandela was appointed the new mediator at a Great Lakes
Summit early this month, he pressed Burundi negotiators to reach a
quick settlement in their 17-month-old peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at ending a six-year civil war between Hutu
rebels and Tutsi-dominated government, which has left more than
200,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands of others displaced.

<HEADLINE> EU to Lift Ban on Ugandan Fish: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is set
to lift its ban on the importation of fish from Uganda next month,
a Ugandan minister has said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Fisheries Fred Mukisa made the remarks when
reacting to news that a similar ban on Tanzania has been lifted,
according to a Monitor daily report.
</P>
<P>
Mukisa said that his ministry has tried its best to fulfill the
EU's hygienic demands in order to facilitate the ban-lifting.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member European bloc clamped a total ban on fish exports
from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in March 1999 following reports of
poison being used to trap fish in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Deaths and serious illness allegedly related to fish poison
were reported by Ugandan media, forcing the government to impose a
three-month domestic ban on the sale of fish on the local market.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Uganda National Bureau of Standards
Eva Kasirye Alemu was quoted as saying that the government had
obtained advanced machinery requested by an EU team to detect
poison in fish and fish products before they are exported.
</P>
<P>
Fish export is the country's third largest foreign exchange
earner following coffee and tourism. The EU ban reportedly causes
loss of some one million U.S. dollars each week. About 700,000
people are engaged in fishery-related industries across the
country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Automobile Manufacturers Prepare for WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese automobile
manufacturers are developing new sedans as China seeks entry into
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers say that sedans will be the focus of competition
within the huge Chinese automobile market.
</P>
<P>
At an automobile fair in Changchun, northeastern Jilin Province,
among the 160 different cars on display, including some imported
cars such as Benz, Toyota, Nissan, and BMW, most are below 300,000
yuan (about 36,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Xiali" produced in northern Tianjin and Changchun Volkswagen's
"Jetta", for example, range between 60,000 and 100,000 yuan (12,
000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The newly developed "Xiali" costs 92,000 yuan (11,000 U.S.
dollars). It can reach a speed of 165 km with five liters of gas
per hundred km and is considered the best choice of sedan for
ordinary Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
Some domestic producers say that China is highly competitive
with its heavy-duty trucks, but it will be difficult to compete
with foreign sedan manufacturers in production and costs.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say that some major parts of domestic cars such as
engines are imported or use manufacturing techniques from abroad,
so it is yet unrealistic for the Chinese market to independently
develop high-class sedans. However, it is possible for China's
nascent sedan market to satisfy the needs of a growing urban
middle class in China in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that imported cars will totally occupy the
domestic market after China's accession to the WTO.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Region Keep A Close Eye on the Mid West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- China's western regions are
no longer considered a burden, but an unprecedented business
opportunity for China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The mid western region covers 56 percent of China's territory. A
number of preferential policies next year will see the beginning
of large scale market reforms in the region.
</P>
<P>
Coastal provinces in the east will play an integral part in the
development of the mid western region. Du Bingjian, a senior
official in charge of foreign trade from Qinghai Province, who led
a business delegation to south China's Guangdong Province recently
for the purpose of scouting investment, said, "I hope the
industrial and commercial sector here will take up the government'
s initiative and invest in China's west." The delegation was
warmly received by numerous businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ziqiang, director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign
Trade Commission, said that opening up China's western region has
brought new prospects for economic development in China's coastal
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai cannot compare with Guangdong in the realm of foreign
trade. This discrepancy, however, has created investment
possibilities for Qinghai and the foreign trade boomtown of
Dongguan in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Boasting more than 10,000 overseas-funded firms, Dongguan is an
export processing trade center with annual exports of over 130
billion U.S. dollars. Plants in Dongguan plan to merge with raw
material suppliers in Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Take aluminum for example. There are some 200 aluminum
processing plants in Dongguan, and most of them depend on raw
material imports. Qinghai Province, however, is China's major
aluminum producer eager to exploit its resources.
</P>
<P>
Due to high, rugged terrains, many parts of China's western mid-
regions have not been regarded as suitable for economic reform.
Nevertheless, quite a few foreign transitional firms are ready to
invest in the region. At present, there are 16 transitional
companies looking into starting a number of projects in Qinghai
including hydraulics and gas exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The presence of these companies will undoubtedly create
enormous opportunities to expand business and create competition
for enterprises in China's east and south coastal cities.

<HEADLINE> New Findings Prove Xinjiang Under China's Rule 1,300 years Ago (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 4.6-meter-long and 3.4-meter-wide cave was found
accidentally by a young man of Uygur nationality, Abul'ahat Memet,
who was digging medicinal herb on a cliff in Kuqa, a prosperous
town on the ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The murals depict various familiar Buddhas worshipped by people
of the Han nationality, including Ambitabha and Mahasthamaprapta.
They portray a total 260 lifelike figures in different poses and
with various expressions. Many of the people are plump, reflecting
the Tang Dynasty's preference for heftiness as the highest form of
beauty.
</P>
<P>
Also found in the same area were some iron and copper workshops
and ruins of a castle which the archeologists believe was a
military site where soldiers of the Tang Dynasty were stationed.
</P>
<P>
The findings verify historical records which say that the
central government of the Tang Dynasty set up a prefectural
government in Qiuchi to handle defense and administrative affairs
of the Western Region. An estimated 30,000 soldiers were
dispatched to the area at that time, followed by a tide of Han
monks, craftsmen and their families.
</P>
<P>
Cultural relics experts theorized that the soldiers and
craftsmen from the central part of China built the grotto and
castle in the 7th century.
</P>
<P>
The local government has put up a door at opening of the grotto,
copied the calligraphy and paintings on the fresco and sent some
of the Buddhist statues to a nearby research institute to ensure
their safety, said Guo Mengyuan, a cultural relics expert in
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
"We will take measures to control the temperature and humidity
in the cave to prevent the paint on the fresco from peeling off,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> New Findings Prove Xinjiang Under China's Rule 1,300 years Ago (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists believe
that a newly-discovered Buddhist grotto in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region offers proof that the Muslim-
inhabited area was under Chinese rule 1,300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The grotto, nested in a 60-meter cliff in Kuqa County, the site
of the ancient Qiuchi State, contains a number of exquisite
frescos and Buddha statues similar to those in the world-famous
Dunhuang grottoes, which were built mainly during the Tang Dynasty
in neighboring Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Especially noteworthy is that many of the frescos were
inscribed with Chinese characters used by people of the Han
nationality, China's predominant nationality. The inscriptions
clearly show nine Han surnames, suggesting that the cave was
jointly built by Han people from different families. The experts
surmised from some of the name combinations that Han and local
ethnic people may have married.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the style of calligraphy, archeologists believe
that the inscriptions were written in the golden age of the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Chinese archeologists have
discovered a significant presence of the Han culture in an area
essentially inhabited by Uygur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery has been heralded as the most profound
historical testimony of the close relationship between Xiyu (the
ancient term for the Western Region, or areas west of Yumenguan
including what is now Xinjiang and parts of central Asia) and
China's central government during the Tang Dynasty," said Chen
Shiliang, a research fellow at the Grotto Research Institute of
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
"It supplies an important clue for the study of joint
development of Xinjiang by various nationalities and the cultural
exchanges among people with different ethnic backgrounds," he
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Vocational Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has put
20 million yuan (about 2.42 million U.S.dollars) into establishing
50 bases to train teachers for vocational schools, 35 in colleges
and the rest in vocational schools, said an official with the
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
According to today's edition of the "China Youth Daily", the
government has also designated a further 20 million yuan in
developing over 100 multi-media teaching software and over 1,000
teaching materials for vocational education in the next three to
five years.
</P>
<P>
Experts have urged reform for the country's vocational
education. Most Chinese vocational schools have used the same
teaching materials for decades, while almost all the teachers have
little practical experience, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
With increased enrollment for colleges, many junior high school
graduates choose to continue their studies, rather than going into
vocational studies.
</P>
<P>
Only half of the vocational school teachers have qualified
diplomas and many middle-aged and young teaches lack practical
pedagogical experience, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jing, an official from the Education Ministry, said that
the ministry will issue a teaching program for vocational high
schools in 2000, and the ministry will encourage university
graduates to become vocational school teachers.
</P>
<P>
Vocational schools will also adopt a credit system, he said.
Students will be able to choose their majors according to their
individual interests.

<HEADLINE> More Troops Deployed in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI)
sent reinforcement troops to Maluku where fresh communal clashes
killed more people, according to reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed broke out in the provincial capital of Ambon on
Sunday night after a bus driven by a Christian hit a 14-year-old
Muslim. Rival mobs used guns, slingshots and home-made bombs in
the clash.
</P>
<P>
Marines intervened and tried to separate the warring factions
by erecting barbed wire roadblocks. When the mobs bypassed the
barriers, the troops opened fire with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesian Observer, at least 38 persons were
killed in the clash and scores of shops as well as Silo church --
the largest in the city -- and a nearby mosque were burned.
</P>
<P>
In response to the latest violence, 435 soldiers from the
Awanglong Battalion left Samarinda, capital of East Kalimantan
Province, for Ambon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, communal riots which have swept some villages on
Halmahera island in Maluku this month have killed at least 100
persons and injured tens of others.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, the conflicts erupted
after a series of attacks by residents of Fritu and Gemaf villages
on December 18.
</P>
<P>
The security forces deployed in Weda subdistrict in Halmahera
island were unable to put the clashes under control.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of homes and houses of prayer in the island were
reportedly burned down while residents who were seeking refuge
also met difficulties on their journeys because of the severe
conditions of the damaged roads and bridges. Maluku has been
the site of bloody communal violence since the beginning of the
year. And more than 800 people have died.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri visited Ambon on December 12, pleading for an end to
the bloodshed and calling for religious tolerance.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Seizes Ephedrine Powder From Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities have
seized 134.5 kilograms of ephedrine powder, a main kind of raw
material used in producing amphetamine stimulant drug, from a
local woman in the country's Kalay township at the end of last
month, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was made by a combined team comprising the local
intelligence unit and police force, which searched the woman's
house in Tahan area of the township on November 29.

<P>
The ephedrine powder was found kept by the woman in
polyethylene bags in her house, it said.
</P>
<P>
Action has been taken against the woman under Myanmar's
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities said the country began to face the

<P>
MANILA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Millennium bug-busters in the
Philippines are to start a round-the-clock watch from Tuesday to
quickly respond to any disruptions linked to the computer glitch,
the nation's leading newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Manila Bulletin quoted Science and Technology
Secretary Filemon Uriarte as saying a millennium bug center is to
run day and night between December 28 and January 3.
</P>
<P>
The center is to revert to eight-hour shifts between January 4
and January 15, the secretary added.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the center will help coordinate technical support
for "critical" sectors, comprising finance, manufacturing,
utilities, government services, health care, transportation and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The project is led by retired General Alexander Aguirre,
President Joseph Estrada's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
The center also links with the government's civil defense
office to deal with any emergencies, Uriarte said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older generation
computers programmed to read the last two digits of dates.
</P>
<P>
When the date clicks to the year 2000, experts fear these
systems could read them as the year 1900, causing malfunctions.

PHNOM PENH, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Four provinces and
Sihanoukville in Cambodia held a joint ceremony in Sihanoukville
Monday to destroy more than 7,000 illegal weapons, the Cambodia
Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sar Kheng presided
over the ceremony attended by about 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The weapons, collected from Koh Kong, Kep, Kampot and Kompong
Speu provinces and from Sihanoukville, had been seized from
illegal owners or had been handed in voluntarily during the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
The event marked the sixth time that weapons were destroyed in
the country since the government issued a nationwide ban on
firearms in April and has taken drastic measures to crack down on
illegal possession of weapons.
</P>
<P>
As of late September, according to government figures, the
number of confiscated and voluntarily turned-in weapons had
reached more than 60,000, of which more than 20,000 were destroyed
by the government.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Opposition to Back Govt on Peace Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
United National Party (UNP) has responded positively to President
Chandrika Kumaratunga's call for support her in resolving the
protracted ethnic crisis, party sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The party, however, rejected Kumaratunga's invitation to
participate in the formation of a national government which was
made in her statement last Wednesday, when Kumaratunga was
declared winning reelection in the November 21 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
The UNP made the decisions Monday afternoon after a three-hour
joint meeting of the Executive Committee and Parliamentary Group
chaired by party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at the party's
headquarters in suburban Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The thinking of the party was that it should support the
government for the amicable settlement of the ethnic crisis as it
was a national issue, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983 Sri Lanka has been plagued by long-running ethnic
conflicts between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who are
fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the north
and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the party had drawn the majority of votes in some
areas where the number of voters of minority communities was high.
</P>
<P>
The UNP also held the view that they had an obligation to the 3.
6 million voters who supported Wickremesinghe at the presidential
election last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A firmer response can be expected after the government submits
its proposals for the resolution of the ethnic crisis, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The party rejected the proposal for a national government
because its supporters are still being harassed and assaulted by
government members and supporters, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They added that the government had not yet inspired the UNP
with sufficient confidence, given the turn of events before and
after the election.

HANOI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 400,000 Vietnamese
households have risen above the poverty line in 1999 with help
from the national hunger eradication and poverty alleviation (HEPA)
program, local English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate of the country, as a result, has dropped to
below 14 percent of the total households, 2 percent lower than the
1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
By the World Bank standard, Vietnam's poverty rate is currently
37 percent, compared with 58 percent in 1993.

Some 15 trillion Vietnamese dong (around 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars) has been mobilized over the past eight years and invested
in the country's HEPA program, under which there are many
investment projects in various domains with the aim of providing
the necessary conditions for poor people to develop production,
thus raising their income.
</P>
<P>
These projects focus on building infrastructure, promoting
production and side occupations, providing credit for the poor,
supporting the poor in education and health care and promoting
agriculture-forestry-fisheries and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
However, it is a long and difficult way ahead in 2000 to
achieve the target of reducing the poverty rate to 10 percent,
particularly in view of the fact that hundreds of thousands of
households in central provinces have fallen into poverty again
after floods ravaged the region in November and December this year.

<HEADLINE> ADB Grants Sri Lanka Loan to Contain Eroding Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (
ADB) has granted Sri Lanka a concessional loan of 40 million U.S.
dollars for a coast conservation project, the bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The loan, approved early this month, will cover half of the
cost for the 80-million-dollar Coastal Resource Management Project
which aims to minimize coastal erosion in critical stretches
through appropriate physical intervention, the ADB said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The six-year project will construct shoreline protection works
in the most- affected coastline in six districts in North Western,
Western and Southern provinces as the western and southwestern
coast alone loses between 200,000 and 300,000 square meters of
beach a year to storms and high waves.
</P>
<P>
The coast is home to one-third of Sri Lanka's 19 million
population and the highly productive ecosystem is an important
base for the country's growth as the coastal zone accounts for
nearly 80 percent of fish production and 70 percent of industrial
output.
</P>
<P>
The eroding coastline especially threatens economic activity on
the densely populated western and southwestern coasts.
</P>
<P>
The ADB-assisted project is expected to benefit small-scale
fishers and prawn farmers, fish processors, lagoon fishers, coral
miners, fish vendors and other workers in the fishing and allied
industries.
</P>
<P>
The project will also address other major problems such as over-
fishing, pollution and uncontrolled exploitation of lagoons and
estuaries, coral reefs and mangrove swamps, grass beds and other
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan is repayable over 24 years with an eight-year
grace period. The interest charge will be 1.5 percent in 24 years
and 1 percent during the grace period.

<HEADLINE> Banking System Situation in Bangladesh Continues to Deteriorate: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The overall situation of
Bangladesh's banking system has continued to deteriorate as the
nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) have reached a "near-critical
" stage while private banks have showed some improvement, The
Financial Express reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report prepared by the Bank Reform Committee for the
finance minister, the daily newspaper said the prevailing crisis
in the banking system was mainly the result of weak supervision by
the Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The 136-page report, after reviewing the situation of the NCBs,
private commercial banks and foreign-owned banks, concluded that
the banking system needed to be disciplined and efficient and it
made a 188-point recommendation to overhaul and revamp the country
's banking system.
</P>
<P>
The country's four NCBs, which account for over 60 percent of
the total deposits and 51 percent of loans, have been unprofitable
over the last five years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The default loan situation was the most critical and worrying
problem in the banking system, according to the report. "The
problem of a huge default loan has turned the total banking sector
into a risky business and posed a big obstacle to sound
utilization of capital and enhancing investment in the country's
economy."
</P>
<P>
The banks were forced to maintain a large margin of 7-8 percent
between deposit and lending rates, affecting both the saving
habits and investment initiatives, the report said, adding that
the margin was 1-2 percent in developed banking systems.
</P>
<P>
The NCBs also charged high interest rates on their lending in
order to maintain their surplus manpower and additional overhead
costs, discouraging honest entrepreneurs, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report listed political influence in granting loans, burden
of losses of state-owned enterprises, lack of accountability of
bank officials, surplus manpower and unexpected activities by
employees unions as some of the problems faced by the banks.
</P>
<P>
It added that the triangular role of the government as the NCBs
' owner, client and regulator left a negative impact on the
banking system and suggested the NCBs' autonomy and self-rule as
part of their reform and reorganization.
</P>
<P>
The report also proposed autonomy of the central bank to
introduce an effective supervision system and the bank's absolute
authority to ensure effective and legitimate application of a
regulatory framework to the commercial banks, which it said would
help the political government avoid pressure from different vested
quarters in establishing disciplines and rule of law in the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The country has attempted some reform measures over the last 10
years and the Bank Reform Committee was formed in late 1996 for
the purpose.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened Against Suicide Bombers in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police have
tightened security against Tamil rebels' suicide bombers in
Colombo, the capital city of the country, police sources said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Police Inspector General Lucky Kodituwakku
Monday evening called a meeting of all the deputy inspectors
generals of police and instructed them to tighten security in the
city and other areas amid reports that several Tamil rebels'
suicide bombers have infiltrated into Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, police said nine Tamil rebel suicide bombers have
entered the city and three of them are women.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the suicide bombers is to assassinate political
leaders and this has been brought to the notice of government
officials, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general instructed his deputies to take firm
action against all those attempting to create unrest and take all
measures necessary to maintain law and order in the country, they
added.
</P>
<P>
A bombing by Tamil suicide bombers took place at a
presidential election rally in Colombo on December 18, injuring
President Chandrika Kumaratunga and causing heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and
east of the island country.

<HEADLINE> FDI Inflows Expected to Rise in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Inflows of private foreign
direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh are expected to average
about 780 million U.S. dollars annually for the next five years, a
sharp rise from nearly 400 million dollars in fiscal 1997-98, said
a World Bank study available here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, "Foreign Direct Investment in Bangladesh: Issues and
Long-Run Sustainability," said trade and exchange liberalization,
current account convertibility and liberalization of the
investment regime have all helped bring about the increase in
investment.
</P>
<P>
It added that Bangladesh stands to gain from these inflows
provided it continues to allocate and manage these resources
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Foreign private capital flows into Bangladesh have taken three
forms: FDI, portfolio investment and foreign currency loans (
supplier credit or commercial loan).
</P>
<P>
FDI inflows are projected to average about 900 million dollars
each year during 2000-2010 while outflows would rise, on an annual
basis, from 129 million dollars during 1996-2000 to almost 600
million dollars during 2001-2005 and 1.2 billion dollars during
2005-2010.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector has been the principal recipient of the
inflows in Bangladesh but if the current trends continue, foreign
investment in telecommunication, manufacturing and services could
overtake energy by 2006.
</P>
<P>
To cover profit repatriation, interest payment and amortization
of private debt while enjoying the benefits of substantial FDI,
Bangladesh needs to augment its debt-servicing capacity through
sustained growth in exports, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The FDI and debt inflows have not helped boost foreign exchange
reserves so far and are not expected to do so over the next 10
years as both the FDI and private debt inflows in Bangladesh have
largely financed imports of machinery and equipment, according to
the study.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of FDI presents upside opportunities for
Bangladesh's economy, which requires massive investment in
infrastructure. But we must not lose sight of the downside risks
of this mode of external finance," said Zaidi Sattar, a World Bank
economist for the South Asian region and main author of the study.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Africa to Usher in 21st Century With New Hopes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- As the clock is ticking to the
dawn of the new century, Africa, the least developed continent on
the earth, vows to speed up its development in the long march to
catch up with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
While the outgoing 20th century is often described as "a
century of Africa's liberation and independence", the new
millennium can surely bring fresh hope and opportunity to the
backward continent which, like elsewhere, also has huge potentials
for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At present, the social development and economic recovery in
many parts of the continent are still hindered by some major
problems left over mainly from the colonial age.
</P>
<P>
One third of sub-Saharan countries are involved in civil
unrest, bilateral conflicts or regional wars. As a result, more
than half of Africans are still living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
However, African leaders have come to realize that the
continent can not afford to remain one of perpetual insecurity and
instability.
</P>
<P>
They share a unanimous view that peace and development are,
more than ever, two things that Africans have been yearning for,
as it was demonstrated in a declaration issued at the end of the
35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in
July.
</P>
<P>
This important meeting, attended by 46 African heads of state
and government, was undoubtedly aimed at making full preparations
for the African continent entering the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called on
leaders of African countries in his keynote speech to make "2000 a
year of peace and security in Africa," stressing that "Africa's
reputation as a continent at war against itself must be arrested."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo himself was elected as President of the Fourth
Republic of Nigeria and sworn in on May 29, an eye-catching event
of this year which has brought an end to the 16 years of
uninterrupted military rule in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
It is also encouraging to see in the year that African leaders,
"through concerted and collective efforts", succeeded in bringing
all players involved in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) -- which had sucked in five other African
countries -- and the two warring sides of Sierra Leone to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Both the peace agreements, one for the DRC signed in Zambian
capital Lusaka on July 10 and the other for Sierra Leone signed in
Togolese capital Lome on July 7, show that "where there is
determination and persistence, there is a solution to the crisis,"
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"They should encourage us to work even harder in order to
address the other hotbeds of tension which are still prevailing on
the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid and solve conflicts, the 53-member OAU and other
sub-regional bodies have adopted a series of measures and set up a
mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution,
which are meant to seek home-grown solutions.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the 16-member Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) approved the establishment of such a mechanism at
its 22nd summit which ended on December 10 in Lome.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism includes a Mediation and Security Council, a
multi-national stand-by force, and four Zonal Observation bureaux
to monitor and deal with potential conflicts in the sub-region.

<TEXT>
<P>
The formal launching of such a mechanism means the ECOWAS,
which has successfully quenched war-fire in Sierra Leone and
Guinea-Bissau in the past year, is shifting from its past role as
a "fire-fighter" to a more active role of peace-builder.
</P>
<P>
All these show the strong will of the African leaders and
people to seek peace and political stability which will pave the
way for social development and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 also witnessed that African countries quickened
their steps toward economic integration and cooperation, which
will get them better prepared for economic expansion in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
The 21 member states of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), at its fourth summit in May, voiced
their determination and commitment to the realization of the
COMESA free trade area by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three east African countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
in November signed a treaty for the reestablishment of the East
African Community. And the 16-member ECOWAS decided at its 22nd
summit in December to make January 1 of 2004 as the launching time
of the west Africa single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the existing 10 regional or sub-regional
organizations in Africa have respectively mapped out their
blueprints of integration and cooperation for the next 10 years,
which include the establishment of economic community, monetary
union, free trade area and customs union to facilitate the free
movement of goods, services, labor and capital across the borders
of member states. All these will lead to the final formation of
the African Economic Community scheduled for the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
Given the challenges of globalization and international
competition, "Africa's strength, both internally and in its
relations with the rest of the world, lies in pursuing vigorously
the goal of economic cooperation and integration," OAU
Secretary-General Salim said.
</P>
<P>
It is observed that for Africa, if the political stability and
economic integration serve the long-term interest of development
in the new century, its economic prospects will also bode well in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Africa's economic growth rate is predicted to reach five
percent in 2000, compared with 3.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the economic power-house of the continent, is
expected to see an economic growth rate of 3.7 percent in the
first year of the new century, representing a giant leap forward
after this year's expansion of 0. 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Morocco, another two important economies in Africa,
are expected to achieve growth rates of 3.3 percent and 5.1
percent respectively in 2000, up from 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent
of this year, according to IMF prediction.
</P>
<P>
Other African countries such as Tunisia, the Sudan, Cameroon,
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Rwanda and Mozambique may secure a growth
rate between four and five percent this year, and they are
expected to enjoy faster economic expansion in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report attributes the continent's faster economic
growth in the new century to the readjustment of economic
structure carried out in some African countries, apart from a
positive role that the regional economic integration will play.
</P>
<P>
All in all, Africa will lurch and march along its road of
development in the new century despite many daunting challenges it
is facing or will face.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders can feel the weight of burdens on their
shoulders more than ever before, because they need not only to
address the social, economic and political problems in their
respective countries, but also to brave the torrential wave of
globalization.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttle Discovery Returns to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle
Discovery returned to earth safely at 7:01 p.m. local time Monday
(0001 GMT Tuesday) at Kennedy Space Center after successfully
completing an eight-day mission.
</P>
<P>
The return ended the three-flight 1999 agenda of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
The space travel, originally scheduled for mid-October, finally
started on December 19 after nine delays. Although NASA officials
said the space shuttle was immune from the Millennium Bug, the
planned 10-day flight was cut to eight days to ensure its return
before the arrival of 2000 to avoid possible Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
The major task of the eight-day flight was rescuing the failing
Hubble telescope through three spacewalks. The telescope had
stopped working since mid-November after four of its navigational
gyroscopes went wrong.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts replaced six gyroscopes in Hubble with new ones
in the first spacewalk. A more powerful CPU chip was installed in
it in the second walk.
</P>
<P>
Spacewalk three had a radio transmitter, a digital recorder and
anti-rays sun shades put in the three-billion-dollar telescope.
</P>
<P>
The refurbished telescope was then released back into the orbit
on December 25.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will test the telescope within the next two weeks
and it is expected to resume space explorations on January 9, said
NASA.
</P>
<P>
Hubble has served in space for nearly 10 years since it was
first launched in 1990, sending more than 259,000 valuable
pictures back to earth.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will begin the new
millennium with more international trade agreements than any other
country in the region, an official from the Secretariat of
Commerce and Industrial Promotion (SECOFI) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Solis, the head of the Office of Commercial
Negotiations with Latin America, said the country has already
signed many trade accords and there are more to be completed
before the new year begins.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has signed separate free trade treaties (FTA) with Costa
Rica, Nicaragua, Chile and Bolivia, and one with Venezuela and
Colombia. Furthermore, it is holding negotiations for similar
deals with other Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
According to Solis, the FTA with Chile has been the most
successful in Latin America. In 1998, Mexican exports to Chile
exceeded its exports to other Latin American countries combined.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (
NAFTA) which also groups the United States and Canada, and has
arranged an FTA with the European Union. Meanwhile it continues
to negotiate similar accords with other nations.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is Latin America's largest exporter and the 13th largest
worldwide. Its external sales reached 124,391 billion U.S.
dollars in the first 11 months of the year, up 16.1 percent over
the same period in 1998.

the exchange rate will surpass the 20,000 sucres barrier in early
January 2000.

<P>
Joyce de Ginata, president of the National Federation of
Chambers of Ecuador's Small Industries, on Monday called for the

<HEADLINE> New Doping Allegations Hit Italian Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The future of Italian sports has
been threatened by a new drugs scandal on Monday after the country
's 22 top athletes were claimed involved in a blood doping program.
</P>
<P>
The list of the names published by Rome-based daily la
Repubblica included cyclists Gianni Bugno, Claudio Chiappucci,
Maurizio Fondriest and Rolf Sorensen plus all four members of the
Italian Nordic skiing team, Olympic champions for the 4x10 km
relay at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
The paper claimed they took the banned hormone erythropoetin (
EPO) in the early 1990s under the guidance of Francesco Conconi, a
professor at the northern Italian University of Ferrara and head
of its research center for applied biomedecine in sports. Conconi
had claimed the program part of a legitimate research into the
effects of EPO on amateur athletes.
</P>
<P>
The professor and some of the athletes denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) said the head of its anti-
doping commission Giacomo Aiello spoke to the magistrate
investigating Conconi on Monday following the publication of the
article. But it declined to give any details.
</P>
<P>
La Repubblica said the list was part of a cache of computer
files seized by a magistrate investigating the professor.
</P>
<P>
Italian soccer and CONI were rocked by a doping scandal a year
ago, which led to the resignation of CONI's president and the head
of the anti-doping panel and the closure of CONI's main Rome
laboratory.

<HEADLINE> Two Detained for Bathhouse Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 28 (Xinhua)-- Police have detained two
suspects in connection with a bath house fire that killed 20
people on Sunday in Changchun, the capital city of northeast China
's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
 Fire engulfed a bath house in the basement of the three-star
Hawaii Grand Hotel after a late night Christmas party, killing 10
men and 10 women.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, the police detained Han Zhenhua,deputy
general manager of the hotel, and a women who has been contracted
to run the bath house, Liu Jiting.
</P>
<P>
Han signed a contract with Liu in October this year allowing
Liu to manage the bathhouse with several partners.
</P>
<P>
Three of the 20 victims were believed to be burnt to death
while the others died from smoke inhalation, said Zong Yile, chief
of a local fire brigade.
</P>
<P>
The police, however, have not fully established the cause of
the accident or those killed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
Thirty one other people stranded the bathhouse were rescued by
firemen and promptly sent to hospital. Most of them have been
discharged but 11 are still being treated and under intensive
medical care.
</P>
<P>
The fire swept a 347-square-meter area in the basement. The
hotel is 17 stories high with 2 underground basements.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Hong Hu called a urgent meeting on Monday
morning urging officials to make sure that something like this
never happens again.
</P>
<P>
The deputy mayor of Changchun, Tian Zhonglin, convened a
separate meeting on Monday afternoon, attended by restaurateurs,
clubs managers, and bathhouse owners.
</P>
<P>
Tian reprimanded many present at the meeting for negligence.
Changchun will carry out thorough fire prevention checks in a
number of industries, he said. Those who are found not to strictly
abide to fire regulations will be sternly punished.

<HEADLINE> More Bank Cards For Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- More bank cards, credit
cards and IC (integrated circuit) cards have made banking and
transacting money more convenient and safe for Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In the past, children would send money to their parents each
month by post or on special occasions such as New Year's Day or
the Spring Festival, taking several days. But through a nationwide
bank network, money can be sent and received the same day.
</P>
<P>
The IC card is widely used in school cafeterias, supermarkets,
department stores, and widely used to pay for hotel and restaurant
bills, household electricity and water consumption and traffic
fines.
</P>
<P>
Bank cards will not bring great profits to banks in the short
term, but they will surely bring more deposits and therefore
increase bank loans. More than 130,000 residents in Changchun have
one or several bank cards.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that people will depend more on bank cards
than cash in the next few years.

<P>
SHENYANG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Museum of Chinese History
has agreed to preserve an ancient wine vessel made of wood
believed to be the largest wine vessel in China.
</P>
<P>
The rectangular red pine vessel, which is 262 centimeters long,
131 centimeters wide and 164 centimeters high, was donated Monday
to the Museum by the Jinzhou government, in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The wine storing in the vessel Known as "Wood Wine Ocean" was
a tribute wine drunk by members of the Qing (11644-1911) court.
</P>
<P>
When the vessel was unearthed, it contained more than four
tons of wine that had been stored for 151 years. The wine had a
strong flavor and was still drinkable. The vessel was one of the
four unearthed in June 1996 by Lingchuan Daoguang Group in Jinzhou
when the company was moving to a new location.
</P>
<P>
The huge vessel will be valuable for studying how wine was
stored during the Qing dynasty and for studying Manchurian culture.

<P>
NANJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- All four of China's vitamin C
plants have turned profitable despite a slump in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Most of the products of Jiangshan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
based in east China's Jiangsu Province are sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
The four plants produce some 5,000 tons of Vitamin C annually,
accounting for about one-tenth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
There were previously 28 Vitamin C producers in China, but most
of them fell victim to a global price war in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Kong Tai, president of the Jiangshan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,
attributed profits in China's Vitamin C industry to its
technological superiority. "All technologies used at our plants
were developed domestically and have reached advanced
international levels," Kong said.
</P>
<P>
However, these plants still face challenges from international
competitors such giants as the Swiss drug manufacturer Roche. A
new price war is sure to break out because the international
market is presently oversupplied, Kong added.

GUANGZHOU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, one of China's major economic powerhouses, is expecting
more than nine percent growth in its gross domestic product (GDP)
this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth will exceed the province's GDP growth goal of 8.5
percent anticipated earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Decrease of Corn As Staple Chinese Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Maize, which used to be
staple food for Chinese, is now mainly used for making fodder or
as industrial raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 70 percent of China's 110 million
tons annual corn consumption is used for fodder processing.
Amounts for food and industrial production account for less than
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Annual corn yield exceeded 50 million tons by the late 1970s,
mainly consumed as staple food. Wheat and rice gradually replaced
corn as the staple food in people's diet by the mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
" We get about 10 tons of corn each year. Only a small amount
ends up on the family table," said Liu Shun, a farmer in northeast
China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Exports of corn has increased since the 1990s. From 1991 to
1994 exports reached 36.86 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The structure of Chinese diet has changed considerably in the
past decade. The per capita consumption of crops decreased from
172.2 kg in 1980 to 111.6 kg in 1995. The consumption of meat, on
the other hand, has increased from 32.7 kg to 42.6 kg.
</P>
<P>
While a large proportion of corn is used for fodder, it is also
used for industrial raw materials such in the production of paper,
textiles, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have begun to grow varieties of corn for industrial use.
Jilin province has increased its growing area of corn specially
for fodder processing and industry to 400,000 hectares, said
provincial officials in charge of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the more consumption of meat will surely see
a further increase in corn used as raw material for fodder
processing.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Wine Vessel Donated to Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHENYANG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Museum of Chinese History
has agreed to preserve an ancient wine vessel made of wood
believed to be the largest wine vessel in China.
</P>
<P>
The rectangular red pine vessel, which is 262 centimeters long,
131 centimeters wide and 164 centimeters high, was donated Monday
to the Museum by the Jinzhou government, in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The wine storing in the vessel Known as "Wood Wine Ocean" was
a tribute wine drunk by members of the Qing (1644-1911) court.
</P>
<P>
When the vessel was unearthed, it contained more than four
tons of wine that had been stored for 151 years. The wine had a
strong flavor and was still drinkable. The vessel was one of the
four unearthed in June 1996 by Lingchuan Daoguang Group in Jinzhou
when the company was moving to a new location.
</P>
<P>
The huge vessel will be valuable for studying how wine was
stored during the Qing dynasty and for studying Manchurian culture.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- About 30 residents were
evacuated from their homes in the town of Carisbrook in central
Victoria state, southeast Australia, overnight after torrential
rains caused a local dam to leak, police said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said a hole in the dam wall sparked fears that homes in
the town's south could be inundated, so the residents were
temporarily evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Emergency workers sandbagged the area while engineers released
water in a controlled manner to ease pressure on the dam wall,
spokesman Senior Constable Rob Pugh said.
</P>
<P>
Most residents had since returned to their homes, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Remittance From Bangladeshi Expatriates Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi citizens working
abroad remitted some 71 billion taka (about 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars) to the country in the first 10 months this year, which
was 4.3 percent less than the corresponding period last year, the
latest issue of Economic Times weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 226,600 Bangladeshi people were employed in
different parts of the world during the period, representing a
rise of 3.27 percent over that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Manpower Ministry sources attributed the negative growth in
remittance to the surge of black market trading and the declining
flow of remittance from the Untied States, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Bangladesh has identified illegal black
market trading as the main hindrance to remittance earnings from
people working abroad, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The formal money remittance system is time-consuming and
services at the banks are poor, while money transfer through the
black market is faster and there is no harassment for both the
senders abroad and the beneficiaries in Bangladesh, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The country's target of manpower export for the year is 245,000.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's manpower export was 267,677 and the
remittance was about 1.6 billion dollars, 4.82 percent higher over
that of the previous year.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Anil Khurana, an ailing
Indian passenger of the hijacked Indian Airline plane, is in a
critical condition, his doctors said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Khurana was airlifted from Kandahar in southern Afghanistan to
Islamabad earlier by a U.N. aircraft after being released by the
hijackers. In Islamabad, he was immediately admitted to a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctors who are treating the Indian national
at Shifa International Hospital, the patient is a diabetic,
suffering from stomach ulcer and with an unstable heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
"We have conducted preliminary tests. At present his sugar
level is quite high. We are trying our best," the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Khurana, 40, had initially refused to leave Afghanistan unless
his brother, who is among the remaining over 150 hostages, is
released.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. authorities handed over the ailing Indian to the
Indian high commissioner at the Islamic airport on Monday
afternoon. Khurana was then admitted to the hospital as a private
patient.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Nail Clippers Go Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The appearance of a wee
product on the Chinese market has not only rekindled a dying small
hardware plant, but also fulfilled the hope of many here that one
day China would have its own home-made high-quality nail clippers.
</P>
<P>
"A newspaper article encouraged me when I was seriously
considering the future of my company last year," said Liang
Boqiang, manager of Zhongshan Julong Ornaments Company, previously
a small hardware workshop in Zhongshan city in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Liang was responding to a news article on Premier Zhu Rongji's
comments during a meeting with light industry representatives on
the poor quality of Chinese nail clippers.
</P>
<P>
China introduced its Double Arrows nail clippers in the 1930s,
but the market has been monopolized by foreign brands in recent
decades due to China's lack of technological improvement.
</P>
<P>
Liang and his men studied the operations of more than 30 nail
clipper producers worldwide, and then invested 10 million yuan on
building workshops, buying advanced equipment and hiring
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Less than a year later, the new "St. Allen" brand of snips
debuted and instantly caught the attention of both domestic
companies and their foreign counterparts. With all quality
indicators reaching or surpassing the Korean products, the new
product boasted one more competitive edge: it is 60 percent
cheaper than comparable Korean brands.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud to have won the biggest order (for nail clippers)
this year since 1949, and our sales revenue exceeded 40 million
yuan in less than eight months," Liang said proudly.

<HEADLINE> Circular on Boosting Army-Public Ties During Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- All army units and local
governments throughout the country have been urged to hold various
activities to strengthen ties between the military, government and
civilians during Spring Festival, the traditional Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese New Year's Day is the first day of the first month
of the traditional Chinese lunar calendar; this year's Spring
Festival falls on February 5, 2000.
</P>
<P>
A joint circular recently issued by the Ministry of Civil
Affairs and the General Political Department of the Chinese People
's Liberation Army (PLA) says that in January, 2000, a national
conference will be held to select a number of model towns where
local army units, governments and civilians have done an
outstanding job to bring their relations closer.
</P>
<P>
The circular urges the concerned parties to help tackle each
other's problems in their work and life. It also asks them to join
hands in criticizing the banned Falun Gong cult in an effort to
advance a scientific, civilized and healthy way of life.
</P>
<P>
Priority has been given to the settlement of demobilized
soldiers and their families and the timely resolution of all
related problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, historical, complex issues that have affected the
army-government-people ties must be dealt with in order to further
improve the relationship, the circular says.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Cult Crimes Exposed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been revealed that by publishing various materials, the
cult raked in a total of over 42 million yuan (about five million
U.S. dollars) in illegal profit.
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of its followers' wish to keep healthy, Li
Hongzhi proclaimed that medicine is an ineffective weapon against
illness, which he said is caused by their actions in former lives.
</P>
<P>
Many innocent people were fooled by Li and his lies. By the end
of August, more than 1,400 people had committed suicide, inflicted
self-injury or died as a result of refusing medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The crimes committed by the cult were alarming. The four
accused, following Li Hongzhi, jeopardized the safety of society
and broke the law.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zuofu, a noted legal expert at the People's University of
China, said that the judicial departments had been prudent in the
trial and sentencing of the four cult members.
</P>
<P>
The range of punishment was appropriate, and the sentences
based on law and fact, and embodied the principle of ruling the
country by law, he said.
</P>
<P>
After learning of the sentences, people from all walks of life
here said that the trial represented another victory in the fight
against the Falun Gong cult and offered a good opportunity to
educate Falun Gong practitioners.
</P>
<P>
They believed that those who continue to practice Falun Gong
will ultimately see the true nature of the cult, break from it and
return to their normal lives.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Cult Crimes Exposed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Four key members of the banned
Falun Gong cult were tried and sentenced here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
the trial produced sufficient evidence of the Falun Gong crimes
and the accused showed their remorse in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The four -- Li Chang, Wang Zhiwen, Ji Liewu and Yao Jie -- were
sentenced to 18, 16, 12 and seven years of imprisonment
respectively on charges of organizing and using the cult
organization to undermine the implementation of law, causing
deaths by organizing and using the cult organization, and
illegally obtaining state secrets.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong cult had evil intentions and endangered society
and the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Among the examples was the April 25 siege of the central
leadership compound Zhongnanhai by over 10,000 Falun Gong
practitioners from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
This incident seriously disrupted the work of government
departments and the daily routine of the general public,
threatened social stability and had negative political
consequences.
</P>
<P>
The accused employed various means to illegally obtain state
secrets which were later made public by the accused.
</P>
<P>
Court investigations also found that behind the virtuous facade
of the Falun Gong cult existed the greedy nature of its founder Li
Hongzhi and other members of the cult.
