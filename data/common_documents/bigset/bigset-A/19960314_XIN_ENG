<HEADLINE> AL Chief Calls for Continuation of Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Cairo-based Arab League (AL) Esmat Abdul Meguid today made a fresh
call for boosting the sluggish Middle East peace process following
the conclusion of an international anti-terrorism summit held in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Meguid made the call while has addressing the the 105th session
of the Arab League Council, which opened at the AL premises here.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that the AL's secretariat had sent letters on the
peace drive to the United States and Russia, co-sponsors of the
peace process, and to the Italian government that currently serves
as chairman of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that the convening of the anti-terrorism summit, or
summit of peacemakers in the Egyptian Red Sea city of Sharm el
Sheikh Wednesday, has demonstrated international determination and
world support for a peaceful settlement to the Middle East
problems.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East region does not stand alone in the face of
difficulties that obstruct the process of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
In its letters, the AL secretariat also emphasized the
importance of maintaining and bolstering the peace process, saying
that the Arab nation calls for peace and is keen on the prevalence
of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Meguid noted that the Arab world would never enjoy security and
stability until after a just and comprehensive settlement,
including the Palestinian people's right to establish its
independent state, is materialized in the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the summit of peacemakers, the AL chief said the
summit's closing statement clearly reflected the desire to salvage
peace at a time when all roads to peace seemed to have reached a
dead end.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Meguid stressed the necessity of a immediate
resumption of the peace process on all tracks without
delay.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Businessmen Urged To Reduce Food Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Congress of Trade
Union (ZCTU) today appealed to businessmen to reduce prices of
mealie meal (maize flour), the staple food of Zambians.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU President Alec Chirwa told reporters in northern city of
Kitwe that traders who sell food must also have a moral
obligation of selling products at affordable prices to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Chirwa said it was inhuman for the traders to hike food prices
which would make customers fail to buy and this would result in many
children dying from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
"The government must work hard to ensure that price of mealie
meal becomes affordable to every Zambian," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to improve the food marketing
system and promote competition among traders, adding that this
was the only way of reducing prices of food.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the average price of mealie meal has
been hiked by some 40 percent due to shortage of maize in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The preparations for Zimbabwe's
presidential elections, scheduled to be held this weekend, are
in place, a poll official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Election Directorate Chairman Mariyawanda Nzuwah said about
3.3 million U.S. dollars had been spent to set up some 3,049
polling centers for the presidential election, the second since
the country's independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Nzuwah said over 4.9 million registered voters of the
country's 10.5 million population are expected to go to the
polls, slightly more than those for last year's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede said the counting would begin
on Monday at 7:00 a.m. at all the counting centers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
And it was hoped that results would be ready the same day,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Current President Robert Mugabe is now only being challenged
by the opposition United Parties President retired bishop Abel
Muzorewa.
</P>
<P>
Answering whether Muzorewa will withdraw from the race, Mudede
said he had not received any notice of withdrawal from Mozorewa.
</P>
<P>
"If Muzorewa decides to pull out it would be very unfortunate
as everything is now in place. The ballot papers are already in
the hands of polling officers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports say if Muzorewa withdraws from the race, the
government will lose about 4.4 million U.S. dollars.

DHAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic incidents involving bomb
blasts and clashes marked the sixth day of the opposition's
non-cooperation campaign in the capital today, leaving about 15
people injured.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the official BSS news agency, six
people were admitted to hospital with bomb injuries, and two of
them were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Five people were also injured when a bomb exploded inside a
temple while four others were hurt in clashes between rival
political activists, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (People's)
League began their non-cooperation campaign last Saturday in a bid
to annul the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party-held February 15
elections and force the resignation of the present "illegal"
government to pave the way for fresh elections under a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that despite some incidents of clashes,
reports of violence were fewer today than the previous days, and
no one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
Banks and other financial institutions as well as a large
number of shops and other businesses opened today, although
automobiles remained off the road and train services were
disrupted due to blockades installed at different points.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the opposition parties had announced partial
relaxations of their campaign.

<P>
HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Over 4,000 offenders did
community service in Zimbabwe last year, indicating a 50 percent
increase over the previous year, community service national
coordinator Andrew Musengezi said today.
</P>
<P>
Musengezi expected a further increase in the service as
magistrates began to appreciate its importance.
</P>
<P>
He said the first two months of this year had already seen
1,000 people doing community service.
</P>
<P>
"In 1993 we had 682 cases and this rose to 2,494 in 1994 and
last year we had 4,578 cases. This shows that it is gaining
ground and even our default rate is around five percent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Community service was introduced in 1993 with the aim of
reducing prison congestion and rehabilitating offenders.
</P>
<P>
He noted the introduction of community service had seen the
stablization of the prison population.

foreigners who were on a scientific expedition in the deep areas
of Irian Jaya.

<HEADLINE> Britain in Grief After Scottish School Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain has been overcome today by
grief brought about by the killing in a primary school in the town
of Dunblane, Perthshire, central Scotland, Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
A gunman armed with four semi-automatic pistols burst into the
school gym and opened fire at 29 children aged four to six.
Sixteen pupils and their woman teacher were killed and another 12
children wounded. Then the gunman killed himself.
</P>
<P>
The British parliament is in a sombre mood today, united in its
horror and condemnation of the barbarous killing.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that Queen Elizabeth II and her daughter
Princess Royal Anne are to visit Dunblance next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The queen sent messages of condolence Wednesday to the victims
of the massacre and their families, expressing her "deepest and
most heartfelt sympathy."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major told the House of Commons that it was
an event of "almost unimaginable horror" and that many questions
would have to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government would consider the implications of
the massacre when considering future firearms legislation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is to visit the town of Dunblane Friday in a
non-political role as a representative of the whole of the House
of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who flew to the
scene, announced in the house an inquiry into the murderous event.
</P>
<P>
Forsyth told the House of Commons that senior Scottish judge
Lord Cullen had agreed to carry out the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
He said he had witnessed the scene which "encompassed both the
worst and the best of which humanity is capable."
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor leader Tony Blair expressed his grief
sentiments by saying, "Politics is silent today. We grieve. We
stand in solidarity with the community of Dunblane."
</P>
<P>
It was reported eight children and two teachers injured in the
massacre remain in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Five of the children are in intensive care and one is said to
be in critical condition.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Ambassador to China on Anti-Terrorism (by Wang Yadong and Gong Zhenxi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian ambassador to China
Moustapha Saphariny called upon today the Palestinian and
Israeli sides to take "necessary measures" to end the acts of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua reporters today, the
ambassador described the international Peacemakers Summit ended
Wednesday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm el Sheikh
as an important conference of pushing the peace process back on
track.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the conference would certainly not stop at mere
denunciation and condemnation of terrorism, but would have to go
deep into the causes that motivate such acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "Palestinians cannot always be the victim
of terrorist actions and their consequences. We can also call the
violence and massacres committed by Israeli extremists in Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem and in Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron terrorist
actions."
</P>
<P>
Saphariny noted that "the acts of terror cannot be stopped by
the policies pursued by the Israeli government, such as collective
punishments, closure of the borders and economic siege."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that Israel's such provocative policy
could only make the Palestinian National Authority appear in the
eyes of its people to be incapable of providing them with security
and means of livelihood.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the goal of the eradication of terrorism cannot be
achieved at a time when all the Palestinian people are suffering
under siege and closure," said Saphariny
</P>
<P>
However, the ambassador asserted that the Palestinian National
Authority has been taking measures, including the suspension of
the activities of paramilitary organizations, to restrict
terrorist operations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police force have detained many people. "Thus,
I may say that the Palestinian side has taken measures beyond it
capabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that agreements reached between Israel and the
Palestinians should be fully implemented in order to maintain the
momentum of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The timetable agreed, particularly, on the implementation of
the scheduled withdrawal of Israeli forces from Hebron by the end
of this month and the final phase of negotiations by the beginning
of May, has to be respected, the Palestinian ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> EAC Secretariat Inaugurated In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
ARUSHA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of the East
African Co-operation (EAC) is today inaugurated by the heads of
state of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Marking the historical event at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium
in Arusha, Northern Tanzania, were Kenyan President Daniel Arap
moi, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Other dignitaries attending the inauguration ceremony included
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu, Organization Of African
Unity (OAU) chief Salim Ahmed Salim and former Tanzanian
presidents Julius Nyerere and Ali Hassan Mwinyi.
</P>
<P>
In a warm and cordial atmosphere, the three East African
leaders appointed Kenyan Ambassodar Francis Kirimi Muthaura the
Executive Secretary of the EAC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
In their inauguration speeches, the three East African leaders
described the day as a historical one producing results of common
desire.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have begun to pay off since the three countries
started to seek the replacement of the defunct East African
Community by the currently inaugurated East African Co-operation,
according to the three leaders.
</P>
<P>
The presidents also commended the retired president Mwalimu
Nyerere for his recent effort to bring peace in Burundi and help
Burundians enter into dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Moi, who is the Chairman of the summit,
stressed the point that Africa would be built by Africans
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Let us work together, build East Africa that is stronger than
before," he appealed in the Kiswahili language.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Museveni underscored the need to improve
roads on the borders of the three countries in order to enhance
trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Besiness needs fast travelling, going out and coming back
home," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Mkapa expressed thanks to the fore-leaders
of East Africa, especially Mwalimu Nyerere, who was one of the
founders of the defunct East African Community.
</P>
<P>
"They had a great vision, and we are just following their
way," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
In his message of congratulation, OAU chief Salim Ahmed Salim
noted that one of the lessons to be learnt from the death of the
East African Community was that co-operation was vital for the
development of Africa and the people.
</P>
<P>
According to a communigue signed by the three presidents at
the ceremony, areas of co-opearation under the newly established
EAC involve transport and communication, trade, industry,
agriculture and education.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Among UK Ethnic Minorities Remains High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ethnic minorities have
not benefited as much as the white population from the improvement
in the labor market in the past year, the Central Statistical
Office's latest quarterly labor force survey showed.
</P>
<P>
In the year to autumn 1995, the unemployment rate among whites
fell from 8.5 percent to 8 percent, while that for ethnic
minorities fell from 19.1 to 18.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is relatively unusual in that unemployment and employment
among ethnic minorities are normally "supercyclical." Unemployment
is higher on average for minorities than whites, but tends to fall
faster in good times and rise more quickly in bad times.
</P>
<P>
Women from minorities have done particularly badly. Their
unemployment rate rose by 1.5 percentage points in the year to
autumn 1995, while unemployment rates decline for white men and
women and men from minorities.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rates vary widely between different minorities.
Last autumn the worst affected were Pakistanis and Bangladeshis,
with a jobless rate of 28.7 percent, followed by people of African
and Caribbean origin, with a jobless rate of 22.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Partner Not to Support No-Confidence  Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Party
(RPP), Nepal's third largest party and the ruling partner in the
present coalition government, would not support a no- confidence
motion against the government, it leader said today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President of the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (UML) Man Mohan Adhikari, RPP President Surya Bahadur
Thapa said his party could not cooperation with the opposition on
this matter.
</P>
<P>
The opposition would table a no-confidence motion against the
three-party government under Nepali Congress (NC) Party leader
Sher Bahadur Deuba in parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
It would be immoral for a responsible party to throw its weight
behind a no-confidence motion against its own government, he said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of his party, Thapa said in the letter that his
party's decision is to remain in the coalition government with the
NC and the Goodwill Party.
</P>
<P>
However, rumors had it that the RPP might split in the coming
days as party leaders differ over whether the party should support
the UML-sponsored no-confidence motion during a special session of
the House of Representatives beginning on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The RPP, which has 19 seats in the 205-member House of
Representatives, holds the balance for the survival of the present
coalition government. The UML and the main ruling NC party hold
88 and 86 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
The UML has offered to form an alternative coalition government
led by the RPP if the RPP supports its motion to topple down the
present NC-led government.

<HEADLINE> Delinquent Credit Card Loans Hit 10-Year High in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Delinquent credit card loans
in the U.S. hit a 10-year high in the fourth quarter of 1995, a
survey by the American Bankers Association (ABA) said today.
</P>
<P>
Credit card accounts that were 30 days or more overdue rose to
3.34 percent in the quarter, up from 3.30 percent in the previous
quarter and 2.93 percent in 1994. The fourth quarter levels
matched the previous high of 3.34 percent in the first quarter of
1991.
</P>
<P>
The amount of dollars owed on the delinquent credit card
accounts rose to 4.45 percent, up from 3.20 percent in 1994, the
ABA said.
</P>
<P>
ABA economist James Chessen said the increases in late payments
have slowed, but "the level of delinquencies is still alarming."
</P>
<P>
Economists blame the rising delinquencies on a variety of
factors, including stagnant paychecks, banks' mass marketing of
credit cards and consumer spending habits that disregard rising
personal debt.
</P>
<P>
The ABA survey also found rising delinquencies in closed-end
consumer installment loans, or loans with a specific payment date,
which crept up to 2.12 percent or 0.14 percentage points higher
than the third quarter of 1995. Delinquencies for direct auto
loans rose to 1.87 percent, up 0.22 percentage points from the
third quarter.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Ambassador in Peking on Amendment of National Charter (by Gong Zhenxi and Wang Yadong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PEKING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Ambassador in
Peking said today that the amendment of the Palestinian National
Charter depends on the extent of Israel's commitment to the
agreements signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview today with Xinhua, Palestinian
Ambassador Moustapha Saphariny also said Israel was still
expanding its settlements, constructing ring roads around
Palestinian towns and villages, pursuing the policy of collective
punishment, sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and delaying
the commencement of the final stage of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added that all such acts constitute hurdles that obstruct
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, hindering any action on the
part of the Palestinian National Council to amend the Palestinian
National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Saphariny called upon Israel to honor its pledges and commit
itself to the Palestinian-Israeli agreements, as the Israeli
people are now at the threshold of general elections while the
Palestinian people are at the door steps of the final phase of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question as to whether the Palestinian National
Council will approve the amendment of that article in the National
Charter which stipulates the destruction of Israel, or draw up a
new charter altogether, the Palestinian ambassador said that "to
amend the Charter or not to amend it, means the drawing up of a
new constitution that may be the focus of attention."
</P>
<P>
"But the amendment of the present constitution will have to
depend on the extent of rectification measures to be undertaken by
Israel during the period that precedes the convocation of the
Palestinian National Council," Moustapha added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it would be difficult for the Palestinian
National Council to agree on the amendment of the Charter so long
as Israel adheres to its procrastination and to the currently
pursued policies.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian ambassador went on to say that PLO Executive
Committee had, at a recent meeting, taken a decision that called
for the convening of the Palestinian National Council by the
beginning of May, indicating that a number of the council members
were already on their way to Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Greek Couple Accused of Embezzling Through Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A Greek couple has been accused
of embezzling an unknown sum of money through computer, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife team, whose names have not been disclosed,
were employed at the Finance Ministry's computing center and a
tax office respectively. The incident is believed to be one of
Greece's first ever white-collar computer crimes.
</P>
<P>
As a computer systems analyst and programmer, he regularly
broke into computer archives, in collaboration with his wife, a
cashier at a district tax office, to slash off zeroes. After
understating the amounts of actual taxes and fines paid by
taxpayers at the tax office, they would then forge receipts with
the reduced amount to pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
The scan was confirmed Wednesday by the country's Deputy
Finance Minister George Anomeritis who said this was an isolated
case and the ministry's computers were essentially safe from
hackers.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is not known the couple were working solely for
themselves or on behalf of others.

<HEADLINE> US Wholesale Prices Down 0.2 Pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices fell 0.2
percent in February, the first decline in eight months, according
to a report by the Labor Department today.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the drop in its Producer Price
Index (PPI) was the first since an identical decline last June and
it resulted mainly from a milder weather which restrained the
energy prices.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs dropped 0.7 percent after shooting up 2.9 percent
in January and 3.7 percent in December. It was the first drop
since energy prices fell 1 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Food prices also declined in February for the second straight
month, down 0.3 percent after a 0.2 percent fall a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the core
index rose a slight 0.1 percent. Overall, wholesale prices were
rising at a 0.9 percent annual rate during the first two months of
1996.
</P>
<P>
The PPI measures cost pressures before they reach the consumer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reported last week that 705,000 new jobs
were created in February, pushing the jobless rate down to 5.5
percent from 5.8 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported Wednesday that a
nationwide survey showed the economy was growing modestly in
January and February. At the same time, the survey found subdued
wage and price pressures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the employment figure and the Fed's report
on the U.S. economy may dim the hope that the Federal Open Market
Committee will cut the interest rate when it meets on March 26
despite the lower inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Launch Another Military Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Military Space Forces
will launch a military satellite from the Plesetsk Space Center
today, on the eve of the space center's 30th anniversary, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be put into orbit by a Soyuz-U rocket which
is scheduled to blast off at 20:40 Moscow time (17:40 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's first military satellite, a Kosmos-112, was
launched from Plesetsk in the northern Arkhangelsk region on March
17, 1966.
</P>
<P>
Since then, 62 percent of Russia's satellites and 40 percent of
the world's satellites have been launched from Plesetsk. The
satellite to be launched today will be the 1862nd satellite
lifting off from the site.
</P>
<P>
The space center had its highest launch rate in 1977, when 70
booster rockets placed 76 satellites in orbit. Plesetsk launch
programs employ boosters of the Soyuz, Molniya, Tsiklon and Kosmos
series to deploy communications, survey, navigation and weather
satellites.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Closes Office in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees today announced the closure of its
office in Santiago, Chile, on this very day after 22 years of
service to refugees and returnees in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The move came as a result of the democratic reforms and other
positive and fundamental changes in the Chilean society, which
makes the need for asylum no longer exist, according to the UNHCR
in a press release issued today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the office began its work in Chile in
1973, a week after the overthrow of the government of Salvador
Allende and has since helped thousands of foreign refugees to seek
a second country of asylum.
</P>
<P>
During 1973 and 1974, the office managed to find resettlement
for about 2,600 foreign refugees, who either returned to their
home countries or remained in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, more than 200,000 Chileans were also
provided with protection and legal assistance by UNHCR offices in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that Chile's democratic reforms beginning 1988
boosted the return of refugees to the country. In 1990, an
official request for UNHCR help in promoting voluntary
repatriation was put forward by the Chilean government. In early
1994, the UNHCR declared the Cessation Clause applicable to
Chilean refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR added that its Regional Office in Buenos Aires will
now be in charge of promoting refugee legislation and dealing with
individual cases in Chile.
</P>
<P>
A closure ceremony was held today at Chile's Presidential
Palace. Attending the ceremony was Assistant High Commissioner
Sergio Vieira de Mello, representing U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees Sadako Ogata.

BUCHAREST, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Central Bank has
removed from office 12 senior executives of the Dacia Felix Bank,
including the president and the governor, accusing them of
violating credit and foreign exchange regulations.
</P>
<P>
Dacia Felix, a joint venture bank, granted credits without
guarantees, resulting in large losses of funds. The bank's
supervisor Sever Muresan fled the country with 500 million
U.S. dollars recently.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the Dacia Felix executives has shocked Romanian
financial circles. Worried depositors withdrew around 1.6 billion
leus (560,000 U.S. dollars) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vasile Dumitru has been appointed the new governor of Dacia
Felix, which is based in the city of Cluj-Napoca in northwestern
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Central Bank, there are 23 commercial banks and 12
joint venture and foreign banks in the East European country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Concludes Solidarity Visit to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left Israel for Washington this evening, concluding his 22-hour
solidarity visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and some other Israeli
officials were at the Ben-Gurion Airport to see him off.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Wednesday night from Sharm el-Sheikh,
Egypt after attending the anti-terror summit in the aftermath of
the recent Hamas suicide attacks in Israel which killed 58
people. This is his third visit to Israel as U.S. President.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Clinton reiterated U.S. support for Israel in
the war against terrorism and for the continuation of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and other Israeli officials to discuss the issue of
anti-Israeli attacks by Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference along with Peres, Clinton announced that
the U.S. will commit more than 100 million U.S. dollars to assist
Israel in combating terror.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton said the two countries will immediately try
to conclude a bilateral agreement on combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the agreement, the U.S. will immediately
begin to provide Israel with additional equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
Both sides will join together to develop new anti-terror
methods and technologies. And both countries will work to enhance
communications and coordination in the war against terror.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who accompanied
Clinton on the visit, will remain here to finalize details of the
document.
</P>
<P>
Later, Clinton laid a wreath before the grave of late Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated on November 4,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Also this morning, the U.S. President held talks with Israeli
opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the country, Clinton gave a speech to the
Israeli people at the Tel Aviv Center for Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
He said that Wednesday's meeting in the Egyptian Red Sea resort
of Sharm el-Sheikh showed that Israel is not alone in this region
because leaders of 13 Arab countries attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that peace and security is inseparable. "Fear (of
terror) must be conquered, security must be achieved and peace
must be pursued," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know that Israel will never let her enemies achieve the
victory they seek and will never abandon the hope of peace," said
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Optimistic About Pakistan's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior World Bank Official
today expressed her optimism over higher economic growth in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Economic reports suggest that the prospects for higher economic
growth and lower inflation for the current fiscal year had been
improved, said Nieko Nishimizu, the Country Director of the World
Bank's South Asia Regional Office.
</P>
<P>
Nishimizu, who is about to complete a three-week visit to
Pakistan, said in a statement to the press that the stabilization
of the economy and improved conditions had now laid the basis for
meeting the long-term development challenges facing the country.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Pakistan's economic performance has responded
favorably to the government's timely and effective short-term
stabilization measures.
</P>
<P>
"My optimism is based on the favorable response by the economy
to the government's stabilization measures in recent months and I
believe that not many developing countries could have such a quick
response," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nishimizu urged Pakistan to broaden and deepen structural
policy reforms and institutional development to realize its full
growth and employment potential.
</P>
<P>
Observing that as a result of the government's Social Action
Program (SAP), progress is being made in delivery of basic social
services, she promised that the World Bank would continue to give
top priority to the SAP.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized the importance of a strong partnership between
the government, communities and Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOS) in delivering quality social services in a cost-effective
manner.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Pakistan, Nishimizu visited rural areas in
the Provinces of Balochistan, Northwest Frontier, Punjab and Sindh
and the Northern Areas.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM invites FYROM Counterpart to Visit Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos has invited his former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
(FYROM) counterpart Ljubomir Frckovski to visit Athens for talks
on bilateral issues, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman clarified however that the talks would not touch
on the issue of the neighboring state's name, regarding which
months-long negotiations have been going on in New York between
representatives of the two countries under the aegis of U.N.
mediator Cyrus Vance.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that the two foreign ministers would discuss
economic and trade relations between Athens and Skopje. The date
for the meeting would be set after the reply to the invitation has
been received, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Prime Minister Kostas Simitis
had separate talks today on the FYROM name issue with the
country's opposition party leaders with the aim "to create a
broad front on a common basis on the issue."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the talks, Simitis said that
Greece's relations with the FYROM were developing and "the ice is
melting." Economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
was developing "very positively" and only the problem of the name
remained, he said.

<HEADLINE> Killer Drug Should Be Dealt With Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sports chiefs should quicken their
pace to develop a new scientific way to remove the use of the
fatal, blood-doping drug erythropoietin (EPO), a leading doping
expert said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have been studying hard in the field and those from
Canada, France and the United States said on Thursday that they
had found a possible way of detecting the drug.
</P>
<P>
The tests can be carried out on both blood and urine but the
introduction of blood testing would certainly help improve the new
technique.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee, which presently conducts
urine tests, has decided against introducing blood testing at this
year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
By increasing the red blood cells which transport oxygen
around the body, EPO is perfect for athletes who want to cheat in
endurance events like cycling, rowing and distance running.
</P>
<P>
But it is suspected that at least 18 riders in Europe have
died after taking the drug since it was first developed in the
mid-1980s to treat kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
The substance is produced naturally in the body. But
scientists said artificial EPO can be fatal, leading to high blood
pressure, a thrombosis or a heart attack and also breaking down
the entire circulatory system.
</P>
<P>
The use of EPO was banned by the IOC in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Launches New EAC In Arusha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today appealed to East African countries not to repeat the
mistake that led to the collapse of the East African Community
(EAC) in 1977.
</P>
<P>
President Moi pointed out that the launching of the East
African Co-operation 19 years after the EAC collapse is a great
hope for a better future of East Africa.
</P>
<P>
President Moi was speaking from the Sheik Hamri Abeid Stadium
in Arusha, northern Tanzania, where he presided over the East
African Co-operation Summit and the inauguration of its
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Together with Moi at the summit were his counterparts Benjamin
Mkapa of Tanzania and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president said on the occasion that by launching
the co-operation, the three leaders have set the stage for their
peoples to benefit from the renewed spirit of East African unity.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, there is need to address critical issues such
as modalities for a harmonized monetary policy and the free
movement of people across national borders.
</P>
<P>
There is also need to consider the benefits to be derived from
common tariffs and the harmonization of customs services, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the region of the East Africa must not lose sight of
obstacles that can jeopardize the collective progress, he warned.
</P>
<P>
President Moi listed the serious economic problems in the face
of East Africa as heavy debt burden, poor commodity prices and
threat to their infant industries.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, the three East African countries are being
challenged by the emerging regional groupings such as the
European Union, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Such groupings are imposing trading conditions that restrict
the entry of goods from East Africa to their markets, he said,
adding that the East African countries need to enhance their
joint bargaining power in order to ensure their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Other dignitaries present at the summit include former
Tanzanian presidents Julius Nyerere and Hassan Ali Mwinyi,
Rwandese President Pasteaur Bizimungu and the Secretary General
of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Dr Salim Ahamed
Salim.

<P>
BEIRUT March 14 (Xinhua) -- Five Israeli soldiers were wounded
by guerrillas of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, this
afternoon in an attack at an Israeli military convoy in the
Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas launched the bomb attack at the Israeli convoy on a
road between the towns of Aishiyeh and Rihan in Jezzine area in
northern sector of the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in
south Lebanon, according to security sources in the south.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the guerrillas detonated an explosive devise
near the town of Aishiyeh at 3:20 p.m. (13:20 GMT) when the
Israeli convoy comprising several military vehicles was passing
by.
</P>
<P>
At least one vehicle was destroyed and five Israeli soldiers
were wounded, one of them is in dangerous condition, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>

military wing of Hezbollah, claimed responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
confirmed that the Israeli positions at Sejoud, Rihan and Khazlan
were attacked this afternoon by guerrillas, but denied any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces, on the other hand, bombarded today
a number of suspected guerrilla bases in Iglim Al-Toffah in the
afternoon, causing no casualties, the security sources said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Tells Press to be Discreet on Hawala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court has asked
the media to exercise restraint when reporting proceedings in the
hawala bribery case, the Hindustan times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case is an 18-million-U.S.-dollar bribery scandal
which involves more than 20 leading politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is the function and right of the media to gather and convey
information to the public about the case without violating the
presumption of innocence," said a three-judge bench during the
resumed hearing of the case yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The presiding judge, J.S. Verma, said "The media have an
obligation to report faithfully ... otherwise the reporting of the
case would become detrimental to public interest."
</P>
<P>
He said he was extremely disturbed at the kind of publicity
given to the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
"This case was like any other case for the court," Justice
Verma said. But media reports gave an impression as if he was
taking an unusual interest, he said, adding that this had
disturbed and embarrassed him.
</P>
<P>
Justice Verma, who recently gave an interview to a news
magazine, was reportedly annoyed by the report which portrayed him
as the hero judge in the hawala case.

<HEADLINE> Major Pledges to Get Tough on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today that his government will do all it can to stop foreign
terrorist groups from getting foothold in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told BBC Radio that he would introduce new
anti-terrorism legislation if necessary.
</P>
<P>
He pledged "any information on terrorism fund-raising, or other
support, will be carefully examined."
</P>
<P>
He said that it was time to look at those who used safe havens
abroad "to foster dissent elsewhere" to create a climate in which
terrorism could flourish.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the British government will open a debate
in parliament on the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the renewal of the act has been considered
natural after the Irish Republican Army plotted the huge bomb
blast in east London on February 9.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor, which has voted against the act's renewal
since 1982, has changed its position.
</P>
<P>
Labor parliament members have been told not to vote against it,
according to a BBC TV report this afternoon.

the recent bomb attacks in Israel and vowed to cooperate in
fighting terrorism and promoting peace.

school in Scotland, killing 16 children, a teacher and himself.
</P>
<P>

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Confusion reigns in Italy, where myriad political parties

The Wall Street Journal:

a punishing brake-plant strike, ended after an hour and 20

spend less money overseas and ordering Clinton to eliminate at

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Police Clashes with Clergyman's Supporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus anti-riot police clashed
today with the supporters of a clergyman, who appeared before the
Holy Synod, the supreme church body, facing charges of moral
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place when hundreds of people gathered
around the Archbishopric, in the walled city of Nicosia, to
support Archimandrite Pangratios Meraklis, who is a candidate for
the post of the Bishop of Morphou.
</P>
<P>
The anti-riot policemen used tear gas and clubs to disperse
the demonstrators as they were hurling stones, tomatoes and
fruits against police.
</P>
<P>
During the clash, a number of people, including policemen,
were injured and taken to Nicosia hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Chrysostomos has claimed to have evidence that
Meraklis was a homosexual. However, Meraklis vehemently denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has appealed for the restoration of law
and order and called on Meraklis' supporters to restrain
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told the press that
"I am really saddened by today's incidents. On behalf of the
government, I would like to express sadness for today's events
outside the Archbishopric."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted the government had a duty to "act and calm
things down and I appeal to everybody to restore calm."
</P>
<P>
"We have often said demonstrators are free to express their
feelings but, it must be made clear that police cannot allow the
crowds to enter the Archbishopric. Law and order must prevail,
unfortunately we have no other choice," Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that several shops in the main shopping areas
of downtown Nicosia closed because of the riot.

<HEADLINE> China Downs South Korea in Four-nation Women's Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, Zhenjiang Province, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Olympic and
world runners-up China held off a tenacious challenge from South
Korea to clinch their first victory at the third leg of the
four-nation women's basketball tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players, who lost to the Cubans at the opening game
on Wednesday, edged out the South Koreans 87-81 after leading
45-43 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese jumped to a 11-4 lead with an aggressive game, but
the South Koreans closed the gap soon with fast attack and
well-knit defense and surged ahead 12-11 on a three-pointer by
Kwun Eun-Jeong.
</P>
<P>
Then began a see-saw game. China had snatched lead twice
before South Korea made it 43-43 with only 30 seconds to go in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xin converted a foul shot to put China 45-43 ahead at the
interval.
</P>
<P>
China led by 11 points five minutes into second half, but their
lead was soon eroding under South Korea's well-organized attacks.
</P>
<P>
South Korea levelled the score 72-72 with four minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
In the final minutes, the host team cashed in on some defensive
errors by the South Koreans to pull away.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied with my team's performance today," said
Chinese head coach Chen Daohong. "The South Koreans snatched lead
from our hands quite a few times while we were leading by about 10
points. That means my team is inexperienced and immature."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese coach didn't see a bright prospect for his team in
the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I will be very happy with a third-place finish in Atlanta, "
Chen said. "If China falls to fifth or sixth place, I won't be
surprised."
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the world championship last year, we now only have
Zheng Haixia to count on," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 2.04-meter Zheng, the most valuable player in the world
championship, scored a game-high 37 points in Thursday's match and
pumped in 32 points, also a game-high, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other game, the United States beat Cuba 81-78
after leading the halftime 38-37.
</P>
<P>
The United States won the first two legs of the tournament in
Haikou and Zengcheng respectively a few days ago, twice beating
China into the second place.
</P>
<P>
Cuba placed third twice with South Korea last.

<HEADLINE> Draft Budgets for 1996 Are Feasible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The draft budgets of the central
and local governments for 1996 conform with the state properly
tight fiscal policy and are expected to support economic and
social advancements.
</P>
<P>
This is the view of an examination report on the draft budgets
made by the Financial and Economic Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The report was approved this afternoon at the second meeting of
the presidium of the Fourth Session of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Li Hao, vice-chairman of the committee, made the report at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft budgets, budgeted revenues will see
certain increases, the increase rate of budgeted expenditures will
be lower than that of budgeted revenues, deficit will be cut, the
state will increase investment in agriculture, science and
education despite the properly right fiscal policy, Li Hao said in
his report.
</P>
<P>
This year begins the country's Ninth Five-year Plan, and it is
of great significance to arrange and implement budgets of central
and local governments well, so that China's reform, development
and stability can maintain a strong momentum, Li Hao said.
</P>
<P>
For years, wealth distribution has tilted markedly in favor of
individuals. State fiscal revenues now account for less than 11
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Under such
circumstances, the functions of the governments cannot be fully
carried out, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In order to fulfill the 1996 central and local budgets, the
committee proposed that relevant departments strive to increase
revenues by collecting taxes strictly according to law, control
financial expenditures by implementing the tight financial policy,
strengthen disciplines and supervision over financial operations
and further carry out taxation reform.
</P>
<P>
Li said that implementation of the 1995 central and local
budgets was generally good, with state revenues increasing
considerably, and expenditures basically meeting the needs of
major projects and development of various governmental
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
But the problems are that the proportion of financial revenues
in GDP keeps dropping, enforcement of the tax law is lax, and tax
evasions are rampant, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that to realize the goal of boosting the nation's
financial strength in the next five years, the financial and
taxation mechanism must be further improved, initiatives of
governments at all levels should be brought into full play to
collect more and spend less.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments's responsibilities for
various revenues and expenditures must be clarified in accordance
with the budget law, and the financial transfer payment system
should be fully established and further improved, he added.

<HEADLINE> Draft Development Plan for 1996 Feasible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The guidelines, principles and
key points of the draft plan on China's national economic and
social development for 1996 are believed to be correct and various
indices can be taken as feasible.
</P>
<P>
A report on examininatopm of the draft plan for 1996, made by
the Financial and Economic Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), was approved this afternoon at the second meeting
of the Presidium of the Fourth Session of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Liu Suinian, chairman of the committee, delivered the report at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
China's economy is planned to grow by eight percent in 1996,
the increase rate of retail prices will be about ten percent, and
the increase rate of investment in fixed assets will be somewhat
32 percent.
</P>
<P>
The committee held that such indices are feasible and the
overall arrangements for 1996 appropriate, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In case some adjustments are needed to be made during the
course of implementing the plan, the NPC Standing Committee should
be notified on relevant readjustments in advance, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
To fulfil the national economic and social development plan
for this year, Niu said efforts should be made to implement the
principles and policies set forth by the CPC Central Committee and
concentrate on the two shifts in economic structure and economic
growth mode.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Niu also emphasized the importance of promoting
economic restructuring, rationalizing relations in various fields
and diverting the mode of economic growth to the improvement of
structure, management, quality and performance so as to promote
the sustained, rapid and healthy economic development.
</P>
<P>
A report by the NPC Financial and Economic Committee held that
the plan for 1996 lacks detailed measures to promote the shifts in
economic structure, strive for better agriculture harvest,
accelerate the reform of the state-owned enterprises and improve
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the committee suggested that measures be taken to
consolidate agriculture as the basis of the national economy and
to reinvigorate rural economy and enhance the effort in the reform
of the state-owned enterprises. The committee also urged on
improving economic performance, curbing inflation, readjusting
individual income distribution and promoting a coordinated
regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the state plan for 1995 has been well
implemented as the major goals for national economic and social
development have been met, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also warned of some contradictions and
problems which have long existed in economic life such as price
hikes, no substantial improvement in agricultural production
conditions and growing state debts.
</P>
<P>
So, he said, efforts should be made in 1996 to do well in
various aspects of work, which is of great significance to
fulfilling various tasks in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996--2000).
</P>
<P>
To meet the targets, leading officials at various levels should
enhance political work and step up anti-corruption drive to fulfil
the national economic and social development plan for the year
1996 and to lay a solid foundation for the accomplishment of
various tasks set forth in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, Niu
said.

ROME, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The strike of Italian soccer players
will go ahead as planned this weekend, announced Sergio, Campana,
head of the players union, in Milan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The players are in dispute with the Italian Football Federation
over payments into a players' pension fund and the use of foreign
players.
</P>
<P>
The strike means there will be no matches either Saturday, when
the four clubs involved in next week's European cup ties -- AC
Milan, Juventus, Parma and AS Roma -- were all due to play, or on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Campana had announced the strike on Monday and immediately
concessions were made by Italian Football Federation chief Antonio
Matarrese and a plea to call off the action came from the
government.
</P>
<P>
But Campana was unimpressed. He also boycotted a meeting in

<HEADLINE> Premier Raises Two Suggestions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) from Shandong Province gathered
in the Shandong room of the Great Hall of the People here for a
panel discussion this morning, with Premier Li Peng expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
"Selling cigarettes here?" he asked when the premier entered
the room at 9:00 in the morning. Several brands of cigarettes on a
side table had caught his attention.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has decided to ban smoking at public places, and the
regulation is to become effective on May 15 this year. The Great
Hall of the People should no longer sell cigarettes," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Attendants came forward to explain that all rooms of the Great
Hall of the People have been smoking free during the NPC and CPPCC
sessions in response to Beijing's smoking ban. Selling cigarettes
in the room was only a temporary service for the convenience of
the deputies.
</P>
<P>
The Cigarettes were withdrawn immediately, and workers of the
Hall said they will no longer sell cigarettes in the hall.
</P>
<P>
Li gave his approval. Turning to the deputies, he then said:
"I'm also a deputy, may I make a suggestion now?"
</P>
<P>
"I suggest that we people's deputies set an example in
observing the no smoking ban at public places," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Good!" deputies said, and applauded.
</P>
<P>
The meeting evolved into heated discussions with the premier
occasionally chipping in to ask questions or air opinions.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Jining Wang Renyuan said Jining's "liquor-making
industry has made marked progress" in the last five years, and the
sales volume of its two liquors "tops the list of liquor makers
nationwide..."
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me, I have a word here," Li said to Wang. "You have
mentioned the liquor-making industry, which I have been thinking
about for a long time."
</P>
<P>
"Our grain output, in stead of being too much, is not enough.
National liquor output is quite high, consuming 25 billion kg of
grain annually, which is not a small amount in my opinion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Now liquor-making factories are everywhere, and some have to
buy grains from other places to make spirits," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to consuming grain, spirits are also harmful to
people's health, Li said, adding that corruption often brews in a
cup of liquor.
</P>
<P>
"May I raise another suggestion? Can't we call on the society
to consume less spirits and replace them with fruit wines?" he
said. "In family gatherings or get-togethers with friends, fruit
wine can enliven the atmosphere as well."
</P>
<P>
Li said China has abundant forest resources, which provide
enough raw materials to make fruit wines.
</P>
<P>
"Drinking fruit wines is helpful to our health, does not waste
grain, and is good for social ethics," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputies again responded with applause.

Gyaincain Norbu, secretary of the autonomous regional committee of
the Communist Party of China, adding that "we will make sychronous
arrangements for economic development, urban and rural
construction and environment protection."
</P>
<P>
Another official, from the the autonomous region's Linzi
Prefecture, said: "We are aware of the far-reaching impact that
environment protection will produce on the generations to come and
we will never seek for temporary economic development at the
expense of environmental deterioration."
</P>
<P>
the success or failure of Linzi, with 70 percent of the Tibet's
forest resources, lies in the development of forests, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, Tibet has established 13 nature
reserves covering more than 320,000 sq km. Apart from the laws and
regulations enacted by the central government, it has also
unveiled a series of regional rules and regulations on
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Documents that have been released by the the Tibet Autonomous
Regional Environment Protection agency show that the Tibet Plateau
is one of the few areas in the world that have remained unpoluted.

<HEADLINE> India Unveils Plan to Boost Relations with ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- India has spelt out a
seven-point action plan for expanding its economic relations with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Indian
Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The plan was unveiled at a symposium here Wednesday by External
Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee as ASEAN has agreed to accept
India as a full dialogue partner of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee said the government and the business community of
India should make a joint massive effort for "India brand imaging"
in ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
This effort had to be preceded by expanding the information
base that India had on individual ASEAN countries and on the new
ASEAN matrix of trade and economic relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance to refurbish India's image in the
eyes of ASEAN's trade and industry sectors, which, he said, often
viewed India as an uncompetitive giant.

<HEADLINE> Artist Wins Copyright Infringement Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Wu Guanzhong, a famous Chinese
artist who paints in oil, has proved victorious in a two-year
lawsuit against Shanghai's Duoyunxuan Company and a Hong Kong
auction company for using his copyright.
</P>
<P>
The two companies auctioned a portrait of the late Chinese
leader Mao Zedong, called "Bombard the Headquarters", bearing Wu's
signature, in Autumn 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Mao wrote a Dazibao, or big-character poster entitled
"Bombard the Headquarters", marking the beginning of the ten-year
cultural revolution that he unleashed.
</P>
<P>
The picture sold for 528,000 HK dollars, but Wu denied having
painted the picture.
</P>
<P>
Before the auction took place, Wu had warned the companies
repeatedly, but they ignored his warnings. As a result, Wu turned
to Shanghai's Intermediate People's Court for help in July, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The court reached a verdict saying that both of the companies
should apologize to Wu publicly in newspapers, and each should
pay him 73,000 yuan in damages.
</P>
<P>
The auctioneers had an additional fine of 50,000 yuan, and
Duoyunxuan, of 30,000 yuan, and the money earned by the latter
from the picture was seized as well.
</P>
<P>
The Duoyunxuan company reportedly disagreed with the judgement
and filed a suit with the Shanghai Higher People's Court. The
appeal was denied Monday.

BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- High ranking officials from north
China's Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, and Hebei province,
will increase their cooperation to promote economic prosperity for
the Bohai Bay rim and the whole of northern China.
</P>
<P>
The two mayors and the provincial governor held discussions on
how to achieve common development while attending the ongoing

</P>
<P>
According to China's development program for the next 15 years,
which is being examined at the current NPC session, the Bohai Bay
rim along China's east coastline is one of the seven
trans-provincial economic zones. Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, along
with two peninsulas around the bay, constitute the main body of
the zone.
</P>
<P>
Ye Liansong, governor of Hebei province, said the Bohai Bay rim
will become the third engine for China's economic take-off by the
end of this century, after the Pearl River delta in south China
and the Yangtze River delta supported by an economic belt along
the river.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Mayor Zhang Lichang expected the rim to bring along
economic prosperity in northern China, as well as connect the
north with the south.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan expressed Beijing's wish to join in the
regional economy, which will promote the whole region's as well as
the city's economic expansion.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese General Liu Huaqing today
cited the principles of seeking truth from facts and giving
priority to the people's interests as an ideological and political
guarantee for achieving the country's development goals.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, a member of the Standing Committee the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark
while joining a panel discussion of deputies from Hubei Province
at the current session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Liu heeded carefully to the deputies' remarks on the progress
Hubei has made over the past five years and its development plans
in the future, coordinated growth of regional economy, poverty
relief work in old revolutionary base areas, the work of local
people's congresses and ideological and ethical development.
</P>
<P>
The correct implementation of principles and policies requires
a united and competent leadership, Liu said, urging local
officials to seek truth from facts and overcome formalism,
subjectivism and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some officials who like to report on achievements
rather than shortcomings, saying that "such work style must be
done away with."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there are indeed some officials who are
impure in Party spirit. They are motivated by personal desires and
do not think much about service to the people.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot resist the inroads by decadent ideas, and their
conduct will not only bring hazards to the cause of the Communist
Party but lead themselves onto the road of corruption and
degeneration," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"Ideological education among Party members should not be
slackened," he stressed, calling on officials at various levels to
exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the development of China's central and western
parts, Liu said the aid from the state is important, but the
province should better rely on itself for its economic expansion.

PARIS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- France's economic growth rate will
fall short of the projected 2.8 percent this year, Minister of
Economics and Finance Jean Arthuis said today.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that the growth rate would be a mere 1.5
percent in 1996, compared with 2.4 percent in 1995 and 2.9 percent

However, Arthuis stressed that the government would try to

France's public debt in 1995 amounted to 600 billion
U.S. dollars, 40 percent of its GDP, which was below the European
Union's ceiling of 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Individual Income Tax Cheat Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Wei Baolin, a senior engineer at
the Beijing Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute, is going
to have to serve two years in prison and pay 50,000 yuan in fines
for individual income tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's West District People's Court reached the verdict
today in the first instance of justice departments trying an
individual income tax case publicly, since administrative offices
for local taxes were established.
</P>
<P>
From October, 1992 to March, 1993, Wei had technology service
agreements with three companies in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and
Zhejiang provinces for the Zhenxing New Mining Technology
Development Company of Lengshuijiang City, Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
He received a total of 105,000 yuan for his services, but did
not report it to the local tax administration or pay for the part
of his taxes that was not covered by his employer and the three
companies.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's Criminal Law and tax evasion
regulations made by the NPC Standing Committee, the court ruled
that Wei was guilty of cheating on his taxes.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chunping, deputy director of Beijing's Administration of
Local Taxation, said that Beijing residents paid 320 million yuan
in individual income taxes last year, up 200 million yuan from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still many people who do not report their
income, but most taxes are withheld from employees' salaries by
their employers. As in many countries, it is still very difficult
to tax the upper-income bracket, because of their ability to
protect their income from disclosure.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 14 (Xinhua)-- A massive search operation is now
under way in Trincomlee's Naval Dockyard Complex in the east by
Sri Lankan army, navy and police units who are hunting for a Tamil
rebel suicide squad, according to defense sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said some 3,000 military personnel are involved in
the operation which was launched after the security authorities
received reports that a group of unidentified men had infiltrated
a navy facility last night.
</P>
<P>
They added that the search was under way and the 500-acre
complex has been surrounded by the military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched
suicide attacks in April last year destroying two navy gunboats
and killing 12 Navy personnel in the Trincomlee harbor waters near
the navy dockyard.
</P>
<P>
That attack also marked the LTTE rebels' resolve to end the
peace talks with the government, which were held in Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which has been fighting against the government for a
separate Tamil state since 1983, has conducted several devastating
bomb blasts in Colombo during the last three months, after the
government troops mounted military attacks on LTTE bases in the
northern Jaffna peninsula and recaptured the rebel stronghold
Jaffna city.

<HEADLINE> 58 Detained in Istanbul for Illegal Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Istanbul police have arrested 58
people who were involved in illegal demonstrations Wednesday night
which led to the injury of eight policemen.
</P>
<P>
According to a police statement issued today, the demonstrators
gathered without permission in the low-income neighborhoods of
Alibeykoy and Maltepe, chanting slogans to protest police who put
down the Gaziospanpasa rioting last year.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, most of them were members of outlawed
radical leftist organizations, built barricades and set fire to
tires to defy the intervention of local police.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia news agency reported that at least eight
policemen were wounded when the demonstrators threw stones and
Molotov cocktails at security forces.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul police have clamped strict security in Gaziospanpasa
during the first anniversary of the rioting.
</P>
<P>
Some outlawed groups thus switched to other neighborhoods to
continue their protest against the government and local police,
whom they accused as "fascists."
</P>
<P>
During four days of rioting in March 1995, 21 Alevis, members
of a Moslem sect, were killed when police clashed with thousands
of people protesting the coffeehouse slaying of a community member
by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Local media portrayed last year's rioting as "sectarian
violence" between Sunni and Alevi communities. But some analysts
said the rioting was in fact a result of unfair social system
which barred not only the Alevis but also all the poor population
from their rights of living.

<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Inner Mongolia, one of
China's worst hit areas for soil erosion, have made great efforts
to reclaim the land.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia loses an average of 300 million tons of soil a
year. The farmers and herdsmen have helped build reservoirs and
dams to help solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Now 42,000 square kilometers of Inner Mongolia's pastoral
lands, with its large tracts of desert, have been improved after a
10-year drive to fight soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the most effective way to curb soil
erosion is to combine capital construction with biological means,
combine land improvements with closed-off afforested areas, and
combining water and soil conservation with land exploitation.
</P>
<P>
From 1985, the local government mobilized farmers and herdsmen
to build 87 water storage dams and reservoirs, which have retained
2.17 million cubic meters of silt in each of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
They have also planted grass on 734,000 hectares of land, and
built 391,300 hectares of cultivated land. The green cover rate
has risen from 21 percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the development of a diversified economy, the annual
per capita income of farmers has increased by more than five times
over the past decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 deputies to the
current session of the National People's Congress (NPC) proposed
that academicians at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
be named at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
The academician system have been established both at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, according to a proposal submitted to the NPC session
mainly by Wu Shuqing, president of Beijing University, and Huang
Da, president of the People's University of China.
</P>
<P>
The academicians have not been named among scholars engaged in
social sciences, they noted, adding that the noted academician are
named in both natural and social sciences in most countries.
</P>
<P>
"Along with social changes in China, a large number of economic
and social problems are yet to be studied and solved, and the
country's cultural inheritances that cover the past 5,000 years
are also needed to be explored and sorted out," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of an academician system at the CASS is
expected to help encourage and advance researches in the sphere of
social sciences," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conditions for naming academicians in social sciences are
now available, because China already has some world-renowned
scholars who have obtained very high academic attainment and
scored major research findings and the CASS has accumulated a
plentiful amount of experience since its founding 18 years ago, Wu
said.

<HEADLINE> Special Economic Zones To Remain Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's special economic zones
(SEZ) should continue to be special to lead the country in
establishing a socialist market economy and making its economic
system conform to international practices.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Ge Hongsheng, newly
appointed director of the Special Economic Zones Office under the
State Council, reiterated that the central authorities' resolve on
the establishment of SEZs, the basic policies on SEZs, and their
status and functions will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Ge's remarks in a sense are directed at people's concern over
SEZs' prospects after the state withdrew last year from them
preferential policies in finance and taxation granted earlier to
SEZs.
</P>
<P>
The former governor of Zhejiang province acknowledged that
SEZs' past development was considerably fueled by the state's
preferential policies, especially those on finance and taxation.
</P>
<P>
He expected SEZs to keep its vitality and development momentum,
to be demonstrated by a higher economic growth rate than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
"However, they are not likely to claim the same high rate as
that during the past 15 years, neither will they make the same
pace in introducing overseas capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, China has set up five SEZs in Shenzhen, Zhuhai,
Shantou, Xiamenmm and Hainan. By 1994, overseas businesses had
invested 16.8 billion US dollars in 30,000 overseas-funded
projects there, accounting for one seventh of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Ge pointed out SEZs should focus on adjustment of their
industrial structure and improvement of product quality and
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"If the SEZs keep its growth rate at around 14 percent each
year, their total GDP will still double in five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of a new economic growth mechanism is central to
the SEZs' future development, he said. In a long-term view, the
SEZs' experience under equal competition conditions will be more
persuasive and they can serve a better role model for other areas
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ge stressed the SEZs will continue to carry out experiments in
financial, trade and commercial fields, giving equal treatment to
Chinese and overseas-funded businesses, and the social security
system.
</P>
<P>
"If they can make a success of experiments in reform of
state-owned enterprises, they will make a great contribution to
the country," he noted

<HEADLINE> Kipketer not Permitted to Run for Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Olympic Committee (KOC) on
Thursday formally rejected a request from its Danish counterpart
asking Kenya to permit world 800 meters champion Wilson Kipketer
to run for Denmark at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The answer was "No'," said Charles Mukora, chairman of the
KOC. "To run for Denmark at an Olympics, Kipketer must wait for
the Sydney Games. ... We stick to the rules of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC)."
</P>
<P>
Olympic Charter ruled that a person could only compete for a
country three years after being granted full citizenship.
</P>
<P>
It means that Kipketer cannot run for Denmark at the Atlanta
Olympics even if he is granted full citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Mukora is also a member of the IOC board and council member of
the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF).
</P>
<P>
Kipketer has not met the seven-year residency period to qualify
for Danish citizenship and efforts to have the Danish parliament
process his application in time for Atlanta Games have so far
failed.

<HEADLINE> Desertification From Improper Water Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers say that the
cause of the increasingly more severe desertification in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over past two decades has
been irrational use of water resources.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by the Xinjiang Institute of
Biology, Pedology, and Deserts under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, most water in desert streams is either used up by
irrigation or held in reservoirs without passing through the
desert, resulting in deterioration because of drought and
diminishing ground cover.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 20 years ago, desertification was
the product of warfare, excessive cutting of trees, and irrational
cultivation practices, which damaged vegetation, but in the past
20 years, the process was the result of water depletion.
</P>
<P>
It has been determined that 40 percent of desertified land in
the Taklimakan Desert, China's largest, is the result of such
irrational use of water.
</P>
<P>
The "green corridor" along the lower reaches of the Tarim River
is now deceasing and deserts at both sides of the corridor are
eating away at the oases at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are taking steps to develop more water
conservation projects and to raise the utility rate of water
resources.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Trade Exceeds 1 Billion Dollars Since 1989 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cumulative trade between South
Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) between
1989 and 1995 exceeded 1 billion U.S. dollars, according to the
National Unification Board (NUB).
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1995, the value of inter-Korean trade,
beginning in 1989, stood at 1.22 billion dollars on an approved
basis and 990 million dollars on a customs cleared basis, said a
report issued by the NUB today.
</P>
<P>
If South Korea's 150,000-ton rice shipment to the DPRK last
year is included, the figures will increase to 1.43 billion
dollars and 1.22 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
South Korea suffered a 770-million-dollar deficit in trade with
the DPRK during the seven-year period.
</P>
<P>
Direct trade accounted for only 5.3 percent of inter-Korean
trade, which was conducted mostly via third countries, the report
added.

<HEADLINE> Basic Law on Taiwan Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwan deputy to the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature in session here,
proposed today enacting a law on the "one country, two systems"
policy governing reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin Liyun, member of the NPC Standing Committee and
vice-chairperson of the NPC Overseas Chinese Committee, said,
"Taiwan compatriots still have limited understanding of the
details of the 'one country, two systems' policy."
</P>
<P>
She proposed enshrining the state policy of "one country, two
systems" in a law, which she said may be called "Basic Law of the
Taiwan Special Administrative Region."
</P>
<P>
This, she said, will enable Taiwan compatriots to have a
clearer understanding of the benefits of Taiwan's reunification
with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Enactment of such a law has to have participation from Taiwan
compatriots, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that, in the current situation of tense relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, high-level political
talks between the two sides cannot be expected for the moment.
</P>
<P>
She said, however, discussions between people of the two sides
should start first to explore the feasibility of a basic law for
the Taiwan special administrative region and contents to be
included in the law.
</P>
<P>
Academic symposiums and contacts and exchanges between people
of the two sides should increase so that the non-official views of
the people can be reflected in the future law, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
She said: "A basic law of the Taiwan Special Administrative
Region will serve to protect the fundamental interests of the
Taiwan people and call in question the legality of a law on
cross-Straits relations announced unilaterally by the Taiwan
authorities."

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Warns Against Rushing Into Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the Bank of
England, Eddie George, warned Wednesday of the economic risks of
pushing ahead with a single European currency by 1999 and said
Britain would not be damaged by opting out of the project.
</P>
<P>
Referring to rising unemployment in the European Union (EU),
George said recent developments had increased his doubts about
moving ahead with Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"If EMU goes wrong, it could become a serious source of
political discord within Europe rather than contributing to
European harmony," he told a Royal Institute of International
Affairs conference here.
</P>
<P>
The governor also clashed with his European counterparts by
insisting that the pound did not have to rejoin the Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM) in order to retain the option of taking part in a
single currency.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be mindless to insist that a currency which
had achieved stability outside the ERM be prevented from taking
part in the EMU.
</P>
<P>
If there were doubts about the likely success of the single
currency, George said, Britain should stay outside. With sensible
monetary policy at home, Britain would not suffer from remaining
outside, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no particular reason to suppose that the British
economy would be damaged by exercising that option," he added.

ISLAMABAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A national census may be held
in Pakistan by the end of this year, although there are a lot of
related problems remaining to be solved, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly, Pakistani Minister for
Finance and Economic Affairs Makhdoom Shahabuddin said that the
government was anxious to hold a census in the country in the
interest of making future development plans.
</P>

"We are trying to work out a methodology for the census," he

governments is also needed.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have examined the example of Turkey and the use of
armed forces to impose a one-day curfew for holding the census."
</P>
<P>
"However it is not workable for Pakistan," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the census will cost heavily and need large-scale
mobilization, which the provincial governments considered as major
obstacles to the census.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Provided with Vast Business Opportunities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's long-range development
program being deliberated in the on-going session of the National
People's Congress (NPC) will strengthen China's national strength
and offer enormous business opportunities for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy will maintain a growth rate of eight
percent in the next five years. Such a rate is encouraging for the
world as a whole at a time when the economy is slowing down in the
West, said Prof. Wang Linsheng, former vice-president of Chinese
University of International Business and Economics.
</P>
<P>
If China can achieve its goals for economic and social
development over the next 15 years, the living standard of its
people will be markedly improved, hence a large consumer market,
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He said the rapid economic growth itself means a rise in
business opportunities. The vast and expanding market potentials
will increase business returns for foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics available show that China made use of 160
billion US dollars in foreign investment during the five years
from 1991 to 1995. China ranks the second in term of the total
amount of overseas investment it has used, only next to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Dai Yuanchen, a highly-acclaimed economist from the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, said China must undertake major
technological upgrading and transformation to bring about a shift
from traditional planned economy to market economy and from being
extensive to intensive.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in addition to aid from the state, a large number
of enterprises require foreign funds and technology in updating
their technology and products so as to meet the demands of
international competition.
</P>
<P>
According to the development program, China is expected to
produce another 25 million to 35 million tons of food grain
annually by the year 2000. To this end, it will intensify its
efforts to seek for more foreign capital in agriculture production
in which several dozen billion US dollars have already been
invested.
</P>
<P>
The program says China is going to pursue a development
strategy aimed at narrowing regional disparity between the
coastal regions and the central and western parts of the country
in the next 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Old People Getting Healthier, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Old people are getting healthier,
and extra years of life no longer mean extra years of disability,
an American survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Arthritis, high blood pressure, circulation problems, dementia,
stroke, blocked arteries and emphysema were becoming less
prevalent among the old every year, said Kenneth Manton of Duke
University in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Manton has been conducting a survey of the health and
lifestyles of 20,000 American men and women over the age of 65
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Medical problems doctors considered normal in 65-year-olds
often did not appear now until people were 70 or 75, Manton said
in a report in the New Scientist published here today.
</P>
<P>
"It raises the question of what should be considered normal
aging," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medical advances such as hip replacements and beta-blockers to
control high blood pressure were two obvious causes, he added, but
more subtle factors might be at work too.
</P>
<P>
Better nutrition in the early years of the century gave today's
old people a much better start in life than the previous
generation enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
However, not all diseases are in retreat. Some cancers and
bronchitis were increasing among the elderly, reflecting smoking
and air pollution, Manton said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the decline in the number of disabled
elderly had saved the U.S. government 200 billion dollars since
1982.

<HEADLINE> Progresses Made in Reform of State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
progresses last year in its reform of state-owned enterprises, an
official in charge of economy and trade said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, said a pilot project was carried out in state
firms in 18 Chinese cities last year. Measures taken include
increasing the firms' capital, carrying out technological
renovation, relocating surplus workers, and having poorly managed
enterprises merged or go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
He said, eight billion yuan was added to the firms' total
capital last year, resulting in a lower debt-to-asset ratio.
</P>
<P>
Wang cited the example of Shanghai. The debt-to-asset ratio for
state firms in the city dropped from 71 percent to 69 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
He said 23.5 percent of the added capital was used for
technological upgrading and product quality improvement.
</P>
<P>
He said that nationwide 366 firms were merged and 103 went
bankrupt last year, with 1.4 million workers retiring from active
duties.
</P>
<P>
The minister said enterprise mergers and bankruptcy are meant
to establish "a system of the survival of the fittest", to
revitalize the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the considerable progress made in reform of state
firms, deep-rooted problems of the economic system are yet to be
addressed, and the reform remains an arduous job, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, state-owned enterprises reported losses of 40.9
billion yuan, up 20.5 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Wang said, problems handicapping state firms are all
long-standing ones, and their causes are complicated. The state's,
enterprises' and workers' ability to stand drastic changes have to
be taken into consideration in reform.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of state-owned enterprises will be a gradual process,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The race to win multi-million
dollar orders from China's Three Gorges Dam Project is to be
launched soon.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Germany, Japan, Canada, Russia and other
countries are already lining up on the starting line waiting for
the bidding to start in the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
China is inviting international bidding for the purchase of 14
water turbogenerators for the construction of the Three Gorges
Project, the world-largest water-control scheme.
</P>
<P>
Yangtze River Three Gorges Development Corporation, the major
undertaker of the project, describes the next round of bids as one
of several large-scale international contests the country will
invite for the project this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, China invited international bidding for the
purchase of concrete lifting and transporting equipment. A dozen
manufacturers from the Republic of Korea, Japan, Russia, Germany,
and the United States competed for the bid.
</P>
<P>
China is evaluating the bids and is expected to announce the
results soon, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee the successful damming of the Yangtze
River in 1997, China is busy inviting bids both at home and
abroad, in order to excavate earth and place concrete on schedule.
</P>
<P>
This year's domestic bids for the project include: second phase
of a cofferdam on the river, equipment for monitoring the security
of the project's water-conservancy system, construction of a dike
on the river's left bank, the third phase of the project's power
plant, among others.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of a permanent ship-lock whose bidding result
was announced in early March will involve a total investment 2.5
billion yuan (about 301 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Steps Up Efforts to Improve Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has launched a
ten-billion yuan drive to improve its environment.
</P>
<P>
Although China's largest city has effectively put environmental
pollution under control, it should step up its efforts to embark
upon more environment-related projects to further improve the
environment, Gu Yongkang, official of the municipal environmental
protection bureau, said.
</P>
<P>
Projects for this year include sewage treatment, drinking water
improvement and afforestation, and will involve an investment of
more than ten billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, local authorities have spent five billion
yuan on environmental improvement. The relocation of polluting
factories is one of the major measures to improve the
environment. Since 1986 Shanghai has relocated 105 heavily
polluting factories, the resettlement of which cost 2.77 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Huangpu River is one of the major drinking water sources
for the 13 million urban residents. Over the past decade, some 40
industrial pollution sources and 80 domestic animal farms at the
upper reaches of the river have been treated, and the overall
discharge of pollutants brought under control. A 6,000-m long and
50-m wide green belt was also created to protect river sources.
</P>
<P>
The control of discharge of waste gases from motor vehicles is
also one of the focuses for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The environmental treatment relates not only to the improvement
of the investment environment but, more importantly, to the
improvement of the quality of life for local residents, said Gu
Yongkang.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Law Amendments For Better Checks and Balances (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To ensure a fair trial, the draft amendments stipulate that
courts no longer have to conduct overall investigations into cases
in advance to prevent any bias at trial, and their sole role is to
evaluate evidences and conduct court debates between prosecution
and defense.
</P>
<P>
Many people find it difficult for individuals to bring a
lawsuit to the court under the current system. The draft
amendments enlarge the scope of lawsuits brought to court by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
According to the amended law, the scope of cases to be directly
handled by prosecuting bodies has been narrowed to cases of
corruption, dereliction of duties, and infringement upon the
rights and interests of citizens by govenment functionaries.
</P>
<P>
The revised law has a total of 226 articles, from 164 in the
existing law.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the Criminal Procedural Law in 1979 laid a
legal foundation for judicial bodies to correct wrongs committed
in the ten years of the chaotic "Cultural Revolution", and paved
the way for successful trials of Lin Biao and the notorious "Gang
of Four" afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Law Amendments For Better Checks And Balances (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- "No one shall be deemed guilty
without conviction by a court of law."
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most conspicuous stipulations in draft
amendments to China's Criminal Procedural Law.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments are intended to improve the country's
legal system and better protect the legitimate rights and
interests of Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments are being deliberated by some 2,900
deputies attending the current National People's Congress (NPC)
session.
</P>
<P>
When the amended Criminal Procedural Law is adopted at this
session, the law is expected to become effective at the start of
next year. Many important criminal procedural principles will be
applied in judicial practices with past malpractices done away
with.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing Criminal Procedural Law, the police
may detain and investigate suspects all by themselves without
involvement by other law-enforcement bodies, and prosecutors may
convict and decide prosecution exemptions for suspects of petty
crimes without a court trial.
</P>
<P>
Detention of suspects for investigations, as an administrative
compulsory means, was intended to establish the identity of
criminals, especially those who are always on the move or who do
not tell their real names.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, almost 80 percent of crimes in the
country were committed by roaming criminals.
</P>
<P>
But because of a shortage of funds, a deficiency in police
manpower and poor equipment, detentions often lasted longer than
the time limit.
</P>
<P>
The amended law will stipulate that the police have to obtain
an arrest warrant from the prosecuting organ for the detained
within three days of detention. The time limit may be extended by
one to four days under special circumstances. For major suspects
of repeated crimes, gang crimes and crimes committed by those on
the move who refuse to tell their real names, the time limit may
be extended to a maximum of 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Public Security Li Jizhou said such a revision
will not undermine the police's capability to combat crimes. "It
will compel the police to improve their work efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will abide by the law "without any
reservations" when it becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting organs have until now had the right to "convict"
and then give "prosecution exemption" to petty offenders.
</P>
<P>
"This evidently violates the principle that a suspect can be
found guilty only through trial by a court of law," said a judge
from the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments allow lawyers to offer legal services to
suspects after the latter are questioned for the first time by the
police, and defendants have the right to employ lawyers when their
cases have been transferred to the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing law, a defendant is allowed to have
access to a lawyer at least seven days before the court opens.
</P>
<P>
Such a revision gives more time to lawyers to prepare for their
cases, and will help better protect the rights and interests of
the accused.

<HEADLINE> Forum on Mekong Subregion Development Held in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The third forum on investment
opportunities in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) was held here
today with the participation of representatives from Cambodia,
China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam as well as some 300
South Korean businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The one-day forum, co-sponsored by the Federation of Korean
Industries (FKI) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), was
designed to explain the GMS projects sponsored by the ADB to South
Korean firms interested in possible investments.
</P>
<P>
The forum featured comprehensive presentations on the region's
developmental opportunities, particularly in transportation,
telecommunications, energy as well as the role of the ADB in such
development.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Asian and European leaders at the first
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Bangkok agreed to develop the Mekong
subregion, an area bounded by Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming address, FKI Chairman Chey Jong-hyon said,
"the South Korean business community is now considering the Mekong
river area as one of the most attractive areas."
</P>
<P>
"Korean businessmen are very well aware of the rich natural and
human resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Such economic potential, if combined with the experience and
top-of-the-line technology Korea has acquired during its
three-decade industrialization process, will certainly bring
economic prosperity to both the Mekong subregion and Korea," Chey
said.
</P>
<P>
The FKI chairman called for an active participation of
neighboring countries in GMS projects and assistance of
international financial organizations such as the ADB and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
Following Chey's keynote address, representatives of the six
countries delivered speeches and several ADB officials, including
Vice-President Noritada Morita, provided some background
information about the Mekong projects.
</P>
<P>
The fourth forum of its kind will be held in Manila, the
Philippines, late next month.

<HEADLINE> Ports of Entry Development in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
in south China now has 28 ports of entry, which played a leading
part in the growth of local foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The region has nearly 1,595 km of coastal lines and 1,050 km of
land border lines.
</P>
<P>
There were only three ports before 1992, so the bulk of import
and export commodities had to be transfered to other provinces for
loading and unloading purposes, greatly restricting the
development of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi now ranks the 3rd place according to the number of
ports of entry among all provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions in China, with 17 Category-A and 11 Category-B ports of
entry.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the role of the ports, the region reaped an aggregate
import and export volume of ten billion US dollars-worth during
the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), a 2.63 times increase over
the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
And last year a total of 977 million US dollars-worth of
exports were delivered from the ports, up 11 percent over 1994.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of young peasants in
central China have not only escaped poverty, but have become
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
The rags-to-riches success of Henan province's peasants has
been attributed to various kinds of technical training courses.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up many technical service centers and
technical training bases at provincial and county levels, where
young peasants can consult, and learn practical skills.
</P>
<P>
Many have become wealthy and helped others become well-fed
after studying at the training bases.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of rural youth in the province will master
at least one practical skill, over 20 percent have hopes of
getting wealthy and one million will escape poverty in the next
five years, thanks to efforts by local governments.
</P>
<P>
Henan now boasts more than 20,000 youth service organizations
and entities, which are playing a very important role in rural
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The province has 12.5 million young peasants, whose action has
an important bearing on the process of poverty-relief and
modernization in rural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Western Europe saw an unexpected
sharp rise in new car sales last month, prompting carmakers into
believing that the industry's prospect this year might be less
pessimistic than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the European Automobile
Manufacturers's Association show that new car registrations in
Western Europe last month rose by 10.2 percent to 1,041,500,
compared with 945,000 in February last year.

<HEADLINE> Experts Encouraged to Play Bigger Role in Jiangsu's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A "brain trust" of experts has
helped east China's Jiangsu Province make great strides.
</P>
<P>
The senior experts now have a say in government decision-making
on economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been more than 800 agents providing
consultations for governments at various levels across the
province, involving over 11,000 experts and professors.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 70,000 senior scientific and technological
experts, Jiangsu has been practicing a policy during the past few
years, encouraging experts to offer advices on economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of last year, 38 academicians, 46 middle-aged
and young experts, who have outstanding achievements and 15
celebrities became members of the province's first brain trust.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, they presented more than 200 proposals,
concerning the overall and long-term development of science and
technology, the internationalization of the local economy, and the
common progress of regional economies.
</P>
<P>
A beach development proposal has resulted in a provincial plan
for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996--2000) to enclose 39,000
ha of tideland, develop 10,500 ha of enclosed idle land, and
transform 20,000 ha of middle- and low-yield land.
</P>
<P>
Experts in various cities and counties also enjoy a say in
local government decisions.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the consultancy committee composed of 39
experts in Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu, offered their
opinions on more than 170 projects, which added a total economic
benefit valued at about 100 million yuan (nearly 12 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some cities and counties have started to seek senior
consultants from all over the country, as well as across the world.
</P>
<P>
Haimen City employed 134 experts in a bid to boost its economy,
mainly in material industry.

"Forerunning growth of the eastern region has been scored, to
some extent, at the expense of central and western parts," said Li
Chunting, governor of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
"However, he added, in a long-run, only when the economies of
the central and western parts are developed can the whole
country's comprehensive national strength be enhanced and the
economy in eastern parts be beefed up with staying power," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Quicker economic growth in central and western parts will be
conducive to the coordinated development of the national economy,
said Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted that this will also open broader space for Shanghai's
pillar industries and newly-emerged economic sectors, and benefits
industrial restructuring and upgrading of products in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, a noted Chinese economist, held his unique view on
narrowing of the east-west gaps. A complete and unified domestic
market should be established so that capital can flow to interior
areas where there are abundant natural resources and labor
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Then the state should help make up the deficiencies that have
arisen from the weak infrastructure facilities and shortages of
managerial personnel and technicians in the interior regions, Wu
said.

Other policy measures are listed as rationalizing the prices of
resources products so as to enhance the self-development abilities
of the central and western regions, improving the investment
environment and directing more foreign funds to these regions and
strengthening economic association and cooperation, encouraging
the eastern areas to invest more in the central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
Such new policies set by the central authorities are welcomed
by NPC deputies from the central and western regions who
reiterated their resolve to seize the opportunity and turn
advantages on the concentration of resources in their regions to
economic advantages.
</P>
<P>
According to the authoritative personalities, by early next
century, more than 50 percent of the electric power to be required
in China's coastal eastern parts will come from the central and
western parts, and over 60 percent of the demand for raw materials
is expected to rely on supplies from the country's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province, northwest China, remains one of the most
underdeveloped areas in the country, but governor Tian Chengping
shows full confidence in invigorating his province economically.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai boasts abundant hydraulic power resources along the
upper reaches of the Yellow River, and its potential of mineral
resources which will be worth as much as 17.5 trillion yuan (about
2.1 trillion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The governor held that China's development must rely on
domestic resources, just as what the United States did to develop
its western parts and what Japan did to develop Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian, salt lakes in Qinghai have the potential of
producing 97 percent of the country's potash fertilizers. Owing to
inadequacy of exploitation and utilization, China has to spend
some 200 million US dollars importing more than two million tons
of potash fertilizers every year.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai will work hard to expand potash fertilizer projects as
part of its effort to revitalize local economy and ease the
shortage of potash fertilizer in eastern parts, and the entire
country at large, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies from the central and western parts said the
disparities between their areas and the eastern parts can only be
narrowed in the wake of common development.
</P>
<P>
With plentiful regional resources, vast markets and cheap
labor, the central and western parts are imbued with tremendous
potentials for future development and have attractive reciprocate
rate for investment.
</P>
<P>
On the other way round, the advantages of the eastern areas in
capital, technology, talented people, information and manufactured
goods are just what the central and western parts aspire.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies from economically booming eastern China also show
their understanding of and support for the country's policy of
coordinating development between different regions.

<HEADLINE> China Striving to Narrow Regional Disparity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The growing regional disparity
between the eastern and central and western parts has been a focal
point at the annual sessions of the National People's Congress
(NPC), and deputies to the on-going session have finally got an
answer for it.
</P>
<P>
The central and western parts are referred to the provinces and
autonomous regions except for the 12 coastal provinces and
municipalities. The following statistics can give people a gist of
an idea concerning the widening regional disparity:
</P>
<P>
-- China's national average annual increase rate of gross
national product (GNP) was 11.7 percent in the five years from
1991 to 1995. The figure climbed to 16 percent in the eastern part
while it was only nine percent in the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1990, the eastern areas produced 55.4 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), whereas the central and
western parts, which occupy 85 percent of the territory, turned
out only 44. 6 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
-- Farmers' per-capita income in the east is more than 15 times
that in the west.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1987, China shifted its development strategy
eastward by granting preferential policies to coastal provinces in
financing, credit loans and investment, which accelerated economic
growth in the east but resulted in a widening income gap.
</P>
<P>
The widening regional disparity is inevitable for a country
ready for an economic take-off, said Cui Lintao, party secretary
of Communist Party of China (CPC) Xi'an City Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, 67.4 percent of the total fixed
investment were poured into the country's eastern areas while the
central and western parts got only 32. 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Fifth Plenary Session of the CPC Central
Committee set forth a proposal guiding the drafting of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1995-2000) and long-term objectives to the
year 2010, which unveiled China's decision to promote coordinated
regional development in the next five to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To implement the principle, the Chinese government plans to
introduce five major new policy measures for the development of
central and western parts in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
These policies include stepping up resources development and
infrastructure projects; adjusting the distribution of processing
industries by guiding the transfer of resources-processing and
labor-intensive industries to the central and western parts of the
country.

<HEADLINE> China Works to Protect Large Historical Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out
detailed plans to protect large historical sites which have long
been regarded as the hardest of cultural relics to conserve.
</P>
<P>
Large historical sites include tribal sites, city ruins, and
remains of military defence works, water conservancy facilities,
mines, and groups of palaces.
</P>
<P>
China has around 200 large historical sites, accounting for
more than one third of the total cultural sites under state
protection.
</P>
<P>
To avoid conflicts between the protection of cultural relics
and the increasing demand for land in the light of rapid economic
development, departments of cultural property have made close
explorations at the sites. They have made it clear which parts of
the sites should be protected.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to solve problems of damage to the
environment of the sites. Beijing, for example, has stopped
production at several factories because they were blamed for air
pollution at the Zhoukoudian site, where Peking Man lived some
450,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, where
a great number of large historical sites are located, 2,000 square
meters of new buildings at a group of imperial palaces of the Tang
Dynasty (618-907) have been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
The country has also encouraged local people to take part in
the protection of the sites.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an hired local farmers to work as guardians of the sites,
and mobilized locals to help develop tourism at the sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon veteran Mick Harford
was charged with misconduct on Thursday following a F.A. Cup
quarter-final between the team and Chelsea on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old striker, who has 14 days to appeal, is in
trouble with the Football Association for an insulting gesture at
Chelsea fans rather than a verbal assault on the Chelsea's
manager Glenn Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
An angry Harford, who had just been substituted, had to be
pulled away from the Chelsea bench, when with language described
as "vile and atrocious" he allegedly accused Hoddle of having
"sorted" the referee in his favour.
</P>
<P>
"Mick Harford has been charged with misconduct for giving a
two-fingered gesture to the crowd when he was substituted during
Saturday's Cup tie," said F.A. spokesman Steve Double.
</P>
<P>
"He is charged with bringing the game into disrepute for the
gesture rather than the verbal outburst on the evidence of the
fourth official."
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon disputed the referee's decision to penalise them for
a back pass handled by their goalkeeper from which Ruud Gullit put
Chelsea ahead from a free kick.
</P>
<P>
But Wimbledon stormed back to equalise and earn a replay at
their Selhurst Park ground next Wednesday.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in southwest
China's Sichuan Province have found a 1,800-year-old large tomb
carved into a cliff.
</P>
<P>
Located 20 meters above the Yuanbao mountain foot in Santai
county, the 15.4m long tomb has a door way leading to three
chambers.
</P>
<P>
Relief sculptures can be found on the ceiling, walls and
pillars of the tomb.
</P>
<P>
From the inscriptions of "Yong He" (in Chinese meaning
permanent peace), the experts concluded that the tomb was built
during the years of Yong He (136-141) in the Eastern Han Dynasty
(25-220).
</P>
<P>
No cultural relics remained, except for some pottery that is
frequently seen in Eastern Han tombs.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that although the tomb had at some stage been
robbed, it will still contribute to the study of burial systems of
the dynasty.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Traditional courtyards have
become a money spinner for farmers in northeast China's Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Statistics Bureau reports that in 1995 farmers
earned 4.6 billion yuan from what they described as "courtyard
economy," which includes planting cash crops and trees, raising
domestic animals and operating workshops.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a 25 percent increase from 1994, an
official of the bureau said, adding that 68 percent of the rural
households each earned at least 1,800 yuan from the economy last
year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the provincial government in the major grain
producing area has been encouraging farmers to become prosperous
by boosting the courtyard economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 about 2.5 million rural households, 75 percent of the
province's total, participated in a competition held to expand the
courtyard economy. The acreage of their courtyards amounted to
138,500 hectares, 81 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Last year agro-technicians held training courses for four
million farmers, spreading knowledge about 100 new techniques in
rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges Anti-Terrorism Aid to Israel (by Xie Dongfeng, Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced here today that the United States will commit more than
100 million U.S. dollars to assist Israel in the fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I sent to the congress an emergency request for
the first installment for this counter-terrorism effort," said
Clinton at a press conference along with Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon peres.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said he expected the congress to react
quickly to this important measure.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that the U.S. and Israel will immediately
begin negotiations to conclude the bilateral agreement on
combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, the agreement will strengthen the joint
U.S.-Israeli anti-terrorism effort in three areas.
</P>
<P>
"First, the U.S. will immediately begin to provide Israel with
additional equipment and training," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, our (two) nations will join together to develop new
anti-terrorism methods and technology, thirdly, we will work to
enhance communications and coordination between our (two) nations
as well as other nations who have joined us in the war against
terrorism," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the U.S. will also increase its intelligence
sharing and coordination (with other nations on combating
terrorism)," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who
is accompanying his 22-hour visit to Israel, will remain in
Israel to finalize details of the document.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President stressed that the U.S. and Israel will make
every possible effort to defeat Islamic extremists and to prevent
them from killing innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton stressed that the Middle East peace process
must continue. Without peace, there will be no security, and
without security, there will be no peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Wednesday night, after attending the
one-day international Summit of Peacemakers in Egyptian resort
Sharm el-Sheikh, to show his support for Israel in the aftermath
of the recent Hamas suicide bombing attacks in Israel which killed
58 people.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference, Peres praised Clinton as "the
first world leader to put on his agenda peace in our time is a
major goal."
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Israeli closure on the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, Peres said that it is not aimed at the Palestinian people,
but to "answer some security needs."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to create no starvation," he said. "This is
clearly a security measure."
</P>
<P>
As to Syria, Peres said that while Damascus must press to
depart from support or shelter for terrorism, the door must be
left open for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton shrugged off criticism by the Israeli opposition that
his visit here is merely to boost Peres' prospects in the
upcoming general elections in May.
</P>
<P>
He said he came here because terrorist attacks kill dozens of
people and because the U.S. is committed to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will not interfere with Israeli internal
policies. "I respect the results of democracy here and at home,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Clinton attended a special Israeli cabinet
meeting, and discussed with Peres and his security advisers on
the situation regarding the suicide bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Clinton also met with opposition Likud Chairman
Binyamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President is scheduled to leave Israel for Washington
this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Coca Cola to Expand Market in Inland China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The famous American soft drinks
company Coca Cola will have invested a cool 500m US dollars in
China by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The company today announced plans to expand its market share in
inland China by establishing seven bottling factories in the
region within next three years as part of a multi-million dollar
boost.
</P>
<P>
The seven factories will be located in northeast China's cities
of Shenyang and Harbin, northwest China's Taiyuan City, central
China's Zhengzhou City, southwest China's Kunming City, and east
China's cities of Hefei and Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the factories, Coca Cola will totally
own 23 bottling factories in China.
</P>
<P>
Since it returned to the Chinese market at the end of 1970s,
Coca Cola's investment in China reached 100 million US dollars by
1992 with 13 bottling factories, said B.C. Lu, vice-president of
Coca Cola China Ltd.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, he said, the total investment of the
company will amount to 500 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola has until now produced Coca Cola, Sprite, Fanta and
Feixue mineral water in China. With its help, its cooperation
partner, Tianjin Jinmei Soft Drink Company, began to produce soft
drinks with the brand name of Jinmeile in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since Coca Cola purchases all material from China for its
production in the country, the company also brings significant
profits to the local economy, according to a survey report on
China's joint ventures conducted independently by Peter Nolan, an
economist of Britain's Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
The report said that every job in Coca Cola's China factory
creates six indirect employment opportunities to supply material
for Coca Cola's production.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Chinese government began to use the quality
standard of Coca Cola as that of China's soft drink industry, and
the production structure of China's soft drink industry is, to
large extent, the duplication of Coca Cola's, which are supplying
bases to bottling factories, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the base used by China's Coca Cola bottling
factories is produced in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Control Maputo River's Displacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has requested that
South Africa should control the discharging capacity of the upper
reaches of Maputo River so as to prevent the areas of the lower
reaches in Mozambique from being flooded.
</P>
<P>
Xavier Junior, leader for water resources of the National
Water Conservency Authority said he told South Africa that
Mozambique cannot stand the water displacement of 800 cubic
meters/a second from Maputo River as the lower reaches would be
flooded.
</P>
<P>
He said this after South Africa informed him that as from
March 13, South Africa would displace 800 cuber meters of water
per second from the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Junior said he had asked South Africa to lower the discharging
capacity to the level of below 600 cubic meters per second and is
waiting for a reply.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains in central and south Mozambique since January have
caused rivers to overflow, displacing more than 200,000 people.

<HEADLINE> 20 Young Scientists Selected for CAS Priority Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Twenty outstanding young Chinese
scientists, including nine who have studied and worked overseas,
have been selected by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) for a
maximum funding of about two million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the selection results today, Lu Yongxiang, CAS
executive vice-president, said the 20 young scientists, whose ages
range between 29-39, will have better working and living
conditions because of the funding, than most of their domestic
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The funding, which varies to meet the demands of different
branches of science, will be used to start up their research, buy
necessary equipment and instruments for experiments and houses for
their own use.
</P>
<P>
The selection was the second made by CAS as part of its plan to
train 100 leaders in various branches of sciences by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The academy chose 14 young Chinese scientists from both home
and abroad in late 1994, the first such effort since the plan was
launched in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jinchun, 33, member of American Physics Society, and winner
of first Wu Chien-shiung Physics Prize, is among the nine
scientists who have made outstanding achievements during study and
work abroad. Xie returned to China last month.
</P>
<P>
Lu said CAS encourages excellent young scientists in and
outside China, who have not been chosen but are interested in
working for CAS, to work at the academy.
</P>
<P>
He promised that CAS will provide them with similar or even
better working and living conditions than those included in the
plan in accordance with the needs of CAS research.
</P>
<P>
The academy, which has about 60,000 researchers, also plans to
train 2,000 leading scientists and 30,000 young scientific workers
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
CAS is scheduled to recruit 26 young Chinese scientists
studying and working at home and abroad this year, and offer
similar treatment, the vice-president said.

<HEADLINE> Mountainous Areas in Hebei Province Become Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Barren mountains in north
China's Hebei Province have become green as a result of a massive
afforestation project launched by farmers.
</P>
<P>
One of the afforestation projects - costing over 300 million
yuan - was designed to provide a shelterbelt of trees north of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Hebei Provincial Forestry Department said
that the provincial government had launched the afforestation
project in 1986 in a 100,000 sq km area in the Yanshan, Hengshan
and Taihang mountains. Trees have so far been planted on 1.2
million hectares of land and grass on 33,000 hectares in the 50
counties in the area.
</P>
<P>
Experts say 99 percent of the trees planted so far have
survived.
</P>
<P>
The province has also created 340 woods so far.
</P>
<P>
An effective measure taken by the provincial government to
afforest barren hills is to ban livestock grazing and firewood
gathering on mountains, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the acreage of enclosed mountainsides, totalling
840,000 ha, accounts for 34 percent of the province's total
afforested acreage.
</P>
<P>
Air tree seeding on mountains is conducted in the rainy season,
creating woods of 67,000 ha every year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In a move to quicken the pace of tree planting, local
governments began to sell rights to use barren hills and wasteland
to farmers and enterprises in 1993. As a result, over 600 million
yuan has been raised for afforestation, he added.

BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A contract was signed in Beijing
today for the import of two sets of 350,000-kilowatt steam turbine
generators. They will be used in a project in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, which is financed by the Asian Development
Bank(ADB) .
</P>
<P>
The Qitaihe Thermal Energy and Environment Improvement Project,
located in the middle of the province, which is rich in coal,
receives funds totalling 220 million US dollars from the ADB.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed today, Japan's Mitsui Company, winner
of an international bidding exercise, will provide the two
generators produced by General Electrics of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project promises a capacity of 1,200,000
to 1,400,000 kilowatts, and the two sets of coal-fired generators,
being constructed with funds partly from the ADB, will be put into
operation in 1999.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes US Over Wheat Quarantine Issue (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the following decade and more, the US government made no
reference to China to the sale of infected wheat.
</P>
<P>
However, since the beginning of the 1990s, the US side brought
up this issue again, saying that "the TCK occurrence actually is
not suited to the natural conditions of China," except for very
few places.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the US urged China to open all ports south to
Dalian city to wheat exported from US TCK-infected areas.
</P>
<P>
The request was rejected by China once again.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by China's hard stance, the US side has altered its
tactics since last year, labeling the TCK dispute as "a political
issue" instead of a "technical problem."
</P>
<P>
Taking the refusal of China as one technical barrier affecting
bilateral trade, the US began to relate the dispute with China's
reentry of the GATT ad entry of the WTO, coercing China to make a
"political decision".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the US side incited dozens of Congressmen who were
unaware of the truth to write letters to Chinese leaders, aiming
at exerting more pressure on China.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of the two government organs stressed in
the Chinese capital that the production safety of wheat, a staple
food for China, a big agricultural country with over 1.2 billion
people, is extremely important.
</P>
<P>
As a quarantine policy, China's ban on imports of wheat from
TCK infected areas is based on results of a number of scientific
appraisals, and fully conforms to the international practice.
</P>
<P>
While banning wheat import from US TCK-infected areas, they
noted, China permits no import of such crop from any country and
region with TCK occurrence. The quarantine policy is on no account
such a "technical barrier" as the US side described.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side holds to the belief that the TCK dispute is a
sheer technical issue, which should be settled through technical
co-operation of the two sides, they said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to seek the solution to this problem through a
bilateral technical co-operation, which is based on a shared
respect for science, they said.

MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between Russian
government troops and Chechen separatists flared up again early
today in central Grozny, capital of the breakaway Russian
republic, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The clash renewed at 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT) on the eve
of a crucial meeting of the decision-making Russian Security
Council, which is to approve a peace scenario for the Chechen
settlement.
</P>
<P>
An exchange of fire occurred when armed separatists loyal to
rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev opened fire from a 16-story building
on a Russian checkpoint on a bridge over the Sunzha river close to
the Minutka Square in downtown Grozny, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Clashes were also reported in a neighborhood in eastern Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is in Grozny for talks
with Chechen leaders to find a way of curbing the new wave of
separatist attacks on the city.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, hundreds of Chechen rebels started a major
assault on Grozny also on the eve of a Russian Security Council
meeting. The fighting raged for four days in the city, causing
numerous casualties on both sides as well as to local residents.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops delivered air and artillery strikes on Chechen
separatists' positions in Bamut, 35 kilometers southwest of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The Russian command believes that Bamut, a one-time Soviet
missile base, is where the Chechen separatists' main ammunition
and weapons dumps are located. It is the last major stronghold of
the rebels after their base in Novogroznensky was eliminated.

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes US Over Wheat Quarantine Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China today accused the United
States of adopting double standards on wheat quarantine "for its
own interests". It criticized the US for what it described as a
hegemonic act.
</P>
<P>
Officials with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) and State Administration for Quarantine of
Animals and Plants, said that on December 20 last year, 12 US
congressmen from five wheat production states jointly wrote to the
Clinton Administration, asking for US talks with Mexico on wheat
to be slowed down, due to the issue of Karnal bunt of wheat.
</P>
<P>
The US Government decided, as a result, to postpone its
importation of wheat from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
However, on December 12 last year, 30 US congressmen from wheat
production states jointly wrote to Chinese leaders, criticizing
China's quarantine of the Tilletia Controversa Kuhu (TCK) as
unscientific.
</P>
<P>
They asked China to amend quarantine laws and regulations to
permit TCK-infected wheat from the US to enter China, and imposed
pressure on China repeatedly, in the name of this "political
issue".
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the US side put China on the "super 301 list for
observation" last year for a so-called limitation of US products
with unfair trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that this act by the US should be condemned.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the TCK will exert great harm on the
production of wheat, adding it was even much more dangerous than
the Karnal bunt. They added it is very difficult to prevent, cure
and wipe out the TCK.
</P>
<P>
At present, many countries and organizations in the world have
listed the TCK on namelists for quarantine, including 36 members
of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization
(EPPO), as well as Australia, Canada and the IAPPC.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the Chinese Government has always
treated the TCK issue scientifically, while not completely
forbidding the import of US wheat simply because some areas of the
US were infected by the TCK.
</P>
<P>
They added that as early as the early 1970s when China started
to import US wheat, China found out the TCK existing in some areas
of the US during quarantine.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, the US side did not admit the fact, and they
had to admit it when Chinese experts presented evidence obtained
from the US wheat exported to China, said the Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
After that, the US side spread the view that "TCK infection is
not harmful", which was refuted by the Chinese side, the officials
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Computer Firms Cracks Down on Software Pirates in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's main software companies
have set up a watchdog organization to fight against software
piracy in this country.
</P>
<P>
Business Software Alliance (BSA) Turkey, founded by 14 local
and foreign software companies recently, will take legal actions
to crack down on pirates of software in Turkey, today's Turkish
Daily News quoted Emre Berkin, General Manager of Microsoft
Bilgisayar Yazilim Hizmetleri Ltd, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The computer company is a Turkish subsidiary of the world's
leading computer software producer Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
BSA Turkey intends to protect over 10 brands of software
programs currently sold in Turkey from illegal copy and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Berkin said "BSA Turkey aims to reduce copyright violations
software and encourage greater use of licensed programs," adding
that infringement of software copyright is widespread in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Some 95 percent of all software used in desk top processors or
personal computers in Turkey have been illegally obtained and
about 30 percent of Microsoft's DOS and Windows programs have
been pirated, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Pirated software costs producers of programs billions of
U.S. dollars in lost revenue worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union have singled out
Turkey as one of the world's worst violators of software
copyright.
</P>
<P>
Turkish parliament last June worked out a new law protecting
copyrights and intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The new law forbids illegal copying, distribution, sale and use
of copyrighted software.
</P>
<P>
Those who are involved in software pirates cases will face up
to three years imprisonment and must pay hefty fines if found
guilty of copyright infringement.

NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao said the ruling Congress Party would start selecting

given to younger candidates, the Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>

day," Rao said Wednesday at a meeting of the parliamentary group
of his party.
</P>
<P>
Rao, president of the Congress Party, expressed optimism about
the coming polls, saying his party is on the "upswing and will

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China calls on the US to maintain
a stable policy towards China, which should not be affected by the
situation of its domestic politics, said a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, the spokesman, made the remarks at a press
conference when asked to comment on the current situation of
Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the US policy towards China has always been
influenced by its domestic politics. For example, the policy would
appear to be in different tendencies at a time before, in the
middle of or after the US presidential election, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such a swaying policy towards China would
do nothing but bring about unstable factors to Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a meeting between Chinese and US
Foreign Ministers, the spokesman said "it is under
consideration".

<P>

<HEADLINE> Planting the Seeds of a New Idea in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- People often celebrate special
occasions with flowers. But in Shanghai they are branching out
into a new craze ... saying it with trees.
</P>
<P>
Couples celebrating golden wedding anniversaries and proud
grandparents wishing birthday greetings to their grandchildren are
digging deep to add more greenery to the landscape of China's
biggest city.
</P>
<P>
A plot of land in the western part of Shanghai has been
assigned for residents to plant commemorative trees.
</P>
<P>
With less than one-and-a-half square meters of green land per
person, Shanghai is much in need of an injection of grass and tree-

covered areas.
</P>
<P>
A local green land development corporation developed the plot
of the land, and invited people to plant commemorative trees.
</P>
<P>
The initiative received a good response from residents and
telephones lines at the corporation rang non-stop with people
placing orders.
</P>
<P>
The corporation provides 16 species of trees for people to
choose. People can attach commemorative plaques to the trees,
which record names, dates, and commemorative messages.
</P>
<P>
With a cost of up to 500 yuan(60 US dollars), hundreds of
people have ordered trees, and more than 100 commemorative trees
are already growing on the land.
</P>
<P>
Among the people who planted trees, there are grandmothers
planting birthday trees for grandsons; friends planting friendship
trees; old couples planting trees celebrating golden wedding
anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
With the help of his grandmother and mother, Zhangqi, a
five-year-old boy from Hongkou District, planted a metasequoia to
commemorate his birthday.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he chose to plant the metasequoia, he said:" It grows
up rapidly and uprightly. I also want to grow up quickly to be an
upright person."

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Administrative costs of
Malawi parliament are likely to be the highest in Africa,
Tanzanian official news agency "Shihata" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shihata reported that large amounts of money paid as travel
allowances to members of the house between Zomba and other parts
of Malawi is the cause of the high costs.
</P>
<P>
Shihata quoted an official of the eastern and southern African
universities research program, Ms. Florence Swai as saying the
parliament building was in Zomba although there are no
residential facilities for the members of the house.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians have to travel daily to attend sessions
there, Ms. Swai added.
</P>
<P>
Shihata further said between 50 and 70 members drive from
Blantyre daily during the session, while those without means of
transport hire some. Blantyre is 70 kilometers from Zomba.
</P>
<P>
Shihata added that it costs 1,000 Kwachas (about 66 US
Dollars) to hire a car from Blantyre to Zomba for a single trip.
The government pays 132 dollars per day on transport allowance to
the parliamentarians.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection is a
major issue for China, which should not take the road of
development first and pollution control second, as some countries
have done, Chinese premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We must leave our future generations a good ecological
environment," Li said at a panel discussion of Shandong deputies
to the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature,
now in session.
</P>
<P>
"We should not take the old road taken by some countries of
developing their economies first and treating pollution later," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for strengthened pollution control in
township enterprises, which he said have made great contributions
to national economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Decisions should be made to close down some rural enterprises
that pollute the environment heavily but have no prospect of
becoming pollution free or largely free through technical
revamping," he said.
</P>
<P>
On agricultural development, Li talked about the country's
system of farming.
</P>
<P>
"Nationwide, we should continue to adhere to the
household-based responsibility-contracting farming system," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But in some areas where productivity is high, a large amount
of labor has shifted to industrial production, and rural
industries are fairly well developed, people can go for economies
of scale with the precondition that participation is on a
voluntary basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this is to increase grain production and raise economic
efficiency "through mechanization, scientific application of
fertilizers, better irrigation methods and the commercialization
of farming."
</P>
<P>
He called on Shandong, a bread basket of China, to pay greater
attention to the use of agrotechniques for production increases.
</P>
<P>
The premier also took part in a panel discussion of Fujian
deputies to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There is an obvious guiding principle in the outline
for the ninth five-year plan and long-term development goals for
2010, that is, economic development will continue to take center
stage in our work."
</P>
<P>
The premier said the government's policies towards foreign
investors, including those from Taiwan, have not changed.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage them to further strengthen economic cooperation
with us under the principle of equality and mutual benefit," he
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Key Granary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural experts in Central
China's Hunan Province are streaming to rural areas to spread
latest research findings. The aim is to help farmers with spring
farming despite freezing wet weather.
</P>
<P>
"I feel just like fish in water when I am here," said Zhou
Yingbin, associate research fellow of the Hunan Agricultural
University, while teaching eagerly-learning farmers how to soak
seeds and raise rice seedlings.
</P>
<P>
Zhou disclosed that he and colleagues are putting into practice
a "national rice project," which they developed recently under the
leadership of Yuan Longping, known as "father of hybrid rice".
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to help add 3.2 billion kilograms of
grain to Hunan's present annual output of 27 billion kilograms of
rice by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of Hunan's efforts to increase the grain output,
and serve as one of China's key granaries in the next century,"
said Pang Daomu, deputy governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include tapping the land resources, using
science to raise the level of crops from single output units, and
to arouse the enthusiasm of farmers.
</P>
<P>
With arable land accounting for only 3.2 percent of China's
total, Hunan produces six percent of the nation's total grain, and
its rice output ranks first in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tan Qiucheng, an official of Hunan Provincial Bureau of
Agriculture, said the grain-sufficient province has sold an annual
of five billion kilograms of grain to the state and other
provinces and regions, exclusive of the amount of grain sold by
farmers themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of grain is enough to feed 125 million people a
year, and we shall contribute more grain in the future," the
deputy governor added.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have estimated that Hunan's maximal potential of
grain output will be 36 billion kilograms annually.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the grain production, the province plans to open up
the remaining 200,000 hectares of areas suitable for farming,
raise the multiple crop index and single output units, and spread
the cultivation of hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
This year will witness the province popularizing such skills as
 sparsely-planting rice on dry farmland, throwing rice shoots in
the field, and second cropping rice, known as "ratooning rice"
academically.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are encouraged to raise more pigs, and process and
market grain to make more profits out of grain.
</P>
<P>
While designating farmland protection zones, improving
cultivation methods, and making full use of local resources, the
provincial government has set up grain funds by charging a grain
consumption tax, and urging industry to support agriculture. It
also diverted foreign interest in investing in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"With the implementation of all policies in favor of
agriculture, we shall be able to boost the grain output, with our
research findings leading in the world," said Yuan Longping, the
well-known agricultural scientist.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Orchestras to Create Symphony Music Tide in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Tours by four of the world's top
symphony orchestras to China this year are expected to start a
wave of following for classical music.
</P>
<P>
The treat for music lovers starts with a high note next month
when the Orchestra National De France visits China.
</P>
<P>
In June the Philadelphia Orchestra from the USA will head east,
followed in September by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The
musical tide will reach its finale in October with a visit by the
Wiener Philharmoniker.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Culture, the
orchestras will demonstrate their virtuosity to Chinese music
lovers under separate batons of Charles Dutoit, Wolfgang
Sawallisch, Riccardo Chailly and Zubin Mehta during the '96
Beijing International Symphony Music Year, sponsored by the China
Performing Arts Agency.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the visits of the four orchestras will
stir up a craze for symphony music among Chinese people for a

<HEADLINE> China's Finance Seen Stable in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's finance will perform
stably in the first quarter of this year, statistics released by
the State Information Center (SIC) show.
</P>
<P>
Bank deposits are expected to rise 30 percent to 4.1617
trillion yuan. The rise, however, will be weaker than in the
previous quarter because the expansion in deposits has slowed down
and residents have less money to deposit.
</P>
<P>
Bank loans are expected to jump 21 percent to 3.9849 trillion
yuan, of which short-term loans will expand 20.5 percent to 2.9101
trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Currency in circulation is expected to grow a paltry 9.6
percent to 797.3 billion yuan, as China has vowed to stick to its
tight monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Increases in price subsidies to beat inflation will be smaller
as price hike will slow down, and increases in tax revenues will
not rise dramatically as the economy will grow at a slower pace
and tax revenues already rocketed in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
In this quarter tax revenues are expected to hit 113.6 billion,
up 10.6 percent, and government expenditure will be 110 billion
yuan.

<HEADLINE> CITIC Sets Future Development Aims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- CITIC Industrial Bank has become
the sixth largest commercial bank in China in economic terms after
smashing a billion-yuan profit margin last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank's performance was just one of the many highlights in a
successful spell for the China International Trust and Investment
Company (CITIC).
</P>
<P>
Now the company is aiming to increase its total assets by
between 10 and 15 percent each year during next five years.
</P>
<P>
The growth margin of its net capital and profits by the year
2,000 will both be higher than the increase of its total assets
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
This development plan was set by CITIC board of directors at a
meeting recently.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, CITIC's total assets reached almost 167
billion yuan, and its net capital reached 17 billion yuan, an
increase of at least five-fold in both cases compared to 1990.
</P>
<P>
The company also yielded profits of over two billion yuan,
nearly eight times more than that in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade volume of CITIC exceeded 400 million US
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Two agreements were signed with Iran for the construction of
subways in the country and for the supply of a cement production
line. The value of the agreements was over 300 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As for its subsidiaries, the CITIC Industrial Bank earned
profits of one billion yuan, making it the sixth largest
commercial bank in China in terms of economic strength. The
reserves of the Ka Wah Bank in Hong Kong, also affiliated to
CITIC, reached 150 million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
The five power stations, run by the New Power Energy Company of
CITIC, with total generating capacity of 155 million kws, have all
been put into operation.
</P>
<P>
CITIFOR Company, another subsidiary of CITIC, has invested in
two tunnels and two bridges in Shanghai, as well as in a super
highway. It has also participated in the building of the new Hong
Kong.

HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The indigenization of the
country's economy will be a key objective for the Zimbabwean
government to enable the people to be completely sovereign,
President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
In a TV broadcast last night, Mugabe said black people must be
substantially involved in all areas of the economy from
agriculture, commerce and industry to mining. There should be
others to work along with blacks in the economy but these should
only serve to reinforce Zimbabweans who will be the main
operators.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said foreign-owned companies will be encouraged to
open up to Zimbabweans in the interests of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The ownership of land must also be indigenized and the land
question must now be settled ''once and for all'', he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the people of Zimbabwe must continue to be
united at various levels of society to foster development.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Propose Making Law on Euthanasia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior medical scholars from
Beijing and Shanghai, who are at the current annual session of the
National People's Congress (NPC), proposed that a law on
euthanasia, or painless death, be made as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They noted that euthanasia can be first tried out in these two
cities where medical conditions are relatively sound.
</P>
<P>
"Doctors are duty-bound to cure patients' sickness, but they
have to alleviate the pain of those patients with incurable
diseases," said Wu Zhaoguang, a professor at the Shanghai
Zhongshan Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"It is a humane practice to grant doctors and patients the
right to carry out euthanasia in accordance with the law," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
Proposals on making a law concerning euthanasia have been
submitted to the NPC, China's top legislature, for several times.
</P>
<P>
However, experts believe that owing to differing medical
conditions in various places, it is not the right time to enact a
law on euthanasia to be implemented across the country.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, scores of deputies to the Shanghai
Municipal People's Congress proposed that local regulations on
euthanasia be formulated and have it first implemented in the
municipality.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Shanghai once again proposed at the on-going NPC
session that euthanasia can be tried out in Shanghai which has
advanced medical service and where people are more open-minded.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yamei and Yan Renying, both senior medical professors and
NPC deputies from Beijing, said euthanasia helps relieve patients'
pain and raise the quality of life. They suggested that it be
tried out in such big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, they put forward a proposal on euthanasia to the
top legislature, and many aged people wrote to them and expressed
the support for painless death.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, NPC deputies raised at previous sessions
motions concerning euthanasia, since some suits on the relevant
disputes were brought forth in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Without the backing up of a law, nevertheless, doctors are
overcautious about the life of patients with excruciating
sufferings from incurable diseases.

<HEADLINE> Reserve Zone Set up to Protect Classic-Style City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Official protection is to be
given to a corner of an ancient Chinese city known as 'the Venice
of the East'.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou city government has issued details of the project,
and noted American architect, Ieoh Ming Pei, has been hired to
help in a program to create a special reserve zone in Suzhou, in
Jiangsu Province, to protect historical buildings and streets.
</P>
<P>
The zone covers the eastern part of the city near the Pingjiang
River, including one garden, five waterways, 12 stone bridges and
16 buildings in the styles of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and the
Qing dynasty (1644-1919).
</P>
<P>
The history of the city dates to 2,500 years ago. Protected
houses and buildings are mostly intact, with upturned eaves, white
walls, black tiles, and windows and doors decorated with wood
carvings.
</P>
<P>
The distribution and the style are very similar to those on a
map from the Song dynasty(960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The program aims at developing local tourism, improving the
environment and protecting historical relics.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Refugees to Leave Iran for Homeland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 250,000 Afghan refugees in
Iran will leave for home via Turkmenistan next month, an official
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that these refugees
would return to Afghanistan's northern and central provinces.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Husseini, Director-General for Expatriate and Refugee
Affairs at the Interior Ministry, said that the voluntary return
program of Afghan refugees is based on the trilateral agreement
signed between Iran, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan refugees willing to return home should apply at
governorate offices throughout the country from next April, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 25 U.S. dollars plus a carpet and a 50-kg wheat
bag will be given to every Afghan refugee who leaves Iran within
the program.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that some 500,000 Afghan refugees should return
to their homeland in 1995, but because of intensification of the
Afghan civil war, only 120,000 refugees could leave Iran.
</P>
<P>
He also said that at present about 2 million Afghan
refugees are living in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Deputy Suggests Amending Trade Union Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A deputy to the National People's
Congress in session here proposed amending the Trade Union Law to
protect union officials from unfair treatment from employers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ruiying, a member of the NPC Law Committee, said
retaliation against trade union officials by enterprise management
has been a frequent occurrance in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"For discharging their duties as representatives of employees,
some trade union officials have been removed from their posts,
others have had their salaries withheld, and still others have had
their labor contracts terminated," Zhang, also vice-chairperson of
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She quoted the Labor Law as stipulating that trade unions be
authorized to negotiate and sign contracts with enterprise
management on behalf of workers.
</P>
<P>
The existing Trade Union Law was adopted before the concept of
a socialist market economy was introduced in China, she said. As a
result, one of the shortcomings of the law is that it fails to
have provisions protecting the rights of trade union officials
executing their duties, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to a lack of legal protection, some trade union
officials have not been bold enough to work for the rights and
interests of employees," Zhang said, suggesting that amendments
protecting the normal execution of duty by trade union officials
be made to the Trade Union Law.
</P>
<P>
Some businesses, especially foreign-funded and private firms,
have restricted or prohibited their employees from joining trade
unions, Zhang charged.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, some enterprises have done away with their trade
unions under the name of streamlining, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In businesses without trade unions, she said, it is difficult
to protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers. This is
detrimental to a steady relationship between labor and management
and to social stability, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Trade Union Law should be amended to the
extent of giving trade unions the right to work independently and
punishing actions that harm the legitimate rights and interests of
workers.

<HEADLINE> Blueprint for China's Coal Import, Export Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's coal exports will climb
to 35 million tons by the year 2000, according to the monthly
magazine "Intertrade".
</P>
<P>
The China National Coal Import and Export Corporation, the
exclusive dealer in coal import and export in China, is expected
to earn 1.6 billion US dollars by that year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the first year of China's Ninth Five-Year Plan, the
corporation is to raise coal exports to 27.5 million
tons. Meanwhile, it will import 55 million US dollars-worth of
coal products.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the corporation set a record in business turnover,
import and export value and profits in foreign currency earned
from coal exports.
</P>
<P>
Coal exports in 1995 were 24.75 million tons, a 10-percent rise

<HEADLINE> Hubei's High Speed Mail Service Takes Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Jet-speed postal services from
central China have won a stamp of approval from customers.
</P>
<P>
A new service means that letters can travel half way around the
world in as little as two days.
</P>
<P>
Middle China's Hubei Province has expanded its direct air-mail
inter-exchange and EMS services to four more foreign countries-
Japan, Singapore, Australia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The boost comes a year after the province launched the service
by introducing high-speed postal links with the USA and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The province's air-mail and EMS letters can directly reach the
additional four countries within two or three days through the
Wuhan Emergency Mail Service Bureau. It used to take four or five
days for such letters to arrive previously.
</P>
<P>
Post offices in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai handle most of the
country's international postal matters. It meant that the
province's international air-mails could only reach their
destinations via the three cities until now.
</P>
<P>
The province has also witnessed a boom in international postal
articles sent in recent years. The number topped 16 million last
year, about 60 percent of them bound for the six countries.
</P>
<P>
People can also inquire about their letters through computer
networks, as part of another improvement in the system.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region is turning over a new leaf after a major
crackdown on pornographic material.
</P>
<P>
Last year About 48,500 illegal books, magazines and newspapers were
seized and over 36,000 items of contraband audio-visual and other
electronic publications were confiscated. The crackdown also led
the closing of over 100 videotape and laser disc theaters.
</P>
<P>
But while officials have been busy cleaning up the shelves in
some bookstores it has helped establish a clean environment for
healthy and legal publications.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 kinds of important books have been published and
the range of newspapers rose from 50 in 1990 to 69 in
1995, while periodicals increased from 150 to 171.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Guangxi published 81 kinds of tapes, 17 kinds of
videotapes and 13 compact discs (CD). There was also a
breakthrough in manufacturing VCDs and LDs.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, more than 850 kinds of books produced in the
region won awards at, or above, provincial level.

<HEADLINE> More Tianjin College Students Seeing Psychologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- It's the end of the work day, but
Dr. Li Huiqin, a psychologist in Nankai University's clinic, has
just finished two hours' talks with a frowning girl who has
been haunted by failing on several exams.
</P>
<P>
The doctor noted that, because of the increasing number of
college students visiting the psychology clinic, she often has to
leave work late.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the clinic is open twice a week, and eight to 10
students usually come each time.
</P>
<P>
At neighboring Tianjin University, some 1,000 undergraduates
and graduate students have seen a psychologist in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese college students have got accustomed to consultations
with a psychologist and to treatment. One girl said that she and
her classmates trust psychologists very much and are glad to be
able to talk with them.
</P>
<P>
The situation was different when the clinic at Tianjin
University opened 10 years ago. One doctor explained that, at that
time, many students knew very little about psychological
outpatient services, or misunderstood them. Some students thought
that only those who were insane went to see psychologists, so few
dared to go for visits.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey done by Tianjin's public health departments has
shown that some 16 percent of the city's college students have
psychological problems or diseases to differing degrees, such as
obsessive behaviour, neuroses, anxieties, depression,
schizophrenia, or other abnormal conditions.
</P>
<P>
One teacher attributes the increase in the number of
psychological disorders to the rapidly changing society and the
reforms, and to the necessity of seeking a job in the market
economy, the heavy schoolwork, and problems that occur during
puberty.
</P>
<P>
This situation has aroused the attention of school
administrators. Nankai University has, for the past several years,
conducted psychological tests on incoming freshmen and has kept a
record of their psychological conditions, in an attempt to deal
with problems when they occur.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's universities and colleges have also started to
provide public information about mental health through lectures
and by providing courses, which have been welcomed by students.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe For Improvement Of Women's Social Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President robert
Mugabe has assured Zimbabwean women that his government was fully
behind all efforts to improve the status of women in society and
was committed to implementing recommendations adopted at the
Fourth World Conference for Women in Beijing, China, last year.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe made the commitment while addressing women, most of
whom are ZANU (PF) Women's League members, gathered to
commemorate the International Women's Day in Harare on Wednesday,
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's remarks are a repercussion to the facts that domestic
violence and sexual abuse against women and children have reached
intolerable and alarming levels.
</P>
<P>
He said women should come up with recommendations for stiff
penalties for perpetrators of these crimes and ''it would be
negation of duty on the part of the government to let these
people go unpunished, let alone destroy the family which is the
backbone of our society.''
</P>
<P>
The government would make everything possible to strengthen
its contribution and that of the non-governmental community in
helping victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse through
provision of proper counselling and sympathy, he said.
</P>
<P>
''What is more chilling is that most of the perpetrators of
these anti-social acts are relatives of the women and children
concerned in whom society has vested the responsibility of
protecting these weaker members of our society,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Farmer's Legendary Tale on Ecological Farming  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proceeding from the specific conditions of his village, Zhang
tried to grope about for "biological energy"-- something that he
was unaware of at that time.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said: "We put human droppings into pits to produce biogas
for use in lighting and cooking. Then we put the dregs and
residues into fish pools and move the pool silts to the farmland."
</P>
<P>
"So there comes a fine cycle between such waste materials and
energy," Zhang explained.
</P>
<P>
"In the early days when I was the village head, my villagers
wished to have porridge and then steamed dumplings, and afterwards
wanted to live in tile-roofed houses, and a park, a zoo as well as
a recreation center," he said.
</P>
<P>
The village now has an apple orchard, a peach yard and a garden
and reduced the amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, all
contributing to controlling environmental pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he even did not know what the name of "ecological
agriculture" is meant until several years ago when Qu Geping, then
head of the State Environment Agency, accompanied a deputy
secretary-general of the United Nations for an inspection tour of
his village.
</P>
<P>
Only until then did Zhang learn that he had found a solution to
ecological farming for areas of poorer countries, for which the UN
had worked and searched for decades.
</P>
<P>
According to his understanding, Zhang said, ecological farming
is to plant more trees, grow more flowers and grass, curb soil
erosion, planning on birth of babies, and longer life span for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
The average life expectancy in Xiaozhangzhuang has reached 74
for male and 77 for female, exceeding the national average,
Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that his village has set up kindergartens, schools and
libraries in the recent years. Primary education has been
popularized and 30 percent of the villagers have received
secondary or higher education.
</P>
<P>
"Xiaozhangzhuang has created a model in getting rid of poverty
through improvement of ecological conditions and development of
ecological farming," said Qu Geping, now chairman of the
Environment and Resources Protection Committee of the National
People's Congress.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Urban Council of Hong Kong
has sent a delegation on a 10-day visit to three cities in the
United States and Canada this week, a spokesman of the council
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The six-member delegation is to learn about the latest

</P>
<P>
The Urban Council is one of the statutory authorities in Hong

GUANGZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province is making great efforts to develop
hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Work is now underway on the second phase of the Guangzhou
Tianhe Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,200 enterprises have been set up in the zone, 25
of which are export-oriented ones, and more than 1,000 of which
are non-governmental.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 120 hi-tech enterprises recognized by the city,
104 are situated in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Last year the zone generated a total income of three billion
yuan from industry and trade, and earned more than 16 million US
dollars in foreign exchange from exports.
</P>
<P>
The city is now striving to put even more effort into building
up its successful development zones in a bid to use high
technology industries to promote city development.

<HEADLINE> Sky's the Limit For Elevator Companies in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China is set to take a giant step
forward in the market for elevators.
</P>
<P>
The growth of high-rise cities will give a real lift to demand
for elevators in the next five years. An estimated 200,000 will be
needed by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth in demand for elevators across China will be
at least 10 percent in the 1996-2000 period, the country's Ninth
Five-Year Plan, a national survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
China's elevator industry experienced rapid development over
the past 16 years, with an aggregated output of 194,000. The
annual production spiralled to 30,000 in 1995, 13 times the 1980
figure.
</P>
<P>
Of the 123 registered elevator manufacturers in China, five are
Sino-foreign joint ventures, who possess a team of experienced
technicians, and up-to-date equipment. Their production makes up
60 percent of supplies on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Though China has become the third largest elevator producer in
the world after the United States and Japan, it can hardly satisfy
the growing need for high-grade elevators and escalators on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
This can be attributed to the speed in the pace of
urbanization. Statistics show that the number of new cities will
soar to 800 by the year 2000. New buildings covering a total floor
space of 1.2 billion square meters will be completed in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Some large cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Chongqing, are building or making plans for skyscrapers with
heights exceeding 300 meters.
</P>
<P>
Because of the immense demand, and shortage of high-quality
products, China will import 7,000 or 8,000 elevators from abroad
in each of the next few years. Elevator spare parts will also be
in great demand in China, according to a report in China Import
News.

<HEADLINE> GM Union Strike Enters 9th Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The strike of the General
Motors (GM) union workers entered the 9th day today, paralyzing
most of the GM assembly plants in North American as the world's
largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, 22 of GM's 29 North American assembly plants had
stopped working due to the run-out of parts made at Dayton. Dozens
of GM's other parts plants were closing or curtailing production.
</P>
<P>
About 90,000 GM workers were off the job Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of 1,600 companies that make parts for GM
cars have begun laying off their workers. ITT Automotive, which
makes brakes, said 370 employees at its plant in New Lexington,
Ohio, have been told not to work on Monday. A decision is pending
on layoffs at another ITT plant in Rochester, New York.
</P>
<P>
The strike's ripples have also affected the companies that
provide the raw materials and components for parts and at
thousands of GM dealerships where customers will not be able to
get specific models or options because no new vehicles are coming
into the inventory.
</P>
<P>
The walkout by some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers
(UAW) at the two brake plants in Delphi Chassisin, Dayton, Ohio,
kicked off on March 5, mainly over job security and outsourcing,
the production of parts by outside plants or companies.
</P>
<P>
A GM spokesman said no significant progress was made Wednesday
and no new talks were scheduled for solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
GM has been under heavy pressure from the financial community
to reduce its costs for components. Having UAW workers build the
parts at its own plants can cost virtually more than buying them
from outside suppliers that pay wages and benefits far below the
40-45 dollars hourly union salaries.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Amend Foreign Investment Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to amend its investment
law so as to attract more foreign money, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Nhac, deputy head of the ministry for planning and
investment, said that Vietnam will funnel more investment to
projects vital to national development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vietnam now needs "quality more than quantity" of
foreign investment which will be directed to projects which
Vietnamese entrepreneurs lack the means to undertake.
</P>
<P>
The country will create favorable conditions for foreign
investors in projects of significant interest to national
development.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to develop and foster industries in rural areas will
also be encouraged, as will moves to modernize and commercialize
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Prices and policies concerning land use may be revised to
encourage the growing of fruit trees and cash crops.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 billion U.S. dollars poured into 1,325 investment
projects in the country as of last December.
</P>
<P>
Some investment projects will be left open to foreign investors
while others will only accept funds from local entrepreneurs after
the investment law is amended, Nhac added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will help Vietnamese enterprises acquire shares in
all projects of infrastructure construction, including
build-operate-transfer projects funded by money from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam first pronounced its foreign investment law at the end
of 1987.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is reviewing the existing law and considering
amendments and supplements to be submitted to the National
Assembly for approval by the end of the year, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Business Leaders Urge Opposition to  Further Relax Non-Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi business leaders
Wednesday urged the country's mainstream opposition parties to
make more relaxation in their indefinite non-cooperation campaign
to allow normal operation of more business entities.
</P>
<P>
The opposition launched the strike-like campaign last Saturday
to press for the scrapping of the parliamentary elections on
February 15, which were won by the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party with the opposition parties boycotting.
</P>
<P>
The Chambers of Commerce and Employers' Association appreciated
in a statement the opposition's relaxation move Tuesday allowing
all banks, shops and export-oriented private factories to start
operations at a stipulated time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The association, however, said relaxation was also needed on
ports, financial institutions and public transports carrying
export cargoes to and from the ports.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the opposition to allow normal operations of
domestic-market-oriented industries and shops for the benefit of
millions of workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce
and Industry (FBCCI), a leading body of the country's business
community, once again called upon President Rahman Biswas to take
measures for holding fresh elections under a neutral government.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI President Salman F. Rahman warned that a sit-in would be
staged in front of the Presidential House Saturday if the demand
was not met.

<HEADLINE> Crimea Doubts Quick Passage of Constitution by Kiev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary speaker of Crimean
Autonomous Republic doubted today that the Ukrainian Supreme
Soviet (parliament) will approve a new Crimean constitution in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in the Crimean capital of Simferopol,
Yevgeny Suprunyuk asked Kiev to handle its relations with Crimea
in a constructive way and not to escalate the longstanding
constitutional row.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament abolished Crimea's 1992 constitution
in March 1995, accusing it of assisting the separationist tendency
in the mainly ethnic Russian peninsula. The parliament also passed
a law on Crimea status, demanding Crimea produce a constitution on
the basis of the law.
</P>
<P>
But last month, the Ukrainian Constitutional Committee
suggested the new constitution drafted by the Crimean parliament
be changed into a "charter" for further revision.
</P>
<P>
To this, the Crimean parliament stated this week that Crimea's
right to a referendum on its status should not be written off from
any new constitution and urged Kiev to pass the one it drafted by
the month end.
</P>
<P>
The current constitutional row has roused deep concerns of
President Leonid Kuchma and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet
Alexander Moroz, who called for restraints from the
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
The Crimean Peninsula was part of Russia before 1954 when it
was incorporated into Ukraine under the then Soviet leadership.
</P>
<P>
It then tried to return to Russia's fold despite its autonomous
status Kiev was forced to give in 1992. Separatist movement in the
peninsula suffered a great setback after Ukraine suspended both
Crimea's constitution and its presidency in March 1995.

<HEADLINE> TV Group to Work on Rating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A group headed by Jack
Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America
(MPAA), was set up today to develop a system for rating sex and
violence in television shows.
</P>
<P>
The group's tasks, expected to be completed by the end of the
year, include deciding what shows should be rated.
</P>
<P>
Executives of the group have said sports and news won't be
rated, but no consensus has been reached on how to treat cartoons,
children's shows and news magazines.
</P>
<P>
The rating will involve shows on broadcast, cable and public
television and is supposed to be applied by the program's
distributor.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with President Bill Clinton last month, leading
executives of the TV industry promised to create a system to work
along with the so-called v-chip, which is required by the
Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
The v-chip can recognize sexual and violent content in a TV
program. With a remote control device, parents would be able to
block individual shows or whole categories of programs.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the MPAA, members of the group include
representatives of ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, United Paramount, the
National Cable Television Association, the National Association of
Broadcasters, public television and independent television
stations.

<HEADLINE> Multimillionaire Forbes Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. multimillionaire magazine
publisher Steve Forbes has decided to quit race for the Republican
presidential nomination and throw his support to U.S. Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole, his aides said today.
</P>
<P>
Forbes, who had spent some 30 million U.S. dollars since he
announced his participation in the campaign last September, made
the decision one day after Dole swept the Republican primaries in
seven states on so-called "Super Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col told reporters that Forbes
himself will make the retreat announcement sometime on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the publisher earned 901,000 votes during the primary
season--some 16 percent of those cast, putting him third behind
Dole and conservative TV commentator Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Senate majority leader Dole has won more than
700 delegates to the Republican National Convention. A total of
996 delegates are required to get the nomination for the White
House candidate at the party convention to be held in San Diego in
August.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan is distant second with less than 8O delegates.
</P>
<P>
It is almost certain that Dole, widely supported by Republican
mainstream and dozens of GOP state governors, will win the party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Dole has held out to Buchanan and Forbes and urged them to
unite behind him to fight Democratic President Bill Clinton in
elections on November 5.
</P>
<P>
Forbes bowed to inevitability of Dole victory, but Buchanan has
rejected Dole's call and vowed to battle with the GOP presidential
front-runner to San Diego.

BUENOS AIRES, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem today hoped that the current summit of peace in Egypt will
be conducive to the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Menem said

Sheij meeting and of the fact that it is being held under
difficult circumstances.

negotiations in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president said that his government welcomed the
agreements reached so far because they constitute the only
possible alternative for reaching and guaranteeing the well-being
of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from 30 countries drafted today in Sharm el Sheij a
document calling for peace and condemning all forms of terrorism

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Yeltsin Under Pressure to Sack Grachev  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- To sack or not to sack has become
a major dilemma for Boris Yeltsin as the countdown begins to the
June 16 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has developed
into an important test for the Russian president who is facing
increasing pressure from supporters to get rid of one of his most
loyal political allies.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's advisers are telling him that he cannot win the
presidential election with the ball and chain of Grachev and the
Chechen war around his neck.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who
runs Yeltsin's re-election headquarters, told reporters a
substantial number of presidential campaigners are actively
pushing the president to fire the 48-year-old minister.
</P>
<P>
Grachev, one of Yeltsin's most loyal political allies, is
blamed for letting the 15-month war in the separatist republic of
Chechnya drag on.
</P>
<P>
Soskovets said that the campaign in Chechnya, along with its
mistakes and setbacks, is the "heaviest burden" Yeltsin has to
bear in his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
Presidential advisers are urging Yeltsin to name those guilty
of "bad planning" in the Chechen operation, pointing their finger
at Grachev, who once vowed to quell separatism in Chechnya's
capital Grozny within two hours with just two airborne regiments.
</P>
<P>
It turned out that entire divisions of Russian servicemen
ended up fighting in the rebellious city and republic in a war of
attrition which has already claimed more than 30,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
And last Thursday, Chechen militants loyal to separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev went close to recapturing several parts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of Grachev's fall from grace have been bubbling for
months in Moscow, amid allegations of corruption, incompetence and
a series of political gaffes.
</P>
<P>
A poll by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion Studies
found that both radical and moderate democrats, represented by
Yegor Gaidar's Russia's Democratic Choice and Grigory Yavlinsky's
Yabloko bloc respectively, dislike Grachev.
</P>
<P>
Both have urged Yeltsin to sack Grachev and Yeltsin needs their
support to defeat Communist Party chief Zyuganov in the election
race.
</P>
<P>
Even the communists and other opposition forces dislike
Grachev, who, when police left Moscow unprotected in October 1993,
ordered the military to storm the White House to prevent an
attempted coup, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Grachev has survived widespread criticism has
been attributed to his personal loyalty to the president.
</P>
<P>
"This loyalty has always been Grachev's strongest card," the
Moscow Tribune said, and "Yeltsin has always been able to depend
on him."
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said Yeltsin would be deciding
Grachev's fate in the coming days.

<HEADLINE> French, German Response to Middle East Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl both hailed Wednesday's
international anti-terrorist "Summit of the Peacemakers" in Egypt
as a success.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told reporters today that the meeting of the peacemakers
is in itself progress in the peace process after the force of
hatred gained the upper hand for a while.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to provide Palestine
with more aid and investment to improve living conditions. Only
when better living conditions are in sight can peace take root in
the hearts of the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French president also hoped the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli peace negotiations will yield positive results as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl described as "remarkable" the
four-hour summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh which
was attended by 27 nations.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said failure of the Middle East peace process would cause
panic among moderate Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Moslem militant group Hamas's terrorist activities have
struck terror not only in Israel but also in other Middle East
countries, said Kohl, and the meeting has assured those countries
that the international community will support their fight against
the opponents of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The German Chancellor also praised the summit for avoiding the
contentious issue of whether to point a finger at certain
countries as "sponsors of terrorism".
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the European Union's relations with Iran, the
French President said the EU holds different views from the United
States, while Kohl said the U.S. has expressed its understanding
of the EU's attitude towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said the EU will continue to hold critical talks
with Iran, which has been accused by the U.S. of supporting
terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Continental Free Trade Zone Talks to Be Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers from
the 34 countries on the American continent will resume talks on
the establishment of a continental free trade zone on March 18-21.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting in Colombia are expected to
sign a document on the progress of the negotiations, said Jose
Botafogo, the Brazilian undersecretary of integration, economic
and foreign trade matters.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four American countries pledged at the Summit of the
Americas held in Miami in December 1994 to establish a free trade
zone in the hemisphere by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants all the countries on the continent to
take part in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
reached between the U.S., Mexico and Canada in 1992, according to
Botafogo.
</P>
<P>
However, MERCOSUR, made up of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay, the largest American trade bloc after NAFTA, believes
that the U.S. position does not take into account the individual
advantages of other countries.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Employs Millions of Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Millions of children in Latin
America and the Caribbean, instead of going to school, are
employed as child laborers, a U.N. report shows.
</P>
<P>
There are between 16-18 million child laborers in Latin America
and the Caribbean and on average, a third do not go to school, a
joint study by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the
U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(CEPAL).
</P>
<P>
Children who work lose two or more years of schooling and as a
result earn some 20 percent less than adults, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 17 percent of children in the region work and in some
countries the number rises to 32 percent, a figure described as
"worrisome" by UNICEF Regional Director Marta Mauras here today.
</P>
<P>
She condemned child labor as perpetuating poverty, and while she
admitted that it was sometimes a way of lifting some households
out of extreme poverty, its overall impact on the reduction of
poverty was almost zero.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF-CEPAL investigation, child labor is
concentrated in unskilled jobs and is heavily exploited.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for programs to subsidize poor households with
children to improve education conditions of the working
population.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Move Hurts, But Not Stems Investments in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The enacted U.S. Helms-Burton
Bill imposing sanctions on Cuba's trade partners and investors
could hurt, but not stem the influx of foreign money into the country,
a senior Cuban official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Foreign Investment and Economic Aid
Raul Taladrid said the U.S. anti-Cuban bill, which was ratified
yesterday by President Bill Clinton, has drawn strong worldwide
condemnations, including that from the Rio Group, a political
consultative body comprising 12 Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
The group announced today "its most vigorous rejection" of the
U.S. move that "violates the principles of international law, the
charters of the United Nations and the Organization of American
States."
</P>
<P>
Taladrid added that Cuba is negotiating with more countries on
protection of foreign investments, though since 1993, 15
nations have already signed agreements with Cuba on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he added, Cuba had received more than 2
billion U.S. dollars from 55 countries, and now another 200 business
negotiations are underway.
</P>
<P>
According to other reports from Montevideo, the Uruguayan
government expressed in a press bulletin that it will adhere to
the position of the Rio Group, which rejects the U.S. bill to
sanction those who invest or negotiate with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> hke031317--German Paedophile Gets 43 Years' Jail Term in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A German man has been sentenced
to 43 years' imprisonment on a series of charges of child sexual
abuse and intended trafficking in pornography.
</P>
<P>
The sentence, passed on Wednesday by a Thon Buri criminal court
on Bernd Karl-Heinz Nierenz, 36, is the heaviest handed down to a
foreigner for sexual offenses against children in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994, police raided Nierenz's flat in Thon Buri,
Bangkok, and found 136 photo albums filled with pornographic
pictures of underage boys, 29 pornographic videotapes, more than
100 roles of pornographic film negatives, and advertising
brochures for pornographic materials and child sex tours in
Thailand, intended for sale or public distribution.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Denies Jones, 47, a British-Guyanan national, was
sentenced to a 50-year term in prison for similar offenses, but he
was sentenced in two separate trials.
</P>
<P>
Nierenz's conviction came in the face of a six-month-old
campaign waged on the Internet targeting Thailand as a center of
child prostitution and trafficking and encouraging people to
boycott Thai products.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some developed countries have accepted that
they should share the responsibility for child prostitution in
developing countries and have enacted extraterritorial laws that
enable them to prosecute their own nationals for crimes committed
against children abroad.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been a few convictions under these
extraterritorial laws in countries like Sweden and Germany, such
cases remain difficult to prosecute due to complicated
cross-national legal procedures.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai House Committee on Labor
and Social Welfare has made an eleventh-hour bid to save five Thai
workers due to be hanged in Singapore Friday.
</P>
<P>
The panel has decided to request the Singaporean parliament
president to postpone the execution.
</P>
<P>
The committee has urged Thai House Speaker Boon-eua
Prasertsuwan to submit a request to the Singaporean parliament
president to help push for a lesser punishment or at least
postpone the hanging.
</P>
<P>
Five Thai workers in Singapore face death sentence after they
were found guilty of robbery and murder of two Indian nationals in
September 1993. They are now in Changi prison, Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The panel hopes that Singapore would delay the execution and
commute the death sentence to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The Thai House Justice and Human Rights Committee also urged
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa to ask his Singaporean
counterpart Goh Chok Tong to pardon the workers. Goh is said to
be the only person with the authority to suspend the punishment.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Leaders Differ on Opposition  Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the National
Democratic Party (RPP), second ruling party and a key force under
the current political situation in Nepal, Wednesday differed over
the party's stance on a no-confidence motion against the present
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of RPP parliamentary party held late Wednesday
decided to let parliamentary party leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand
to finalize whether RPP would support the no-confidence motion
against the government to be tabled by the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) in the parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
The UML party has offered RPP to form an alternative coalition
government with Chand as prime minister if the no-confidence
motion is passed in the forthcoming special House session slated
for March 20, reports said.
</P>
<P>
With 19 seats in the House of Representatives, RPP holds the
key to survival of the present three-party government under Sher
Bahadur Deuba. NML and the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party
have 88 and 86 seats respectively in the 205-seat House.
</P>
<P>
Two RPP leaders, Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani and
Water Resources Minister Pashupati J.B. Rana of the present
government, openly opposed to form an alliance with the UML party
and walked out of the RPP meeting Wednesday to show their
opposition. Seven other RPP MPs were absent from the Wednesday
parliamentary party meeting, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
It was expected a RPP Central Working Committee meeting would
be held soon to take up the matter.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Not to Be Used as Base to Attack 3rd Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman
Surapong Jayanama has reiterated that Thailand has a clear policy
of not permitting any foreign organization to use it as a base to
assail a third country.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand offers freedom of expression for everybody, but it is
against any foreign group using its territory as a base for
attacking a third country," said Surapong, who is director-general
of the Information Department.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment when asked why Thai police Wednesday
briefly detained two Amnesty International activists and seized
from them 50 copies of a report attacking China on human rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
Suvidhya Simaskul, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's
East Asia Department, also asked, "why should they use Thailand to
attack a third country? it's not done anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
A Thai police officer told the Amnesty International detainees

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Opposition Reiterates Cancellation of Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Immediate cancellation of the
ruling party-held "farcical" February polls is the only way to
solve Bangladesh's political crisis, opposition parties have
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The firm stand was stated Wednesday in their separate letters,
almost identical, in response to the president's call for putting
forward their respective suggestions on the framework of the
proposed caretaker government for holding general elections
following their earlier discussions with the president.
</P>
<P>
On March 10-11, President Abdur Rahman Biswas held separate
meetings with the opposition parties and the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) in his initiative for resolution to the
national crisis through dialogues.
</P>
<P>
In the letters, the mainstream opposition parties led by the
Awami (People's) League expressed their doubts about a positive
outcome of the presidential move as "the February polls is yet to
be declared null and void and the cabinet headed by Begum Khaleda
Zia still to resign."
</P>
<P>
Without that, there is little scope for any effective step
towards the formation of a non-party caretaker government, the
opposition parties said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their willingness to cooperate with the president
in ending the persisting political crisis, the opposition parties
hoped that the president would pave the way for resolving the
problem by ensuring immediate cancellation of the February
elections and resignation of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the ruling BNP may communicate its proposal
to the president today.

<P>
China is not likely to expand the size of its troops for a
period to come.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chunli, the former acting commander of Guangzhou Military
Area Command, said," Peace and development will remain the main
trend of the world, which has provided an excellent opportunity
for China's modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
China has cut down the size of its troops from five million to
three million since it pursued a disarmment policy in the 1980s,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The road for the PLA is "to improve the quality of its troops
and strengthen its combat effectiveness through advances in
science and technology," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Said Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission, "Building a powerful army by means of science and
technology means building the PLA into an efficient army with a
reasonable size, a scientific structure, excellent troop quality,
excellent weaponry, and advanced military theories."
</P>
<P>
The PLA understands the country's difficulties. It will work
hard to ease the burdens of the state and take part in economic
development, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On bettering troops, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission, said the PLA will correctly handle the
relationship between quantity and quality and define a
proportionate ratio with regard to its ground, navy and air forces
and the strategic missile forces.
</P>
<P>
Liu said China's effort to increase the capabilities of
national defense and improve the army's combat efficiency is
purely for the sake of defense.
</P>
<P>
"China will neither invade any other countries nor join in the
arms race even when it lays claim to a greater national strength
in the future," he said.

China's national defense budget should be maintained at a low
level to the extent that it can ensure national security, said
Song Wenzhong, a retired vice president of the Academy of Military
Sciences of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
"China's defense budget has been kept at a low level and, in
fact, it has shown a negative increase," said Song, who provided
the following statistics to support his point:
</P>
<P>
-- In 1994, China's national defense budget was 55.07 billion
yuan, about 2.3 percent of that of the United States, 18.3 percent
of Britain, 18.6 percent of France, 13.9 percent of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of China's defense budget in its GNP of 1994 was
only 1.3 percent, compared with 4.2 percent of the United States,
3.6 percent of Britain and 3.18 percent of France.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the London International Institute
for Strategic Studies, China's per capita defense expenditures and
defense budget per soldier ranked 87 and 85 respectively in the
world in 1994.
</P>
<P>
-- Last year, China spent 63.677 billion yuan in national
defense while its inflation rate hit 14.5 percent, which means its
defense expenditure went down slightly. This year's defense budget
has also shown an actual decrease if inflation is taken into
account.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's medium- and long-term
development plan is a grand blueprint for peace and development
and will contribute to peace and stability in the world, according
to army officers attending the country's top legislature and top
advisory body in their capacity as deputies or members.
</P>
<P>
"For the attainment of development goals set forth in the
government plan, a peaceful environment is of vital importance for
China" is a consensus among these officers, who expressed their
views in interviews or at group discussions.
</P>
<P>
"A backward China with a huge population would not merely be a
problem of its own but a burden for the rest of the world," said
Xie Guoliang, a professor with the Academy of Military Sciences of
the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
With an estimated population of 1.4 billion by the year 2010,
China needs to devote itself single-mindedly to economic
development for many years to come, he said.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor and Minister of National Defense Chi Haotian
has the same view. He said, "The central task of our nation at
present is to concentrate all its resources in boosting the
national economy and increasing the national strength."
</P>
<P>
Modernization of China's national defense relies on the growth
of the national economy, Chi said, pledging that the PLA will
continue to support the country's economic expansion and help
achieve trans-century goals.
</P>
<P>
Many officers stress that a peaceful and stable environment is
critical for China's development.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, chief of the PLA General Staff, said the key to
realizing the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and
long-term goals is continued reform and development, but stability
is the prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
"China needs not only political and social stability at home,
but a peaceful international environment, especially a stable
surrounding environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economy has to come first, according these officers.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the national economy has developed and national
strengthen grown is it possible for the army to have the resources
to develop itself," said Wang Xurong, commander of the naval air
force.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Farmer's Legendary Tale on Ecological Farming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- It was a real tough job to get
someone suitable to head Xiaozhangzhuang village -- because all
grown-ups in the village then went begging away from their homes,
and the township government had to call in a young farmer from a
nearby village, Zhang Jiashun, to fill the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
This happened 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Today, all of my 2,000-strong villagers have all thrown away
their beggar's bowls," said Zhang, who is here attending this
year's session of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's village, Xiaozhangzhuang of east China's Anhui
Province, is on the north side of the Huaihe River that used to
be a leading scourge in the region with frequent flooding.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told Xinhua that the majority of his fellow farmers have
moved out of tidy straw-thatched cottages and to rows of
reinforce-concrete houses, and a modern, tree-covered town has
sprung up on former barren sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita income of villagers reached 2,400 yuan (about
300 US dollars) last year, approaching or reaching the standard
set by the Chinese government for a relatively comfortable life,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that his fellow villagers, like their urban
cousins, now have access to drinking water.
</P>
<P>
For all what he has contributed to his village, Zhang and his
village have been honored with two gold prizes by the United
Nations Environment Program, one for himself and the other,
"Global 500," for his village that "has established a growth
pattern for ecological agriculture, which is of great value in
reference to rural areas of poorer countries."
</P>
<P>
Born into a poor famer's family, Zhang, 58, does not have any
schooling, and even to date he can hardly read or write.
</P>
<P>
"I dispatched 200 of my men to collect droppings before we
grew wheat and sesame," he said, referring to the first thing
he did after he was named head of his village.
</P>
<P>
"Then I traveled four consecutive days and nights by train to
Tianshan Mountain pasture area in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and bought back 40 horses with the money from
our sales of wheat and sesame," Zhang recalled.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30-strong years, Zhang has led his men to
deep-plough their 360 ha of farmland, dig 20 kg of tunnels and 15
fish pools, sink 64 wells and rebuild a forest belt of 50 kg long.

<HEADLINE> Former Thai PM's Arrest Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Criminal Court has
ordered to arrest a former member of parliament for failing to
show up to hear a court verdict on him.
</P>
<P>
Seksan Saenphum, ex-member of parliament from the Chart Thai
(Thai Nation) Party, was in contravention of a court order as he
failed to appear to hear the appeal court ruling on him.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Court sentenced Seksan to six months in jail on
March 26 last year after finding him guilty of defaming Major
General Sornchai Montriwat, who was a secretary to the then
interior minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Court Wednesday was ready to announce the reduction
of his sentence to a two-year suspended jail term after Seksan
filed an appeal with it.
</P>
<P>
Major General Sornchai, who currently is a deputy interior
minister, filed a defamation suit against Seksan with the Criminal
Court after a censure debate on November 11, 1993 during which
Seksan accused him of smuggling heroin into the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit currently is a deputy prime minister and defense
minister of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientific and technological
zones in this capital city of Northeast China's Liaoning Province
have witnessed substantial development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Torch Building, a symbol of the initiation of the city's
scientific and technological zones, was opened to businesses in
May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The building has become the center for new and high-tech
development, international trade, and worldwide scientific and
technological co-operation, with more and more world-renowned
companies like IBM, AT&AMP;T, Siemens and National setting up ventures
there.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the total income of the building, which
houses over 150 companies, reached 500 million yuan (about 59
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone specializes
in new and high-tech projects including electronics, information,
integrated electro mechanics, biological technology, new
materials, energy and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The zone has also speeded up the construction of 50 new and
high-tech production bases, and its economic returns last year
amounted to 4.85 billion yuan, as well as an export worth 25
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The zone approved 52 projects last year, with a total
contracted investment of 154 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Beiling Spark Technology Zone, the
first of its kind at state-level and approved in 1992 by the State
Science and Technology Commission, is making rapid progress.
</P>
<P>
The zone realized an industrial output last year valued at four
billion yuan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Households Buy 220,000 Computers in China in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Computer are on the verge of
becoming a new family necessity as common as the color television,
washing machine and refrigerator in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese families purchased some 220,000 personal computers last
year, accounting for 20 per cent of the PC sales in the country,
according to the national newspaper People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Prodded by the rapid development of the information industry,
household demand for PCs rose sharply in urban areas. Statistics
show that about five percent of families of Shanghai, China's
largest city, have bought computers, and the number is expected to
be 20 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that when 10 percent of households are equipped
with computers, the pressure to buy will become stronger in other
families, and PC sales will really take off.
</P>
<P>
Expanded applications of PCs have also given a new push to the
computer stampede, now that education, office, and entertainment
software are widely available to families here.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the rising demands, more domestic brands will begin
to appear in the next few years.

MEXICO CITY, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Mexico today appealed to
Central and North American countries to abandon their xenophobic
approach toward immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria Trevino urged the 10
countries taking part in the first regional conference on
migration to respect the human rights of immigrants.
</P>

<P>
Sea shipping plays a crucial role in the European Union's
economy, with 90 per cent of foreign trade and 30 per cent of
inter-EC trade conducted by sea transport, the European Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
With the shipping industry facing increasing globalization, the
Commission called for the redefining of international competition
rules to ensure fair competition, efficiency and security in sea
transportation and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
It also called for measures to expand the EU's shipping fleet,
improve coordination among member states on registration and to
encourage short-haul transport.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also urged the EU to boost cooperation with
Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
In its new strategy papers, the EC proposed great efforts be
made in the following three areas in order to increase EU'S
competitiveness in sea transportation.
</P>
<P>
* to promote professional training and strengthen protection of
the sea transportation-related jobs.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Criticizes British Military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentine deputy foreign
minister Fernando Petrella today criticized British military
presence around the Georgia Island in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British military presence was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
In statements to the local press, the deputy foreign minister
said that if Britain "has proper rights" over the Georgia Island
"it would not need a military presence."
</P>
<P>
However, he confirmed that the British authorities have
refunded to the Argentine fishing boat "Antarctic III", which works
for a U.S. food processing company, 10,000 U.S. dollars in tax and
returned the boat to its owner.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government assumed the move a sign that London is
relaxing its attitude in face of the conflict over the island,
though the press here reported that Britain has added a
surveillance plane and a nuclear-powered submarine to its warships
patroling the area around it.

WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A lawsuit has been brought
against boxing promoter Don King, boxers Julio Cesar Chavez and
Craig Houk over alleged match fixing, a Chicago newspaper reported
on Wednesday.
</P>

Mexican Chavez needed only 79 seconds to knock out Houk in the

The newspaper said Venzor claimed they had defrauded him of
"hundreds of thousands of dollars."

<HEADLINE> 125 Year-Old Former Brazilian Slave Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- One of the two oldest Brazilian
slaves died on Tuesday just two months before her 126th birthday
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Elizaria Damiana Fonseca, died after a short illness at the old
people's home she had been living in for the last 40 years in
Jiundai just outside Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
The former slave, who until recently could still sew and look
after other residents, never competed "officially" with her fellow
countrywoman, Maria Do Carmo, for the title of oldest woman in the
world since she did not have a birth certificate to prove her
birth in 1870, though several people appealed to the editors of
the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
According to the nuns who cared for her, she would have turned
126 on May 11 while Do Carmo had her 125th birthday three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Damiana was snatched away by a Portuguese adventurer before he
returned to Europe and she remembered many of her relatives and
friends were abused in the era of slavery which was abolished in
1888.
</P>
<P>
During that era she worked on several haciendas in the south
eastern part of the country until old age forced her to enter an
asylum in Jiundai run by a religious community.
</P>
<P>
She said that the secret of her longevity was not smoking,
eating lots of pasta and drinking "pinga" (liquor).

<HEADLINE> China to Spur Growth of Chinese-style Fast food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) --The Ministry of Internal Trade
(MIT) will soon issue guidelines aimed at boosting the growth of
Chinese-style fast food and improving the profile of this
burgeoning sector.
</P>
<P>
The first national development plan for fast food production
and services, expected to be approved by the State Council in the
near future, is "a measure of profound significance " to the
industry, "China Daily" said, quoting Ling Dawei, director of
the Catering and Service Department under the MIT.
</P>
<P>
The plan will enhance the industrialization and standardization
of fast food production and chain-stores, which are already
booming in cities, prompted by an improvement of people's living
standards, and the influx of foreign fast food.
</P>
<P>
Fast food services in China have grown rapidly in recent years,
but problems also exist, Ling said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic fast food sector is "lagging " behind market
demand and suffers from a lack of convenience, nutrition, variety
and hygiene, as well as well-known brands that can compete with
foreign names, he added.
</P>
<P>
As part of its major tasks in 1996, Ling said, the MIT is to
help the sector catch up with the pace of national economic
development and cope with the changes in household affairs.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) will be
earmarked for the purpose this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's fast food sector grew 20 percent in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Employment, budget reform,
national security and the European Union will be the top
priorities for the new coalition government over the next four
years, Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky announced on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a 50-page statement, Vranitzky said it is not wise for a
small nation like Austria to tie itself to a certain security
system or to give up any flexibility in its security policy,
because a common security policy for Europe is still a long way
off. He pledged Austria will play an active role in world
security efforts.
</P>
<P>
On Austria's role in the EU, Vranitzky said, as an EU member,
the question for Austria is not to answer "yes" or "no" to the
European Union but to think wholeheartedly about how to build
Europe in the future.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Vranitzky repeatedly stressed the importance
of cooperation between the Social Democratic Party and the
People's Party, the two partners in the new coalition cabinet,
which was sworn in on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor also stressed the importance of good cooperation
between the government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Parliament will begin to debate Vranitzky's
government statement on Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Preparations have begun for
work on China's largest underwater museum at Baiheliang (White
Crane Ridge), in Fuling city of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, local official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 1,600-meter-long, 15-meter-wide rock ridge is in the
Yangtze River to the north of Fuling. It was given the name
because of the white cranes that used to gather on it in ancient
times. A stone carving from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) can be seen
on the rocky ground when it appears in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
The carving has 18 fish carvings which were used for measuring
water levels. Descriptions about changes in the water level were
also carved, providing some of the earliest hydrology measuring
devices in the world.
</P>
<P>
Carvings of famous Chinese calligraphers from the past are
preserved on the rock, which is also called as "Forest of
Underwater Steles".
</P>
<P>
Baiheliang will be covered by 175 meters deep of water because
of the Three Gorges Project, and the Chinese government has
decided to spend some 100 million yuan on an underwater museum.
</P>
<P>
A 30 or 40-meter-high spheroid will cover 220 m. of the stone,
anchored to the river bed, forming an underwater museum.
</P>
<P>
The museum will have two exhibition rooms, showing not only the
stone carvings but also landscapes along the Yangtze River valley,
with objects, pictures, and films.
</P>
<P>
A 100-meter-long underwater passageway will connect the museum
to the river bank. The whole project is to be completed in ten
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today called for the creation of a European army of between
250,000 and 300,000.
</P>
<P>
"Five great countries" of the European Union -- Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Spain, could each send between 50,000
and 60,000 troops, Juppe told a Paris conference of leaders of the
European Democratic Union, a group of conservative and Christian
Democrat Parties with 24 seats in the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The force would come under the leadership of the Western
European Union, a 10-nation military body set up in 1954 to
discuss defense issues, and should be able to operate autonomously
or in coordination with U.S. forces within NATO.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said it was high time the European Union (EU) took
concrete steps to build up joint defense and the means necessary
for joint intervention, with or without the Americans.
</P>
<P>
France has backed joint European defence initiatives and a
"concerted" nuclear deterrent since last autumn but has so far had
little support from other EU members. The country has also moved
closer towards NATO military institutions, although there has been
no suggestion of joining.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac unveiled a reform of the French armed
forces last month, anticipating a streamlined, more professional
and mobile force by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, Chirac said that the participation in Eurocorps, a
European force grouping Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and
France, would not be affected.

YANGON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa will pay an official visit to Myanmar from Sunday at
the invitation of Chairman of the Myanmar State Law and Order
Restoration Council and Prime Minister Senior General Than Shwe,
it was officially announced here today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time ever for a prime minister of Thailand
to visit this neighboring country in 16 years.

<P>
Banharn met Than Shwe last December at the 5th ASEAN summit in
Bangkok where Than Shwe attended the meeting of ASEAN leaders and
leaders of the three nations -- Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's relations with Thailand have been strained since
early last year due to some border incidents which led to
Myanmar's closure of the three border checkpoints at
Tachilek-Maesai, Myawaddy-Maesod and Kawthaung-Ranong.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Calls For Controls On Cigarette, Alcohol, Drug Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- German experts have called for
tighter control over cigarette, alcohol and drug advertisements to
improve the social environment children grow up in.
</P>
<P>
They also called for a levy of five percent of the 1.6 billion
marks spent on advertising in Germany each year to be spent on
anti-drugs programs in schools.
</P>
<P>
The experts made the appeal at the first European conference on
children, youth and drugs, which opened Tuesday in Munster,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by German agencies, some 15 percent of 14
year olds are addicted to smoking, with some having started
smoking when they were eight. An even greater percentage of
teenagers are addicted to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of teenagers who regularly take
pain-killing, hypnotic, sedative and other narcotic drugs is on
the increase. For example, nearly 40 percent of 12-years-olds
often take pain-killers.
</P>
<P>
Experts blamed rising consumption on advertising, which costs
about 1.6 billion marks (1.1 billion U.S. dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
They suggested five percent of the money be levied to carry out
an anti-drugs program in kindergartens and schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Forestry departments in east
China's Zhejiang Province have chosen a number of tree species to
be used as natural fire-prevention belts.
</P>
<P>
The province has started building a 30,000-km natural
fire-prevention forest belt, according to Cheng Weishan, head of
the provincial forest industry department.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, trees have been felled and ditches dug to fight
fires, but the results are often damage to vegetation and soil
loss.
</P>
<P>
After a number of experiments were conducted in the past years,
forest researchers in Zhejiang found that several species of
trees, including bayberry, have low burning points and can be
used as natural prevention shelter belts.
</P>
<P>
The shelter belt may completely replace traditional fire
shelters, scientists said.

NINGBO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo Port in east China's
Zhejiang Province will invest three billion yuan in the next five
years in increasing its handling capacity, local industry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Port Administration Ye Xinhu told Xinhua that
the port will spend 60 million U.S. dollars in the next two years
to expand its 900-m-long container dock.
</P>
<P>
From 1998 to the year 2000, the port will invest 2.6 billion
yuan in a 1,200-m-long container dock.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the port will be able to handle two
million containers a year and the business volume is expected to
reach one million containers a year.
</P>
<P>
The expansion will also mean that the port will be able to
handle fourth- and fifth-generation container ships, the largest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
As China's fourth largest port, Ningbo has the largest mineral,
crude oil, and third- and fourth-generation container docks in

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
Japan will loan 98.94 billion yen (about 773 million US dollars)
to finance China's key state projects, including several
petrochemical undertakings in Henan, Hubei and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, re-loaned by Bank of China
(BOC), the long-term preferential loans are the third batch this
year signed between BOC and the Export and Import Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The first two batches in January and February, which totalled
about 1.58 billion US dollars, went to support projects such as
the Feilaixia Hydropower Station in Guangdong Province and the
Xiangtan Chemical Fiber Plant in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The loans are part of the Japanese government's foreign
assistance to developing countries. The Export and Import Bank of
Japan, one of the government's financial institutions, has been
asked to grant part of the assistance.
</P>
<P>
These long-term preferential loans have fewer limitations on
the sectors in which they can be used, and there are also fewer
restrictions on the countries and regions from which equipment and
materials can be brought from, making the loans easier to use, BOC
said.

<P>
NANJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province has
been trying to bring in foreign expertise and advanced technology
to improve its agriculture, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991--1995), the
province had 23 cooperative projects with foreign partners,
invited 115 foreign agronomists, and over 500 agronomy development
projects.
</P>
<P>
To use imported scientific and technological developments
faster, a number of experimental fields have been set up.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Japanese dryland rice cultivation technology was used
on 6.5 million mu of land (about 430,000 ha), which increased
output value by 640 million yuan (about 75 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Grapes and apples grown on the experimental fields won several
national prizes, after which they were produced on a larger scale
and sold well in the market.
</P>
<P>
Regional pillar industries have also been formed by introducing
foreign expertise combined with local resource advantages. In
hilly areas of Zhenjiang Prefecture, fruit and vegetable
production bases were set up by introducing a dozen of new
varieties, such as strawberries and grapes.
</P>
<P>
Through cooperation with foreign partners, aquatic production
and beach development in some cities have had good results.
</P>
<P>
The imports to rural areas in northern Jiangsu have resulted in
enterprises producing grass handicrafts and vegetables that are
sold on the international market earning millions of yuan in
foreign currency annually.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has urged Russian foreign policy makers to coordinate and remove
differences of views in their work, a high-ranking diplomat said
at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Igor Ivanov, first deputy foreign minister, told the conference
that Yeltsin signed a decree Tuesday ordering foreign ministry
officials to be more efficient in their work.
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanov, the decree stipulates that only the
president, prime minister and foreign minister are entitled to
make initiative statements on the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Presidential and foreign ministry spokesmen can make policy
announcements whereas departments of other ministries can do it
only when authorized by the foreign ministry, and make comment
when instructed.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Yeltsin criticized former Foreign Minister
Andrei Kozyrev for failing to coordinate with other government
departments.
</P>
<P>
"Anonymous spokesmen for the foreign ministry cannot be
considered official," Ivanov told the press.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to demonstrate Russia's positions
with the utmost exactness," he noted.
</P>
<P>
All bodies of power in Russia and of the Russian Federation
should inform the foreign ministry of their foreign affairs
maneuvers and coordinate with the ministry, Ivanov quoted the
decree.
</P>
<P>
"The more order there is in Russian foreign policy, the more
effective it will be," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said that violator of the decree will be reported to the
president and the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's railway department has
succeeded in developing a new railway switch that can remarkably
improve the speed of trains.
</P>
<P>
The new switch allows trains to travel as fast as 160 km per
hour. The present speed of Chinese trains is 60 to 80 kmh. The
lifespan of the switch is also twice that of the ones in common
use on the Chinese railway lines.
</P>
<P>
The switch was developed jointly by several research
institutions of the Ministry of Railways and manufactured by the
Baoji Bridge Plant in Shaanxi Province, in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new switch is as technologically advanced

STOCKHOLM, March 13 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The Swedish government

its civil affairs minister said here on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Concern over New Petrol on Rise in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Concern is on the rise in New
Zealand over the safety of a new unleaded petrol introduced to
replace the old super leaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
Some government agencies are now joining forces to deal with
the concern, since the first complaint about the new fuel surfaced
last Thursday. So far there have been over 280 complaints,
including a few car fires.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Health, Environment and Commerce ministries,
the Civil Aviation Authority and Occupational Safety and Health
department met with representatives of the oil companies this
morning to voice their concern over the safety issue. This is the
first time the government agencies have taken a coordinated
approach.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Prime Minister Jim Bolger and Energy
Minister Duog Kidd also met with oil companies representatives to
hear their explanation about the problem, which they have failed
to provide. However, they said the new fuel is safe.
</P>
<P>
On one point, Bolger even said motorists should stop using the
petrol if the oil companies cannot give assurance that it is safe.
</P>
<P>
The new petrol, known as 96 octane, uses aromatic hydrocarbons
to replace lead as the catalyst in an effort to reduce pollution.
However, the introduction of the lead-free petrol has thrown the
companies into a public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
The companies said it is now impossible to stop selling the new
petrol on the market, since they stopped making the leaded super
last December to meet the government's policy of a lead-free
petrol supply by 1996.
</P>
<P>
But many New Zealanders said they do not want to see one poison
being replaced by another poison.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the oil companies are carrying out research on
what is wrong with the new fuel, which damages rubber parts of
some vehicles. They said such problems have not been reported in
other countries using the same fuel.
</P>
<P>
Although uncertain about the cause of the problem, the
companies have decided to reduce the level of aromatics in 96
octane.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, drivers of fuel tanks said they want an independent
body to be involved in safety of the new fuel. The demand came
after some drivers reported headaches and nausea after exposed to
fumes from the new petrol.
</P>
<P>
They have threatened to take industrial actions if the problem
is not solved.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Police Arrest Criminals in Ilidza for Looting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO and U.N. representatives
said today that gangs arriving from Sarajevo were looting houses
and terrorizing Serbs remaining in Ilidza, a Serb suburb which was
transfered to the Muslim-Croat federation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
International Police Force Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald told
reporters that federation police arrested several persons today
who were looting houses.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Serbs to remain in Ilidza, although he could
give them no guarantees. Ilidza was the fourth of five Serb-held
suburb in Sarajevo which must be handed to Muslim-Croat federation
control. The last Serb district Grbavica will be transferred on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that the international police force will be
present in considerable numbers" in Ilidza, Tanjug quoted
Fitzgerald as saying.
</P>
<P>
Less than 2,000 Serbs now remain in Ilidza which had a
population of about 25,000 before the Dayton peace accord was
signed last December. All the others had left before the sector
was taken control by 90 federation police Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said that 90 police were probably not enough to
resolve the present situation in Ilidza, adding he would discuss
this with the Sarajevo government Internal Affairs Minister Avdo
Hebib.
</P>
<P>
He warned that situation could become very dangerous unless
terrorism was stopped quickly in the sector.
</P>
<P>
International police representatives have received many
complaints on cars stealing and house looting and on two separate
attacks on a man and a woman in Ilidza, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The international community High Representative for civilian
affairs in Bosnia Carl Bildt requested today in Brussels a direct
IFOR participation in civilian police activities in Sarajevo
districts which were placed under federation authority.

BELGRADE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- An international team of experts

sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will show the size of the heavy arms arsenals of

representatives of the Bosnian Serb state, began the inspection of
the military arsenal of the Muslim-Croat federation.

LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Peugeot Automobile Nigeria
(PAN) is producing an average of two cars of its new
model, Peugeot 306, a day, the company's spokesman Alhaji Baba
Yahaya said today in Kaduna, northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The company has the capacity to produce 60 cars of the new
model per day, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On the 306 auto-technology, Alhaji Baba said that Nigerians
were fast acquiring the new technology introduced into Europe in
1993.
</P>
<P>
98 percent of the workforce assembling the car in PAN now are
Nigerians, while the balance are technical advisers.
</P>
<P>
"Already, many Nigerians, comprising staff of our company and
our distributors, have been trained both at home and in Europe on
the 306 technology," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Peugeot 306 was first launched in December last year by
former Nigerian president Shehu Shagari in Kaduna before it was
introduced into the Lagos and Port Harcourt markets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Report Shows Economy Regaining Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy appears to be
regaining its footing with a number of encouraging signs of
increased activity, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest nationwide survey, the Fed said that most of its
12 regional banks reported moderate to solid gains in economic
activity in recent weeks. Many credited the pickup to rebounds
from weather-related slowdowns earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
It said that pickup in economic activity was occurring without
an increase in inflationary pressures. Most districts reported an
"encouraging pick-up in February" in retail sales except areas in
the West and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
"Wages and price pressure are generally described as subdued,
notwithstanding observations of tight labour markets in several
districts," the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The new Fed survey, known as the beige book, will be used by
the Fed when its Federal Open Market Committee will consider
interest rates in the next meeting on March 26.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the generally upbeat Fed survey, coming
after last Friday's report of the biggest jump in payroll jobs in
more than a decade, strengthened their belief that the Fed will
not cut rates further.
</P>
<P>
But others said that February's employment report, which
resulted in a big drop at the Wall Street stock and bond market
last Friday, was more of a fluke than an indicator of an
overheating economy and further drop of interest rate was
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Fed cut interest rates on January 31, the third reduction
since last July.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's 1996/97 Budget Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's 1996/97
budget was introduced in National Assembly by Finance Minister
Chris Liebenberg today, attracting mixed responses from political
parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new budget saw a modest rise in real expenditure, a
reduction of the deficit and a promise of more efficient tax
collection.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditure is up 10.4 percent at 173.659 billion Rand
(about 47.578 billion US Dollars), revenue rose 13.6 percent to
144.9 billion Rand (about 39.7 billion US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deficit dropped to 28.802 billion Rand (about
7.891 billion US Dollars) from previous year's 30.09 billion Rand
(about 8.244 billion US Dollars), representing a drop to 5.1
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from six percent.
</P>
<P>
The other highlights of the new budget also included no
increase in VAT (value-added-tax), retirement funds to be taxed
at 17 percent of income and interest payments, a 4.6 percent
increase in police budget and five percent cut in defense budget.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech, Liebenberg said job creation, poverty
relief and crime prevention were identified as priorities for
budget allocations.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg described his budget as ''excellent'', but his view
was not shared by political parties.
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP) said the budget deficit was a ''major
cause for concern'' and that the tax burden was too high.
</P>
<P>
NP finance spokesman Theo Alant said the deficit before
borrowing should have been cut to 4.5 percent of GDP through
further reductions to state expenditure.
</P>
<P>
NP's view was echoed by the Democratic Party (DP), whose
finance spokesman Ken Andrew called the ''spend now pay later''
budget ''very disappointing''.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front finance spokesman Willie Botha said it was
disappointing that Liebenberg sought new sources of income
instead of opting for a reduction in government spending.
</P>
<P>
However, the African National Congress (ANC) and Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) welcomed the budget, praising the budget as
one that would create jobs and boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said there was ''no cause for alarm'' over the
imposition of the retirement funds tax, and it was pleased that
Liebenberg had resisted the ''short-sighted and insensitive''
advice to raise VAT.
</P>
<P>
The IFP said it believed the budget was ''good and solid'' and
would ''take the country's socio-economic situation forward.''

<HEADLINE> Hamas Issues Statement Justifying Its Action against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- In its reaction to the
just-concluded "Summit of Peacemakers" in Egypt's Red Sea resort
of Sharm el Sheikh, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) today
issued a statement defending its action against Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in east Jerusalem, the statement said, "Hamas is a political
movement against occupation and its actions. It strives to achieve
this through both political and military work."
</P>
<P>
"Hamas Movement believes in political work as well as armed
struggle since each of them has a role in achieving these
rights ... thus it considers the military work of Iz a-Din
Al-Qassam Brigades as defensive measures, except in some
exceptional unintentional cases when it effected civilians, which
contradicts with Hamas' policy," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It continued, "We consider the Israeli presence, in its
various forms, in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, a
presence of occupation, which U.N. resolutions have continuously
stated and world governments have officially declared since
1967."
</P>
<P>
"U.N. Resolution 242 called on the immediate withdrawal of
Israeli forces from territories it occupied in 1967, but the
Israeli authorities still reject to abide by the text and spirit
of this resolution," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for our military apparatus's operations against
Israeli targets is the continued occupation of the Palestinian
territory. This target will spontaneously conclude with the
conclusion of the occupation," it declared.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Sharm el Sheikh Summit, the Hamas statement
warned: "The international measures supporting the Zionist
position in confronting Hamas will not be the correct approach to
solve the problem, but will be a cause for Israel to continue its
occupation."
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed welcome to any good-will international
mediation, emphasizing, however, that Hamas believes in dialogue
as means for understanding, "but we believe that it is our right
to resist the military occupation and Israeli terror and its
offensive measures against our people."

<HEADLINE> UN Concerned Over Looting In Sarajevo Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations officials today
expressed concern over incidents of terrorising and looting of
Serb homes in Ilidza by gangs from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The previously Serb controlled Ilidza has been handed over to
the Bosnian Federation since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"several Serbs who wanted to stay in Ilidza are now informing
the U.N. they have no choice but to leave," said Alexander Ivanko,
spokesman for the U.N. police force.
</P>
<P>
"This is another blow to the multi-ethnicity of Sarajevo,"
Ivanko said, "It's really a shame that some people who have come
Sarajevo to Ilidza are behaving in the same way as some Serbs
before leaving the area, they are intimidating and harassing
people."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman or the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris
Janowski, said that he saw during a tour of Ilidza that "hundreds
of people entering other people's apartments."
</P>
<P>
"One resident was threatened with a hand grenade, a second with
a pistol, while another with an explosive device," he said, adding
that many vehicles without license plates are moving through
Ilidza.
</P>
<P>
Janowski said that federal police has reacted in some cases,
but that there are too few of them to prevent all criminal acts.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Comprehensive, Lasting Peace in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government today
stressed that the achievement of a comprehensive, just and
lasting peace in the region will lead to an end of the violence
and terror.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers asserted that Lebanon considers that
a correct framework for dealing with the problem of terrorism and
violence is to make efforts to find a comprehensive, just and
lasting settlement to the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
Hours after an international anti-terrorism summit ended in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi convened a regular session of the Council of Ministers
in the Presidential Palace here this evening.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Hrawi called for an
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which
demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon,
according to a statement read out by Information Minister Farid
Mkari at the end of the cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi disclosed that in a conference of Arab foreign ministers
in Cairo Thursday, Lebanon will announce its own position on the
Israeli aggressions (in South Lebanon) and on what is happening
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz left here earlier today
for Cairo to attend the 105th conference of the Arab League
Council, which was postponed for one day due to today's
anti-terrorism summit held in Sharm el Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the Council of Ministers expressed
its support for a decision taken by the president to boycott the
summit at Sharm el Sheikh. The council stressed that Lebanon holds
that there is a distinction between terrorism and the legitimate
right of defending the land.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria were the only countries which had been
invited but were absent in the Sharm el Sheikh summit.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying Lebanon's decision to boycott the summit conference,
the statement said that this summit dealt with the subject of
terrorism, at a time when the basic problem in the Middle East is
political, for which a demanded solution has not yet been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the statement added, came responding to the
recent violence in Israel, while Lebanon suffers daily aggressions
without anyone calling for a stop of the terrorism and violent
operations against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon has always called, and is still calling for an
distinction between terrorism and the right of the legitimate
resistance which is guaranteed and practiced by a number of
countries," the statement stressed.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian FMs Discuss Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa met with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al Sharaa on the
ongoing Middle East peace process and the outcome of an
international anti-terrorism summit held in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place on the sideline of the 105th session of
the Arab League Council, which opened here earlier today with the
participation of the foreign ministers of its 22 member states.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Sharaa, in particular, assessed the situation in the
region following the anti-terrorism summit, or summit of
peacemakers, held Wednesday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort city of
Sharm el Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Moussa emphasized the need to maintain
the momentum of the peace process on all tracks, saying that this
was a demand of all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He said all acts of violence must be condemned, no matter they
take place in Israel or against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about Syria's absence from the summit of
peacemakers,
Moussa said that Syria's failure to attend was "a fact that
we regret."
</P>
<P>
"Yet we have represented the Syrian side and the whole Arab
side in the summit, because the Arab interests are one and the
same, namely, consolidation of the peace process, containing
violence and continuation of the process towards its ultimate goal
on the basis of the land-for-peace principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the restoration of occupied Arab territories
and the Palestinian people's legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister pointed out that there were some
differences between the two countries with regard to the
evaluation of the summit, but such differences would not affect
the policy of coordination between Egypt and Syria in the best
interests of peace, the Arab stance and the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Sharaa expressed his country's great confidence in
Egypt, saying that the Syrian and Egyptian peoples entertained
historic, fraternal and deep-rooted ties, which could not be
shaken by external events.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa pointed out that the political leadership in Syria had
taken a decision not to participate in the Sharm el Sheikh summit,
after a thorough examination of all possible eventualities and
realities.
</P>
<P>
The leadership reached the conclusion of non-participation, as
Syria was still suffering from Israeli occupation despite the
lapse of four years since the inception of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the closing statement of the
peacemakers summit serves the Israeli side more than it does the
Arab side.
</P>
<P>
He said that the peacemakers summit left no room for
distinction between terrorism and what is not terrorism, namely,
the resistance of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa emphasized Syria's commitment to the peace process,
saying that no one could cast any doubt about Syria's adherence to
the peace option.

<HEADLINE> 71 People Injured during Riots in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 71 people were
injured and eight others were arrested here today following
clashes outside the Cyprus Archbishop's palace between the
anti-riot police and supporters of a clergyman.
</P>
<P>
The clergyman, Archimandrite Pangratios Meraklis, was facing
charges of "improper moral conduct" before the Holy Synod, the
island's supreme church body.
</P>
<P>
According to a police spokesman, two policemen and three
demonstrators were hospitalized for further treatment. Eight more
policemen and 58 demonstrators who were taken to hospital, mostly
suffering from breathing problems caused by the tear gas, were
later released.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, some 2,000 demonstrators, who want Meraklis, 39,
to become Bishop of Morphou area, partly occupied by the Turkish
troops since 1974, tried to break police barriers around the
Archbishop's palace in the walled city of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place when some 410 policemen, including 140
anti-riot police members, used tear gas and other means to
disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Glafcos Xenos pointed out that the police
were left with no other choice to restore law and order other
than taking anti-riot measures.
</P>
<P>
Deputy police chief Panikos Hadjiloizou also confirmed that
Cyprus police had information that some extremist groups of
supporters were planning to use explosives and that they received
an anonymous call saying that the life of Archbishop Chrysostomos
was in danger.
</P>
<P>
The Archbishop has stated that Meraklis was "unfit" for the
post of the Bishop of Morphou, accusing him of "moral
misconduct".
</P>
<P>
A Holy Synod press release said three prosecution witnesses
failed to appear before the body today because they had been
threatened by Meraklis' supporters. A fourth witness, a
clergyman, testified against Meraklis.
</P>
<P>
The press release also said the Meraklis appeared before the
Holy Synod and declared that he was not guilty of charges of
"improper moral conduct."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides appealed
for calm and the restoration of law and order.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Rule Extended in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The emergency rule in 10
provinces in southeastern Turkey will be extended, probably for
the last time, for another period of four months as of March 19
following a lengthy debate in the parliament today.
</P>
<P>
This was the 26th time in 18 years that Turkish legislature
extended the emergency rule, which gives sweeping power to local
authorities in fighting with the separatist Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The government's extension draft was passed by a vote of 227 to
 179 with 51 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ulku Guney said that the extension of the
emergency rule would help boost the morale of the security forces
in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the government in next four months would work
on alternative law drafts, such as ID checks, possession of arms
and administration of villages and provinces, and bring it to the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies who took the floor during today's session
pointed out that the Kurdish problem cannot be solved by simply
killing the separatists and that a democratic approach with
political and economic solutions should be introduced.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot fight mosquitos by killing them one by one,"
said one deputy. "You have to drain the swamp".
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that more than 20,000 people have died,
countless wounded in the fighting between the Kurdish rebels and
government forces.
