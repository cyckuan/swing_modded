<HEADLINE> WMO: 1995 the Warmest Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) said Wednesday the year of 1995 was "the warmest year so
far", with the estimated global mean surface temperature being
highest on record.
</P>
<P>
Global observations however do not link the record warmth with
the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which ended in early 1995
following a prolonged ENSO warm episode from 1991 to the end of
1994.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures as high as 47 degrees Centigrade were felt in
parts of Turkmenastan and Kazakstan, and in Spain in July. Central
England experienced the warmest July and August since 1659, with
temperatures hitting 34 degrees Centigrade in some places.
</P>
<P>
The UN specialized meteorological agency said in the report
issued Wednesday that as a global average, 1996 may be slightly
cooler than 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the WMO annual report on global climate, 1995 was
also marked with poor rainfall in some regions and flooding in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
Precipitation 75 percent below normal was reported in central
and southern Brazil, southern Paraguay and parts of Argentina from
early may to mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Less than half of normal rain was measured from November 1994
to late June 1995 across northern and western Morocco, central
Tunisia, much of Algeria, the Iberian Peninsula and southern
France.
</P>
<P>
In central Europe and southern Australia, abundant rainfall
resulted in floodings.
</P>
<P>
The most active hurricane season since 1933 occurred in the
Atlantic Ocean, with destructive winds, storm surges and
torrential rains wreaking havoc in the Caribbean islands, as well
as some parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Notably, in 1995, the ozone hole during the Antarctic spring
period began earlier and lasted a record length, resulting in
almost a total destruction of the ozone layer over the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
Concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere
continued to increase during last year, said WMO.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Labor communities in Pakistan
today observed International Labor Day with renewed commitment to
continuing their struggle to get and safeguard their rights.
</P>
<P>
It was a public holiday and all government, commercial offices
and educational institutions remained closed.
</P>
<P>
Labor Committee in Rawalpindi, twin city of the capital, today
organized a rally to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Participants chanted slogans for protecting their lawful
rights, carrying banners inscribed with their demands, including
ending of contract system and trend of daily wages which is
regarded as harmful to the workers' interests.
</P>
<P>
May Day was observed in the Punjab capital of Lahore by a
number of labor organizations in memory of Chicago workers who
laid down their lives for workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders renewed their pledge to work more devotedly for
higher living standards and better wages for the labor community.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to announce a fresh package of
benefits, take steps to check price hike and stop privatization of
profit-earning public sector industry.
</P>
<P>
The participants raised slogans that they were the real owners
and the privatization would further increase the already high rate
of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Various organizations in Quetta, provincial capital of
Baluchistan, also observed the day by holding processions and
public meetings.
</P>
<P>
Trader union leaders there highlighted the significance of the
day and renewed pledge to serve the country with full dedication.
</P>
<P>
However, Eid ul Azha festival, a Muslim holiday due Monday this
year, and week-long holidays put a damper on traditionally
exuberant May Day celebrations in some parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Rabbi Stabbed in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli rabbi (Jewish
religious leader) was stabbed and seriously wounded today in the
West Bank town of Hebron, according to an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
Nissin Gudayi, the 72-years-old rabbi from Kiryat Arba, a
Jewish settlement near Hebron, was shopping for vegetables in the
open market in the center of Hebron when he was stabbed from
behind.
</P>
<P>
Gudayi was rushed to the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem with
the knife still in his back, after receiving first aid treatment
at the scene by settlers and medical personnel who arrived
shortly after the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
After an immediate operation, doctors described his condition
as serious, but not life threatening.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Israeli army closed the open market,
arrested several suspected local Palestinian residents, and
declared a curfew in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Major Mustafa Al-Natsheh condemned the stabbing, and
said that those responsible for the incident aimed at stopping
the redeployment of the Israeli army in the city.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "the Palestinians are insisting the
Israeli troops leave," adding the arrival of the Palestinian
police will put an end to such attacks in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jewish community of Hebron, together with the
Kiryat Arba settlers, observed a one-day strike today, as part of
their campaign to stop the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 settlers of Hebron and Kiryat Arba traveled to
Jerusalem today to protest outside the Knesset (Israel's
parliament), as a debate on the possible withdrawal was going on
inside the building.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, the Israeli army was scheduled to complete its
withdrawal from Hebron by March 28, but Israel postponed the
pullout due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported last week that the Israeli army would
leave 85 percent of the Hebron municipal area on May 4, and then
to redeploy in the remaining 15 percent of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, army sources said that the withdrawal from Hebron
could be made in stages, with the final one taking place after the
Israeli general elections on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interior Minister Haim Ramon said today the final
decision concerning the withdrawal will only be made by Prime
Minister Shimon Peres after he returns from his trip to the
U.S. and France this evening.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that it is expected that Peres will hold
consultations on Friday with army officers in deciding on a
timetable for the withdrawal from the West Bank town.

<HEADLINE> UK to Withdraw All RAF Planes from Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense has
announced that it will withdraw all Royal Air Force (RAF) planes
from Germany by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The RAF base in Laarbruch, Germany will be closed in 1999 and
the British planes there are to be redeployed to bases in Britain,
according to the annual Defense White Paper published here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four Tornado squadrons based at RAF Bruggen,
Germany "should also be redeployed to existing operational bases
in the United Kingdom," with the base being closed over the next
six years, the White Paper said.
</P>
<P>
On the reasons of closing the RAF bases, the document explained
that the redeployment will "allow significant financial savings to
be made while increasing the effectiveness of training."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference of launching the White Paper,
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo said, it is becoming
very difficult to conduct low-flying training missions in Germany
and it is better to withdraw these planes back to Britain.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised that this decision will not affect the country's
ability cooperate with its NATO allies and meet its NATO
commitments.
</P>
<P>
The move will end a RAF presence of more than 50 years
in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Consumers International Official On Mad Cow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Consumers International acting
regional director Ngaite Chimbandi said here today that safe food
is a priority for all consumers and that all governments should
adopt a precautionary policy and eliminate mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Consumers International has asked all its members to approach
their governments to obtain information on mad cow disease and
crautzfeld jacobs disease (CJD) in their countries, Ms. Chimbandi
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that this information will be used to prepare a
report so that consumer organizations could monitor the situation
and take all the steps within their power to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease broke out in Britain in March and resulted in
the CJD disease that was equivalent to it, which causes fatal
strain in people who consumed diseased beef.
</P>
<P>
She said Consumers International's policy on mad cow disease
is to call on all governments to adopt a precautionary policy on
it and eliminate it from the food chain.
</P>
<P>
Ms.Chimbandi called for adequate compensation to be paid to
ensure that regulations are enforced and those in the industry do
not face economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
And where mad cow disease is not a problem, governments should
take steps to ensure that contaminated animal feeds are not
imported, she added.

<HEADLINE> Test May Help Cancer Treatment, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have developed a
test to predict which cancer patients would fail to benefit from
toxic chemotherapy drugs, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The test is based on the discovery of a protein involved in
signaling cell death. Researchers have named this molecule SAP
(stress-activated protein) kinase.
</P>
<P>
Chemotherapy drugs attack tumors by using this protein to send
a "suicide signal" to cancer cells, said Dr. Brent Zanke of the
Ontario Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
"Cancer cells actually kill themselves after they've been
exposed to drugs," he said. "What chemotherapy actually does is
whisper to these cells:'It is time for you to die.'"
</P>
<P>
The findings by Dr. Zanke and his colleagues are published
today in the British medical journal Current Biology.
</P>
<P>
Chemotherapy drugs fail when the flow of the information is
short-circuited, Dr. Zanke noted.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists have developed a test for the presence of
that short circuit. Blood, or cells from the tumor, is subjected
to an antibody that could show if the pathway is complete.
</P>
<P>
Patients given the test will be checked to see if it predicted
their cancer's resistance to chemotherapy, Dr. Zanke said.
</P>
<P>
Chemotherapy can cause side-effects such as hair loss, nausea
and a severely weakened immune system. The treatment cures some
people, but most gain only temporary shrinkage of a tumor.
</P>
<P>
If doctors knew in advance that a patient would not benefit
from such therapy, they could give increased radiation treatments,
or even experimental new medications, Dr. Zanke said.

<HEADLINE> Shark Substance found to Limit Tumor Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- American researchers have found a
novel substance in sharks that can control the growth of brain
tumors, New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
conducted experiments on rats and found the substance, known as
squalamine, has controlled the growth of brain tumors in rats and
prolonged their lives.
</P>
<P>
The substance attacks tumors by suppressing the formation of new
blood vessels, according to a research team.
</P>
<P>
The findings provide"the first evidence that squalamine may
work against brain cancer," the team said in a news release.
Additional animal experiments must be completed before squalamine
can be tested in humans.
</P>
<P>
Other scientists determined that squalamine works by changing a
cell's shape through disruption of the exchange of sodium and
hydrogen on its surface.
</P>
<P>
Squalamine was found to be a component of shark stomach and
other tissues, and the highest amounts were found in shark livers.
</P>
<P>
Squalamine may ultimately be used with standard chemotherapy,
radiation and surgery in treating brain tumors, researchers hoped.

SOFIA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov
marked the May Day holiday with a call to fellow Socialists to
unite in the fight against the country's economic woes in the

</P>
<P>
But the country's trade unions turned the celebrations into a

electricity, gasoline and central-heating, and an increase in the
number of the poor.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the government change its social policies or
resign.
</P>
<P>
At a rally organized by his Socialist Party, Videnov called on
the party members to help his 16-month-old government stabilize
the financial situation, attract more foreign investment and
increase exports.
</P>
<P>
He also listed a series of achievements made by his government
in the previous year, including economic growth and a drop in the
number of the jobless.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the people's actual income stopped

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Launches Verbal Attacks upon Euroseptics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm has
severely criticized the Eurosecptics of the ruling Conservative
Party, saying "anti-European" feeling will eventually jeopardize
the British national interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the European Policy Forum here today, Rifkind said
that the current rising tide of "anti-European" wave is "childish
xenophobia".
</P>
<P>
Rifkind pointed out that Britain's pulling out of the European
Union (EU) will mean abandoning British influence over the shaping
the rules governing the world's largest free market.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind and other senior cabinet ministers are battling to
unite the deeply-divided Conservative Party behind Prime Minister
John Major around a pragmatic position on Europe in which Britain
remains an active member of the EU but resists any further ceding
of sovereignty to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Some Eurosecptic MPs have recently argued that in an
increasingly free-trade world, it would not result in any tragedy
if Britain pulled out the EU rather than accept a more federal
super-state.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said "some argue that we could have the benefits of the
Single Market without membership of the EU, they are wrong, as
membership could give access to the EU Commission and European
Court which enforce single market rules."
</P>
<P>
He explained that EU membership did not require Britain "to
submit to the inevitability of greater loss of sovereignty and
submersion in some incipient Euro-state."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the rhetoric of some politicians on the Continent,
the reality is that there is no demand or wish on the part of the
peoples of Europe for a United State of Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a recently conducted opinion poll showed
that nearly six out of ten British people questioned oppose the
idea of single European currency and 75 percent want a referendum
on any plans for closer European integration.

<HEADLINE> Over 110 Million Landmines Lying buried in 64 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) says there are over 110 million landmines
buried in old and new battlefields in 64 countries.
</P>
<P>
In a document, titled Landmines: A Global Concern, the
committee says more than 2,000 people are killed or maimed by
mine explosions every month. The document is prepared for the 3rd
Organization of African Unity (OAU)/ICRC Seminar for the
ambassadors accredited to the OAU which will open here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It says, more than 30 percnet of the victims in some countries
are women and children, the very people who should be spared from
the effects of war more than anyone.
</P>
<P>
In a view of the serious difficulties in enforcing complex
restrictions on their use and the appaling human consequences
involved, the committee believes the only effective solution is
to ban entirely the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
anti- personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Anti-personnel mines cost from 3-30 dollars each while
neutralizing them costs between 300 and 1,000 dollars, the
committee adds. enditem

<HEADLINE> Least Developed Countries Call For Alleviation Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng and Li Sizhi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua)-- The ministers of the world's
Least Developed Countries (LDCS) today called for the alleviation
of their heavy debt burden.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued after the ministerial meeting of the
LDCS in Midrand north of Johannesburg, the ministers noted that
the LDCS's external debt service burden remains extremely high
and far exceeds the debt-servicing capacity of many LDCS.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they appealed for the alleviation of their official
bilateral debt and ''urgent and effective measures'' to reduce
the LDCS' debt burden to multilateral financial institutions and
commercial creditors.
</P>
<P>
According to the least developed country report of 1996, the
total debt burden of the world's 48 LDCS amounted to 127 billion
U.S. Dollars at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
And thirty-three of the 48 LDCS are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the
cause of sustained growth and sustainable development in an
increasingly globalising and liberalising world economy.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the LDCS are confronting the processes of
globalisation and liberalisation from a position of disadvantage,
and they feared, to this extent, that the process will accelerate
the marginalistion of the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
The declaration reiterated that the LDCS will continue to
implement economic reforms in a bid to facilitate free trade. But
at the same time, they acknowledged that they can not face
challenges without ''effective and sufficient support measures by
the international community''.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Releases 9 Detainees in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel and its client militia
released today nine prisoners, including a woman, from a hilltop
jail at Khiam in the Israeli occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
This was first batch of detainees released from the Israeli
jail in south Lebanon since a cease-fire was enforced last
Saturday, which put an end to the 16-day Israeli bombardment on
Lebanon, which had claimed more than 160 lives.
</P>
<P>
Five of the prisoners released today went back directly to
their homes inside Israel's self-proclaimed "security zone" in
southern Lebanon, when four others were transferred to the areas
controlled by the Lebanese government by a vehicle of the
International Red Cross Committee.
</P>
<P>
The four persons were identified by Red Cross sources as Anwar
Ahmad Zohour, 32, Abdu Rahman Yassin, 33, Palestinian, Samar
Alaiq, 19, female, Mohammed Dhahra, 31.
</P>
<P>
Besides the woman who had been jailed for three years, the
other three men had been jailed for seven years and a half, or
since November 1988.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 prisoners are being held by Israel and the south
Lebanon army militia in the jail at Khiam, but a specific number
of the prisoners has never been officially given by the Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Most of them were thrown into the jail for their alleged
collaboration with anti-Israeli guerrillas of Lebanese and
Palestinian factions. No trial for them has been carried
out.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Israeli warplanes flew intensive reconnaissance
flights at medium altitute over southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of fire erupted Tuesday afternoon between Lebanese
Shiite Moslem guerrillas and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army militia at heights opposite the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
This was the first fighting in southern Lebanon since the
so-called "April understanding" was enforced Saturday morning,
leading to the cease-fire between Israel and the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.

<TEXT>
<P>
Security sources in the southern Lebanese port city of Saida
said that Iglim Al-Toffah witnessed the exchange of shots of
artilleries and machineguns between the SLA militia's positions at
Sejoud and the positions of the Islamic Resistance at Telal Mlita
and its vicinities. The Islamic Resistance is the military wing of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said that some 20 artillery shells fell at
Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge often used by guerrillas as a springboard
to launch attacks at the Israeli occupation forces, during
Tuesday's fighting. No casualties were reported by the sources.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah announced that its artillery shelled the enemy's
positions at Sejoud at 2:25 p.m. (11:25 GMT). Both Israel and its
client militia confirmed the attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese army units were continuing
today counting up the damages caused by Israel in its Operation
Grapes of Wrath in southern Lebanon from April 11 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Army sources said that the works were facing difficulties in
some villages due to the absence of owners of a number of the
destroyed houses.
</P>
<P>
Explosive experts of the army were still going on searching
unexploded bombs in southern areas.
</P>
<P>
The works of searching-and-detonating have finished at Iglim
Al-Toffah, when 24 more hours are needed in order to complete the
works at the Nabatiyeh area, and three more days are needed at the
Sour area, according to the army sources.
</P>
<P>
Local citizens have been warned to report to the nearest army
post or police station if they find unexploded bombs and other
suspected subjects.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri announced today that the
slogans since today should be "the resistance for the sake of the
nation " instead of "the nation for the sake of the resistance."
</P>
<P>
Inspecting some village in southern Lebanon, Lebanon's House
speaker said, "all of us should be one hand, and responsible for
each other."
</P>
<P>
"And Lebanon has shown its unity and persistence in its
nationalism in order to save the South to become more
self-confident and more trustful among its sons," Berri told the
southern Lebanese villagers.
</P>
<P>
Alluding a brief gun battle between armed men of his Amal
Movement and its traditional rival group the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah on Monday, Berri warned against any attempt of fishing
in troubled waters, underlining that the relations between the
southern Lebanese people was "better than any problem."
</P>
<P>
Berri was quoted by the state-run Lebanese National News
Agency as saying that he was "personally responsible in
guarding Amal Movement and Hezbollah at the same level."
</P>
<P>
"We never accept any harm against fighters from Hezbollah
nor fighters from Amal Movement, since they are brothers,"
said the house speaker, who is also the chairman of the
Shiite Amal Movement.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that he had discovered some new and interesting
possibilities for advancing the peace process during his visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference this evening at the Ben-Gurion
Airport upon his return from a tour of the U.S. and France, Peres
did not go into details on how his trip will help accelerate the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to the U.S., Peres and
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed an accord that will deepen
anti-terrorism cooperation between their two countries through
research and development.
</P>
<P>
He also signed with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry an
agreement under which the U.S. provides Israel with immediate
assistance for defense against Katyusha attacks and long-term
laser missile defense.
</P>
<P>
Peres rejected the opposition's allegation that his trip was
designed to make political gains during the current election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu today accused Peres of
exploiting his close relations with President Clinton and several
Arab leaders to improve his chances for reelection.
</P>
<P>
Like the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians, he said, it will
again take the opposition three years to understand the importance
of his trip to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Mandela On Workers' Right Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South African workers' rights
and interests were protected in the constitution and the common
law as never before, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 3,000 members of the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU) at a May Day rally in Athlone of
Western Cape province, Mandela said a new labor relations act was
replacing previous repressive laws which had undermined workers'
rights.
</P>
<P>
However, the president made no reference to the workers'
demands that the controversial lock-out clause should not be
entrenched in the final constitution, scheduled to be adopted on
May 8.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, COSATU organized a one-day nationwide strike to
demand the exclusion of the lock-out clause from the country's
final constitution.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela said major changes were being made to
occupational health and safety, employment standards and
employment equity.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that these changes would bring South African
industry standards in line with the best international standards
and would help create a free and humanitarian labor market which
would equip the country to compete internationally.
</P>
<P>
The salaries and conditions of public sector workers, who had
been paid poverty wages for years, were being improved, said the
president, adding the whole nation depended on these workers for
public service.

LUSAKA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Godfrey
Miyanda stressed today the country had a lot of potential for
economic growth and enhanced prosperity which could only be
attained through hard work.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of workers in Lusaka to mark the Labor
Day, Miyanda said that to achieve the desired goal, Zambians
should change their attitude towards work for the common good of
the country.
</P>
<P>
''There is nobody else who will develop Zambia other than
Zambians themselves, investors and donors may play their part,
but in the main we ourselves have to fight and win the economic
war,'' Miyanda noted.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, low levels of productivity had
been identified as the major cause for the poor performance of
some sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The government would establish a national productivity center
in the near future to promote productivity in the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the government was determined to
restructure the economy to raise the standard of living of the
people.

Varieties of celebrations were held today in Zambia's major
cities and towns to mark May Day.

<HEADLINE> UN: More UNITA Soldiers Enter Quartering Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is seeing
an upsurge in the number of National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) soldiers in Angola who are entering quartering
sites and registering, U.N. chief spokesman Sylvana Foa said
today.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, yesterday 1,352 entered quartering sites, and the
day before 949, while last Friday, there was only 290 arrivals,
and Thursday only 189 arrivals," she said.
</P>
<P>
In expressing welcome to the development, Sylvana explained
that the upsurge is due to the fact that the mandate of the United
Nations Verification Force expires on May 8 and that normally the
U.N. sees them coming in when the issue of the mandate is raised.
</P>
<P>
She said as of the end of April, 26,169 UNITA soldiers had
registered in the quartering sites, while on the government side,
3,878 rapid reaction police out of the declared strength of 3,977
had been quartered in eight cities.
</P>
<P>
"However, we do need firm commitment form both sides in the
peace process and faster quartering of soldiers particularly on
the UNITA side," she added. The UNITA is reportedly to have over
60,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peacekeeping force was sent to Angola to
monitor a 1994 Lusaka peace agreement. The agreement set a
timetable for the troops quartering of both the government and the
UNITA troops. But both sides lag far behind the time schedule.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat said here today that U.S. President Bill Clinton and
he had agreed to form a joint Palestinian-American Commission to
deal with issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the announcement at a press conference of the U.S.
National Press Club after meeting for 45 minutes with Clinton at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said that the agreed commission would
"deal with all issues of mutual concern for us and for the United
States." But he declined to give any details, saying that the
project was only in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Johnson told reporters that U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher had done some work in the
region during the past weeks and before for the two sides to
establish a mechanism for dealing with the issues of common
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Tuesday for the first formal visit to
the United States as a leader of his nation, told the reporters
that his meeting with Clinton was "fruitful and productive."
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said that the U.S. and Palestinian
leaders focused their talks on the final phase of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks about the future of the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pledged to continue efforts for further advance of the
Mideast peace process. But he bitterly complained of Israeli
restrictions on the movement of Palestinians into Israel following
a wave of suicide bombings earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the restrictions had forced some 120,000
Palestinians out of work and was costing his self-rule area about 6
million U.S. dollars a day.

LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A full inquiry into the mass massacre
at Dunblane Primary School, central Scotland, will be on May 29,
announced senior Scottish judge Lord Cullen today.

and their woman teacher were killed and another 12 children
wounded. Lord Cullen was commissioned by the British government
the following day to carry out the inquiry.

<HEADLINE> IDCS Should Be Given Special Preferences In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate today urged
developed countries to provide the developing countries, especially
the least developed countries (LDCS), with a finer and more just
environment in international trade for competition.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation made the call during a general debate on the subject of
"international trade" at the Ninth Session of the UN Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX) in Midrand, 20 kilometers north of
here.
</P>
<P>
He said in the course of economic globalization, vulnerability of
the developing countries should be taken into full account and that
the developed countries should implement their commitments promised in
the Uruguay round agreements.
</P>
<P>
For this, the agreement on giving developing nations, especially
the LDCS and pure food importers the treatment of preferences and
relevant regulations should be fulfilled in earnest, said Long.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as the Uruguay round agreements have eroded the
generalized system of preferences (GSP) for the developing countries,
improvement of the GSP or implementation of other acts of preferences
should be carried out as a supplementary measure.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalization should be expanded to allow more farm
products and textiles from the developing countries to enter into
the markets of the developed countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Long urged the developed nations to reduce protectionist
measures, drop anti-dumping acts and shun the use of environment as
an excuse to practise protection in trade.
</P>
<P>
As UNCTAD entered its fifth day today, hundreds of delegates from
188 countries gathered at a spacious "ball hall" to debate
international trade in the post-Uruguay round era.
</P>

The meeting will end on May 11. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Begins Removing Spent Nuclear Fuel Rods in DPRK Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua)-- U.S. energy experts today began
removing thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods from a nuclear
facility of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a
spokesman for the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, after months of technical preparations and discussions,
U.S. energy experts and private U.S. companies began the canning
operations on the 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods at the nuclear
facility in North Korea," spokesman Mike McCurry said at a press
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that the operation is taking place "under the
supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency" and "will
make the world a safer place."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the U.S. experts are removing the fuel
rods from a cooling pond and placing them in steel canisters.
</P>
<P>
Under an framework agreement signed in 1994 between Washington
and Pyongyang, the DPRK will freeze activity at its existing
nuclear reactor and at a facility for extracting plutonium from
reactor fuel rods.
</P>
<P>
It also agreed to permit regular inspections of its nuclear
program by the International Atomic Energy Agency as called for
under terms of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The United States in exchange agreed to arrange for the
international financing and supply of two light-water nuclear
reactors to the DPRK for electricity production. The project, at
an estimated cost of 4 billion U.S. dollars is underway smoothly,
American officials said.

<HEADLINE> South African Workers To Sacrifice To Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South African workers are
prepared to make sacrifices for the country's greater good
including accepting a return to prescribed asset investments,
shorter working hours and an overtime ban to ensure more
employment.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Secretary-General of the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU) Sam Shilowa while speaking to about
3,000 COSATU members at the May Day rally in Athlone near Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
Instead of proposing more mass action as threatened earlier to
press labor's constitutional demands, Shilowa catalogued ways
which workers would be prepared to benefit the economy.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, COSATU organized a one-day nationwide strike to
demand the exclusion of the lock-out clause from the country's
new constitution, scheduled to be adopted on May 8.
</P>
<P>
By mooting prescribed asset investments, Shilowa proposed a
return to the policy phased out by the National Party (NP) in the
late 1980s in which the government prescribed that pension and
retirement funds would have to invest a percentage of their
income into government bonds.
</P>
<P>
Shilowa said the former NP government had in the past used
this to invest only in the infrastructure of white areas, but
workers would now be amenable to such a policy on condition that
the money was used to upgrade disadvantaged communities.
</P>
<P>
He also said workers would be prepared to work shorter hours,
for example a 40-hour week, to ensure that more people could
enter the limited labor market.
</P>
<P>
On COSATU's Tuesday strike, Shilowa said the nationwide stay
away was not against the government or the African National
Congress.

<HEADLINE> African, Asian States Call For Assistance To IDCS (by Li Sizhi and Ye Xingzeng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A number of African and Asian
states today took the floor in the general debate of UNCTAD IX,
urging the developed nations to keep on providing help to
developing countries, especially the least developed countries
(LDCS).
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary-General of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Vijay Makhan said when economic liberalization and
globalization move along in the world, "there looms a threat of
marginalization of millions of people", those in Africa in
particupar.
</P>
<P>
He noted although the conclusion of the uruguay round of
multilateral trade negotiations has ushered in the establishment
of the Wworld Trade Organization, the perennial trade and
development problems that face Africa have not changed, not least
in its commodity problems.
</P>
<P>
Makhan reminded the UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) of the proposal in the Addis Ababa Declaration that
requests the donor community to contribute to the African
commodities diversification fund in accordance with the UN
General Assembly Resolution 49/142.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU calls for the operation of the first account of the
common fund. To that end, we appeal to those who have pledged
resources to the second account to honor those pledges without
further delay," said the OAU official.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of Africa's external indebtedness remains
unresolved, saying Africa's debt totalled 317 billion US Dollars
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This corresponds to an average of 231.3 percent of Africa's
exports of goods and services and 71.6 percent of the total GDP
of the continent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Banglaldesh Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce
Mofazzal Karim said he regreted that increasing globalization and
liberalization have adversely affected many enterprises in
developing countries, even resulting in the closure of many.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the opportunities and benefits for ldcs
arising from the Uruguay round are expected to be largely
indirect and would materialize only in the long-run."
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, the costs stemming from the Uruguay round are
more immediate and substantial and would arise from three
sources: erosion of trade preferences, higher prices from import
of food, pharmaceuticals and essential capital goods and
increased administrative costs for compliance," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Karim said, "despite vigorous efforts to diversify, the ldc
economy remains vulnerable to instability in commodity markets.
official development assistance registered a decline in the early
1990s. Flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to LDCS amounts to
be less than one percent of the total flow to developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian delegate told those present at the meeting that
two thirds of the LDCS are in Africa and that the ldcs should
enjoy the generalized system of preferences (gsp) and not
discrimination on the products.
</P>
<P>
A delegate from Mauritius also said as the Uruguay round
agreements have eroded the preferences rendered to developing
countries, the Lome Agreement should remain effective and weak
and small states and island states should be given the GSP as a
supplementary measure.
</P>
<P>
As UNCTAD ix entered its fifth day today, hundreds of
delegates from 188 countries attended the general debate on
international trade at the "ball hall" in Midrand, midway between
Pretoria and Johannesburg. The meeting will come to a close on
May 11. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Flexes Naval Muscle Off Coast of Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States has flexed its
naval muscle off the coast of Liberia, drawing three warships and
several hundred Marines to within sight of Monrovia, U.S. military
officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that the move came after three fatal attacks on the
American Embassy in Liberia over the past 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. Assistant Secretary of State George Moose huddled
behind the walled compound of the American Embassy Tuesday, U.S.
Marine gunners killed at least three Liberians and wounded one in
three separate attacks. The U.S. envoy was unharmed and vowed to
continue his peace mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 U.S. marine commandos remain in waters off Liberia
to answer such contingency as an attack on the American Embassy.
Nearly 300 were recently deployed into Monrovia to help repel
attacks on American facilities and citizens in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the most influential power in Liberia, has
evacuated most non-African foreigners from Monrovia in April and
is pushing for a political settlement in the African state.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on Youths to Stay Away From Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called on students to stay away from drugs and violence
and develop their minds and bodies.
</P>
<P>
"If you young people have heart... you'll stay in school,
you'll stay drug free, you'll stay away from drugs and violence
and you'll get into developing your minds and bodies," Clinton
said at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the modern
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to this summer's Olympics in Atlanta will see "America
at its best," Clinton told a students audience at the District of
Columbia's Eastern High School.
</P>
<P>
"They'll see our diversity and our unity. They'll see that we
have differences that don't divide us. They'll see that we
understand individual excellence and teamwork," the president
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton took the opportunity to encourage students to
concentrate their efforts on study and stay off drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to a Gallup poll disclosed today, violent crime and
drugs are the major concerns of Americans.
</P>
<P>
As many as 57 percent of Americans have a relative or close
friend who has used drugs, and 67 percent considered that drug use
often leads to violent crimes, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The number of drug users in the country retains 12 million
though there has been a big fall since 1979, Barry McCaffrey, the
new head of President Clinton's drug control policy, said
today in presenting the results of the Gallop Survey at a
press conference in Washington.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Backs China In Entering WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIDRAND, SOUTH AFRICA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) backs China's
efforts to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero here today when having talks with Chinese Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Ms Wu Yi and members of
the delegation she is leading to attend the Ninth UNCTAD session.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO needs China, because China has proved to the world
that even if she has not enjoyed the rights of the WTO, she can
flourish by means of her own strength," Ricupero said.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNCTAD had always got vigorous support from China
and maintained fruitful cooperation with her and that his
organization would strengthen and continue to expand this kind of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you that we will continue to back China's wishes to
enter the WTO," Ricupero, a Brazilian, told Ms Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
Ms Wu thanked the UNCTAD for supporting China to enter the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's volume of foreign trade reached 280 billion US
dollars, occupying the 11th in the world, she said, noting that
"it was unfair and unreasonable to exclude China from the WTO."
</P>
<P>
She also said, "The role of the UNCTAD should be strengthened,
and this is the aspirations of all the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
Out of the 188 UNCTAD member states, 160 are from the
developing countries, accounting for the great majority, and
their strength should not be neglected and under-estimated,
Ms Wu Yi said.
</P>
<P>
She said China had all along supported the UNCTAD for playing
a bigger role together with the WTO in promoting the
globalization and liberalization of the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue her support for UNCTAD and will further
strengthen the support in the future," said the Chinese minister.
</P>
<P>
Ms Wu Yi invited the UNCTAD chief to visit China and Ricupero
accepted the invitation, and said, "the developing countries are
proud of the achievements made by China."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India's Second-phase Polls End with Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- In a lower turnout than the first
phase, an estimated 50 to 55 percent of the more than 220 million
voters today voted in the second phase of polling in India's
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Today's polling covered 204 Lok Sabha (House of the People) and
223 assembly (state parliament) seats in several major states of
India as well as some union territories.
</P>
<P>
An approximate 55 to 60 percent polling was reported in the
first phase of elections to 150 Lok Sabha and 532 assembly seats
on April 27.
</P>
<P>
Today's voting was by and large peaceful, barring a few
incidents which claimed at least seven lives in Bihar and Andhra
Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
Six persons were killed and over ten others injured in poll
violence as police firing, bomb blasts and booth capturing marred
the polling in Bihar with an estimated turnout of 50 to 55 percent
in 20 of its 54 Lok Sabha constituencies which went to poll today.
</P>
<P>
In Andhra Pradesh, a police sub-inspector was killed and three
constables were injured in a land mine explosion in Nizamabad
district of the south Indian state.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when a police team was chasing a group of
miscreants who hijacked a jeep carrying poll materials.
</P>
<P>
Police firing, ballot paper snatching and stray incidents of
clashes marked an otherwise peaceful polling in West Bengal today
with 65 percent voting recorded in the state, a traditional
stronghold of left parties in India. Re-polls have been
recommended in four polling stations of the state because of
snatching of ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sporadic incidents of violence were also reported
from some other constituencies where polls were conducted today.
</P>
<P>
The polling was held amidst tight security with about 600,000
security personnel, including 75,000 para-military forces, keeping
vigil at nearly 300,000 polling stations. The security beef-up
was in view of the fact that today's polling covered a
historically violence-prone state of Bihar and politically
volatile Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
Sealed in ballot boxes today were the electoral fortunes of
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao (Berhampur constituency in
Orissa) and Atal Behari Vajpayee (Lucknow of Uttar Pradesh), the
prime ministerial candidate of major opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party.
</P>
<P>
Others whose electoral destines were to be decided were Lok
Sabha Speaker Shivraj Patil, his deputy S. Mallikajunaiah and All
India Indira Congress leader N.D. Tiwari.
</P>
<P>
Today's polling for the Lok Sabha elections covered such major
states of the country as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat,
Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar
Pradesh and West Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Polling was also held for 140 out of 294 assembly seats in West
Bengal and remaining 83 of the 224 assembly seats in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
The current general elections for the 11th Lok Sabha are
arranged in six phases. The third phase of polling is slated for
May 7.

JERUSAlEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from more than 50
countries who are here attending the European regional conference
of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are, among
other things on their agenda, preparing for the first World Food
Summit.
</P>
<P>
Israel is hosting the conference for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 heads of state are expected to attend the planned
five-day summit, which is to open in Rome on November 17.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summit's secretary-general, Kay Killingsworth, was
quoted by the local press today as saying that by the year 2030,
there will be 3 billion more people on earth, most of them in
the developing nations, and without concerted global action the
number which is undernourished will not substantially diminish.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is a landmark event. For the first time, the heads
of government will make a concerted effort to eradicate hunger and
ensure universal food security," she said. "The responsibilities
of the individual nations and international bodies will be
defined. We have to put the food issue back at the top of the
international political agenda."
</P>
<P>
According to an FAO report released at the conference, nearly
800 million people in the world are chronically undernourished and
some 200 million children under the age of five are in jeopardy
because of chronic protein or calorie deficiencies.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Output Continues to Fall in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's manufacturing sector
declined in April for the third month in a row as companies
suffered the biggest drop in new orders since 1992, a business
survey has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply and published Wednesday, suggests that companies have
been caught out by the slowdown in European markets and are still
struggling to reduce excess stocks.
</P>
<P>
The institute's purchasing managers index, a composite index
which tracks output, orders, employment, stocks and prices from
purchasing managers at 310 companies across the UK, fell from 49.4
percent to 48.3 percent last month, the lowest figure recorded
since September 1992.
</P>
<P>
Any reading below 50 indicates deteriorating conditions and a
contraction in activity.
</P>
<P>
As for the economy as a whole, conditions in manufacturing have
been uneven, with demand for consumer goods remained buoyant,
causing a rise in output in the consumer goods sector, while
orders for investment and intermediate goods suffered sharp
declines.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke could be
tempted to deliver one more cut in bank base rates, particularly
as the survey shows that price pressures in manufacturing are
weaker now than at any time since the survey was launched in
mid-1991.
</P>
<P>
They say that faced with a manufacturing sector stuck in the
doldrums, few signs of a pick-up in key export markets and the
prospect of further subtrend growth to come, the Chancellor has
plenty of ammunition with which to push for a further rate cut to
engineer faster growth.

This project, channeled via the European Community Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), will help improve sanitation for around 55,000
people by providing toilets.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Developed Nations To Aid Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midrand (South Africa), May 2 (Xinhua) -- China today urged
the international community, developed countries in particular,
to adopt practical measures to support the enterprises in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made by Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, at the ministerial
round-table meeting on ''enterprise development'' at Gallagher
Estate in Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial round-table meeting was organized by the ninth
session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD IX), which started in Midrand on April 27 until May 11.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Long said the current trend of globalization and
liberalization of world economy brought about the opportunities
to the development of enterprises in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, taking into consideration of the backward technology,
lack of capital and human resources, the enterprises in
developing countries, most of them are small or medium-sized
business, were forced into competitive world market from a
position of disadvantage in comparison with those in developed
countries, said Long.
</P>
<P>
He believed expanding the direct investment in developing
countries by the developed would be an effective way to help them
upgrade the competitiveness of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that special attention should be paid to
specific industrial policies and needs of developing countries in
utilizing the foreign investments, and joint-ventures with a
combination of investment and technology transfer should also be
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Long emphasized that privatization was not a panacea to
enterprise development, adding the competitiveness of the
enterprises was not decided by the fact that they were
state-owned or private.
</P>
<P>
Long hoped UNCTAD should discuss issues related to
international investment policies, paying special attention to
the development dimension. Therefore, UNCTAD should also keep in
mind that its work would be of particular benefit to the least
developed countries and those not participating in negotiations
in this field.

TIANJIN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A bridge built with a donation of
200,000 yuan by two farmers has opened to traffic on the border
between Jixian County near this north China port city and Sanhe
City in Hebei Province.

transportation company and Cui is a successful merchant.
</P>

Their hometown is only separated by a river from Sanhe
City. Though the two sides of the river share thriving economic
ties, crossing the river had not been easy. A small ferry boat was
the only means of doing so.

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide crackdown on crime

emphasizes economic relations among member states.
</P>
<P>
Pardo, who is on a visit here, extended an invitation to
Mugabe to a two-day methodological meeting in Colombia to be held
later this month. Pardo said his country, as current NAM
chairman, sought Mugabe's views in recognition of his leadership
skills.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Mugabe, Pardo said NAM would have to focus on
economic matters now that the cold war was over.
</P>
<P>
''We also discussed South-South cooperation and how we can
improve the living conditions of our people,'' the Colombian
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said discussions had also touched on the World Trade
organization (WTO) and the feeling was that developing countries
were not benefiting as much as their western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
''The new WTO should be a forum to improve free trade. We are
concerned that many of our countries opened their economies and
import from every country and yet they face difficulties in
exporting to developed countries,'' he said.

The minister, who has also visited South Africa, will go

release six of the remaining 11 Serb POWs detained in Sarajevo's
central prison.
</P>
<P>
But there is still no word on the Muslims' reaction.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord, all POWs held by the three
Bosnian factions, including the Croats, should be freed.
</P>
<P>
But both the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs held
back some POWs for alleged war crimes. After Monday's release, the
Serbs are still detaining 15 Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Strong Growth in EU Trade in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Internal and external trade between
European Union (EU) members and the rest of the world grew rapidly
in the first three quarters in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew faster than imports, giving the EU a trade surplus
of 12.4 billion ECUs (16 billion U.S. dollars), double the surplus
of 6.2 billion ECUs (8 billion dollars) in 1994 and a deficit in
1993, figures from EUROSTAT, the EC statistical office, show.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the improvement was the adoption in 1994
of a series of preferential and protective measures to boost
exports to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of EU exports in the first nine months of 1995
stood at 416 billion ECUs (about 541 billion dollars), nearly 10
percent higher than the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The volume of EU imports was 403.6 billion ECUs (about 525
billion dollars), a 6.3 percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Ten EU member states recorded favorable balance of trade during
the three quarters, especially Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg, while five nations suffered trade
deficits -- the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Portugal and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Finland's trade volume climbed 28 percent over the same period
last year, the highest in all EU member states, compared with a
6.9 percent growth rate in Britain, which was the lowest.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Interest Rate Cut Buoys H Shares in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- One more Chinese state-owned
enterprise went listed today at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after
 H-shares soared on the back of China's decision to go head with a
 May Day cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Panda Electronics Company Limited, one of China's
largest electronics manufacturers saw the first transaction of its
 shares started at 2.15 HK dollars (27.6 US cents) this morning at
 the Hong Kong bourse. It has brought to 19 the total number of H
shares.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Panda, a backbone enterprise in China's electronic
industry, picked up the very day to go public to mark the 60th
anniversary of its founding. Having built itself as the second
largest producer of color television sets in China, the Panda
company is joining hands with foreign partners like Ericsson of
Sweden, Motorola of America and Sharp of Japan to develop
up-to-date products including mobile telephones, personal
computers, and audio and visual products.
</P>
<P>
Sources from securities circles said that it is lucky for
Nanjing Panda to get listed just one day after China lowered
interest rates, signifying the 33-month tightening economic
situation would pass away.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, which measures the 18
Hong Kong-listed H shares, surged 5.6 percent Wednesday to end at
872, up 47 points following Tuesday's gain of 28 points. The
renewal of buying came after a three-week downhill trend when many
 H share companies announced annual results worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiangxing, chairman of Nanjing Panda said the May Day cut
in interest rates would reduce the costs of loans borrowed by his
company and stimulate the sales of consumer goods, like television
 sets made by Panda.
</P>
<P>
Chen's optimistic view was shared by Alex P.M. Ko, director of
Peregrine Capital Limited, the sponsor and lead manager of the
Panda issue. Ko, who is in charge of Peregrine's business in
China, said: "The reduction in interest rate, big or small, has
shown a sign that China's macroeconomics control policy has
started to ease. State-owned enterprises are expected to run in
easier circumstances, bringing good news for H shares."
</P>
<P>
According to Ko, Nanjing Panda was the fourth H share sponsored
 by Peregrine, which had also led in issuing shares for Shanghai
petrochemicals, Guangzhou Shipyard and Jingwei Textile Machinery
Company.
</P>
<P>
Investors had given a warm response to the early subscription
of Nanjing Panda, reflecting their confidence in the 60-year-old
state enterprise.
</P>
<P>
All Panda H shares offered for international placing has been
fully subscribed by institutional investors, and public offer in
Hong Kong, at 2.13 HK dollars (29.5 US cents) per share, has been
oversubscribed, according to sources from Peregrine Capital
Limited.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides Aid to Repatriate Malian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
granted 1 million ECUs (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars) of
humanitarian aid to help Malian refugees returning to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Between 100,000 and 200,000 Malian refugees who spent years in
neighboring Algeria and Mauritania in the wake of rebellions
during the 1980s are returning home to the northern part of the
land-locked West African nation.
</P>
<P>
The presence in neighboring countries of large numbers of
refugees from the conflict in northern Mali dominated Mali's
regional relations during the first years of the administration of
Alpha Oumar Konare, who came into power in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the total number of Malian refugees varied, but in
late 1994 they were reported to be as many as 45,000 in Algeria
and up to 118,000 in Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
The Malian government has reached agreements with the
neighboring nations on the repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The EC's humanitarian aid is being channeled via the European
Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). ECHO's partners in the
program include the Belgian Red Cross and non-governmental
organizations from France and Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Military Prosecution has
ordered renewing the detention of a 48-year-old spy working for
Israel for another 45 days in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
The spy, Abdul Malek Abdul Moneim Ali Sadek, a retired
volunteer sergeant, was arrested late last March after he had been
pursued for having traveled to Israel several times via the Taba
crossing point, the Egyptian newspaper Al-Akhbar said today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian security services pursued the retired sergeant for two
years during which he traveled to Israel eight times.
</P>
<P>
Sadek, who had resigned his job in the armed forces, was
interviewed by an Israeli intelligence officer who realized that
he was seeking a more lucrative job, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar pointed out that Sadek was recruited and had training
in Israel for methods of using ciphers and obtaining information.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have revealed that the spy gave the Israel
Mossad (intelligence service) officer some information about his
former place of work in the Egyptian Naval Force, as well as some
information about a military base in the city of Mansoura, 140
kilometers north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have also emphasized that the spy had been under
security observation until he was arrested, and that he has
admitted in detail all that he did throughout the period during
which he was recruited by the Israeli intelligence service.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister On Sino-S. Africa Ties (by liu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen
cooperation with South Africa which will not only benefit both,
but the world peace as each is a regional power, Wu Yi, Minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that on Tuesday, South African President Nelson
Mandela met her and they had cordial talks for one hour and
twenty minutes, during which Mandela said the South African
government is eager to establish diplomatic ties with the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in an address during a luncheon at the
Great Wall Restaurant here before 120 local businessmen. The
luncheon was sponsored by the Rand Bank and the South African
Chamber of Industry and Commerce and two Chinese organizations.
</P>
<P>
She said a number of agreements on investment, trade and the
avoidance of double-taxation would be signed after establishing
relations, providing a stable and fine environment for
businessmen. She expressed the hope that both sides would make
efforts to raise the level of cooperation to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Recent years saw fast growth of trade and economic links
between the two countries, said Wu, who led a Chinese delegation
to attend a two-week ninth session of the UN Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD IX) which will end on May 11.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral direct trade was 14.65 million US Dollars in 1991
while in 1995 it shot up to 1,334 million dollars, said the
Chinese minister.
</P>
<P>
Each side has invested in the other country and dozens of
Chinese enterprises are now doing business in South Africa, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
She noted this shows that bilateral trade has been
complementary even without establishment of diplomatic ties, and
that the setting up of official links in the future would bring
new vitality and more Chinese companies will come to invest in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
She said she would sign a letter of exchange this afternoon
with South African Minister of Commerce and Industry Alec Erwin
which will give the most-favored-nation treatment in terms of
trade to both sides.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question, Ms Wu promised China would mobilize
more businessmen to invest in South Africa, once diplomatic
relations are set up, in the fields of light industry, textiles
and house electrical appliances and others, and said that will
create more jobs for the unemployed blacks and that the products
can be exported to South Africa's neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China and the United Nations
Children's Fund will try to increase rehabilitation programs for
children with disabilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent meeting on projects for the 1996-2000
period, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs and UNICEF will each
choose one city or county from 13 Chinese provinces and autonomous
regions for sample rehabilitation projects for children with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF will invest 1.56 million US dollars in the projects,
making it the biggest investment the UN organization has put into
such projects, and the largest assistance program in Chinese
society by the organization.
</P>
<P>
The program started in 1982 to make use of UNICEF's technical
support and China's community services to create equal
opportunities for handicapped children. Since then, UNICEF has
provided 3.5 million dollars in assistance through the program. It
has spread to 23 provinces, autonomous regions and cities, and 13
cities and counties have been selected as the sample sites.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has put 80 million yuan (about 9.6
million dollars) into the program at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Files on disabled children are to be set up and surveys
conducted among groups of 200,000 people to come up with a better
rehabilitation plan for those with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, three training centers will be opened
in China to provide training for disabled children and their
parents.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, 60 percent of the disabled children in the
sample cities and counties will receive rehabilitation service,
with an effective rate of 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has some 60 million handicapped persons.

<P>
FREETOWN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Sniper firing continues in the
Liberian capital Monrovia on Thursday as rival factions are
battling for control of strategic buildings, according to Monrovia
Radio which has been making intermittent broadcasts since the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomats monitoring the situation from nearby Freetown
said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs,
George Moose, left Monrovia "in disgust" with the "stubborn
attitude of the factional leaders who had ignored his invitation
for a meeting."
</P>
<P>
Moose has now returned to Washington, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said Moose left behind a row over the
shooting death of three Liberians by U.S. marines guarding the
American embassy in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Other reports from Monrovia on Thursday said a United Nations
location at Triver View, east of Monrovia, came under "cross
fire" on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether any of the 41 UN staffers and seven
ngo members at the UN compound were hurt.
</P>
<P>
Factional leader Charles Taylor speaking on his Patriotic
Front radio said on Thursday "peace can only return to Liberia
when Roosevelt Johnson give himself up to ECOMOG."
</P>
<P>
A bid to arrest Johnson, a Khran, on murder charges sparked
off the round of fighting in the war torn country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, West African diplomats said there are "intensive"
behind the scene moves by the Chairman of the ECOWAS to get all
the factional leaders to a meeting on May 7 in Accra.
</P>
<P>
"We are sending a plane to pick them up for the meeting and we
hope they will agree to come," one Ghanaian diplomat told

information for the disabled, especially know-how on the
prevention of disabilities.

China's first official working conference on disabled persons
was held in the capital between April 22 and 24 to sum up the
experiences of the past five years, and draw up a new plan for the
forthcoming five years.

<P>
There are 60 million disabled people in the country, whose
population is 1.2 billion.

The third Sunday in May has been designated National
Help-The-Disabled Day since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Rice Exports to Decline This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's prospects for rice exports and price stability will
not be as favorable as last year, Ophaswongse, deputy managing
director of Huay Chuan Co., said.
</P>
<P>
He gave two reasons for the declines -- declining demand from
major importing countries and competition from other major rice
exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Indonesia, which were the biggest importers of
Thai rice last year, are expected to import less because of higher
domestic outputs.
</P>
<P>
The declining demand is partly due to competition from other
rival rice exporting countries. The prices of rice exports from
Vietnam and India are considerably lower -- about 30 US dollars
and 100 dollars cheaper per ton respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the damage from last year's flood, Thai rice
output this year did not fall significantly, thanks to the
Agriculture Ministry's support for the second crop planting.
</P>
<P>
The second crop of rice is expected to yield a historic high of
3.5 million tons this year, up 75 percent from last year's two
million tons, after the main crop was damaged in nationwide
floods.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Zimbabwean Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
conferred here today with visiting Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge
of Zimbabwe, noting that he is pleased to have the chance to meet
with Mudenge before starting his state visit to Zimbabwe and five
other African countries.
</P>
<P>
The visit will consolidate Sino-African friendships and
cooperation to build long-term, stable ties in the changing
international situation at the end of the century, he said, and
open up more prospects for Sino-African relations in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He told Mudenge that China and the African nations share the
same history of suffering from imperialism and colonialism, and
now face the same task of developing, but that the two sides have
always sympathized with and supported each other.
</P>
<P>
After conveying the greetings of Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, Mudenge said that Jiang's Africa trip is significant and
encouraging to Africa, in contrast to the way in which the
international community and some big countries have neglected
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China and Zimbabwe have formed a solid friendship
when Zimbabwe was fighting for independence, laying a firm
foundation for the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his pleasure over the cooperation between the
two countries in politics, economy, diplomacy, the military,
culture, and in education, and said that the Chinese government is
grateful for Zimbabwe's support in human rights and other
international issues, and expressed his appreciation for
Zimbabwe's "one China" stance on the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Developing friendly ties of cooperation with African nations
has been China's consistent policy, Jiang noted, saying that his
country is willing to raise that cooperation to an even higher
level.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reports Marked Increase in Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's capital Beijing imported 551
million US dollars worth of goods in the first quarter of the
year, a rise of almost 28 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials in Beijing reported that the increase in
local imports mainly resulted from higher import volumes by local
collective enterprises who have no direct right to export and
import, and those which have rights in two regards.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the former imported 170 million US dollars
worth of goods, more than a four-fold increase; and the latter
reported a 3.6 million-US dollar import volume, almost three times
the figure for last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Imports of foreign-funded enterprises remained level with last
year's figure and state-owned enterprises made a 16.2 percent
increase with total volume amounting to 125 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rapid increase in imports of raw materials sped up total
imports in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, imports of raw cotton stood at seven
million US dollars-worth, representing an increase of 72 percent;
imports of veneer boards 20,000 cubic meters, worth 4.26 million
US dollars, going up 36-fold and 31-fold respectively; imports of
fertilizer 4.38 million US dollars, 15 times the figure for last
year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Japan still took the top position among all of Beijing's import
markets, with its exports growing by 0.9 percent. Imports from
Taiwan and Germany started to drop.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports from the United States and Russia went up by
65.3 per cent, and Italian imports saw a 4.6-fold rise.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the increase in imports to Beijing, exports in the
first three months from the capital fell by 32.6 percent, standing
at 360 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local customs officials said that Beijing's imports are
expected to rise continuously with cuts in tariffs, but exports
will hopefully pick up with the improvement of state policies on
foreign trade.

FREETOWN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The editor of Sierra Leone's
biweekly Concord Times newspaper was severely reprimanded by
parliament on Wednesday for a confidential report.
</P>
<P>
The legislature said he had leaked the information of a sub
committee assessing the appointment of Dr Kemoh Salia-bao as
minister of internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, all nominations from President
Tejan Kabbah should be approved by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House Francis Kutubu said: "Although freedom of
the press is enshrined in the constitution, this is in no way a
freedom for the press to publish classified documents."
</P>
<P>
"A repetition will not be viewed so leniently," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Parliament has so far withheld confirmation of Dr Salia-bao
because of the suspicion of his claim that he obtained two
doctorate degrees in a period of six months.

<HEADLINE> New Family Plan Advances Family Planning in Zhejiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Five years ago Chen Xianglong was
lonely and pennyless when he returned to his hometown of Madao
Village in the suburbs of Rui'an, Zhejiang Province, after serving
a four-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 33, said, "Then I lost all hope in my life."
</P>
<P>
But now he has a job, a wife and a lovely child. He has just
been granted a plot to build a new house on.
</P>
<P>
The change in his life has been brought about by the "New
Family Plan" implemented two years ago throughout Zhejiang, one of
the most developed areas in China. Under the plan Chen was
assigned as a brick layer in the village-run construction team.
</P>
<P>
The "New Family Plan," a new move launched by the Zhejiang
provincial government in family planning, requires efforts to
combine family planning with work to expand the rural economy,
help farmers achieve prosperity and build civil and happy families.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Provincial Family Planning Commission said
that the plan caters for farmers' needs to achieve prosperity, and
bring up intelligent and healthy children.
</P>
<P>
The plan has already involved half of rural families in
Zhejiang and by next year will have involved all rural families,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to help farmers become prosperous, it is necessary
to help them learn skills, techniques and general knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"With a better education, farmers will naturally come to
understand why fewer children means achieving prosperity sooner,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
This, in return, will encourage farmers to pursue family
planning conscientiously and make their lives happier, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Practice shows that the plan has been working
well. More and more farmers are keen on study and production and
are seeking a civil and sound life."
</P>
<P>
He cited Madao Village as a good example in implementing the
plan.
</P>
<P>
According to a government plan, women of child-bearing age in
the village could bear 27 children in 1995, but they actually had
19 children, with eight women volunteering not to have a second
child.

<TEXT>
<P>
Madao is considered a prosperous village in Zhejiang, with a
per-capita income of 3,100 yuan. The Villagers' Committee has
formulated six criteria for new and civil families: achieving
prosperity through labor, abiding by laws, acquiring a good
general knowledge, implementing family planning, and taking good
prenatal care and pursuing sound practice in bringing up children.
</P>
<P>
According to the Villagers' Committee, 347 families have met
the criteria, but 21 families have not.
</P>
<P>
The committee decided in early 1995 to buy long-term policies
for the property of the families meeting the criteria and
voluntarily pursuing family planning, as well as policies for
accidental injuries to able-bodied family members.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also decided to buy policies for old-age
pensions for farmers who have only one daughter and volunteered
not to have the second child.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up a home for the aged, where 40 people over
the age of 55 live.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaomei, head of the committee, said, "To some extent
these measures have helped eliminate the traditional concept of
rearing children against one's old age, more sons leading to a
greater fortune and having sons to carry on the family line."
</P>
<P>
Wang Hongfu, 35, said that he supports the "New Family Plan"
because he knows well the difficulty of having too many children.
</P>
<P>
"My parents had to support me and my five brothers and sisters
by tilling three mu of farmland (15 mu is equivalent to one
hectare). My family used to lead a vary hard life," he said.
</P>
<P>
He now earns 20,000 yuan a year by managing a lime kiln for the
village. "Now I have got a child. I concentrate my energy on the
kiln operation and education of my son. I hope my son will study
in a university in the future."
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Xiaomei, some families failed to meet the
criteria for new and civil families because they were
illiterate. So, the village has opened a night school to help
members of these families eliminate illiteracy.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Poverty stricken farmer Ren
Bingsheng has moved out of the cave that was his family's home for
years.
</P>
<P>
While skyscrapers changed the skylines of city's like Shanghai,
Ren's home in the final years of the 20th century was a simple
cave in the barren mountainous area of southern Ningxia in western
China.
</P>
<P>
In a dream scheme advocated by Deng Xiaoping, Ren's days of
poverty are numbered.
</P>
<P>
He has built his own real home and he has rights on a hectare
of farmland to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
It has all been made possible for Ren and his cave dwelling
neighbors thanks to a 'rich man, poor man' initiative that has
spanned China's east-west divide.
</P>
<P>
Huaxi Village, not far from boom city Shanghai was a symbol of
the new rich in China.
</P>
<P>
The village in Jiangsu Province, branded as a national model,
generated more than 200 million yuan (12 million US dollars) in
taxes and profits last year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a third of the villagers drive their own cars - one of
the highest car ownership ratios in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
But the well off people of Huaxi wanted to share their good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
The village volunteered to provide ten million yuan as well as
up to date technology to help put China's poorest people on the
road to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
And they did it by helping people they had never met to build a
new village, modelled on their own thriving community.
</P>
<P>
China's richest village decide to help one of the poorest -
with remarkable results.
</P>
<P>
The new village - also called Huaxi - in the multi-ethnic
Ningxia Hui Automonous Region is now taking shape in the country's
poorest region, 30-km from Ningxia's capital city of Yinchuan.
</P>
<P>
It will become the new home of 6,000 resettlers from Xihaigu, a
barren and desolate mountainous areas in the southern part of
Ningxia, and officially rated as one of the eight poorest areas in
China.
</P>
<P>
Most families lived well under the poverty line in their home
area, in a prefecture that received an annual rainfall level of
200 mm, with evaporation running to 300 mm.
</P>
<P>
Ren says with pride that he has built his new two-room home
with his own meager savings and help from people in a village
hundreds of kilometers away. He has vowed to cast off the
remaining remnants of poverty within two years.
</P>
<P>
The new resettlement village for Ren and other arrivals is
located on a vast plain with adequate irrigation, and it has
brought new hope for the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
Within five years the new village will be turned into an
industrial center, a grain base and a tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
Its gross output value of agriculture and industry will exceed
100 million yuan and the annual income of resettlers will rise to
1,500 yuan, at least five times their previous yearly earnings,
said Yuan Jinlin, deputy director of the regional agricultural
committee.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists described the move as "a great innovation"
in combining the efforts of the prosperous eastern coast and
under-developed western parts in the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
High earning Huaxi in Jiangsu enjoyed a per capita agricultural
and industrial output value averaging 1.3 million yuan last year,
the nation's highest.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy of "achieving common prosperity" advocated by
Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's economic reform, Huaxi
volunteered to provide 10 million yuan and up-to-date technology
to help people in poverty-stricken area to embark on the road to
prosperity.

The one-time barren and desolate area is now bustling with
activity. The first batch of 270 farm households have paved a main
highway leading to Yinchuan, leveled a large tract of farmland,
and built several irrigation canals and pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 educated young people have been sent to Huaxi for
training courses on modern agro-science. Another 1,000 resettlers
are expected to attend similar courses in Jiangsu in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
"Assisting the western part to eliminate poverty will offer a
good chance for coastal areas to expand their own markets and
achieve sustained economic growth," said Qu Jianming, permanent
representative of Huaxi Village in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
As China's leading textile producer, Jiangsu used to import
large amounts of raw wool from abroad. Meanwhile, livestock
raisers in northwest China lack funds and technology to tap local
resources.
</P>
<P>
Dongyuan Village, which sits on a vast grassland, has built a
wool mill with free economic aid from Huaxi. The mill will provide
Huaxi in Jiangsu with 3,000 tons of high-quality wool when it
starts operation.
</P>
<P>
A number of well-off townships and cities in east China's
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have opened their eyes to the
energy and resource-rich, but under-developed western part. They
assisted their poorer countryfolk to boost economic growth by
providing funds, technical personnel, expertise, and through
transfer of technology, for the sake of attaining the grand goal
Common Prosperity.

today met with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and

Turkish-Israeli military accord.
</P>
<P>
Moussa conveyed a message from Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to Demirel on the present regional situation, the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process and the Egyptian-
Turkish bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Turco-Israeli military accord was signed in February, but
became public two months later in April. Since then, it has
spurred angry reaction from the moslem states, including Egypt,
for upsetting the balances in the region.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the controversial accord were explained to
Egypt during a visit of Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary
Onur Oymen who visited Cairo last week.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's neighbors fear that Israeli planes will use the
Turkish airspace to gather intelligence on Iran and Syria. But
the Turkish Foreign Ministry insists that the Israeli jets will
only use Turkish airspace, without carrying electronic monitoring
equipment and arms.
</P>
<P>
"No country at all has the right to, or will be allowed to
ask any question to Turkey on the military training agreement
Turkey has made with Israel," Turkish Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay said last month, after his meeting with Israeli

<HEADLINE> World Bank Anti-Poverty Project In Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A training session for Chinese and
World Bank personnel that ended here today marked the official
beginning of a World Bank-financed anti-poverty project in north
China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The project has 10 sub-projects for land improvement,
irrigation, road development in the countryside, transportation,
cash crops, animal husbandry, and water conservation, according to
bank executives, who said they will benefit three million rural
people in Shanxi's Yuncheng and Luliang areas.
</P>
<P>
The session started on April 29 and was attended by over 100
people from World Bank and local officials and experts.
</P>
<P>
The bank's executive board of directors has approved 100
million US dollars for the project, from funds provided by the
International Development Association, a lending arm of the
international financial body, according to Juergen Voegele, an
executive with the bank's China/Mongolia Department.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.8 million people in the northern Chinese province
still live below the poverty line, according to vice-governor Wang
Wenxue, who said that "the anti-poverty project is of tremendously
great significance to Shanxi's economic development and social
progress."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia sends 126 Vietnamese Boat People Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today sent home
another group of 126 Vietnamese boat people by ships.
</P>
<P>
The latest group of 73 males, 40 females and 13 children left
Malaysia for the southern port of Vung Tau near Ho Chi Minh City
on board of the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) vessel "KD Sri
Inderapura", which left the RMN base in Tanjung Gelang later this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the first country to repatriate Vietnamese boat
people by sea. Two weeks ago, Malaysia successfully repatriated
317 Vietnamese boat people by a RMN ship.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian National Task Force on Vietnamese Illegal Immigrants
Director Yaacob Daud told a news conference that everything went
as planned without any untoward incident in today's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, more than 10 Vietnamese boat people in the
Kerayong camp were hospitalized when they injured themselves
protesting against their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
According to the authorities here, there are still 1,896
Vietnamese boat people in Malaysia, and among them 1,250 have
agreed to fly home under the voluntary repatriation program.
</P>
<P>
They said the third repatriation by ship would be at the end of
May. Malaysia and Vietnam reached an agreement earlier this year
to use ships to speed up the repatriation, which is scheduled to
be completed by June 30, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Over Million Dollars Invested In Zimbabwe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government spent more
than 100 million U.S. Dollars last year to feed over five million
people under the grain loan scheme and drought relief programme.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira said on Wednesday that the government invested the
money to alleviate the plight of some 5 million Zimbabweans failing to
produce enough crops due to crippling droughts.
</P>
<P>
Rural farmers are expected to pay back for the rescue
assistance during times of plenty, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,986,881 people, more than half of Zimbabwe's 10.5
million population, are currently benefiting from the programme,
which started in May last year, to discourage people from
depending on food handouts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe expects a bumper harvest this year of more than 2.4
million tonnes of maize and this will drastically reduce government
spending on drought relief programmes.

<HEADLINE> China Not A Threat To Regional Security: Downer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China is not a source of great
threat to the regional security in East Asia, Australian Minister
for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not persuaded by those who say that China is a source of
great threat to regional security," he told a national security
forum in Canberra today.
</P>
<P>
He said that instead of containing China, engaging China was a
fundamental principle of the Australian Government's policy in
developing relations with China.
</P>
<P>
If Australia engaged China affectively, politically,
economically and in terms of security dialogue, it would help
China to understand the perspective of other countries in the
region. Therefore, China would formulate its security policies
taking into account of appropriate sensitivity of the rest of the
region and encourage a view in the region that China is not and
won't be a great threat to the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not averse to developing appropriate dialogue with
China. We are enthusiastic about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that dialogue with China via multi-lateral and
bilateral levels is something to be pursued."
</P>
<P>
"It is not just for us, but for the other countries in the
region as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the New Security Agenda in the Asia-Pacific Region
forum in the Parliament House this morning, Downer said that
Australia would contribute to the security of the Asia Pacific
region principally through cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Interest Rate Cut Buoys H Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- One more Chinese state-owned
enterprise went listed today at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after
H-shares soared on the back of China's decision to go head with a
May Day cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Panda Electronics Company Limited, one of China's
largest electronics manufacturers saw the first transaction of its
shares started at 2.15 HK dollars (27.6 US cents) this morning at
the Hong Kong bourse. It has brought to 19 the total number of H
shares.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Panda, a backbone enterprise in China's electronic
industry, picked up the very day to go public to mark the 60th
anniversary of its founding. Having built itself as the second
largest producer of color television sets in China, the Panda
company is joining hands with foreign partners like Ericsson of
Sweden, Motorola of America and Sharp of Japan to develop
up-to-date products including mobile telephones, personal
computers, and audio and visual products.
</P>
<P>
Sources from securities circles said that it is lucky for
Nanjing Panda to get listed just one day after China lowered
interest rates, signifying the 33-month tightening economic
situation would pass away.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, which measures the 18
Hong Kong-listed H shares, surged 5.6 percent Wednesday to end at
872, up 47 points following Tuesday's gain of 28 points. The
renewal of buying came after a three-week downhill trend when many
H share companies announced annual results worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiangxing, chairman of Nanjing Panda said the May Day cut
in interest rates would reduce the costs of loans borrowed by his
company and stimulate the sales of consumer goods, like television
sets made by Panda.
</P>
<P>
Chen's optimistic view was shared by Alex P.M. Ko, director of
Peregrine Capital Limited, the sponsor and lead manager of the
Panda issue. Ko, who is in charge of Peregrine's business in
China, said: "The reduction in interest rate, big or small, has
shown a sign that China's macroeconomics control policy has
started to ease. State-owned enterprises are expected to run in
easier circumstances, bringing good news for H shares."
</P>
<P>
According to Ko, Nanjing Panda was the fourth H share sponsored
by Peregrine, which had also led in issuing shares for Shanghai
petrochemicals, Guangzhou Shipyard and Jingwei Textile Machinery
Company.
</P>
<P>
Investors had given a warm response to the early subscription
of Nanjing Panda, reflecting their confidence in the 60-year-old
state enterprise.
</P>
<P>
All Panda H shares offered for international placing had been
fully subscribed by institutional investors, and public offer in
Hong Kong, at 2.13 HK dollars (29.5 US cents) per share, had been
oversubscribed, according to sources from Peregrine Capital
Limited.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Be Sugar Self-Sufficient Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's sugar output is expected to
reach 400,000 tonnes in 1997, enough to meet domestic demand,
according to an estimate made at a recent meeting by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also gave an overview of the deployment over the
year of the national programme for the sugar industry, which has
set the target of one million tonnes of sugar by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The country now has 13 sugar producing mills and is investing
to build 27 others.
</P>
<P>
The combined capacity of these 40 factories will reach 64,400
tonnes of sugarcane per day, a six-fold increase over that when
the programme was started.
</P>
<P>
The target of one million tonnes will be attained by 1998 ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
To keep pace with the expansion of the sugar industry, the
acreage of sugarcane over the past year has increased by 25 per
cent to 217,000 ha, raising the annual sugarcane output to between
9 to 9.5 million tonnes from 6 to 7 million tonnes.

</P>
<P>
The other shuttlers selected for the Thomas Cup, the world

Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Yu Lizhi, ranked the 15th in the world and China's number
three, was conspicuously absent from the roster.
</P>
<P>
"We did not select the players simply according to his or her
world rankings," said coach Li. "We also have to take into account
their recent forms and the styles of our opponents."
</P>
<P>
In the preliminary round, Chinese men will clash with
arch-rival Indonesia, England and Sweden in group A in Thomas Cup.
</P>
<P>
The country's women shuttlers will also meet Indonesia, along

<HEADLINE> Australian Current Account Deficit Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia's current account deficit
dropped 3 percent to 1.596 billion Australian dollars (1.261
billion US dollars) seasonally adjusted in March.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
this was the lowest monthly result in two years.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit dropped from 1.711 billion
Australian dollars (1.352 billion US dollars) in February and
1.651 billion Australian dollars (1.304 billion US dollars) in
January.
</P>
<P>
It was 12 percent lower than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that a weaker economy had cut import
demand and farm exports had recovered from the impact of years of
drought.
</P>
<P>
A strengthening Australian dollar also made imports cheaper and
improved net income deficit. Therefore, today's figures did not
herald a sharp downturn in the trend of current account deficit,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed that Australia's merchandise trade
balance registered a surplus of 29 million Australian dollars
(22.9 million US dollars) in March, the first trade surplus since
February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said that the current
account deficit was slightly higher than the expected 1.4 billion
Australian dollars (1.11 billion US dollars) in the month.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current account deficit was one of the most
serious problems bequeathed to the new government. The coalition
government would strive to improve the country's national savings
by addressing the previous Labor government's 8-billion-Australian
dollar (6.32-billion-US dollar) budget deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian opposition leader Kim Beazley said that the
narrowing current account deficit made it unnecessary for the new
government to slash public service jobs.
</P>
<P>
"With the current account deficit well and truly under control,
now is the time to be consolidating the gains, not slashing
thousands of jobs or hacking services for Australian families," he
said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Allows Relatives to Visit Prisoners on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Around 2,700 people were allowed
to visit their relatives currently detained in jail and
deportation centers in Kuwait during the three-day traditional
holiday Eid el-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice).
</P>
<P>
The first day of the holiday allocated for visitors to the male
prisons drew about 1,200 visitors, while on the second day
allocated for visiting the female jails, 1,500 visitors were
allowed in, the local English newspaper Arabic Times today quoted
Kuwaiti Director General of Penal Institutions and Verdict
Enforcement Department Abdulmajeed Khuraibet as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khuraibet said the prison administration had managed to
organize the visits of the prisoners' relatives and friends in the
hope that the incarcerated convicts would forbear all the habits
or crimes that had landed them in jail.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry said some
problems emerged during the visiting hours because the family
members of the jailed wished to stay longer than the time allotted
to them.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti authorities usually allow relatives and friends of the
jailed to visit them on holidays.
</P>
<P>
Before the Eid el-Adha holiday, Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah had pardoned and released 269 prisoners and
reduced terms of imprisonment for 600 others in a special
amnesty.

<HEADLINE> Self-Sufficiency for Grain Importer Within Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Fujian, a big grain importer on
China's east coast, has said it will be self-sufficient in its
grain supply within five years, a local provincial official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In this densely-populated area, the per-capita amount of
farmland is only less than half the national average, and it had
to import some 500,000 tons of grain from other parts of China
annually for years.
</P>
<P>
The province is trying to increase grain output by 120,000 tons
annually over the next five years, according to Governor Chen
Mingyi, to hit a target of 9.8 million tons by the year 2000,
basically meeting its own needs.
</P>
<P>
The governor is confident of reaching that goal because his
province has long periods of sunshine, mild climate, and
relatively high per unit output.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged local farmers to improve the low and
medium-yield fields, use improved crop strains, and manage things
better. Efforts will be made to expand the area used for grain
crops and the use of modern scientific techniques.
</P>
<P>
Fujian produced 9.2 million tons of grain last year, setting a
record.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inter-party Summit Opens Next Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's inter-party summit, which
has been postponed twice, will finally open next Monday to
discuss important national issues, the "Zambia Daily Mail"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Sata, National Secretary of the ruling Movement for
Multi- party Democracy (MMD), was quoted as saying that the only
free day for all parties was next Monday and President Frederick
Chiluba would chair the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders have re-affirmed their parties' willingness
to attend the summit and urged MMD to facilitate preparations to
reduce political tension at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the United National Independence Party (UNIP) is
still opposed to the MMD idea to have the summit chaired by
President Chiluba because MMD is an interested party. It stands
for a non-partisan figure to chair the summit.
</P>
<P>
The proposed inter-party summit, to be attended by heads of all
major political parties in Zambia, will discuss important issues
concerning the adoption of the draft constitution and the
presidential and general elections scheduled for later this year.

<HEADLINE> Supermarkets Thrive in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has built 60
supermarkets since the first one opened in 1984, and another sixty
are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The number of supermarkets in Beijing will have topped 100 by
the end of next year, with each residential area having at least
one supermarket.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming a supermarket in 1994, the Mingzhu Store had
monthly sales worth 400,000 yuan. But now its tills ring out to
the tune of over one million yuan every month.
</P>
<P>
Today's "People's Daily" attributed the prosperity of
supermarkets in Beijing to the spur from rapid development of such
markets in coastal cities, particularly Shanghai, and flexible
policies being pursued by the Beijing Municipal government to
encourage the opening of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets in Beijing are designed for wage earners, and
handle at least 3,000 types of goods, mostly cereals, cooking oils
and non-staple foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
"Supermarkets have been becoming increasingly popular," the
paper said, adding that the opening of another 60 supermarkets has
been included in the city's construction plan.

<P>
During the trial, exhibited in the court were the knife Zhang
used in the killing, material and written evidence, and results of
examinations of all the evidence, and testimonies of witnesses
were heard. Zhang pleaded guilty to all the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The court held that Zhang Jinlong, who had carried out serious
larcenies and had committed intentional homicide by extremely
cruel means to cover the crime, should receive a severe punishment.
</P>

Committee resolution in this respect, the court sentenced Zhang to

deprivation of political rights for robbery, and to 15-year
imprisonment with deprivation of political rights for three years
for theft.

deprivation of political rights.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Oriental Remedies Boom in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 2 (Xinhua)-- The demand for oriental remedies
remains popular in recent years in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh city
despite the availability of 5,000 kinds of western medicine in the
city.
</P>
<P>
This is due to a high level of confidence in traditional cures
among the people, said health-care officials of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the city's health officials are unable to monitor the
trade. They complained that the industry is outside the
jurisdiction of the health service. Due to a lack of equipment,
local officials are unable to study, test and control oriental
medicines.
</P>
<P>
In Ho Chi Minh city, seven hundred stores offer oriental
medications and treatments. Customers from all walks of life,
including porters, gold shop owners and professors, have
confidence in the dehydrated leaves, trunks, herbs and roots, the
identities of which often remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
Local people believed that oriental medicines are able to cure
various kinds of diseases.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Coin Van </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A coin van has recently started
rolling about the streets of this famous scenic capital of east
China's Zhejiang Province, to assist those in need of change.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such instance in China, where reports of
department stores in some cities in south China running short of
change, especially coins, have been growing.
</P>
<P>
The van is the property of the Hangzhou branch of the China
Bank of Agriculture. It provides service for companies and
individuals that deal with a large amount of change daily.
</P>
<P>
The local public transport company has always been worried
about how to deal with half a ton of coins, or some 80,000 in
number, that it collects each day. Even though it set up a special
group of seven to eight persons, it still found it difficult to
count and clear the coins.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, department stores often found it hard to get
change to use for sales, and sometimes even asked customers to
have coins ready for purchases, and even went so far as to use
things such as rolls of tissue paper for change.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the bank began running a car full of coins
around to companies and department stores to help them out, and
now the transport service is relieved of its burden and department
stores have all the change they need.

LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- World number one Stephen Hendry of
Scotland coasted into the World Professional Snooker Championship
semi-finals in Sheffield, Britain on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hendry, who monopolizes the world number one ranking for a
record-tieing seven years, scored a comfortable 13-5 victory over
Darren Morgan of Wales.
</P>
<P>
Hendry displayed some of his best form of the championship when
he kept his momentum going to make it 12-4 from 5-3.
</P>
<P>
Morgan, the world number eight, was so angry at his performance
that he shaved his beard off during an interval.
</P>
<P>
In another dramatic quarter-final, world number three Ronnie
O'Sullivan from England rallied from a 10-6 deficit to win 13-12
over Scot John Higgins.
</P>
<P>
Shaking off the pressure stemmed from a fine for his punching
of an official, O'Sullivan first took four unanswered frames,
three of them breaks, to tie the score 10-10.
</P>
<P>
Higgins responded by snatching frame 21 and frame 22 for a
favorable position with one frame away from his victory.
</P>
<P>
But O'Sullivan waked up again to drag Higgins into the deciding
frame, which he won 69-21.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigel Bond crushed Dave Harold 13-7 while Peter
Ebdon beat Steve Davis 13-10 in two Englishman-only
quarter-finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The 29th annual meeting of the Board
of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) concluded here
today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting focused on the ADB's role in Asia's
economic development and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, governors noted the region's strong
economic development performance.
</P>
<P>
While economic growth remained impressive in East and Southeast
Asia, they said, the countries of South Asia also maintained the
progress achieved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Governors welcomed the reform efforts being pursued by the
economies in transition, and the improving economic situation in
several Pacific island member countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite these favorable developments, however, they noted that
the two-thirds of the world's poor lives in the region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they emphasized that poverty reduction must remain
the principal priority of the bank.
</P>
<P>
They said that the operations financed by the Concessional
Asian Development Fund (ADF) are crucial for addressing many of
the concerns in Asia, especially those relating to poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, donor countries committed to continue their
contribution to the ADF and they also called on the region's newly
industrialized economies to joint the traditional donors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, developing countries indicated that donors should
not use their contributions as a means to dictate terms and
conditionalities that aggravate rather than alleviate the
difficulties of poor countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held this afternoon, ADB President Mitsuo
Sato said he was optimistic that the negotiations on the seventh
ADF will conclude by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The next ADB annual meeting will be held in Fukuoka, Japan, in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on African Situation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen has called on the world to heed the needs of
Africa rather than neglect the 'forgotten' continent.
</P>
<P>
Qian defined the African situation as stepping into a
history-making period of seeking stability and development.
</P>
<P>
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua before Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Africa, Qian said the
general situation in Africa is tending towards stability, and its
economy is showing signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
And he warned that there can be no world peace or continued
development without the support of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The tremendous changes in the post cold-war international
situation have exerted strong impulses on Africa, resulting in the
emergence of various new contradictions, political turbulences in
some countries, and even civil war in a number of countries. Many
countries face economic difficulties, giving rise to the
prevailing pessimistic view of African Marginalization for some
time.
</P>
<P>
However, the African situation in general is tending toward
stability, with its economy showing signs of improvement, after
the continent stood the test of the post-cold war years.
</P>
<P>
"The most difficult period for Africa is now over, and Africa
is stepping on a new historical period characteristic of seeking
stability and development," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Africa is still facing many difficulties,
he added, "I believe the African countries and the African people
can get over the difficulties and realize economic revitalization
and development."
</P>
<P>
Possessing an important status in the world, Africa constitutes
an important force in the international political arena and its
economy is an inseparable part of the world economy. In that term,
"there will be no economic prosperity of the world without the
economic development of Africa; there will be no riches to speak
of while Africa is still suffering from poverty; and world peace
and development cannot be sustained without the participation of
African countries," Qian stated.
</P>
<P>
The international community should give much heed to, rather
negligence, to Africa. It should not interfere in the internal
affairs of African countries, but should offer the necessary aid
and assistance. In a word "Africa needs the world, and the world
needs Africa," Qian stressed.

<HEADLINE> China to Inject New Vigor In Sino-African Relations: FM Says (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Amid the present changing tide of
the world, China will attach greater importance to the development
of friendship and relations of co-operation with African countries
and will continue to inject new vigor into Sino-African ties.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made this
remark during a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua with regard
to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming six-state African
tour.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Sino-African friendship was fostered through
concerted efforts of several generations of state leaders of China
and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades and more, he noted, Chinese
officials have toured many African nations, and more than 100
state leaders from 48 African nations have visited China.
</P>
<P>
"In international affairs, or in the national construction of
their respective countries, China and African states have always
supported and assisted each other," he said, describing their
friendship as with solid foundations, and well acclaimed by people
of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between China and most of the African
countries have witnessed smooth development and reaped
considerable results, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years Sino-African ties have stood the test of the
dramatically changing international situation and maintained a
good momentum.
</P>
<P>
"Amid the world's present changing tide, China will pay more
attention to developing its friendship and ties of co-operation
with African nations, and will continue to inject into it with new
vigor." Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China is willing to upgrade its relations
with Africa based on equal treatment, sincere friendship, close
unity and co-operation and common development.
</P>
<P>
He clarified the basic points in China's policy towards African
countries: to respect the way chosen by respective African nations
in developing their own countries; to stick to the five principles
of peaceful co-existence, and not to interfere in their internal
affairs; to support the point that all countries, big or small,
strong or weak, rich or poor, should be equal and respect each
other; to support the just struggle of the African countries in
safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and fighting against external interference; to support
the acceleration of unity between African states through peaceful
negotiation; to uphold justice in international affairs and
safeguard the legal rights of African nations; to continue
economic aid to African nations with no political conditions
attached; to insist on the principle of equality and
mutual-benefit in developing bilateral trade relations.
</P>
<P>
We hold that any country or nationality has its own strong
points, and China is willing to conduct communications and
co-operation with African nations on a broad range, with a view to
learning from each other; and China respects the characteristics,
traditions and customs of the African countries, and to oppose
racial discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Child Workers Leads to Court Case in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A child laborer seriously injured in
a shopfloor accident was one of five youngsters aged 12 to 15
employed at a Linfen factory in North China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
After an investigation local labor department officials ordered
the factory to stop the illegal practice, and meted fines against
the factory as well as a man who introduced the child laborers.
</P>
<P>
The punishment was referred by the labor bureau to court in
Linfen district. The court confirmed the guilt of the factory and the
agent for using underaged laborers, but decided the bureau's order
had been obeyed.
</P>
<P>
This has been one of the many administrative cases that courts
in Shanxi province handled to safeguard social stability and
maintain economic order.
</P>
<P>
According to law, citizens who disagree with rulings of
government bodies, are able to seek help from court for final
judgement by litigating administrative lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
The courts across the province handled 813 administrative cases
and completed court proceedings in 754 of them in 1995. Citizens
won 42 percent of the administrative cases, it said.
</P>
<P>
With China's first labor law taking effect at the start of last
year, labor disputes are sharply increasing, and courts in the
province have beefed up their efforts to deal with cases to crack
down on illegal employment of child laborers, and protecting both
the legitimate rights of laborers and employees.
</P>
<P>
The courts in Shanxi province handled 470 labor disputes as
civil cases and another 31 administrative cases on labor disputes
last year.

President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to Egypt and five other
African nations.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Egypt is a big nation of Africa and the Middle
East, playing a significant role and exerting important influences
in international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
China and Egypt have maintained a long-term friendship and
Egypt was among the first African and Arabian countries to
establish diplomatic relations with China, and their political and
economic co-operation have been developing steadily since, Qian
noted.
</P>
<P>
"To strengthen Sino-Egyptian friendship and relations of
co-operation not only will be helpful to the realization of peace
and stability in the Middle East, but also be beneficial to
peoples of both nations." He said.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that although faced with various kinds of
difficulties, the peace process in the Middle East has achieved
great development. While the relaxation of regional tension has
become the mainstream, the realization of peace and stability has
turned out to be the historical trend and desire of the people of
the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive and just settlement of the Middle East issue
will be helpful to the peace and stability of the region as well
as of the world, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"China has consistently supported and promoted the peace
process of the Middle East, and is pleased with the developments
achieved through the peace talks." Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that parties concerned will make active
efforts to overcome difficulties in a flexible and practical
manner in order to realize an overall and rational peace in the
Middle East as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on China's Reform of Overseas Aid (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic reform and development in
both China and African countries calls for changes in Sino-African
economic cooperation, but China's basic principle of sincerely
assisting African countries will not change.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this
during a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua on Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming six-state African tour.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has reformed the system of aid to foreign
countries by providing government interest-subsidized preferential
loans rather than providing interest-free loans.
</P>
<P>
Establishing joint ventures between China and recipient
countries is China's another new way of providing aid to foreign
nations.
</P>
<P>
Such reforms transferred governmental cooperation between China
and African countries to the cooperation of businesses of the two
sides, which expanded the sources of aid funds, and increased the
efficiency of the aid. This more effectively spurred the economic
development of African countries, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, China had decided to appropriately increase
its free economic aid to the African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government takes its aid to the African countries
as one of its international obligations, which is aimed at helping
the countries to develop their own economies, and furthering
Sino-African friendship and economic and trade cooperation, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
China always regards aid as mutual assistance rather than a
unilateral favor, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Although the amount of China's aid to the African countries is
limited, Qian said, no political conditions are added to the aid,
which indicates the fraternity of mutual help, equality and
cooperation between developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China adopted eight principles of overseas aid in 1964, and
four principles of mutual cooperation in 1983.

<HEADLINE> China Heading for 10 Million Mobile Phone Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China's expanding mobile phone
market is likely to see ten million subscribers on the national
public cellular network by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The "People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily" reports that
the country had 1.5 million subscribers by the end of 1994 as
against 50,000 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicts that the annual sales of mobile
telecommunications products nationwide are expected to top 20
billion yuan (about 2.5 billion US dollars) in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This will include annual sales of up to 2.6 million mobile
phones, 70,000-100,000 base stations, up to 2.1 million lines of
mobile exchange capacity and two million pagers.
</P>
<P>
China's pager owners has already topped 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has launched 10 Sino-foreign joint
ventures making telecommunications products in collaboration with
such heavyweights as Motorola, Siemens, Nokia and Ericsson.
</P>
<P>
The daily notes that China still relies heavily on imported
telecommunications products, and many foreign manufacturers of
telecommunications products are striving to promote their finished
products in China.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the country's telecommunications manufacturing
industry is still plagued by such problems as backward technical
skills, weak development capacity, sparse and duplicated
production structures and layout, incomplete varieties and a small
market occupation ratio.

<HEADLINE> Killer of Senior Official Executed in Beijing (1) (Eds: Details added.) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Jinlong, the man who killed
senior Chinese official Li Peiyao, vice chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), was executed
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence was carried out in accordance with the
sentences of the No.1 Intermediate People's Court as approved by
the Higher People's Court of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 Intermediate People's Court of Beijing formed a
collegiate bench for a public trial on April 24 to hear charges
against Zhang of intentional homicide, robbery, and theft.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings against Zhang was instituted by the Beijing
People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Two lawyers from the Qingshan Law Office were appointed
to defend Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Family members of Li Peiyao, and some 70 other people attended
the trial.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, 18, was a soldier of the armed police. Around 4 am on
February 2 this year, Zhang sneaked into Li's residence to steal
property while he was on duty near the house, and he was
discovered in the act.
</P>
<P>
Fearing exposure of his crime, Zhang took a kitchen knife and
lashed out at Li's head and other parts of his body. Li
courageously fought with his attacker, but seriously wounded Li
died of massive hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
When Zhang attempted to flee with 700 yuan and things he had
taken from Li's house, including a camera, leather coat, watch,
and jewelry worth around 26,000 yuan, he was stopped by two other
armed police guards on duty, who later took him to a department of
public security.
</P>
<P>
During the trial Zhang also confessed that during his night
shifts in January this year, he had sneaked into Li's house
twice to steal, but was not discovered.

<HEADLINE> China's Urban Dwellers See Life Through Color TVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Almost nine out of the ten urban
dwellers in China own color TV sets and washing machines, and two
thirds of urban families have refrigerators in their kitchens, a
new survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
But China's market of large-size electric household appliances
such as color TV sets, washing machines and refrigerators is now
inclining to be saturated.
</P>
<P>
Smaller electrical items such as food processors and microwave
ovens are among the hottest selling 'mod cons' in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the "China Machinery and Electronics Daily", most
of the major electric appliances are unlikely to be replaced in
the near future, causing serious overcapacity in domestic
production.
</P>
<P>
Other large and more expensive electric appliances like
big-screen color TV sets, VCD players and high-grade stacked sound
systems are still not being bought in quantity by ordinary Chinese
families because of quality, price and other factors.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, smaller electric appliances as humidifiers,
electric heaters, microwave stoves, electric heaters, air
purifiers and irons are popular with customers.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 80 domestic large markets shows that in the first
two months of this year the sales of food processors, humidifiers
and electric heaters jumped 17.3 percent, 21.9 percent and 16.9
percent, respectively, over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of foreign manufacturers of smaller
electric appliances have been active in gaining a foothold in
China, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Contributes to Security of Asia Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian Minister for Foreign
Affairs Alexander Downer said today that Australia would
contribute to the security of the Asia Pacific region principally
through cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the New Security Agenda in the Asia-Pacific Region
forum in the Parliament House this morning, Downer said that "In
the long term, Australia must aim to help build a regional
environment which is characterized by both resource security and
the development of a culture of trust and consultation.
</P>
<P>
He said that liberalization of trade and investment and joint
development of resources were the straight forward way to ensure
ongoing access by East Asian growth economies to energy and other
resources, which is central to the maintenance of regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
He outlined four aspects of Australia's objectives in the
regional security.
</P>
<P>
First, Australia would strengthen the web of ties with its
immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Existing security arrangements include ANZUS alliance with New
Zealand and the United States, the Five Power Defense Arrangements
with Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the
Closer Defense Relations (CDR) agreement with New Zealand, the
Joint Declaration of Principles with Papua New Guinea, the
Agreement on Maintaining Security with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The arrangements together provide a solid foundation for
security links between Australia and Southeast Asia and the
Australian government will be working to further build on that
foundation," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the aim of developing the web of
security was to strengthen regional security cooperation in a way
that "does not open up regional division or invite strategic
competition."
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Australia would ensure a "continued, strong United
States presence within the East Asian region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Australia would strongly support the strengthening of
regional dialogue and regional institutions such as the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF), a security forum primarily consisting of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, Australia would commit to economic regional
institutions as a way to ease resource scarcity and build greater
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government is, of course, deeply committed to
the development of APEC as the region's pre-eminent institution
for economic cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia would also be pro-active in contributing to joint
development of scarce resources, such as the work of the Mekong
River Commission.
</P>
<P>
Downer also noted the dramatic change in Australia's position
in opposing India's bid to join the ARF. He said that the
coalition government supported India in its bid to join the ARF,
but that would be under the pre-condition that the Indo-Pakistan
dispute would be kept out of the forum.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and some high-ranking Australian officials
would visit India later this year. This would be part of the
coalition government's efforts to upgrade Australia's relations
with South Asia, which had been ignored for some time in the past,
he said.

Republic of Korea in the January-March period was two times the
figure for the same period last year, exceeding that of Hong Kong

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years after a
destructive earthquake, Tangshan City in north China is building a
memorial hall in memory of the disaster and the 240,000 citizens
who died.
</P>
<P>
The memorial will also trace the city's redevelopment in the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The memorial hall, the first one of this kind in the country,
is now under construction, and scheduled to receive its first
visitors on July 28, the exact day in 1976 when the quake
measuring 7.8 degrees on the Richter scale struck and devastated
the then industrial city overnight.
</P>
<P>
The 5,300-sq-m hall will feature 600 photos, 600 objects, 130
charts and 12 sand tables to explain the cause of the powerful
quake, to feature the scenes after the quake and to display
achievements in reconstruction of the city.
</P>
<P>
The hall will also provide rare information and data to
seismologists.
</P>
<P>
Now a city of 1.5 million people, Tangshan has re-emerged as a
leading industrial base with an industrial output value of 73.9
billion yuan (8.8 billion US dollars) last year, 10.9 times the
1975 figure.
</P>
<P>
A theme park that will give people a chance to know about an
earthquake will also be built in the city.
</P>
<P>
A series of commemorative activities, including an investment
and trade fair and an exhibition of Tangshan's achievements since
the quake, are being prepared for the 20th anniversary of the
quake.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Let Hare River Benefit Ethiopian People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- On the Hare River in southern
Ethiopia, an irrigation project was built under the Chinese
assistance. The project will help the Ethiopian people to make
full use of the water resources of the Hare River and greatly
benefit the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Due to the construction of the project, the irrigated areas in
the Hare Valley have been expanded by 1,300 hectares.
The project can also help control floods and prevent the
farmland from being salinized by groundwater.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is an agricultural country with its agricultural
output value accounting for half of its Gross Domestic Product.
However, of its total 16 million hectares of cultivated land,
only one fifth is irrigated.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the water tower in northeastern Africa", Ethiopia is
endowed with numerous lakes and rivers and therefore abounds in
water resources. It is really a pity that the water resources
have not been fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
For many decades, the farmers in the Hare Valley have
cherished the hope that one day they have made use of the river
water to irrigate their crops.
</P>
<P>
The day has come. On April 15, 1993, the governments of
Ethiopia and the People's Republic of China signed an agreement
on the construction of an irrigation project on the Hare River.
</P>
<P>
Since the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
headed by Meles Zenawi took power in July 1991, it has given top
priority to the agricultural development. To develop small-scale
irrigation projects has been an important part of its food
self-sufficiency program.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a group of 38 Chinese experts and
technicians arrived at the Southern People's National State of
Ethiopia in the Hare Valley on September 8 that year to build the
project in cooperation with the local people.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project started on July 2, l994, after 10
months of survey and preparation.
</P>
<P>
At the very beginning of the project's construction, the
Chinese experts raised the call of "building the project with
good quality and at a high speed" and "serving the Ethiopian
people whole heartedly."
</P>
<P>
However, shortly after the start of the construction, the
Chinese experts team met with a problem -- how to reduce the
numbers of houses of the local people to be pulled down and the
acreage of farmland to be occupied by the project.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the initial design, a large number of
houses would be pulled down and 33.76 hectares of farmland
destroyed for the construction of the project, causing a loss of
442,600 Ethiopian Birr (over 70,000 US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese experts thought the loss was too heavy for the
local people and, after consultations with local government
officials, decided to revise their design. As a result, the loss
was reduced by 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> A Story Of Sino-Ethiopian Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin)
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hare River, flowing through
mountainous areas in southern Ethiopia,is capricious. Though
placid in the most time of a year, it could swell into raging
torrents following heavy rains in the valley.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, l994, a rainstorm sent the river in spate and
its discharge increased sharply to 120 cubic meters per second.
The yellow, roaring floods inundated nearby farmland and crops
and were rushing to the cofferdam of the construction site. Once
the floods destroyed the cofferdam, the machines and building
materials in the construction site would be all washed away by
the floods.
</P>
<P>
At this critical moment, all the 38 Chinese experts and
technicians, together with more than 100 Ethiopian workers,
dashed to the cofferdam. They put sandbags and stones into the
floods to protect it from being scoured off.
</P>
<P>
But they failed. The powerful torrents washed away all the
sandbags and the stones.
</P>
<P>
Under this critical situation, Cheng Ya'ning, a Chinese
expert, jumped into the waist-deep water. Many Ethiopian workers
followed him. They built a wall of gabions filled with stones.
Finally, the cofferdam was fastened and safe.
</P>
<P>
Another problem facing the Chinese experts was that water
supplies mustn't be suspended during the construction of the
project since the nearby farmers rely on the water of the Hara
River for daily life use and farming.
</P>
<P>
Bearing in mind the interests of the Ethiopian people, the
Chinese experts made ditches near the main canal to lead water to
the villages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese workers must combat tropical diseses.
Shortly after the start of the project's construction, some of
them suffered from malignant malaria and had a high fever,
headache and pains in joints. Thirtyone of the 38 Chinese experts
and technicians had contracted malaria and many of them had had
relapses.
</P>
<P>
During the construction of the project, many Ethiopian workers,
sometimes reaching 1,600 in number, worked together with the Chinese
experts and technicians. They helped and supported each other and
created many moving stories. Due to the joint efforts of the
workers from the two countries, the project was completed on
January 29, 1996, three months ahead of schedule. Now, it
provides water for 1,300 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
While the project was being built, some senior Ethiopian
government officials came and made inspections of the project.
They included Ethiopian Vice Prime Minister Kasu Ilala and the
Chairman of the Southern People's National State, Abate Kisho.
They spoke highly of the good construction quality of the
project.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, huge funds were allocated by the local
government to furnish a 78-kilometer field drainage which will
make the irrigation project capable to serve more farmland.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation Project on the Hare River will go down in the
friendship annals between the Ethiopian and the Chinese
peoples. enditem

BELGRADE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A preliminary investigation shows
that Muslims were responsible for Monday's incident near the Serb

</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Serb news agency SRNA today, Spokesman

</P>
<P>
Despite the warning, more than 30 Muslims forcibly passed the
IFOR checkpoint into a minefield, about 600 meters west of the

</P>
<P>
After that several explosions were heard in which two Muslims
were killed and seven others wounded, Karonen said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the International Police Task Force has
requested that Gracanica-Sjenina Rijeka route, along which the
Muslims intended to pass, be closed temporarily.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa has shelved for at least a year plans for the
procurement of two diesel attack submarines, the Bangkok Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister torpedoed the order for two A-19 Gotland
Class vessels from Kockums of Sweden for fear of bloating the
current account deficit, which stood at 335.7 billion baht (13.43
billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed purchase would cost 17 billion baht (680 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Thai Navy's moves to buy the vessels led to allegations
that Kockums bribed senior figures of Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) Party before the July 2 general election to enhance its
chances of winning an order.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a source as saying that Banharn was also
concerned an order would give the opposition a chance to revive
the allegations.

<HEADLINE> European Workers Mark May Day With Call for More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Workers and unionists in France, Spain
and Italy urged their governments to resolve the unemployment
problem as they held massive marches in various European cities on
the May Day.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 people joined the march in Paris organized by the
General Confederation of Labor, holding placards which read:" Wipe
Out Unemployment," and "Secure Social Equality."
</P>
<P>
As French workers staged protests in the cities of Bordeaux,
Lille, Lyon, Paris and Strasbourg, 150,000 workers took to the
streets in Spain marking the May Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
The General Confederation of Workers and the Workers'
Commission, the two biggest trade unions in Spain, asked the
Popular Party (PP) to hold "social dialog" with them in a bid to
protect the interests of laborers and reduce unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The PP took over power from the Spanish Socialist Workers'
Party after it won the March 3 election.
</P>
<P>
Joblessness, the biggest problem haunting the European Union
(EU), has remained above 10 percent since 1993. Spain has an
unemployment rate of more than 22 percent, the highest among all
EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
Though unemployment in Italy is not as serious as in Spain, it
still stays at 12 percent, almost two percentage points above the
EU average. The unemployment rate in southern Italy stood as high
as 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A massive march was held in Catania, the largest port city on
the eastern Italian coast. Union leaders urged the Romano Prodi
whose center-left coalition won the April 21 election to place job
creation as the major task of his government.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for International Cooperation for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
U.N. Qin Huasun today called for international cooperation to
enable developing countries to achieve sustainable development and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
economic development, environmental protection, industrial
restructuring and the adoption of environmentally sound
technologies and mode of production can no longer be accomplished
by national efforts alone, Qin told the current session of the
U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development.
</P>
<P>
International economic cooperation has never been such an
urgent need as today, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that old thinking and practice of the old
trade and financial systems are severely hindering cooperation in
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"The old trade, financial and other economic relations which
continue to prevail today represent only the interests of a
handful of countries, and are totally out of step with
contemporary needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no future for the reintroduction of these old concepts
and methods into international cooperation in the field of
development and environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
He criticized "certain developed countries" for pressing their
business interests in the field of international cooperation for
development and environmental protection by citing domestic
political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of treating sustainable development as mankind's
common commitment and common undertaking, they use environmental
protection as a weapon to exercise new trade protectionism to
offset the comparative advantage of the developing countries in
natural and human resources and damper the momentum of their
development. This cannot but cause grave concern of the
international community," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the special session of the General Assembly scheduled
for next year will be a good opportunity to follow the spirit of
the Rio de Janeiro conference on development and environmental
protection and help revitalize cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly session should make efforts to help
developing countries improve the external atmosphere for
development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Lawmakers Slam U.S. for Tougher Sanctions on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of Nicaraguan deputies today
condemned a U.S. bill toughening economic sanctions against Cuba
as a violation of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published in the "Barricada" newspaper, the 47
deputies noted that the Helms-Burton bill violated the principle
of co-existence among nations as stipulated in the United Nations
Charter and treaties that govern international trade.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the U.S. to end its 30-year-old trade, economic
and financial embargo against Cuba, describing it as a policy of
injustice and a violation of international rights.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton bill, named after its sponsors and passed by
Congress in March after Cuba shot down two U.S. planes, aims to
deter the flow of foreign investment into the Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Canada, Russia and the European Union, which trade with
Cuba, have criticized the bill.
</P>
<P>
The deputies also said they had submitted a draft bill
condemning Helms-Burton to the Foreign Affairs Committee of
Nicaragua's National Assembly which, they said, was dragging its
feet over approving it.
</P>
<P>
They warned that they would make the bill public if the National
Assembly failed to pass it.

<HEADLINE> Work on China's Biggest Gas Field Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited construction of
China's largest gas field has begun, after six years of
exploration, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The field stretches across the central part of the
Shaan-Gan-Ning region in the northwestern provinces of Shaanxi and
Gansu and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, which will supply 3 billion cubic meters of gas
a year to Beijing, Shaanxi's capital Xi'an and Ningxia's capital
Yinchuan, is expected to strengthen the role of natural gas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In China, natural gas constitutes only 2 percent of energy
consumption while coal makes up 75 percent and crude oil, 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
Building work has started on a gas purifying plant in
Jiangbian, in Shaanxi, and on pipelines to Xi'an and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Construction of an additional pipeline from the gas field to
Yinchuan will begin in May.
</P>
<P>
The development plan had been approved by the State after many
scientific experiments and feasibility studies, the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC) said.
</P>
<P>
Total investment for the development of the gas field is
expected to exceed 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the development plan, the gas field will begin
supplying 3 billion cubic meters of gas a year by the turn of this
century.
</P>
<P>
By September next year, a capacity for an annual supply of 1
billion cubic meters of gas will be established.
</P>
<P>
To date, 230 billion cubic meters of gas reserves have been
confirmed with another 100 billion cubic meters to be further
evaluated.
</P>
<P>
The gas field was discovered in 1989. To date, only 32,000
square kilometers of the Shaan-Gan-Ning central basin have been
explored . Areas of 5,000 square kilometers have been ascertained
as containing gas.
</P>
<P>
Executives from Shaanxi said surveys had shown there may be
even more gas than had been thought.
</P>
<P>
The Changqing Oil Exploration Bureau is stretching prospecting
beyond the central part of the basin.
</P>
<P>
The supply of natural gas, called a clean energy, should help
improve living conditions for residents in Beijing, Xi'an and
Yinchuan, and the environment will be better cared for.

<HEADLINE> New Dictionary of Chinese Journalism Off Press (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Journalism in China has thrown the
spotlight on itself with the publication today of a new dictionary
about the theories and practices of the media world in China.
</P>
<P>
Compiled by the Xinhua Publishing House, the "Dictionary of
Chinese Journalism" is encyclopaedic in format but follows the
pattern of textbooks in structure. Hot off the presses, it
compares favorably with many academic publications in content.
</P>
<P>
As a reference book essential to journalists, it can guide
young aspirants systematically into the ABC of journalism and
provide scholars with abundant information about the origin,
development and current situation of the Chinese media.
</P>
<P>
Spanning ten chapters, the dictionary runs through theory, news
operations, Chinese and foreign media, information, communication
technology, media management, personnel training, press laws, and
journalists. It consists of 4,991 entries which run to some 2.3
million words.
</P>
<P>
The chapter about theory, which is extremely important,
highlights the guidelines of Chinese journalism based on
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping's theories
about socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary, which is very orthodox ideologically,
emphasizes the class nature of the Communist press, its
proletarian principles and its mission as a mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
It reminds people of the objective of the revolutionary press
as the emancipation of the working class, according to Marx and
Engels; Lenin's notion about the press as a collective propagator,
agitator and organizer; Mao's injunction that the Party press must
publicize the Central Committee's political line and policies
unconditionally; Deng's call for the press to consolidate national
stability and unity and promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
One entry in this chapter says that Chinese news media should
serve the need to establish a socialist market economic structure,
foster socialist culture and ethics, guide and exercise
information service functions, and better serve the people and
socialism.
</P>
<P>
In addition to proletarian press theory, the dictionary also
embraces concepts and terms about print, photo, and electronic
journalism, newsreel and documentary production, Western
journalism and communication.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Import More Corn in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will increase corn
imports to 1.1 million tons this year, 200,000 tons more than last
year, government sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The corn will come from the United States since Argentina, the
main corn supplier for Brazil, could be excluded from the
Brazilian market due to high prices and low stocks available for
export, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's corn output dropped this year to 30.5 million tons as
against 33.5 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due mainly to low yields in Grande DO Sol, one of
the biggest corn-growing states.

<HEADLINE> Castro Heads May Day Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro today
headed a gigantic march in Havana to commemorate International
Workers' Day.
</P>
<P>
One million people, including laborers, professionals,
students and housewives, were involved in the parade, which was
characterized by anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators chanted "Down with the blockade", "No to the
blockade, no to Helms-Burton", and "Forever against the
blockade", referring to the economic blockade imposed by the
United States on the Caribbean nation since the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The blockade was tightened in March this year when the
U.S. passed the Helms Burton bill after Cuban air force jets shot
down two small planes piloted by Florida-based Cuban exiles on
February 24. Cuba accused Washington of violating its air space.
</P>
<P>
"Resist, fight and overcome to save the motherland, socialism
and revolution" and "Together we can do a lot" were among the
slogans the marchers chanted as they converged for a demonstration
in Havana's Revolution Square.

WELLINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand and Australia have
taken the first steps toward a free trade agreement with four
South American countries, according to local press reports today.

stability in Latin America," he said.

of some 1,230 billion NZ dollars (825 billion U.S. dollars), twice

<HEADLINE> Bruton Supports Sinn Fein's Participation in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said
tonight that he hoped Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), would take party in all-party talks on the
future of Northern Ireland scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
Bruton told BBC radio that he was encouraged by Sinn Fein's
attitude, although the British government still insisted that Sinn
Fein could not be admitted to the planned peace talks unless the
IRA revived its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Bruton stressed that Sinn Fein should be allowed to take part
in the talks process so as to enable all-inclusive discussions on
the future of the conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times newspaper in a report today said that
British Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart both
knew that peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland would be
useless without Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Even if the peace talks began on June 10 without Sinn Fein, it
is not inconceivable that they could be let in at a later date. If
Sinn Fein did join on time, every effort would be made to keep
them at the table, the report analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Bruton now was urging Major to make one more overture before
all-party talks, namely, to assure Sinn Fein that they would not
stretch out indefinitely and that there was considerable political
capital in taking part, the report revealed.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments will draw some comfort from
Sinn Fein's decision to take part in elections on May 30 for a
Northern Ireland forum.
</P>
<P>
While Sinn Fein has said it would not participate in the forum,
which all sides acknowledged would be little more than a
talking-shop, the willingness of its leaders to stand for the 110
seats in the forum was taken a positive step, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Deputy PM Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps resigned today.
</P>
<P>
Her resignation has been accepted by Prime Minister Jean
Chretien.
</P>
<P>
In her letter to the prime minister, Copps said that she had
spoken with her family and closest friends over the last few days
to advise them of her decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
Copps has been dogged over the past week by her election
promise that "If the GST (goods and services tax) is not abolished
under a Liberal government, I will resign."
</P>
<P>
"I gave my word and I will keep my word," Copps said in the
letter to the prime minister dated April 30.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal government retreated from its 1993 election
promise to do away with the GST when Finance Minister Paul Martin
admitted last week that the Liberals were wrong to promise to kill
the GST while announcing a harmonized tax agreement with three
Atlantic provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that Copps' decision "cannot have been an easy
one." He congratulated Copps for her courage and commitment,
adding that "this is what integrity in politics is all about."
</P>
<P>
"Your colleagues in Cabinet, in Caucus, and in the Liberal
Party across Canada are all proud of you," Chretien said in his
letter to Copps today.
</P>
<P>
In accepting Copps' resignation, the prime minister also
announced that a by-election would be held in Hamilton East on
June 17.
</P>
<P>
Copps is set to participate in the race. "I owe it to
Hamiltonians to allow them to pass judgement on whether I should
be their member of parliament," she said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister wished Copps the best of luck, and said that
he looked forward to Copps' return to parliament and to the
cabinet.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Secretary of State for
Asia-Pacific Raymond Chan will visit China and Hong Kong between
May 4 and 21 to discuss political, trade, economic and other ties,
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by representatives of 39 Canadian companies, Chan
"will also promote Canadian involvement in projects in the Chinese
cities of Beijing, Dalian, Jinan, Shanghai, Fuzhou and Shenzhen,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to the highly successful Team Canada mission in
November 1994, Canadian businesses have made important gains in
the China market. Exports to China jumped by nearly 50 percent to
a record 2.49 U.S. dollars in 1995, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"To sustain this momentum, we must target more specifically
some of the fast-growing regional markets in China. This mission
will do just that," he added.

<HEADLINE> Draft Deal Limiting Use of Mines Under Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Johan Molander, president of the
current session here on anti-personnel landmines, said today that
he had put forward Tuesday a draft package deal on restricting
use of mines, which according to him solves the remaining
difficult related issues.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five parties to the Convention on Conventional Weapons
(CCW), which are meeting here as from April 26, will decide
whether to accept it or not before the session, the second of its
kind this year, is closed on May 3.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Molander said the deal, if applied, would
be "a significant step forward" in the "development of
humanitarian law globally," though far short of the expectations
of some countries, in particular the West.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he noted 30 countries had urged a total ban on
landmine use, and said reaching this goal looked unlikely.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the draft deal had got before its submission
support from the Western group and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
The draft package, a revision of Protocol II of the CCW on
landmine issues, introduces a ban on the use and transfer of
non-detectable anti-personnel landmines, as well as an extended
coverage of the protocol to internal armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Other important points include a ban on transfer of mines, the
use of which is restricted by the protocol, to any unauthorized
non-state recipient, or to any country not bound to the protocol
unless it agrees to observe the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The draft treaty demands that as of January 1, 1997,
anti-personnel mines to be made should incorporate in construction
a material or device to make them detectable, and that those
earlier made should, prior to emplacement, either do so or attach
a material or device making them detectable.
</P>
<P>
Anti-personnel mines, it provides, unless in defined areas,
should be self-destructing within 30 days after emplacement, and
meanwhile self-deactivating so that no more than one in 1,000
mines will still function 120 days after being planted.
</P>
<P>
For the completion of self-detectability, self-destruction and
self-deactivation of mines earlier produced, the draft gives a
deferral period of nine years from the protocol's entry into force
-- six months after the 20th country notifies its accession.
</P>
<P>
According to Molander, political commitments to immediate
compliance with rules of the protocol will be included in the
treaty text.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the draft text, Molander said Pakistan had tried to
add to Article 8 on the mine transfer issue contents which the
European Union said would limit party obligations and the scope of
application.
</P>
<P>
Molander added that a revised protocol would be blocked without
a consensus.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan to Expand Flight Services of Two Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan have
agreed to allow two airlines to expand their services during the
summer tourist season, the U.S. Transport Department announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during an informal meeting between
representatives of the two countries this week, U.S.
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The accord clears the way for America's United Airlines to
immediately commence an additional daily flight between Los
Angeles and Tokyo and to operate new service between Osaka, Japan,
and Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
It also allows Japanese Airlines to operate between Tokyo and
Kona, Hawaii, and to increase the number of flights it operates
between Sendai, Japan, and Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Transportation Department said that the
newly-reached agreement "clears some of the underbrush" that
stands in the way of a broader renegotiation of the U.S.-Japan air
treaty.
</P>
<P>
"While there remains work to be done on resolving current
disputes before we can consider moving toward more comprehensive
discussions... we are hopeful that we can continue to move in a
positive direction with Japan," Pena said.
