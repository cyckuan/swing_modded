   KARBALA, Iraq (AP) -- In the last two years, Iranian pilgrims
have flocked here by the thousands, visiting holy Shiite Muslim
shrines and boosting Iraq's tourism economy by spending on hotels,
food and sacred souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   But following a recent dispute over pilgrimage fees, Iranians
have stayed away, and Iraqi business people near the shrines in
southern and central Iraq are already hurting from their absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buses full of pilgrims used to stop daily at my restaurant and
others in the city, making us happy with the business,'' but no
longer, said Abdel Hussein Hakeem, a restaurant owner in Najaf, 90
miles south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am afraid the dust will gather again,'' said hotel owner
Salah Mahmoud. He said his hotel sat mostly empty until the influx
of pilgrims helped him restart his business in Karbala, also 90
miles from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Iranian pilgrims regularly visited the holy Shiite
cities of Najaf and Karbala before war broke out between the two
countries in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The border was not officially reopened until July 1998, when an
agreement was made to allow 12,000 Iranian pilgrims to visit
monthly. Iran closed the border again that December, citing fears
for the pilgrims' safety during U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The border was reopened last November, and hundreds of thousands
of pilgrims have made the emotional journey to the revered sites.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, the pilgrimages stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has accused Iraq of barring the pilgrims from visiting the
shrines. Iraq denies this. Its Foreign Ministry claimed that Iran
has stopped the pilgrims because ''it could not pay its commitments
to the Iraqi side.''
</P>
<P>
   Iranian pilgrims pay $350 in fees for accommodation and other
services during their weeklong stay in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Iranian official said in early August that the Iraqis
had requested the pilgrims pay additional entry fees. The official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a previous agreement on
the payment of fees was valid until September.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's religious tourism has flourished in the two years since
Saddam Hussein decided to allow Iranian pilgrims to visit, a move
aimed at bringing hard currency to sanctioned Iraq and improving
relations with its eastern neighbor. Pilgrimage tourism is one of
the few forms of international trade that Iraq is allowed to engage
in under the U.N.'s sweeping sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were reluctant to give a figure for how
much hard currency Iraq may be losing. Estimates based on the
number of Iranian pilgrims allowed to enter suggest a monthly
income of at least $4 million, with another $1 million from
pilgrims from Syria, Jordan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Mosques in the cities of Najaf and Karbala are the most sacred
sites to Iran's majority Shiite Muslims after those in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Najaf is the site of the tomb of Imam Ali, the son-in-law and
cousin of Islam's Prophet Muhammad. Shiites aspire to bury their
dead in its cemetery, which stretches for miles and is the largest
in the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   The Imam Hussein Shrine in Karbala commemorates the martyrdom of
the prophet's grandson and Shiite Islam's most revered saint.
Hussein and 70 family members and followers died in a battle on the
plain of Karbala in the year 680, a key reason for Islam's split
into the orthodox Sunni and minority Shiite sects.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors at the sites make their livings selling worry beads,
white burial sheets inscribed with verses from the Quran, and dried
mud pieces from holy soil used as head rests during prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Murtadha Mahdi has been selling the items for 30 years in
Karbala. ''I used to order on a weekly basis to keep up with
buyers,'' he said. ''I did not order a single item last week
because I sold very few worry beads in the last two weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Solidarity Celebrated in Poland  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GDANSK, Poland (AP) -- Solidarity founder Lech Walesa and guests
including former British leader Margaret Thatcher gathered outside
the Gdansk shipyard Thursday for a ceremony marking the start of
the union's anti-communist crusade 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 Solidarity supporters massed at Solidarity Square,
where the movement was born, to watch Walesa lay a wreath at the
foot of a monument to shipyard workers killed by the communists.
</P>
<P>
   Under sunny skies, union members brought hundreds of Solidarity
banners and a military band played the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief address, Walesa thanked Solidarity members and
supporters, who in 1980 were on both sides of the shipyard gate,
for their efforts to change Poland.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted the workers were ''in a special way paying the
price of the changes'' they initiated 20 years ago, referring to
layoffs, unemployment and other painful side-effects of Poland's
transformation to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''All those who took part in the struggle ... should be proud,''
he said. ''But with pride comes responsibility. We must watch and
make sure that process initiated in August 1980 goes in the right
direction and does not degenerate.''
</P>
<P>
   At an outdoor Mass later, the head of the nation's Roman
Catholic Church, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, called Solidarity's victory
a ''miracle on the Baltic'' and urged Poles to cultivate the
union's traditional ideals of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need solidarity ... we need unity among social groups like
20 years ago,'' Glemp said in his sermon, echoing the main theme of
the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Walesa, , Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and
other union leaders appealed for unity and an end to political
infighting within Solidarity, whose popularity has declined sharply
since the union-led bloc won the 1997 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite economic growth and continuing reforms, which filled
stores and brought dlrs 40 billion in foreign investment, many
Poles are dissatisfied with growing unemployment and shrinking
social blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies end three days of festivities in this Baltic port
city, where Solidarity signed the milestone Gdansk agreement with
the communists 20 years ago. The agreements, meant to bring more
freedom and better conditions for workers, ended a two-week
nationwide strike and the official recognition marked Solidarity's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   But Poland's communist rulers backed away from the deal in
December 1981 and tried to crush the union with martial law. It
took eight more years of steady resistance, and cost more than 100
lives, but Solidarity toppled the regime in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among the foreign guests at the ceremony was Thatcher, whom the
Gdansk City Council bestowed honorary citizenship on last week,
along with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, for supporting
Solidarity in its long struggle against communism.
</P>
<P>
   She left the ceremony early, however, without making any public
remarks.

<HEADLINE> First South American Summit Opens  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- South American leaders opened their
first regional summit Thursday, amid concerns of a possible
spillover from Colombia's anti-drug offensive and of U.S. military
involvement in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana quickly reassured the 11
other leaders that his anti-drug campaign -- known as Plan Colombia
-- will not lead to American military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am the President of Colombia. There will not be a military
intervention,'' he told reporters. ''Instead of criticizing, the
world should understand that drug trafficking is the common
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-day summit was convened by Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso to discuss integrating the region's economies,
strengthening its democratic institutions and improving education
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the consequences of Colombia's drug war was becoming a major
focus of the meeting, which got under way one day after President
Clinton visited Colombia to lend support and release $1.3 billion
in military aid to the counternarcotics program.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military hardware and training are aimed at combating
armed groups that protect plantations producing 90 percent of the
world's cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fully support the plan provided its main goal is a
negotiated peace settlement,'' Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
told reporters. ''What worries us is the plan's strong
military-oriented focus. The level of military involvement must be
lowered.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Venezuela has reinforced its border with Colombia and
planned to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees. He added
that in a single day last year, 22,000 Colombian refugees crossed
the Venezuelan border fleeing violence.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia shares a 1,400-mile border with Venezuela and a
960-mile border with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also said he feared that Colombia's anti-narcotics
efforts could engulf much of South America in a Vietnam-like war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be very dangerous if the operation leads to a
military escalation of the conflict,'' Chavez said. ''It could lead
us to a Vietnamization of the whole Amazon region, before our very
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug trafficking, he said, must ''not be fought with military
actions, but with intelligence services and the cooperation of all
countries affected by this form of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Before thinking of solving other countries' drug-trafficking
problems with acts of violence, the United States should do
something to reduce the high consumption of drugs inside its own
territory,'' Chavez added.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Brazil worries that drug traffickers and
guerrillas fleeing the Colombian offensive could cross into its
territory and has placed army and police troops in the region on
alert.
</P>
<P>
   ''A common South American agenda cannot ignore our concerns with
the destructive effects of organized crime and drug trafficking,''
Cardoso wrote in an article Wednesday in the newspaper Valor.
</P>
<P>
   Combating drug traffickers who cross the region's ''porous
borders ... is a challenge of major proportions that demands the
decisive action of our countries' leaders,'' Cardoso added.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana is expected to brief his
summit colleagues on his anti-drug campaign and, according to some
news reports, try to enlist their support.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has made it clear that while it supports Plan Colombia it
opposes any active military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Summit leaders also are taking first steps to create a South
American trade bloc. They want to integrate the continent's
economies through a network of highways, bridges and river routes
as well as telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the summit's opening ceremony, Cardoso said the
trade bloc would emerge from the ''creation of a free trade area
between Mercosur and the Andean Pact by January 2002 at the very
latest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercosur consists of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay,
with Chile and Bolivia as associate members. The Andean pact's
members are Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   A continentwide trade bloc would give the region greater
bargaining power in the negotiations leading up to the creation of
the U.S.-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas, a
hemisphere-wide free trade zone, scheduled to be in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States wants a free trade area by 2005, Brazil
wants to go more slowly to give regional trade blocs enough time to
solidify and merge into a South American-wide bloc capable of
competing on a hemispheric scale.

Paper: Army Patriot antimissile Battery on Alert
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon put an Army Patriot antimissile battery on
alert Thursday for a possible deployment to Israel because of concern that Iraq
may decide to strike during the U.S. presidential campaign, The Washington Post
reports. The action is in response to concerns that Iraq may decide to fire
surface-to-surface missiles at Israel as the presidential campaign gets into
full swing after Labor Day, Monday, said the report published on the Post Web
site Thursday night. The unit on alert is the 69th Air Defense Artillery
Brigade, based near Frankfurt, Germany, the report said.

Whitewater Team Leaves Little Rock

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray formally declared an

office where President and Hillary Rodham Clinton's business dealings had been
investigated for the past six and half years. Ray said he is now focusing on
whether the president should be held criminally liable for his testimony about
Monica Lewinsky during the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. A federal judge
last year cited Clinton with contempt of court and fined him $90,000 as a civil
penalty for what she called misleading testimony in the Jones case. A grand jury
was seated July 11 to consider whether Clinton should also face criminal charges
for the sworn testimony.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Kansas Woman Freed  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE COFFEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLADSTONE, Mo. (AP) -- Two men kidnapped a woman from her home,
led police on a chase and then held officers at bay for 30 hours in
a sweltering vehicle. The woman was freed early Thursday and two
suspects surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage, See Vongphrachach, 54, was treated for dehydration
after the ordeal and said one man told her they had entered the
wrong house.
</P>
<P>
   Two men invaded her Kansas City, Kan., home before dawn
Wednesday, authorities said. They had tried to force the woman's
three adult sons to put up barricades to seal off the house, but
when police arrived, the men instead forced the woman inside the
family's sport utility vehicle and drove away, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A blown tire stopped the vehicle in Gladstone, Mo., about an
hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Police delivered water to the vehicle throughout the day as
temperatures soared. But they refused requests from the men for
gasoline so they could turn on the vehicle to use the air
conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Vongphrachach and one man left the vehicle at 5:15 a.m.
Thursday. The second suspect surrendered five hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the 100-degree heat finally prompted the
suspects to give themselves up.
</P>
<P>
   ''This morning, he had no air conditioning, no food, no water. I
think the condition greatly, greatly affected him,'' FBI special
agent Larry McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Jason Alcorn, 26, and Lawrence D. Riley, 39,
both of Kansas City, Kan., were charged with kidnapping, carjacking
and firearms charges. They remain in federal custody pending a
hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They are being represented by federal public defenders and did
not comment publicly on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County, Kan., investigators believe the men were part
of a theft ring that targeted specific homes, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Brett Anderson. Three other suspects were arrested in
connection with the break-in at the woman's home, but none had been
charged, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with KCTV, Vongphrachach said she did not know
the men.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pulled me in the car. I get in the car to go with him. I
never saw him before,'' she said. ''He said, 'I'm so sorry, ma'am.
I'm in the wrong house.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so tired. I think, I'm not going to see my family and
friends again. I prayed all day and all night.''

<HEADLINE> School Granted Minute of Silence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday declined to
stop public schools in Virginia from requiring students to observe
a minute of silence.
</P>
<P>
   A state law that took effect July 1 requires all school
districts to impose a minute of silence so students can meditate,
pray or engage in any other silent activity.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia sued on behalf of
eight students who said the new law violates their First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing to fear from a classroom of silent, thoughtful
children,'' said U.S. District Court Chief Judge Claude Hilton, who
refused to issue an injunction.
</P>
<P>
   His decision does not directly address the merits of the
lawsuit. Hilton said he agreed with state Solicitor General William
Hurd, who argued that no harm would be done if the law remains in
effect until a final decision is made in a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs' attorney, Stuart H. Newberger, said tens of
thousands of students will be harmed significantly every day the
law is in effect because it infringes on their constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Virginia, like every other state, cannot get into the prayer
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the eight student plaintiffs was given detention this
week for walking out of class to protest the minute of silence.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Welcomes Burundi Peace Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council on Thursday welcomed
Burundi's compromise peace deal as an ''important step'' towards
national reconciliation and urged the rebels who didn't sign to
stop fighting and join the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the press, the council also encouraged the
negotiators at the Arusha, Tanzania, peace talks to step up their
efforts to find a compromise on outstanding issues and to devise a
timetable for carrying out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi President Pierre Buyoya, the Tutsi-led government and
army, as well as Hutu and Tutsi political parties signed a power
sharing accord Monday, paving the way for ending a 7-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, however, lacked details on when a cease-fire
should take place and who would lead a three year transitional
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hutu rebels and four out of 10 Tutsi parties
refused to sign the document, despite pressure from former South
African President Nelson Mandela, who promised to obtain the
cease-fire later.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton attended the signing ceremony and urged the
rebel holdouts to sign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the four Tutsi parties said they were ready to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsis dominate the army and economy of Hutu-majority Burundi.
Civil war broke out in 1993 upon the assassination of Burundi's
first and only democratically elected president, a Hutu. Fighting
since then has killed 200,000 people in the nation of roughly 6
million.

<HEADLINE> Bush Loses Motion To Dismiss Suit  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush has lost his bid for
dismissal from a lawsuit accusing him of violating the free speech
rights of environmental protesters at the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge John Dietz on Wednesday said Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, could be called to testify when
the case goes to trial. No date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that Bush gave state troopers ''unbridled
discretion'' to target protesters picketing in front of the mansion
last year on a public sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have now established one important part of our case and
that is that the governor is not above the law and that the
Constitution can be enforced. We still have to prove the rest of
our case so we aren't done,'' said David Kahne, a lawyer for the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Mike Jones said Thursday that security policies
regarding the mansion were made by the Department of Public Safety,
with no involvement by Bush or his office.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed against Bush and the DPS in August 1999 by
people arrested and jailed on four different occasions. They were
protesting environmental policies backed by Bush. In each case the
Travis County's district attorney's office dropped charges of
blocking an entry way.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Abraham, one of those arrested, said previous governors
allowed protesters to picket on the sidewalk and Bush is trying to
silence his critics because he is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is responsible, whether he told law enforcement
officers to silence his critics, or simply gave approval with a
wink and a nod,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free speech is exercised freely around the Governor's Mansion
and around the Capitol,'' he said. ''There are protests that take
place almost weekly near the Capitol and near the Governor's
Mansion and it takes place in a manner that is not harmful or
disruptive to public safety.''

containers made storage and transfer of fluids more sterile. The
containers reduced the risk of contaminants filtering in with air.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Bellamy went to work for Harvard professor and medical
inventor Dr. Carl Walter. Together, they conceived and developed
the first plastic containers for blood, which were lighter than
glass, non-breakable and collapsible.
</P>
<P>
   He later helped develop disposable dialysis products and
technology for frozen drug delivery.
Ted R. Brown:
</P>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The man who built the tower where the
world's first atomic bomb was detonated died Sunday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who founded Brown Construction Company in 1935, said in a
1980 interview the World War II project in the southern New Mexico
desert where a bomb was detonated in 1945 was so secret he signed a
blank government contract for an amount of money to be filled in
later.
</P>
<P>
   His men built 45 miles of roads, several observation bunkers and
several towers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also built 60 percent of Interstate 25 and about 40
percent of Interstate 40 in the state in the late 1950s and 1960s.

Janice Hardenburger:
</P>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Sen. Janice Hardenburger, a longtime
Republican activist and strong supporter of local government, died
Thursday of lung cancer. She was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Hardenburger was chairwoman of the Senate Elections and Local
Government Committee. Among colleagues and constituents, she was

Rose Hobart:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actress Rose Hobart, who appeared in more
than 40 movies until her career was stopped by questioning by the
House Un-American Activities Committee, died Tuesday. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Hobart played the leading lady or ''other woman'' in movies
during the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   She may be best known for her role opposite Humphrey Bogart in
''Conflict'' in 1945. Hobart was the wife he schemed to kill in
order to romance her more alluring sister, played by Alexis Smith.
</P>
<P>

called before the House committee investigating communism. She was
an active participant in Actors Lab, which supporters of Sen.
Joseph McCarthy considered subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hobart had signed a paper stating that she was not

<P>
   Her movie credits also included ''East of Borneo'' in 1931 and
''Bride of Vengeance'' in 1949.
Conrad Marca-Relli:
</P>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Conrad Marca-Relli, an Italian-American artist who
served as a link between the European avant-garde and American
abstract expressionism, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest contribution came in the 1950s when he
revolutionized the medium of collage adding strips of canvas over
the canvas and painting them over in a subdued palette -- ''a
painting with oil and canvas,'' in one critic's words.
</P>
<P>
   Marca-Relli's style blended classicism with surrealism and some
of the playful improvisations of his abstract expressionist friends
like Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. He was known for
creating monumental-sized collages.
Hussein Abdel Nasser:
</P>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Hussein Abdel Nasser, the youngest brother

<HEADLINE> 2nd Man Indicted in Theft of Oscars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A county grand jury has indicted a dock
worker in the March theft of 55 Academy Awards statuettes, months
after he was arrested and then released because of a lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges Anthony Hart, 38, of La Puente with one
count of grand theft, Deputy District Attorney Susan Navas said
Thursday. Hart was released on his own recognizance after
surrendering to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hart is the second Roadway Express employee charged in
connection with the Oscar theft. He pleaded innocent during an
arraignment in early August.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ledent, a former Roadway truck driver, pleaded no
contest in June to grand theft. He is to begin serving a six-month
jail term in December. Ledent, 38, testified before grand jurors in
the indictment against Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five gold-plated Oscar statuettes were manufactured in
Chicago and shipped to the Bell warehouse where the men worked on
March 8.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage man Willie Fulgear found 52 of the Oscars in a Los
Angeles trash bin after the disappearance was publicized. They were
found one week before the March 26 Academy Awards ceremony. Three
are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear received a $50,000 reward from Roadway Express and two
tickets to the Academy Awards.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Complaints Vs. Pinochet Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The number of criminal complaints against
Gen. Augusto Pinochet climbed to 170 Thursday with a claim that 23
people were tortured during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed by lawyer Eduardo Contreras with one of
the plaintiffs, Beatriz Miranda, who alleged that several now
retired military officers as responsible for the alleged ''brutal
torture'' in the early stage of Pinochet's regime.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the 84-year-old Pinochet was stripped of his
congressional immunity, paving the way for a trial on one of the
complaints, which deals with ''the caravan of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The caravan was a military squad that executed 72 political
prisoners shortly after the coup. Nineteen of the victims remain
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The judge probing the case against Pinochet has set Oct. 9 as
the date for his, but defense lawyers are seeking to postpone the
legal procedures on health grounds.
</P>
<P>
   An official report compiled by the civilian government that
succeeded Pinochet established 3,197 people were killed or made
disappear for political reasons under Pinochet.

<HEADLINE> Teen Drug Use Continues Decline  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Illegal drug use continues to drop among young
teens, according to the government's latest annual survey, but they
are still experimenting with marijuana in numbers not seen since
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Each day more than 4,200 youths ages 12 to 17 try pot for the
first time, according to the National Household Drug Abuse survey,
released Thursday. The rate -- 81 teens out of 1,000 -- is down from
1997's all-time high of 90.8, but is still well above the rate of
first-time teen marijuana users through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest survey, covering 1999, by the Department of Health
and Human Services, 9 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds who were
questioned said they had used an illegal drug in the past 30 days.
That's down from 9.9 percent in 1998 and 11.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug policy adviser, said
the 21 percent decline in drug use by young teens since 1997 is
proof that a $200 million media campaign is working.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to see America's drug problem in 10 years, watch
this population,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   But increased drug use among people over 17 suggests that the
war on drugs is, at best, being fought to a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Illicit drug use among young adults ages 18 to 25 has climbed 28
percent since 1997, from 14.7 percent of the population that age in
1997 to 16.1 percent in 1998 and 18.8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have miles to go when 14.8 million Americans were current
users of illicit drugs in 1999,'' HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty thousand people were questioned in last year's survey,
which also asked about tobacco and alcohol use. The government
provided no figures for margin of error with the report.
</P>
<P>
   For all age groups, drug use was most common in the West and
parts of Appalachia and New England. Teen drug use was more
prevalent in the Southwest, Great Plains and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that children in homes where parents ''neither
approve nor disapprove'' of cigarette smoking were four times as
likely to have used marijuana in the past month than in homes where
parents ''strongly disapprove'' of cigarette use.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's any question that cigarette use, and
alcohol use, and marijuana use, all three, are related to the ...
probability that you would have drug abuse problems as a young
adult,'' said McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Americans age 12 and older reported that
they used alcohol, a rate that has remained relatively flat for the
past several years, the survey reported. It also said 19 percent of
teens had a drink within the past month, 7.8 percent reported binge
drinking, and 3.6 percent said they were heavy users of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   As for smoking, the study said 30 percent of Americans 12 and
older -- 66.8 million people -- were using tobacco. Of those, 57
million smoked cigarettes. Others smoked cigars or pipes or used
smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton said: ''None of us can afford
to let down our guard in the fight against drug, tobacco and
alcohol abuse, especially when it comes to our children.'' He urged
Congress to fund his administration's substance abuse and treatment
programs when it returns next week.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry Outlines Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The tobacco industry is asking a federal judge to
oversee the case in which thousands of sick Florida smokers won a
$145 billion verdict against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   In legal filings Wednesday, the industry asked U.S. District
Judge Ursula Ungaro-Benages to take the case, which was tried
before a state judge over two years, and also listed reasons why
the record-setting jury award should be erased.
</P>
<P>
   The normal appeals route would be a state appeals court and the
state Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court could take the case if
constitutional issues were at stake. That track would not take the
case to a federal judge or the federal appellate system.
</P>
<P>
   The industry based its request for federal jurisdiction on
''patent errors'' and ''federal constitutional aberrations that
subsumed the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's five biggest cigarette makers also attacked class
certification allowing 300,000 to 700,000 sick Florida smokers to
pursue a single case against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the smokers can file their response next week, and
the judge set a hearing for Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   A six-member state jury delivered the punitive damages verdict
July 14. The jury had earlier awarded $12.7 million in compensatory
damages to three people who represented the class.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
Liggett Group Inc. and the industry's defunct Council for Tobacco
Research and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Gang Said Linked to Mexico Kidnaps  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A group of alleged kidnappers arrested over
the weekend is being linked by prosecutors here to a cocky,
well-armed mafia accused of some of Mexico's most spectacular
abductions.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people were arrested Sunday in the central Pacific coast
state of Nayarit. A spokesman for the state's attorney general's
office, Jesus Cervantes, said they were part of a larger
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gang has approximately 80 members, but divided in
organizations in which only the leaders know one another,'' he
said. ''Each group is different, but they depend on the same
supreme command,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes said prosecutors have linked the group to the 1996
kidnapping of Japanese businessman Mamuro Konno in Tijuana and to
the abduction of ranchero music singer Vicente Fernandez's son.
Konno, president of Sanyo Video Components U.S.A., was kidnapped in
Tijuana in 1996 and freed after eight days for $2 million ransom.
Vicente Fernandez Jr. was kidnapped in May 1998 and released four
months later after payment of a reported $3.2 million ransom -- and
after his abductors cut off two of his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Tellaeche, a spokesman for the attorney general's office
in Baja California state, where Konno was abducted, said the arrest
of three suspects at that time led officials to believe there were
20 people in the kidnapping group.
</P>
<P>
   ''One can think that the band grew since that kidnapping, some
who entered and others where were there for a time,'' he said. ''We
also see that there have been seasons of kidnappings in Sinaloa,
Nayarit and Sonora (states) along with Baja California,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But a private expert on security against kidnappings expressed
reservations about the theory of a large national kidnapping gang.
Jon French of Problem Solvers said most Mexican kidnapping
organizations have about 12 members.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is common are local groups that reach an agreement with
(police) and really, if there is a network on a national level, it
would greatly surprise me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes said the organization has held captives as long as
seven months and sometimes send bits of a finger to relatives. It
charges ransoms in dollars and uses automatic weapons loaded with
explosive cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been absurd cases in which the kidnapper told the
relatives: 'Take your time gathering the ransom. I am going on
Easter vacation and I will call you when I return,''' Cervantes
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said anti-kidnap police from at least eight states are
questioning the suspects arrested over the weekend. He identified
the suspects as Carlos Rojas, Roberto and Adalberto Arellano, Justo
Mayor, Arturo Torres, Pedro Gutierrez, Andres Brito and Maria del
Rosario Peregrino.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have clarified the cases of a businessman from Jalisco
state who was kidnapped last year and whose body is being sought,''
Cervantes said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came after one of the suspects visited a hospital in
the Nayarit state capital of Tepic for treatment of a bullet wound.
He admitted he had been shot during a dispute over division of a
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes said the organization's roots extend back more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   He said officials have not detected links with police agencies.
Many kidnapping gangs in Mexico have been connected to current or
former policemen.

<HEADLINE> Whistleblower Waco Lawyer Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The former prosecutor who warned Attorney General
Janet Reno of a possible cover-up within her own department has
been told he is being targeted for prosecution by Waco Special
Counsel John C. Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   Former assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston's attorney, Michael
Kennedy, said his client has been threatened with indictments on
charges including obstruction of justice and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ''This law office and Mr. Johnston believe that he was unfairly
targeted for his frequent criticism of the U.S. government and for
blowing the whistle on the government's efforts to mislead the
public about the government's use of pyrotechnic devices against
the Branch Davidians,'' Kennedy said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Johnston reportedly stems from pretrial
notes he made in 1993 that show he may have been present at a
meeting where ''military rounds'' were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston didn't pass the notes to Danforth's office because he
was concerned they would be misconstrued and used to falsely
implicate him, two government sources told The Associated Press on
the condition of anonymity. Kennedy said Johnston wasn't at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Diltz, a spokeswoman for Danforth's office in St. Louis,
declined to comment on the reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who resigned from the U.S. Attorney's office in Waco
in January, was involved in the Branch Davidian case from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he helped draft the search warrant that the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms attempted to execute on Feb. 28 of
that year in a botched raid that turned into a gunbattle. Four
federal agents and six Davidians were killed. The following year,
Johnston helped to convict nine Davidians in the deaths of the
agents.

   Johnston has been at odds with Justice officials since he paved
the way for filmmaker Michael McNulty to review evidence sifted
from the ruins of the burned Branch Davidian compound. The compound
caught fire during a siege April 19, 1993, that ended a 51-day
standoff between the sect and federal agents. Sect leader David
Koresh and some 80 followers died inside.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty's discovery of a spent pyrotechnic tear gas canister
forced the FBI last year to recant its long-standing denials that
potentially incendiary devices had been fired at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face triggered investigations by Congress and the
special counsel appointment by Reno. Danforth was asked to review
government actions in the standoff and to determine if there was a
government cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston wrote Reno a letter on Aug. 30, 1999, stating that
government lawyers had known about the potentially incendiary
devices for years. Ten days later, he was pulled from the case. In
1993, Johnston also bypassed his supervisor and wrote to Reno about
the FBI's handling of the crime scene at the burned compound.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said in a written statement that Danforth's prosecutors
have tried to ''coerce'' him into pleading guilty over the past
year, The Washington Post reported in Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Danforth's prosecutors and investigators have lied to me,
made me false promises, cursed me with profanity and threatened to
throw me in jail,'' Johnston said in the statement. He said one
prosecutor told his law partner his life was over. ''Not my career,
mind you; my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth has twice brought Johnston before a federal grand jury
for questioning since his resignation in January.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Danforth absolved the government of all blame in the
blaze. A week before, an advisory jury hearing a $675 million
wrongful-death suit brought by surviving cult members and the
victims' families came to the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith on
Tuesday canceled a Sept. 18 hearing on whether federal agents shot
at Branch Davidians on the final day of the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was canceled because plaintiffs would not pay travel
costs for David Oxlee, an expert from England. Oxlee worked with
British firm Vector Data Systems Ltd., which examined infrared
images taken by an aerial FBI surveillance camera on the final day
of a 51-day standoff between federal agents and the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is expected to issue a final ruling on the issues
presented to the jury as well as the gunfire issue.

<HEADLINE> Hearing Halted in Terrorism Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- A judge has granted a motion to halt bond
proceedings in the case of a Palestinian immigrant being held as a
suspected terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Mazen Al-Najjar has been jailed for three years without charges
on the basis of secret evidence. His bond hearing Thursday was
halted so a federal can rule on the handling of that evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The former University of South Florida Arabic instructor is
seeking to be released while he appeals a deportation order. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested him in May 1997
after the order was issued.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether immigration Judge R. Kevin McHugh should
review the secret evidence before giving Al-Najjar's attorney,
David Cole, a chance to view a summary of it.
</P>
<P>
   Cole plans to ask U.S. District Judge Joan Lenard to order
McHugh to give him a copy of the summary before the evidence is
presented.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is information being presented behind closed doors,''
Cole told McHugh. ''It should not be considered unless the evidence
is necessary and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   McHugh scheduled a Sept. 18 conference call with the attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   None of the secret evidence against Al-Najjar has been
introduced. The INS showed classified material to McHugh in May
1997, prompting him to order Al-Najjar detained as a national
security threat.
</P>
<P>
   Lenard ruled in May that Al-Najjar's civil rights had been
violated and ordered the bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just another week after another week,'' Al-Najjar said
Thursday. ''I will complete reading another book, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   McHugh's latest decision came one day after a federal agent
acknowledged the government lacks any direct evidence that
Al-Najjar had raised money for a terror group or had helped
organize any violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, INS attorney Daniel Vara played a 13-minute
videotape of various gatherings organized by the Islamic Committee
for Palestine as evidence Al-Najjar had consorted with known
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Najjar was an officer in the committee and helped organize
the conferences, some of which were attended by leaders of the
terrorist group Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was compiled from nearly 500 hours of video seized in
1995, but INS agent William D. West was unable to offer any example
of Al-Najjar soliciting money for the Islamic Jihad or advocating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   At one gathering shown on the tape, a Muslim prayer leader
identified the charity as the ''active arm of the Islamic Jihad,''
but Al-Najjar was neither present at, nor organized, that event,
West acknowledged under cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said the government's case was an extension of its focus on
Al-Najjar's brother-in-law, Sami Al-Arian.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Arian incorporated the Islamic Committee for Palestine and
the World and Islam Studies Enterprise, a think tank associated
with the University of South Florida. Al-Najjar's primary work was
with the think tank, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Arian, a legal permanent resident, is free and has remained
in the courtroom since testifying earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Najjar is one of several immigrants held on secret evidence
nationwide. An Egyptian in New York, a Palestinian in New Jersey
and an Iraqi in California were released after rebutting terrorist
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Army Missile Battery Said on Alert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon put an Army Patriot antimissile
battery on alert Thursday for a possible deployment to Israel
because of concern that Iraq may decide to strike during the U.S.
presidential campaign, The Washington Post reports.
</P>
<P>
   The action is in response to concerns that Iraq may decide to
fire surface-to-surface missiles at Israel as the presidential
campaign gets into full swing after Labor Day, Monday, the
newspaper reported in its Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The unit on alert is the 69th Air Defense Artillery Brigade,
based near Frankfurt, Germany, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon did not immediately return a call seeking comment
late Thursday night. U.S. military officials in Europe could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot missile is a guided supersonic surface-to-air
missile designed to intercept enemy aircraft and missiles, and was
used extensively in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, 39 Iraqi Scud missiles were fired at Israel
during the Patriot's first deployment. The Patriots were mostly
unsuccessful in deterring Iraq's attacks, which damaged Tel Aviv
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the Pentagon sent the missiles to Israel to
head off any possible attacks while Iraq refused to cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors. The crisis culminated in a 70-hour air war
against Baghdad. No Iraqi missiles were fired at Israel during that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials did not say whether the United States was
acting out of a general concern or was provoked by hard evidence,
the Post said, though in the past Iraq President Saddam Hussein has
provoked confrontations during sensitive moments.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British warplanes have had many confrontations with
Iraq, patrolling over northern and southern Iraq in ''no-fly''
zones set up after the war to protect Kurdish and Shiite minorities
from the Iraqi military. Iraq maintains the zones violate its
sovereignty and has been challenging the patrols since December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an official Iraqi newspaper said that U.S. jets
bombed a village in southern Iraq, injuring a child and two others.
The paper quoted a statement by a military spokesman that Iraqi air
defenses hit one of the planes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials confirmed coalition aircraft struck Iraq on
Wednesday, but said they targeted an air-defense command post and
anti-aircraft artillery sites. The officials said the planes
returned safely.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Pilot Conversation Released  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- His supersonic jet aflame and two engines failing,
Christian Marty, captain of the doomed Concorde flight, tried to
gain speed for an emergency landing less than two minutes after
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Concorde zero ... 4590, You have flames. You have flames
behind you,'' the control tower warned.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later came Marty's chilling word: ''Too late.''
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report on the crash posted on the Internet
Thursday by French investigators provides a graphic account of the
final moments of Air France flight 4590 -- a chillingly professional
cockpit exchange that indicates the control tower gave the first
alert of trouble but that the crew was powerless to change their
aircraft's course.
</P>
<P>
   The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of
commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German
tourists, and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-page report by France's Accident and Inquiry Office, the
BEA, underscores that the crew was unaware, then unable, to correct
a trajectory toward disaster. The flaming plane slammed into a
small hotel, decimating it, and was partially embedded in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both France and Britain -- the only countries with supersonic
fleets -- last month withdrew the Concorde's airworthiness
certification while the investigation proceeds. The BEA, which
draws no conclusions in its report, planned a news conference
Friday. Its final report is not expected for at least a year. A
judicial investigation also is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives a second-by-second description of events.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:43 p.m. The sleek supersonic had just lifted its needle
nose toward the heavens after roaring down the runway at
breathtaking speed.
</P>
<P>
   Seven seconds after the message from the control tower at
Charles de Gaulle airport, the chief navigator confirmed,
''Breakdown eng... breakdown engine two.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cut engine two,'' he said, four seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing. But
Marty could be heard saying: ''Too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The control tower was trying to coax the Concorde back to runway
26, where it had taken off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Negative. We're trying for Le Bourget,'' a small nearby
airport, the copilot responded. It was 4:44 p.m. and 22 seconds.
There were some sounds similar to exertion. Nine seconds later all
was silent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crew had neither the means to be aware of the nature of
the fire nor to fight it,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report stresses that it was the destruction of a forward
tire on the left landing gear -- gashed by a 16-inch stray piece of
metal on the runway -- that likely triggered a chain of events
dooming the flight. Yet there was no indication from the transcript
of cockpit conversation that the crew was aware of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's burning badly, and I'm not sure it's coming from the
engine,'' said someone in the control tower. ''Gong'' sounds were
periodically recorded inside the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that heavy chunks of rubber from the burst
Goodyear tire damaged the fuel tanks located in the Concorde's
delta-shaped wings.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes had elapsed from the time the tire was
gashed to the time the plane crashed, the report said. The flames
appeared less than a minute after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The highly technical report contains simple, telling
photographs, like that of a nearly 9-pound tire part with a nearly
13-inch gash, the bent metal strip that destroyed the tire and the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   After the tire was gashed, a fire appeared under the left wing,
the report said, followed by problems on engines No. 1 and 2. ''The
plane can neither gain altitude nor accelerate. The crew notes that
the landing gears cannot be lifted.'' Then the motor stops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Concorde has crashed near Le Bourget ...,'' the control
tower said at 4:45 and 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, the control tower sent out a general message:
''For all planes listening, I'll get back to you in a minute. We're
going to pull ourselves together and restart takeoffs.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Searches Wen Ho Lee's Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE ROCK, N.M. (AP) -- FBI agents searched the home of Wen Ho
Lee on Thursday as the former Los Alamos National Laboratory
scientist accused of security breaches waited in jail for his
expected release Friday on bail.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 FBI personnel spent a little more than 12 hours
searching the home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did complete the tasks mandated by the court order, and we
feel we did a thorough and professional job,'' agent Doug Beldon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hollander, one of Lee's attorneys, kept watch on the
search from inside Lee's home. She said agents had not seized any
evidence that she knew of.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're looking for any evidence of these crimes, the
allegedly missing seven tapes,'' she said, referring to unsecure
computer tapes containing restricted data that Lee was accused of
downloading. The defense insists the tapes were destroyed, but the
government wants proof.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole point of this search was so the government could be
assured that before Wen Ho Lee was released that there was nothing
(of a sensitive scientific nature) in the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is accused of downloading restricted material about
nuclear weapons to unsecure computers, as well. He has been jailed
since Dec. 10, charged with 59 counts, and could face life in
prison if convicted. Trial is set Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis emphasized in court
Tuesday that until those tapes are located or proven destroyed,
there can be no adequate security measure for Lee's release.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker on Tuesday ordered that Lee be
released at noon Friday on $1 million bond. An appeal could still
delay Lee's release, but there was no word on any such filing
Thursday. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver would
have to issue an emergency stay of Parker's order.
</P>
<P>
   Parker proposed what he described as ''highly restrictive
terms'' for Lee's release, including a search of the home, and
ordered prosecution and defense attorneys to negotiate the final
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The final conditions were not made public, but the judge's
proposal included limits on communication, travel, home visits and
required removal of all electronic communication devices except for
one telephone line. Lee would have to remain under electronic
monitoring and wear an electronic bracelet. His mail also could be
inspected. Lee's neighbors are to serve as his custodians during
his release.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the area around Lee's home was cordoned off by
police cars and cones. People were going in and out of the home,
some carrying clipboards.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lee's neighbors, Nora Aubert, said: ''I want it to be
over. I want them to release him or do something.''

<HEADLINE> No. 5 Miami 61, McNeese St. 14  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Ken Dorsey threw three touchdown passes and Santana
Moss gained 204 all-purpose yards as fifth-ranked Miami beat
Division I-AA McNeese State 61-14 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes totaled 630 yards, most of it coming in the first
half. Dorsey, Moss and many other starters sat out much of the
second half while their backups picked up playing time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good start to what should be Miami's most productive
season in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In Butch Davis' five seasons at Miami, the Hurricanes have as
many losses (19) as they had in the 12 years before he arrived.
They also won four national championships in that span.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring NCAA sanctions and 31 lost scholarships between
1995 and 1997, the program has been rebuilt and reloaded with
talent at every position.
</P>
<P>
   It showed, especially against the overmatched Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored on six of eight first-half possessions, including
five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey, a sophomore, hit Reggie Wayne on a pair of perfectly
thrown fade passes in the same corner of the end zone in the first
quarter. Dorsey also hit Daryl Jones on a 23-yard pass in the
second to give Miami a 34-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey completed 17 of 29 passes for 248 yards, winning for the
fourth time in as many starts. In his four starts, Dorsey is
81-for-120 for 966 yards with 12 TD passes and just one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of weapons surrounding him, like Moss.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy 5-foot-10 receiver returned a punt 77 yards late in
the first quarter, putting the 'Canes ahead 20-7. He picked up the
bouncing kick at the 23, cut right toward the sideline, turned
upfield and sprinted untouched into the end zone. He got two key
blocks on the play, one from Andre King and another from Al Blades.
</P>
<P>
   Moss added a 75 yard run on an end around, skirting outside the
defense and cutting back across the field for the score. Moss
finished with 35 yards receiving, 75 yards rushing and 94 return
yards.
</P>
<P>
   He sat out the second half with a sore right foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (0-1) answered Miami's opening-drive score with a
nine play, 65-yard drive that they kept alive by converting a
fourth-and-3 play at the Hurricanes' 36. Jessie Burton scored two
plays later, breaking three tackles en route to 21-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   McNeese State added a late touchdown, converting a Miami
turnover into a 27-yard scoring pass from Slade Nagle to Jermaine
Martin. The Cowboys tallied 409 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But they just couldn't stop Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Canes added two late touchdowns. Ethnic Sands connected
with Andre Johnson on a 32-yard pass play, and Clinton Portis
outran the defense 82 yards for the final score.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 6, Orioles 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Juan Encarnacion singled in the tiebreaking run
in the eighth inning and Deivi Cruz homered as the Detroit Tigers
capped their most successful month of the season by defeating the
Baltimore Orioles 6-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Macias drove in two runs for the Tigers, who went 18-10 in
August to get back to the .500 mark (66-66) after a 9-23 start.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle drove in the lone run for the Orioles, who wasted
another fine effort by Mike Mussina. Baltimore has scored three
runs or less in 18 of his 29 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   After Mussina left, Brad Ausmus hit a leadoff single in the
eighth off Mike Trombley (4-4). Pinch-hitter Wendell Magee greeted
Buddy Groom with a single and Encarnacion followed with a sharp
single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pulled away with a four-run ninth that included a
two-run triple by Macias and an RBI single by Encarnacion.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler, vying to win his sixth straight start for
Detroit, allowed one run and five hits in 6 2-3 innings. He had a
season-high eight strikeouts but failed to win for the first time
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler was replaced by Danny Patterson (5-1), who struck out
Melvin Mora with runners at second and third and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina gave up one run and five hits in seven innings, striking
out seven. The right-hander has allowed just one earned run in his
last three starts but has only one win in that span.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles put runners on second and third with one out in the
third before Moehler struck out Delino DeShields and Belle,
beginning a stretch in which he retired eight straight batters.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz broke the scoreless duel in the fifth with his eighth
homer, a solo drive that landed two rows into the left-field seats.
It ended Mussina's string of 20 innings without allowing an earned
run.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore pulled even in the sixth when Mora hit a leadoff
double, took third on a bunt and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Belle. It was the Orioles' first run for Mussina in 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Despite the loss, Baltimore won the season series 6-4. ...
The Orioles completed a 4-3 homestand and begin a season-long
13-game road trip Friday in Cleveland. ... Moehler had a 1.15 ERA
in two starts against Baltimore this year. ... Mussina recorded his
1,500th career strikeout in the sixth, fanning Encarnacion on three
pitches.

<HEADLINE> United States 99, Canada 70  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Despite ''O Canada'' somehow turning into
Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy,'' Vince Carter and his American teammates
came up with a virtuoso performance.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who works in Canada at his regular job, scored 29 points
as the U.S. Olympic team won its first exhibition game with ease,
99-70 over Canada on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The low point for the Americans came several minutes before the
opening tipoff when an arena employee pushed the wrong button when
it was time for the national anthems to be played. After the
Beethoven number played for several seconds, the volume was lowered
and the song faded out -- much to the disgust of the Canadian
basketball federation.
</P>
<P>
   Canada managed to keep it close for only a few minutes before
the Americans took charge with a 16-0 run for a 27-10 lead. After
that, the best action came from Carter as he took on the bold Rowan
Barrett, who dared to talk a little trash.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen finished with 18 points, Alonzo Mourning had 13 and
Kevin Garnett added 10 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team was all thumbs in the first few moments,
committing turnovers on is first two possessions -- both on entry
passes to Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Canada broke the Americans' press and tied it at 6 on a dunk by
Peter Guarasci, but Allan Houston put the U.S. team ahead for good
on a 3-pointer from the right corner just over 3&AMP;frac12; minutes into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 11-10 before the U.S. team broke the game open
with its 16-0 run, the highlight of which was a fast break ending
with four touch passes and a dunk by Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning dunked on the Americans' next possession, too, and
Jason Kidd then attempted an alley-oop pass off the backboard that
Garnett couldn't convert. It was 27-10 before Canada ended the run
on a jumper by Andrew Mavis.
</P>
<P>
   Carter didn't check into the game until more than 10 minutes had
elapsed. He converted his first two shots, putting back an airball
by Steve Smith for a 29-12 lead and then hitting a 3-pointer. Much
to Carter's amusement, Barrett answered with a 3-pointer and then
told Carter about it.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett later prevented Carter from dunking, slapping the ball
out of his hands on a fast break, but the byplay between the two
stayed lighthearted. Barrett led Canada with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett provided a light moment five minutes into the second
half when he got down on his knees and crawled up behind Todd
McCullough, ready to pounce if an inbounds pass was thrown him way.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett never got to spring his surprise, but he was able to
leap high for an alley-oop dunk less than a minute later to give
the Americans a 62-39 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Canada pulled within 15 with 11&AMP;frac12; minutes left, but the U.S. team
answered with a 10-0 run including five points from Carter to
restore a large comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   Carter didn't dunk until 7:30 remained, and when it finally
happened it brought the loudest roar of the night from the crowd of
7,355 at the University of Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Wisconsin 19, Western Mich. 7  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Michael Bennett rushed for 128 yards and a
touchdown as No. 4 Wisconsin survived the suspension of five
starters in a lackluster 19-7 victory over Western Michigan on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before kickoff, Wisconsin said 26 players had been
suspended from one to three games for receiving unadvertised
discounts at a shoe store. Eleven players served all or part of
their suspensions against Western Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In the Badgers' first game since the graduation of NCAA career
rushing leader Ron Dayne, Wisconsin's offense struggled to produce
the methodical drives once led by the Heisman Trophy winner.
Bennett got 30 carries but rarely broke into the Broncos' defensive
backfield, and Wisconsin's passing game was erratic.
</P>
<P>
   But Wisconsin's underwhelming performance can't be attributed
entirely to the suspensions. Only four Badgers expected to play a
significant amount were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Chris Chambers -- who's injured anyway -- receiver/kick
returner Nick Davis and offensive tackle Ben Johnson were the only
offensive starters out. All-American cornerback Jamar Fletcher and
linebacker Bryson Thompson were the missing defensive starters.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin didn't get an offensive touchdown until a 68-yard
drive capped by Bennett's 8-yard run around the left end with 9:31
to play. Thirteen seconds later, defensive end Ross Kolodziej
sacked Broncos quarterback Jeff Welsh in the end zone for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Hunt scored on an 89-yard punt return in the second quarter
for the Badgers, who entered the season with the highest preseason
ranking in school history. Hunt, a junior playing in his first
game, made the second-longest punt return in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin quarterback Brooks Bollinger frequently scrambled but
found no one open. Bollinger, the Big Ten freshman of the year last
season, was 6-for-11 for 96 yards while improving to 9-0 as a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Western Michigan's wide-open passing offense capitalized on
Fletcher's absence. Welsh, in his first start since replacing Tim
Lester, was 20-for-39 for 243 yards and was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's first drive in the post-Dayne era ended on downs
when Bennett was hit for a 3-yard loss by Jared Pike at Western
Michigan's 29. But linebacker Ben Herbert recovered a fumble
moments later, and the Badgers scored on a 21-yard field goal by
Vitaly Pisetsky.
</P>
<P>
   The game then descended into a turf war, with neither team able
to gain significant yardage. Wisconsin's offense even heard a
smattering of boos when it failed to move the ball midway through
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos trailed 10-7 at halftime after Welsh capped an
80-yard drive with a 2-yard TD pass to Mobolaji Afariogun with 1:54
left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers' opener was played on one of the hottest days of the
year in Wisconsin, with the school flashing messages on the
scoreboard urging fans to drink plenty of water.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin extended its winning streak to nine games,
third-longest in the country.

<HEADLINE> US Jumpers Offended by Racial Slur  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian Olympic Committee president
John Coates said Friday he will apologize to the United States team
over racial slurs by Australian long jumper Jai Taurima.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said he would also talk to Taurima regarding his comments
in a training camp in Brisbane that have upset several black
American athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Taurima called the American long jumpers ''dribblers'' and said
''you can pretty much knock out all the dark guys'' in Sydney's
cool conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Leading American high jumpers Melvin Lister and Savante
Stringfellow are both black.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said the comments were against the team values set up by
the Australian Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll give the chef de mission of the U.S. team a ring and tell
her that on behalf of our team I apologize,'' Coates told
Australian Broadcasting Corp., radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the comments are accurately reported they are at odds with
the team values to which all our Olympians aspire. We should
respect our competitors, there should be no racial jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I intend to talk to Jai to remind him that this is the basis
of which our team is going to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Lister, winner of the U.S. Olympic trials, and Stringfellow, the
U.S. indoor champion and NCAA outdoor champion, were furious when
told of Taurima's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand him having the confidence to beat us -- but to
come at us racially,'' Lister said. ''I want him to know I wasn't
satisfied with the comments he made. All that can do is cause
animosity between the U.S. and Australia.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Suspends Wisconsin Players  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The NCAA suspended 26 Wisconsin football
players Thursday for one to three games for receiving unadvertised
discounts at a shoe store, forcing the Badgers to bench 11 players
for their opener.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 suspended for the No. 4 Badgers' game with Western
Michigan on Thursday night included starting receivers Chris
Chambers and Nick Davis, cornerback Jamar Fletcher, offensive
lineman Ben Johnson and linebacker Bryson Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 26, including Fletcher, Davis, Johnson and
Chambers, were suspended for three games for receiving benefits of
more than $500, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 players, including running back Michael Bennett,
defensive tackle Wendell Bryant, cornerback Mike Echols and
Thompson, were suspended for one game and ordered to do 12 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand by my kids,'' Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez said after
the Badgers' 19-7 victory over Western Michigan. ''People need to
understand that there was no intent to do any wrong. ... I really
didn't think our guys did anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't be more proud of a staff and a group of players to
respond the way they did. That's got to be unprecedented to go
through what we went through today. This may be the longest day
I've ever had to go through in coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers' suspension could be an especially tough blow to the
Badgers. The team's leading receiver from last season was already
sidelined by a stress fracture in his right foot that was expected
to keep him out until at least the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   School officials aren't sure if he will be allowed to serve the
suspension while injured, meaning he could miss more than half the
season. Alvarez said the issue hadn't been resolved, but said
jokingly: ''Chris is walking tonight. ... I didn't say he was
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA ordered all 26 players to serve the suspensions within
the first four games of the season. The other six suspended for
Thursday's game were: Delante McGrew, George Pratt, Ryan Simmons,
Chuck Smith, Stephon Watson and Scott Wille.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you have tremendous disappointment. You have to feel
for them,'' Wisconsin athletic director Pat Richter said. ''We felt
this was not warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who said he never expected his players would be
suspended until meeting with the NCAA 10 days ago, hasn't
completely decided when the remaining suspensions will be served.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions stem from reports last month that members of the
football and men's basketball teams may have received special
credit arrangements at The Shoe Box in Black Earth, Wis., that were
not available to other clients.
</P>
<P>
   The players suspended for Thursday's game were available for
comment afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those guys we lost, we love them to death, but they're got to
do their time, and we've got to move on and play,'' Badgers
defensive end Wendell Bryant said. ''We take pride when we play in
Camp Randall. That's something we hold sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 21 players, including starting quarterback Brooks
Bollinger, were not suspended but were ordered to perform 24 hours
of community service for the discounts they received.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer player Wynter Pero was suspended for two games
and ordered to do 24 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   All will be required to repay the discounts they received.
</P>
<P>
   The school also investigated allegations that some athletes may
have exchanged university-issued shoes for merchandise but found no
evidence of that so far, said Melany Newby, vice chancellor for
legal and executive affairs.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the Wisconsin State Journal detailed purchases by
eight members of the Badgers' Final Four men's basketball team and
14 players from the Rose Bowl champion football team. The paper
reported players received discounts of 25 percent to 40 percent and
interest-free credit.
</P>
<P>
   The university and NCAA still have to review the eligibility of
winter athletes, who also could face penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA notified the university Monday that 81 fall athletes
would be ineligible in various capacities. Richter said the
university appealed the finding, and the NCAA then decided to knock
down the number of athletes required to serve suspensions and pay
reparations to 48.
</P>
<P>
   Richter said the university proposed lighter sanctions when they
made their initial report to the NCAA, and many of the players told
NCAA officials they did not know they had violated any rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a shock to them,'' Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro confirmed the suspensions but would
not comment specifically on the infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe Box owner Steve Schmitt said Thursday he talked to
university officials several times about the discounts he offered
players, which he said are extended to all his regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt has men's basketball season tickets and has donated
money to the university in the past, which would qualify him as a
booster under NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   Newby said the university's investigation was continuing and the
school had not made a recommendation to the NCAA whether the
violations constitute a major or secondary violation. But the
players' transgressions individually were ruled to be secondary.
</P>
<P>
   If the purchases constitute a major rules violation, it would be
the third such infraction within the last decade for the
university.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling program was put on probation in 1994 for improper
use of booster funds that included impermissible benefits to
athletes, a major rules violation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the NCAA found the athletic department had committed
a major rules infraction because coaches and staff members received
reimbursement for expenses from a boosters fund without approval
from the chancellor. That probation was scheduled to end in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NCAA Committee on Infractions did not penalize the
university under repeat violator rules last year, partly because
Wisconsin self-reported the violations.

<HEADLINE> US Absent at UN Parliament Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States' absence from the first
meeting of parliamentary leaders of more than 140 countries is
being viewed as a sign of Washington's growing isolation from
global politics.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding officers of parliaments from China, Russia, Britain,
France and dozens of other countries flew thousands of miles to
attend the meeting. But U.S. Congress members, who had the shortest
distance to travel, were conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who presides over the Senate, was
invited to the three-day conference that ends Friday. So were
Senate Majority leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sent regrets that he would be campaigning for the
presidency, but Lott and Hastert never responded, said Anders
Johnsson, secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU),
which organized the conference with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert went to Colombia on Wednesday with President Clinton and
had campaign commitments, spokesman John Feehery told The
Associated Press. Lott's press office never responded to queries
about his absence.
</P>
<P>
   The short shrift given to the conference by the congressional
leaders mirrors the change in the U.S. attitude toward the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, an organization that encourages
cooperation among the world's legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was a founding member of the IPU in 1889 and
played a prominent role until the mid-1990s, when congressional
leaders cut back their participation, Johnsson said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which is assessed 15 percent of the IPU's
budget, also cut back payments. It paid nothing in 1998 and 1999
and now owes more than $2.4 million, according to IPU records. The
United States also owes more than $1.5 billion to the United
Nations, according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Burg, speaker of Israel's Knesset, said Thursday that he
discussed the IPU a few weeks ago with Hastert, who is considering
advocating a U.S. pullout from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do hope that America won't withdraw,'' Burg said. ''I do not
think it is good for the well-being of the world that the United
States of America is isolating itself from the political affairs
and the political flow of events of the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has an interest in keeping its staunchest ally in global
forums, especially at this critical time in the Middle East peace
process, Burg explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Leaving Israel alone in this arena, I believe, stands against
the best interest of the United States of America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnsson said the end of the Cold War may have led ''to a
lessened interest in international cooperation'' by the United
States. He said that members of the U.S. Congress do want to be
active, but apparently not the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Ney, an Ohio Republican who was part of a U.S.
congressional team that met informally with the speaker of the
Iranian parliament Wednesday night, said he couldn't understand the
American absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should participate,'' he said. ''I'm going to take it up
with the speaker. This is wrong we are not participating.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parliamentary participants also are miffed at the Clinton
Administration's decision to ban the speakers of the Cuban and
Yugoslav parliaments from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was so angered at the refusal to grant visas to
Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, and Srdja
Bozovic, president of the Yugoslav Federal Assembly's Chamber of
Republics, that it endorsed a statement Wednesday calling
Washington's action ''contrary to the principle underlying the
functioning of parliaments.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United
States does not have an obligation to the IPU to issue visas. But
Russia's Foreign Ministry and many visiting members of parliament
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that if a country agrees to allow an international
organization to meet on its territory, this does not give it a
right to determine the participants,'' said Lord Russell Johnston,
president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

<HEADLINE> Greek Church Fights ID Card Changes  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's powerful Orthodox Christian
Church is taking its fight against the Socialist government back to
the streets in a battle its fiery leader says pits the ''sons of
darkness'' against ''the sons of light.''
</P>
<P>
   The church hopes it can force the government to revoke a
decision eliminating the religion entry from state identity cards.
It would like to collect nearly 5 million signatures -- about half
the total population -- to force a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the showdown resonates far beyond just ID cards. It
represents an important crossroads for Greece: whether the nation
can adopt European Union norms or remain under the influence of
clergymen who are highly suspicious of the EU and the influence of
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue our struggle for Greece to remain a Christian
state, as we knew it and want to live it,'' Archbishop
Christodoulos, the leader of the church, said this week during a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In June, he led huge rallies against the
ID changes in Athens and the northern port of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
   While most Greeks vacationed in August, church printing presses
worked overtime churning out millions of ballots that will be
carried door-to-door as part of their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos planned to formally open the signature drive
Friday, the first day of the ecclesiastic new year. It will end on
March 25, the day Greece celebrates its early 19th century war of
independence from Ottoman Turkish rule.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, however, the new IDs should be in circulation. The
government said it will begin issuing the new cards in October.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Costas Simitis has said the ID issue is closed for the
government, arguing it abolished the religion entry because it ran
counter to Greece's modernization efforts and European outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and the country's religious minorities,
including Jews, Muslims and Roman Catholics, also welcomed the
decision. They claimed the old ID cards allowed religious
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The government fears the church's signature campaign could
deeply divide Greece, where more than 97 percent of the native-born
population is baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church but opinion
polls show a near even split on the ID issue.
</P>
<P>
   But many Orthodox church leaders are wary of the government's
drive to bring Greece into the mainstream of the EU. They see it as
a threat to the Christian Orthodox character of the nation and
possibly the stirrings of an eventual separation of church and
state in Greece, where Greek Orthodoxy is the official religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This war is being waged between the sons of darkness and the
sons of light. We believe wholeheartedly that we belong to the sons
of light,'' Christodoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars see it a different way: the values of the Western
European Enlightenment versus Eastern mysticism rooted in
Byzantium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boundaries between the church and state are enlightened
European notions, they are not part of the medieval heritage or the
eastern way of thinking,'' said Nicholas Constas, an assistant
professor of theology at Harvard Divinity School. ''The state
became religiously neutral and religion was relegated to ... the
province of the soul. That's not the Orthodox way of looking at
it.''

<HEADLINE> Candidate Up After Labor Day Wins  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential candidate significantly ahead
in the polls around Labor Day has won every election for the last
50 years -- which offers little insight into what will happen this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Few White House races have been this tight, with Republican
George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore virtually tied in many polls
and the stage set for a very close race.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of evidence that after Labor Day, the polls
start to solidify,'' said James Campbell, a political scientist
from Buffalo, N.Y., and author of ''The American Campaign.''
''People who are responding to polls are responding with a
preference they're more definite about.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Labor Day has less and less significance as a starting
point for the fall campaigns, analysts say, because presidential
candidates seldom take time off between the party conventions and
the holiday any more. But polls need a week or two to settle after
the conventions, and that tends to happen by late August or early
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you get away from the conventions, you get a pretty good
idea of how the race is going,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the
Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The close relationship of September's polls to November's
election is sometimes coincidental because the margin between the
candidates often varies widely from the time these surveys are
conducted and the election. For example:
</P>
<P>
   -- Richard Nixon led Hubert Humphrey by 12 points in September
1968; the race closed to less than a percentage point by the
election.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jimmy Carter was almost 10 points ahead of President Ford in
September 1976; the race closed to 50-48 on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   -- Carter and Ronald Reagan were very close after Labor Day 1980,
though Reagan won by 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign points to 1960 as the year most resembling 2000.
John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were very close that September,
and the election also was very close.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's operation likes 1988, when then-Vice President George
Bush, father of this year's GOP nominee, pulled ahead after his
late August convention and went on to comfortably defeat Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's campaign has followed the 1988 pattern so far,
veterans of the '88 campaign say the resemblance is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of things are different this year,'' said pollster Bob
Teeter, who was Bush's deputy campaign manager in 1988. ''Dukakis
was a poor candidate, and neither Bush nor Gore is as bad a
candidate.'' And Teeter noted Reagan was more personally popular at
the end of his term than President Clinton, who has high
professional but low personal approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Dukakis campaign has become a model of how not to approach
the period between the conventions and Labor Day. He went home to
Massachusetts for several days and did not respond aggressively as
the Bush campaign took charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't take any time off, what I did do -- and it was
probably a mistake -- I wanted to get back home and spend two or
three days in my own state, reconnecting,'' said Dukakis, a former
Massachusetts governor. ''My great mistake was not to have a
well-thought-out strategy for dealing with his attack campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference to Labor Day as the traditional starting point for
the general election campaign dates back to an era when
presidential candidates took a break after the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Polls after Labor Day are still subject to shifts of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University political scientist Robert Shapiro noted
that ''common sense would suggest an economic downturn or a foreign
policy crisis could have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who thinks a lead in September is predictive of the
election should remember the results from 1948, which changed
history, modern polling methods and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   President Truman trailed Thomas Dewey 47 percent to 39 percent
in September 1948. Two months later, the newly re-elected Truman
got to grin broadly for a now-famous photo of him holding up a
newspaper with the mistaken headline -- ''Dewey Defeats Truman.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Plays High Card Early  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Getting personal, Republicans have come out
with an ad attacking Al Gore's credibility in a gambit that
exploits his greatest perceived vulnerability while betraying worry
about the course of George W. Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to attack Gore so directly this early in the
stretch to the Nov. 7 presidential election was widely seen by
those who study campaign conduct as a sign of nervousness about how
Bush is doing. That did not foreclose the possibility the ad would
score.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political version of investing in junk bonds,'' said
political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, ''a dramatic and risky move,
which has the potential for a significant return.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party ad accuses Democrat Gore of ''reinventing
himself,'' making the point with two examples -- his visit to a
Buddhist temple in 1996 at which money was illegally raised, played
against his recent vow to clean up the campaign finance system, and
his boast that ''I took the initiative in creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman's voice responds: ''Yeah, and I invented the remote
control, too. Another round of this and I'll sell my television.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic operatives quickly put on hold plans to release a
hard-hitting ad attack on Bush's record as Texas governor, hoping
instead that they could encourage a public backlash against
negative tactics by the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The value of negative campaigning is in dispute, with polls
suggesting people don't like it but with much evidence existing,
too, that it helps voters make informed decisions when done in
certain ways.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who come down differently on that question agreed
Thursday, however, that it's not easy for Bush to pull off because
he has made so much of his intention to run an upbeat campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bush is perceived to be the negative one, the personal
chemistry and goodwill will start to dissipate,'' said Alan
Brinkley, a Columbia University historian.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ad is by the Republican National Committee, not the
Bush campaign, the candidate himself has not necessarily
relinquished his claim to the high road.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinction between party and candidate sponsorship of
ads is lost on viewers. In any event, the campaign has a direct
influence: Last week, Bush had the RNC pull a personal attack ad
against Gore before it aired that quoted the vice president deeply
out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Bush adviser Ralph Reed said the new ad is in response to a
Democratic advertising assault that he says has grossly distorted
Bush's positions and record. An ad that shows ''the heart of the
matter is Al Gore's credibility'' can counter all such distortions,
he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is not going to be a punching bag,'' he said.
''The counterpunch is to demonstrate that there is a credibility
gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Blanchard of Eastern Kentucky University, who studies
negative campaigning, said attacks risk hurting the candidate who
makes them.
</P>
<P>
   He said George Bush, the candidate's father, succeeded with a
similar attack strategy at a comparable stage of the 1988
presidential campaign in portraying Democrat Michael Dukakis as
weak on crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to think that those kinds of tactics were not
appropriate for August or September, but ever since the 1988
election ... we're not so sure,'' Blanchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who studies campaign ads at the
Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania, says voters value negative campaigning when it helps
them discern differences on issues or casts light on personal
drawbacks relevant to someone's performance in office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's credibility is fair game, she said, but in her view the
ad misfires.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tone of that ad is sarcastic, not humorous,'' she said.
''And sarcasm doesn't play well with undecided voters.''

<HEADLINE> Elian To Start 2nd Grade in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- With government-supplied school uniforms,
it's hard for Cuban elementary students to stand out in the crowd
on the first day of class; yet one of them, blending in among the
second-graders, is Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   As the school year opened Friday, photographers in the boy's
hometown of Cardenas prepared for what many hope will be the final
stakeout for Elian -- possibly the world's most-photographed
6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   After this, school officials hope he will be allowed some
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's schoolmates have been encouraged to treat the shipwreck
survivor ''just like anybody else.'' The Cuban government also has
made it clear that reporters won't be allowed to swarm the boy on
the first day of school, or thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we have been successful at preserving the greatest
intimacy possible for this family that has suffered so much,''
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the seven-month custody battle between Elian's father and
his Miami relatives drew to a close with the boy's return to Cuba
on June 28, he has lived quietly, away from the public eye. His
first day at school will be his first public appearance in months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't be hanging over all over him. The poor kid has had a lot
of problems, and everything should be as normal as possible for him
now,'' said Luanda Leon, recounting advice given at a meeting this
week among teachers and parents of Elian's 27 new classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Leon's 7-year-old son, Ariel Cisneros, will be in Elian's class
at the high-ceilinged old school in the coastal city of Cardenas,
about 90 miles east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Workmen this week spruced up the Marcelo Salado school, named
after a revolutionary youth leader. They put in new toilets and
replaced bricks in the building, which holds about 900 students.
</P>
<P>
   The school will have watercoolers, TV sets and videocassette
recorders in every other classroom -- a wealth of equipment found in
some, but not all, Cuban grade schools.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast
on Thanksgiving after his mother and 10 other Cubans drowned when
their boat sank during an attempt to reach the United States. He
was returned to his father after U.S. authorities seized him from
the home of his Miami relatives during a nighttime raid in April.
</P>
<P>
   Since his homecoming, the family reportedly has been living at a
Havana boarding school, away from the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been able to enjoy some vacations in privacy and with his
family,'' Perez Roque said. ''I think I can say that things have
gone well for Elian Gonzalez.''
</P>
<P>
   Snippets of video broadcast on state-run television have shown
Elian playing with friends, riding in a small boat with his father
and swimming among dolphins near an undisclosed beach location. He
was also shown making up schoolwork, practicing cursive letters.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to his return to Cuba had predicted Fidel Castro
would parade the boy around as a poster child for communism. The
Cuban leader appears to have made a conscious effort not to give
his political enemies ammunition to use against him.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Castro met the boy, whose plight absorbed the island
nation, no photographs of the meeting were published and no
videotaped images were shown.
</P>
<P>
   Elian himself was nowhere in sight this week. Plainclothes
guards stood outside his family's home to discourage reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another Elian here, explains Yolaine Betancourt:
her 7-year-old son, Elian Betancourt, who was playing with toy cars
on the floor of a neighbor's home in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for this other little Elian not to make a fuss
the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very excited about meeting him,'' Betancourt said of her
son's famous namesake. ''My son's going to look at him like
something out of this world!''

<HEADLINE> Tight Race Expected for Bush  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- While ''there's a campaign ebb and flow''
that lately has run against George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee is where he expected to be at Labor Day, in a
tight contest with Vice President Al Gore, his chief strategist
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not doing anything different,'' said Karl Rove. ''This
is going to be a tight race. So what's new?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was campaigning Friday in Texarkana, Ark., and Lafayette,
La., concentrating on education, his chosen topic during a week of
campaign distractions. They included a ruling by a federal judge
demanding improvements in his state's handling of medical benefits
for low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, political director for Bush, acknowledged in an interview
Thursday that Gore has gained in the polls since the Democratic
National Convention, but noted he had publicly forecast that would
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, there's a campaign ebb and flow and this guy's had a
couple of good weeks,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   He juggled incoming calls on three telephones, stopped to shred
a sheaf of campaign papers left over from an earlier meeting and
called out instructions to aides as he said there's no sense of
alarm over the state of the race, in which Bush had held hefty
leads in the public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the boost Gore got from his convention is ebbing. ''We
fully expected this to tighten up and we expected to be behind in a
number of polls on Labor Day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the situation will level out and he doubted that
anything, including campaign debates still to be negotiated, would
vault either candidate far ahead of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see it going up and down, but I don't see any dramatic
movement for anybody,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   That could make for an election that will turn on organization
and party efforts to get out the vote, especially in the swing
states of the Midwest, Rove said. He said the Bush campaign is
geared up to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said he isn't concerned about voter judgments of Bush based
on critiques and TV jokes over words he mispronounces or misuses,
or over the limited pace of his campaigning so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wouldn't be where he is if people did not think he was up
to the job,'' Rove said. He said they will have ample opportunity
to judge him for themselves because Bush will campaign more
aggressively after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key is when do you turn it on,'' he said. ''We're going to
power up.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's campaign was a two-stop affair, with Bush winding up at
his ranch near Crawford. He is receiving a CIA national security
briefing there Saturday, standard treatment for presidential
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed as the work of ''an activist, liberal judge'' the
federal court ruling that Texas is not complying with a 1996 court
commitment to improve health care services for low-income children
under Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing everything in our power to take care of the
disadvantaged children of the state of Texas,'' Bush said Thursday
as he campaigned in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Texas state plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the federal government has refused to grant waivers
that would have made it easier to help needy children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason they're pounding me is because this is an
administration of which Al Gore is a part that has been unable to
lead,'' he said. ''They're trying to go on the offensive on an
issue on which they are extremely vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said
the ruling was troubling and that Bush ''has an obligation to
explain'' it.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee had planned to start airing TV
commercials criticizing the Texas record in Medicaid, but put them
on hold, in favor of complaining about a new Republican ad the Gore
camp denounces as negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   That one, to be broadcast in 17 states beginning as early as
Friday, challenges Gore's credibility with an image of his
appearance at a 1996 event at a Buddhist temple, and caustic
suggestions that he keeps reinventing himself.

<HEADLINE> Wheels in Motion for Lee's Release  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The wheels were in motion Friday for
the release on $1 million bail of a jailed scientist charged with
breaching security at a nuclear weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   But a government appeal could delay the homecoming for Wen Ho
Lee, who was fired from Los Alamos National Laboratory last year
after allegedly downloading restricted data about nuclear weapons
to unsecure computers and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 FBI agents and support personnel searched for more than
12 hours Thursday at Lee's home in the Los Alamos suburb of White
Rock, looking for any sensitive scientific materials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're looking for any evidence of these crimes, the
allegedly missing seven tapes,'' said defense attorney Nancy
Hollander, who kept watch on the search. The defense insists the
tapes were destroyed, but the government wants proof.
</P>
<P>
   As far as she knows, Hollander said, agents seized nothing from
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a long day. We did complete the tasks mandated by the
court order, and we feel we did a thorough and professional job,''
agent Doug Beldon said after the search ended Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, who has been jailed since Dec. 10, could face life in
prison if convicted of the 59 counts against him. Trial is set for
Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis emphasized Tuesday
that until the missing tapes are located or proven destroyed, there
can be no adequate security measure for Lee's release.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker on Tuesday ordered that Lee be
freed at noon Friday on $1 million bail. An appeal could still
delay Lee's release. There was no word on any such filing Thursday
with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, which would
have to issue an emergency stay of Parker's order.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis and the U.S. solicitor general's office had awaited
Parker's memorandum explaining his reasons for granting bail before
making any appeal decision. They got the memorandum late Thursday
afternoon, Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   The final conditions of the release order were not made public,
but the judge's proposal had included a search of Lee's home,
limits on his communication, travel, home visits and required
removal of all electronic communication devices except for one
telephone line from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Lee would have to remain under electronic monitoring and wear an
electronic bracelet, and his mail could be inspected, under the
judge's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians were to return to the house Friday morning to
install security devices, Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   As agents, reporters and photographers converged Thursday on
Barcelona Avenue, neighbor Sandy Warnock suggested the FBI presence
was at least a likely guarantee against her home, across from
Lee's, being burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's men in suits all over the place, and this just isn't a
suit place. They stick out like a sore thumb,'' Warnock said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pauses Before 'U.S. Workathon'  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore pauses only briefly before bursting
into a 24-hour ''American Workathon'' to mark the Labor Day holiday
with a presidential campaign blitz leading up to a major economic
speech, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Gore planned a five-city tour beginning Sunday to
''spend time with Americans who are working.''
</P>
<P>
   That was being followed by a speech Wednesday in Cleveland where
he was to offer a detailed economic plan with specific goals for
the country's economic future, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has gained in the polls since the Democratic National
Convention and he spent this week talking up a series of detailed
health care plans. He said voters are beginning to focus on those
issues and that's what has boosted him in the campaign against
Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the American people focus on issues and ask the candidates
for specifics, as I expected they would when we reached Labor Day,
that's what I most enjoy talking about,'' Gore told reporters
aboard his campaign plane Thursday. ''I'm in my element. I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day marks the traditional opening of the fall campaign
season, and Gore was taking full advantage by launching ''a 24-hour
Labor Day Workathon, a nonstop, around-the-clock push to kick off
our ticket's economic agenda for America's future,'' aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans called for launching the blitz Sunday afternoon with
construction workers in Philadelphia, followed by a Flint, Mich.,
meeting with hospital workers, and a red-eye flight to Tampa, Fla.,
for a dawn meeting with firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters union was one of the first to endorse Gore.
</P>
<P>
   From Florida, Gore dashes to Pittsburgh and Louisville, Ky., for
events showcasing middle-class workers.
</P>
<P>
   The swing is designed to make the point the Gore is a hard
worker, on a holiday to honor working Americans, and crank up the
intensity of an already hard-fought presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's week stays frantic, with him dashing to virtually every
region of the country despite a heavy focus on the industrial
Midwest, a key battleground in the election. The choice of
Cleveland as the site for his economic speech was no accident; Ohio
is a crucial battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has long argued that his economic proposals are better
designed to keep the economy prosperous. He pushes for smaller,
targeted tax cuts, as well as new spending on health care and
education, warning that Bush would plunge the nation back into
deficits with big tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore will offer a ''comprehensive economic agenda''
fleshing out even more specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've given specifics for every proposal, and we'll continue
to do that,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that while both campaigns have been running at a fever
pitch, Labor Day marks an important symbolic crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Labor day begins a two-month home stretch for the campaign,''
Gore said. ''I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Democratic convention, most polls have shown Gore
gaining ground on Bush, and the two rivals are entering the
campaign's final sprint locked in a very close and competitive
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you I'm feeling a lot more responsiveness and
enthusiasm and energy,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee hoped to turn things around
with new television commercials questioning Gore's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rejected suggestions that the campaign had taken a
permanent turn for the negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't turn it into that,'' said Gore. ''I certainly hope it
doesn't turn into that.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the new RNC spots, saying running mate
Joseph Lieberman had already addressed the issue.

U.S. Absent From Global Parliament Meeting
</SUBHEAD>

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States' absence from the first meeting of
parliamentary leaders of more than 140 countries is being viewed as a sign of
Washington's growing isolation from global politics. Presiding officers of
parliaments from China, Russia, Britain, France and dozens of other countries
flew thousands of miles to attend the meeting. But U.S. Congress members, who
had the shortest distance to travel, were conspicuously absent. Vice President
Al Gore, who presides over the Senate, was invited to the three-day conference

Dennis Hastert.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defends Texas Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas legislators who have been studying
the state's Medicaid program say they will propose changes to
address serious problems that were highlighted this week after a
federal judge's critical ruling was made public.
</P>
<P>
   The decision immediately became fodder for the presidential
candidates, with Democrat Al Gore criticizing Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, his Republican rival. Bush defended his record and accused
Democrats of trying to hide their own weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate Committee on Human Services will submit its
final recommendations Friday to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and other
legislative leaders looking ahead to the next biennial session in
January.
</P>
<P>
   In a copy of the recommendations, obtained by The Associated
Press, the committee proposes measures to improve communication
between Medicaid recipients and the state, to make the Medicaid
application process easier, to eliminate rules that require the
state to count assets such as cars when reviewing applications and
to expand support for recipients leaving welfare for work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our ultimate goal is to ensure health care is available to all
Texas children and that those children are safe and healthy,'' said
state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, a Laredo Democrat and the committee's
chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the recommendations address problems outlined
in the court ruling, legislative committees have been working on
Medicaid reform in the years in between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice, in an Aug. 14 ruling
made public Wednesday, said Texas was not adequately providing
dental care, regular checkups, transportation to doctors or
information about what services are available to children in
Medicaid, despite a 1996 agreement in which the state promised to
make major improvements in its program.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will help with some of those problems,'' said state said
Rep. Elliott Naishtat, a Democrat from Austin and chairman of the
House Committee that will recommend similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.5 million of Texas' 6 million children are enrolled in
Medicaid. Another 1.4 million are uninsured, about 600,000 of whom
are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign said the ruling shows Bush's lack of leadership
on child health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered, ''We are doing everything in our power to take
care of the disadvantaged children of the state of Texas.'' He
criticized the federal government for refusing to grant waivers
that he said would have made the process easier.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Mike Jones said it's too early to tell what, if
any, changes will be made. He said Bush is committed to the
children of Texas and pointed to state court filings that say Texas
has dramatically improved Medicaid since the original class-action
lawsuit filed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   According to those filings, checkup participation rates have
increased from 29 percent to 66 percent since 1993. The number of
state employees assigned to the program has increased from 10 to
nearly 500 and the state made 5 million contacts to Medicaid
clients in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Medical Transportation Program budget has
increased 300 percent since 1993, the state claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that much of that data was inflated. And while
more money may be spent on transportation, the court found that
only 2 percent of those eligible had used it in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn plans to appeal Justice's ruling,
which requires that a corrective plan be submitted to the court in
60 days.

<HEADLINE> Mediators Give Ideas for Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians would jointly
administer Jerusalem during a 5- to 10-year trial period under a
plan reportedly put forth by Egyptian mediators seeking to help
broker a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan suggests the ''one city with two administrations'' idea
be tried as a basis for an agreement on the holy city. The
Egyptians have presented the idea to both sides and the United
States, according to an Arab diplomat and an Egyptian expert close
to the talks who asked that their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Israel would control the Western Wall, the
revered site where Jews pray. Jews would have unrestricted access
to the Western Wall from two points in the city, as they do now.
The al-Aqsa mosque, which sits atop the wall, would be in
Palestinian hands.
</P>
<P>
   Joint Israeli-Palestinian police squads would patrol and
supervise security in areas where the two peoples are expected to
be in constant contact, the Egyptian expert and the Arab diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Egyptian plan avoids a direct reference to the
explosive issue of rival claims to political sovereignty over
Jerusalem. Instead the Egyptian mediators have coined phrases like
''functional sovereignty'' and ''administrative control.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The creative solution in these ideas is that the Egyptians are
trying to avoid using the word sovereignty, which was the main
stumbling block in Camp David,'' the Arab diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a solution can give each party what it wants without
delving into problematic phraseology,'' said the Egyptian expert, a
veteran of Middle East peace negotiations. He said wrangling over
legal and political terminology blocked agreement at the Camp David
summit last month.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas, which have not progressed to a formal proposal, fully
satisfy neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians. But they could
in time be the basis for resolving their most difficult point of
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   And other accords could be struck in the meantime on less
complicated issues, such as the borders of a Palestinian state and
the fate of Palestinian refugees who want to return to land in what
is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have said little publicly about their
mediation, no doubt wary of being condemned by hard-liners who want
no compromise on Arab claims to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak told the French newspaper Le Figaro that
Mideast peace must come ''now or never'' and Israel needs to show
willingness to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have everything, a state, an army and the territories
taken in 1967. The Palestinians have nothing,'' he was quoted as
saying in the interview, published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak told Le Figaro that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
would never succumb to pressure to make concessions on Muslim holy
sites in Jerusalem. ''No Muslim would ever pardon him,'' he said,
according to Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian expert said the Egyptians had persuaded Arafat to
put off for at least a month plans to declare independence on Sept.
13. That would allow more time for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Egyptian plan, the office of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said: ''There are currently no concrete
negotiations between us and the Palestinians, and thus there is no
point in a discussion of this type until Arafat displays the
flexibility necessary for achieving an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an official close to Barak said Thursday that if the
Palestinians do not make concessions in the coming few weeks, the
Israeli leader will ask the hard-line Likud party to join his
government.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline appeared aimed at forcing Palestinian concessions
on Jerusalem. Bringing the Likud into government would chill the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to Arafat, Nabil Amr, said such threats showed that
Barak had run out of ideas for the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Most Indians haven't benefited from 1990s casino boom  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEACH SPRINGS, Ariz. (AP) - When American Indians began
embracing gambling as an economic development tool in the 1990s,
the Hualapai tribe in northern Arizona moved quickly to open a
casino at its Grand Canyon West tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders figured that slot machines would provide new
revenue for the tribe's 1,200 members, many of whom have lived in
poverty for years. But they forgot that most of the 100,000
visitors to Grand Canyon West each year come directly from Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those people weren't coming to a casino,'' said Louise Benson,
tribal chairman. ''They were coming to see the Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after opening the casino, the Hualapai shut it
down. Instead of providing an economic boom to tribal members, it
left them $1 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were high hopes for that casino, but the reality of it
was that we were too isolated,'' said Alex Cabillo, the tribe's
director of public works.
</P>
<P>
   The Hualapai tribe is one of only two whose casinos failed
during the Indian gambling boom of the past decade, when revenues
exploded from $100 million in 1988 to $8.26 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But an Associated Press computer analysis of federal
unemployment, poverty and public assistance records indicates that
the vast majority of American Indians, like the Hualapai, have not
realized the early ''high hopes'' of the casino boom.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the American Indian population belong to
poverty-stricken tribes that still don't have Las Vegas-style
casinos. Some, like the Navajo, culturally oppose gambling, while
others, like the Hualapai, are too far away from major population
centers to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 130 tribes with Las Vegas-style casinos, those near
major cities have thrived, while most others have little left after
paying the bills, the AP analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   Despite new gambling jobs, unemployment on reservations with
established casinos held steady around 54 percent between 1991 and
1997, according to data the tribes reported to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs. Many of the casino jobs were filled with non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody thinks that tribes are getting rich from gaming and
very few of them are,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500,000 Indians whose tribes operate casinos, only about
80,000 belong to tribes with gambling operations that generate more
than $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 23 tribes with the most successful casinos - like
the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Tribe in Minnesota - pay each
member hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Scott County, which includes the Shakopee reservation south
of Minneapolis, the poverty rate declined from 4.1 percent in 1989
to 3.5 percent six years later. The reservation's unemployment rate
also plummeted from 70 percent in 1991 to just 4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Such success stories belong mostly to tribes with casinos near
major population centers.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Mashantucket Pequot tribe of Connecticut reported more
than $300 million in revenue in the first five months of this year
from its Foxwoods Casino, located between New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And the Seminole Tribe's Hollywood Gaming Center on Miami's Gold
Coast generates more than $100 million a year with pull-tab slot
machines. The unemployment rate on that reservation, however, still
was 45 percent in 1997, and the average poverty rate in the two
counties it touches rose from 10.4 percent in 1989 to 12.1 percent
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For many tribes with Las Vegas-style casinos, like the San
Carlos Apaches in eastern Arizona, gambling revenues pay for casino
operations and debt service, with little left to upgrade the
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In counties that include reservations with casinos, the average
poverty rate declined only slightly between 1989 and 1995, from
17.7 percent to 15.5 percent, the AP analysis founds. Counties that
include reservations without casinos saw their poverty rate remain
steady at slightly more than 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the poverty rate hovered around 13 percent during
the period.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Tachi Yokut Tribe in the San Joaquin Valley
brags on its Web site that its Palace Gaming Center has provided
employment for tribal members, helped raise education levels and
upgraded housing.
</P>
<P>
   But the poverty rate in Kings County, which includes the tribe's
small reservation, climbed from 18.2 percent in 1989 to 22.3
percent in 1995. The reservation's unemployment rate dropped
slightly to 49.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Taylor, a research fellow at the Harvard University
Project on American Indian Economic Development, said many
investments gaming tribes have made in social and economic
infrastructure don't translate into immediate improvements in
quality-of-life indicators like poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see investments arising out of gaming taking hold slowly
in greater educational success, greater family integrity, greater
personal health, greater crime prevention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some optimistic signs that tribes hope to build on as
they begin paying off their casino construction loans.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis indicates casino gambling has slowed, though not
reversed, the growth of tribal members on public assistance.
Participation in the Agriculture Department's Food Distribution
Program on Indian Reservations increased 8.2 percent from 1990 to
1997 among tribes with casinos, compared with 57.3 percent among
tribes without them.
</P>
<P>
   And economic development has been spurred in communities near
tribal casinos, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's
County Business Patterns for 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida Indian Nation in central New York, for example, has
become the largest employer in Oneida and Madison counties, thanks
to a casino that's generating more than $100 million in annual
revenues. A championship golf course and convention center are
under construction.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the new jobs have not reduced unemployment for
Indians. Tribes with established casinos saw their overall
unemployment rate actually rise four-tenths of a point to 54.4
percent between 1991 and 1997, the AP analysis found.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Coin, former executive director of the National Indian
Gaming Association, said that's because 75 percent of jobs in
tribal casinos are held by non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation along the
California-Arizona-Nevada border, the unemployment rate climbed
from 27.2 percent in 1991 to 74.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal administrator Gary Goforth acknowledged few of the 675
jobs at the tribe's two financially troubled casinos are filled by
tribal members. ''Not everybody wants to be a dealer, or a
housekeeper or even a manager in the restaurant,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Estate-Tax Repeal  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders are vowing a prompt
attempt to override President Clinton's veto of a bill repealing
inheritance taxes, but if that fails the so-called death tax debate
will play out in the fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they will make sure voters understand that if
Congress remains in GOP control and George W. Bush wins the White
House over Al Gore, the estate tax will undoubtedly be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This choice is clear: Al Gore and the Democrats will continue
the death tax, and Governor Bush and the Republicans will end it,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say the GOP refused to consider less-costly
compromise provisions to help the family farmers and small
businesses sometimes hit hard by estate taxes, such as raising
exemptions for them without giving a windfall to the wealthiest
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans do not want election-year antics such as Republicans
passing bills designed to be vetoed just so they can have some
talking points,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior
Ways and Means Committee Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during a ceremony Thursday in the White House East
Room, said the bill would threaten the nation's financial
well-being while handing the richest 3,000 families an average tax
cut of $7 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong on grounds of fairness. It is wrong on grounds of
fiscal responsibility,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the $105 billion cost during the 10-year
phaseout would explode to $750 billion in the decade after full
repeal, rapidly consuming budget surplus dollars needed to shore up
Social Security and Medicare, pay down the national debt and
increase spending on education.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, like the marriage penalty tax cut Clinton vetoed a few
weeks ago, was part of last year's vetoed $792 billion tax cut that
congressional Republicans are now trying to pass bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   The president said these smaller, more popular bills could
''snowball'' into the same huge tax cut, threatening a return to
deficits and higher interest rates for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless someone stops it, the snowball will turn into an
avalanche and you'll have the same impact you had before ...,''
Clinton said. ''This bill suffered the inevitable fate of a
snowball in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of estates in a given year pay the tax that
reaches 55 percent, but sponsors of the repeal won broad support on
Capitol Hill by arguing that it inhibits business expansion,
threatens breakups of farms and forces millions of taxpayers to pay
lawyers, accountants and insurance companies so they can avoid the
tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working men and women across the country recognize that it is
simply wrong that after paying taxes your whole life, the
government can collect up to 55 percent of these same assets when
the head of the family dies,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has proposed estate tax repeal in his $1.3 trillion
tax cut, labeled as ''class warfare'' Clinton's argument about the
wealthy. ''I would have signed the bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, 65 Democrats joined all Republicans in passing the
bill this summer, just over the two-thirds threshold necessary to
override the veto. House GOP leaders tentatively plan next Thursday
to put those Democrats on the spot -- particularly those in
difficult re-election fights -- and some say they'll vote against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is wrong, and to his veto I say no,'' said Rep.
Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders, however, insist they will muster the votes
to sustain the veto even if some in their party have to switch
votes. Republicans also plan to stage a veto override vote on the
marriage penalty bill next month; Democrats say they've got the
votes to back that veto as well.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the first $675,000 of an individual's assets are
exempt from estate taxes, which a married couple can double through
certain estate planning steps. Under current law, that $675,000
exemption will rise to $1 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and small businesses already have higher individual
exemptions of $1.3 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, according to IRS statistics, 43,000 estates paid the
tax. Only about one of every 600,000 people who die each year leave
family farm or small business estates that owe any tax, according
to Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Divulges Military Readiness  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When George W. Bush and running mate Dick
Cheney say the Clinton administration has squandered the strong
military it inherited from Bush's father, they point to a problem
that independent observers agree is real: a mismatch between
defense resources and demands placed on U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, few could challenge -- and Bush and Cheney do
not -- Al Gore's assertion that today's American military is the
strongest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that measures of military capability are really
political judgments: Under what circumstances should military force
be used? What are the odds that U.S. security interests will be
challenged, and by whom? To what extent does the peacetime presence
of U.S. troops abroad deter conflict? How willing are U.S. allies
to fight alongside American forces, and to share burdens like
peacekeeping?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military, in power and reach, is so superior to any
other on Earth that comparisons really miss the point. The United
States has set for itself a unique military role -- not of global
policeman but of global power. It is the only military that keeps
substantial numbers of troops and ships on duty around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the largely unasked question in the current
debate over military readiness: Ready for what?
</P>
<P>
   Ready to conduct an increasing number of open-ended peacekeeping
operations, beyond the current commitments in Bosnia and Kosovo?
Probably not, but neither Bush nor Gore is likely to allow that,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to keep up their peacekeeping in the Balkans? Yes,
although the Pentagon states openly that if war broke out
elsewhere, the forces (mainly Army) in Bosnia and Kosovo would have
to pull out immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to continue patrolling the skies over southern and
northern Iraq, as the Air Force, Navy and Marines have been doing
since shortly after the 1991 Persian Gulf War? Apparently yes,
although that mission has been a major strain.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration's Gulf War succeeded in expelling Iraqi
forces from Kuwait, but it left Saddam Hussein in power in Baghdad,
and the Clinton administration has sought to keep a lid on his
military.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said Thursday that a new Bush administration would press
U.S. allies in Europe to share a bigger portion of the peackeeping
load in the Balkans, so that the United States could pull out some
of its troops. At present there are 6,200 U.S. troops in Kosovo, or
about one-seventh of the total peacekeeping force. And in Bosnia
the United States has a slightly higher proportion: 4,600 of the
total 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's comments sparked a sharp response from the Gore
campaign, where a spokeswoman, Kym Spell, said Bush ''clearly
doesn't understand what is going on in the world.'' She said U.S.
forces comprised a low percentage of the peacekeeping forces in
both Kosovo and Bosnia, and that U.S. allies pay for 90 percent of
the peacekeeping effort.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Defense Department's own standard is to be
prepared to fight two ''major theater wars'' nearly simultaneously.
There is no precise definition of either ''major theater war'' or
''nearly simultaneously,'' but the general idea is to be able to
fight and win wars against, say, Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon told Congress Thursday in its quarterly report on
readiness that most combat forces are ready to execute their
wartime missions, although it expressed concern about shortfalls in
training and certain personnel skills as well as deficiencies in
equipment such as anti-aircraft radar jammers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report said that in today's context, in which U.S.
troops are on duty in the Balkans and in the Persian Gulf, the
''risk factors'' for responding to the outbreak of war on the
Korean Peninsula would be ''moderate.'' It judged the risk for
responding to a second war, theoretically in the Persian Gulf, as
''high.''
</P>
<P>
   Those risks are not meant to suggest the United States would not
prevail in either of the two wars, but rather that the potential
for American casualties would be greater.
</P>
<P>
   That's different than being able to fight a world war of the
kind feared during the Cold War struggle with the Soviet Union.
When the Berlin Wall fell and democracy swept through central and
eastern Europe in 1989-90, the Bush administration and Congress
decided to reduce U.S. forces, cut budgets and close bases.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and Bush now say the Clinton administration went too far
in cutting back on the military.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Hawley, recently retired as commander of the Air
Force's Air Combat Command, blames the Clinton administration for
taking a ''procurement holiday,'' meaning it slowed down the
purchasing of new weaponry to the point that wear and tear have
made it increasingly expensive to operate.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has forced the military to use money that would
otherwise buy new equipment to maintain the old.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the Pentagon is gearing up for what has become a
quadrennial review of the military, to determine how to balance
military requirements with national security strategy. The last
such review, in 1997, was headed by Cohen, a Republican. The next
one will start early next year when a new administration takes
office.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Tradition Develops  </HEADLINE>
By MIRANDA LEITSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The 12 young men and women grip their paddles,
angling them just above the water and awaiting the start. They have
sweated and strained nine weeks for this moment -- their first
dragon boat race.
</P>
<P>
   The start signal blares, and the team storms across Meadow Lake
in its 2,000-pound boat decorated with a red dragon's head and
tail.
</P>
<P>
   Cries of ''Paddle! Paddle! Go! Go!'' mix with drum beats,
resounding over the lake.
</P>
<P>
   The race is over in less than four minutes. The Xtreme NY club
places third and Carol Chang, the team's drummer, who sets the
paddlers' pace, leads the dripping-wet crew in a cheer:
''Extreme!''
</P>
<P>
   The paddlers at the Hong Kong dragon boat festival in New York's
borough of Queens in mid-August were vying in the ancient Chinese
sport of dragon boating, which is attracting new adherents across
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From San Francisco to New York, and along the Mississippi River
in places as unlikely as Dubuque, Iowa, more than 400 teams are
dragon boating, said Iowan Gary Carstens of the United States
Dragon Boat Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Most dragon boating hotspots are in the Midwest, which has 275
teams. Nearly 70 teams train in New York City, and some 80 teams
practice in and around Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it. I want to win as much as anybody else, but I love
the team community,'' said Ginny O'Hare, 33, co-captain of New
York's Wall Street Lions crew.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very, very hard ... but it's a great workout on the
river,'' said Ellen Tacelosky, 32, a banker from Arlington, Va.,
whose D.C. Dragons team paddles on Washington's Anacostia River.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a competitive team -- which traditionally has 18
paddlers, a steerer and a drummer -- is synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the paddles combine as one big paddle, and that's what
moves the boat forward,'' said Xtreme NY co-captain Kang Ko, 30, of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it's a matter of speed. Paddlers use a combination
of strokes to propel the 38-foot canoes. Sharp slices through the
water make for a quick start or a run for the finish; deeper pulls
maintain a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is attracting considerable interest outside the Asian
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the sport is the promotion of Asian culture,'' said
Tim Woo, 37, of Queens. But ''even in New York, where I would say
you have the highest Asian-American participation, it's only 30 to
40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragon boating began in China with the legend of Qu Yuan, a
poet-statesman who drowned himself in the Milo River in Central
Hunan province more than 2,000 years ago to protest government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Qu's bereaved countrymen rowed boats in the river, beating their
paddles against the water to frighten fish and dragons away from
his body.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of our lives,'' said May Wong, a Hong Kong native
living in New York. ''I like it because it brings out Chinese
traditions and Americans can join in. They can learn something
about the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to trace the roots of the sport in the United
States. A Philadelphia rowing team was given a dragon boat in 1983
by a Hong Kong group, said Bill Toole of the Philadelphia dragon
boat team. A dragon boat festival in New York in 1991 -- sponsored
by a Hong Kong group -- sparked further interest.
</P>
<P>
   Paddlers say one reason for the growing participation in the
sport is that it requires relatively little skill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only so many people can play soccer, rugby or baseball, but
everyone can paddle,'' said Carstens, 48.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a team in Cedar Rapids where the youngest person is
62,'' said Carstens. ''Their motto is: 'We can do everything for a
minute and a half.'''

<HEADLINE> Interior Reviews Boy Scout Ties  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Interior Department attempt to clarify its
relationship with the Boy Scouts of America in light of the group's
ban on gays has prompted sharp responses from Republicans, with the
issue quickly surfacing in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department acknowledged Thursday that it is
reviewing its ties with the 90-year-old scouting organization
because of an executive order by President Clinton in June that
prohibits government participation in education activities with
groups that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The department's solicitor recently asked the Justice Department
for advice on the matter and directed all Interior agencies to
produce detailed information on their activities -- everything from
agency involvement in the national Scout jamboree to awarding of
conservation merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   The information is needed ''to determine which activities and
programs ... as they relate to the Boy Scouts of America are
consistent with'' the president's executive order on
discrimination, Interior Solicitor John Leshy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, when it surfaced, brought immediate response Thursday
from Republicans, including GOP presidential nominee George W.
Bush, who questioned whether the Interior Department was on the
verge of throwing the Scouts off federal land, which for years many
Scout troops have used for camping.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm troubled by this memo appearing to suggest that the
Clinton-Gore administration might sever the federal government's
long-standing relationship with the Boy Scouts of America,'' Bush
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had little to say, but a spokesman for Vice
President Al Gore's campaign sought to make clear Gore has no
intention of ousting the Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a Gore administration Boy Scouts will be allowed to use
federal land,'' Gore campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior spokesman Jon Wright said the department has no
intention of severing its ties with the Scouts, characterizing the
Leshy memo as part of an attempt to get clarification from the
Justice Department on how the president's June 23 executive order
might affect the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a long history and tradition with the Boy Scouts and
we look forward to continuing that relationship,'' said Wright,
adding that Scouts often help clean up campgrounds and trails and
the department helps Scouts work on conservation merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued his executive order on discrimination only five
days before the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts were within
their constitutional rights to ban homosexuals as scoutmasters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican
Conference, accused the Clinton administration of ''investigating''
the Boy Scouts and of ''political pandering'' to gays.
</P>
<P>
   Justice spokeswoman Kara Peterman said that while the department
is continuing to develop general guidelines for the president's
order, it has issued no advice to Interior or anyone else
specifically involving the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't even looked at it,'' she said, adding that when
Justice received the request, Interior was told to produce more
information on what involvement the scouting organization has with
them.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, Leshy, the department's top legal officer, asked all
agencies to provide details on their activities involving the Boy
Scouts so that he could forward that information to Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The memo sought information on Interior's involvement in next
year's Boy Scout Jamboree as well as the department's involvement
in ''all activities, events or programs'' involving the Scouts, any
monetary or non-monetary assistance, sponsorship of any Scout
troops or events, and involvement in any award, certificates,
patches, merit badges or other forms of recognition of Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has caught the Boy Scouts of America, incorporated
in 1910 and chartered by Congress six years later, by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stumped,'' spokesman Gregg Shields said. He said as far as
he knows the Boy Scouts have had little dealing with the federal
government except ''we camp on some federal land. ... We get almost
no financial support from the federal government.''

<HEADLINE> East Timor Crimes Suspects Named  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- State prosecutors named 19 army and
police officers, government officials and pro-Indonesian militiamen
on Friday as suspects in last year's rampant slayings and
destruction in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But former military commander Gen. Wiranto and prominent militia
leader Eurico Guterres, who have been implicated in the violence by
the United Nations and an earlier Indonesian inquiry, were absent
from the list.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, commanded
the armed forces during a militia rampage that followed the
U.N.-organized referendum on Aug. 30, 1999, in which the people of
East Timor voted overwhelmingly to separate from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to take action against Wiranto -- who enjoys the
backing of powerful army hard-liners -- will likely result in
renewed calls for an international tribunal to bring the
perpetrators of the violence to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's democratic government has rejected the idea of a
tribunal along the lines of those for Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia. It insists its own court system is capable of bringing
those responsible to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Rachman, who leads the Indonesian joint commission on
human rights violations in East Timor, said Maj. Gen. Adam Damiri,
a former regional army commander, topped the list of possible
suspects, along with two brigadier generals.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven more officers, ranging from lieutenant to colonel, were
also named. Others on the list were Abilio Soares, East Timor's
former Indonesian-appointed governor, the district head of Liquica
township and three militia members.
</P>
<P>
   ''All will be summoned for questioning next week,'' Rachman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is accused in five specific atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   They include massacres in April 1999 of independence supporters
in Liquica and of refugees who sought shelter at the Dili home of
prominent independence leader Manuel Carrascalao.
</P>
<P>
   The group also is accused in violence that raged in the days
after the territory voted for independence last year -- including a
bloody attack on the home of East Timor's Nobel Peace laureate,
Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, killings in the border town of
Suai and the murder of Dutch journalist Sander Thoenes.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's other Nobel Peace Prize winner, Jose Ramos-Horta,
was angered by the absence of Guterres from the suspects' list.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Eurico Guterres, a notorious war criminal, is not brought
to trial, it leaves no option to the United Nations but to set up a
war crimes tribunal,'' he said Friday in the capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Guterres, who headed the notorious Aitarak (Thorn) militia, is
accused of leading the destruction of Dili. Just days before the
referendum, he publicly threatened to transform the town into ''a
sea of fire'' if its people voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
   At least 250 people died after the vote. Human rights groups
blame the Indonesian military for inciting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Indonesian government-sponsored human rights
commission accused 33 military officers -- including Wiranto -- of
''crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate U.N. panel concluded that the terror campaign ''would
not have been possible without the active involvement of the
Indonesian army, and the knowledge and approval of the top military
command.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, these findings forced President Abdurrahman
Wahid to fire Wiranto from his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto has admitted that some lower-ranking members of
Indonesia's military backed the militias, but has denied that the
army command actively supported the violence.

<HEADLINE> Volcanic Japanese Island Evacuated  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- All remaining residents of a Japanese island where
a volcano began erupting nearly two months ago were ordered to
evacuate Friday because of the danger of more eruptions,
earthquakes and landslides.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 residents had remained on Miyake Island, south of
Tokyo, since Mount Oyama rumbled back to life in early July. Only
police, fire and municipal personnel -- about 600 people -- will
remain there after Friday, said Keita Takashima, a Tokyo government
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation order comes two days after the 2,686-foot volcano
erupted for the eighth time in two months. More than 60 percent of
Miyake's residents had left the island voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The eruptions have blanketed the island with ash, prompting
warnings that heavy rains could set off mudslides. The island also
has been shaken by thousands of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has become a dangerous place, so it would be a relief to
leave,'' said Miyake government spokeswoman Izumi Asanuma, who was
awaiting a decision about whether she would be evacuated. Her
mother and two brothers have already left, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Government shelters have been set up in Tokyo and ships were
dispatched to the island to help evacuate the remaining residents.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, 13,000 people were ordered to evacuate in
northern Japan after Mount Usu erupted for the first time in 22
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, all 10,000 residents on Oshima Island in the Izu Island
chain were evacuated for a month after Mount Mihara erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have said shifts in huge underground pools of magma are
responsible for the recent volcanic and seismic activity on Miyake,
which is about 120 miles south of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquakes that have rocked Miyake and surrounding islands
in the Izu chain have generated fears a big earthquake could strike
Tokyo. The capital, also highly vulnerable, on Friday marked the
anniversary of a 1923 earthquake that killed 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and about 5.5 million people across
the nation took part in annual drills to commemorate the quake.
They culminate Sunday with a massive military rescue exercise.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 14, Indians 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Chad Curtis hit a tiebreaking
seventh-inning double and Rusty Greer followed with a two-run
single as the Texas Rangers stopped a five-game losing streak with
a 14-7 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game finished in 4 hours, 21 minutes, one minute shy of the
major league record for a nine-inning contest.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Waszgis got the go-ahead rally started in the seventh
inning of a 6-6 game with a one-out single off Steve Karsay (4-6).
Waszgis went to second on Luis Alicea's single and scored on
Curtis' double to right.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who went 5-for-6 with four RBIs, drove in Alicea and
Curtis, who went 4-for-5, with a single through the middle of a
drawn-in infield to make it 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea, who was also 4-for-5 with a club record-tying five runs
scored, added a two-run homer, Rafael Palmeiro an RBI single and
Ricky Ledee a two-run triple in a five-run eighth off Jamie
Brewington.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro reached base in all six plate appearances, one short of
the major league record, with three singles and three walks. The
Rangers' 21 hits tied a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Karsay, the fifth of seven Cleveland pitchers, gave up three
runs and four hits over two-thirds of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Venafro (3-1) pitched 1 1-3 innings of two-hit relief for
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Cleveland's three-game winning streak and trimmed
its AL wild-card race lead to one game over idle Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler's two-run single in the sixth gave the Rangers a 6-5
lead, but Kenny Lofton delivered an RBI single in the seventh to
tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman had a two-run homer for the Indians, 18-9 since
Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The game started in 99 degree heat, the highest reading for a
night game at The Ballpark in Arlington this season. High
temperature in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on Thursday was a record
108 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Texas made it 2-0 in the first inning against Jason Bere on
Greer's single and Ledee's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians came back with a four-run second, highlighted by
Fryman's two-run shot, his 20th, off rookie starter Brian Sikorski.
Omar Vizquel and Manny Ramirez had RBI singles to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tied it at 4 in the third on Greer's RBI single and Bere's
bases-loaded walk to Kapler, Bere's last batter.
</P>
<P>
   Bere, 4-2 in his first six starts since he was acquired from
Milwaukee on July 28, lasted only 2 1-3 innings. He allowed four
runs and six hits, struck out one and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski gave up four runs and nine hits, struck out four and
walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's baserunning gave the Indians a 5-4 lead in the sixth.
After drawing a leadoff walk and moving to second on Matt Perisho's
wild pickoff throw, Lofton took third on Roberto Alomar's flyout
and scored on Tim Crabtree's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Fryman has seven career 20-homer seasons. ... Ramirez
stretched his hitting streak to 15 games. ... Bere had his shortest
outing for the Indians. ... Indians catcher Sandy Alomar missed his
second straight start with back spasms and is still day-to-day.

<HEADLINE> Lindland on U.S. Wrestling Team  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Evander Holyfield got to keep his title after Mike
Tyson bit his ears. American wrestler Keith Sieracki might not be
as fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the International Olympic Committee said Sieracki
could be replaced by Matt Lindland on the U.S. Olympic Greco-Roman
team for Sydney on Thursday, Sieracki came forward with a videotape
that appeared to show Lindland biting his ear during a qualifying
match.
</P>
<P>
   Though inconclusive, the tape, viewed by The Associated Press,
showed Lindland making a deliberate move toward Sieracki's right
ear as the two jostled for leverage. Sieracki immediately jumped
back in protest, and a close-up shot showed a small amount of blood
coming from the ear.
</P>
<P>
   ''USA Wrestling has rules about brutality,'' Sieracki said. ''If
this isn't brutality, I don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki went on to win the match 2-1 on a referee's decision,
apparently securing an Olympic berth. USA Wrestling committees
upheld the decision despite Lindland's claim he was illegally
tripped during the 167&AMP;frac12;-pound match, but an arbitrator ordered a
rematch, won by Lindland 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee reviewed the conflicting cases and
submitted Sieracki's name as part of the Olympic team on Sunday to
comply with IOC deadlines. It asked the IOC on Tuesday that
Lindland be named as a replacement to comply with a judge's ruling
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''As your request was made pursuant to a court's order, the IOC
has agreed to grant the requested substitution of the entry, i.e.,
Mr. Matthew Lindland in the place of Keith Sieracki,'' IOC sports
director Gilbert Felli said in a letter faxed to the USOC in
Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki, a military police sergeant stationed at the Fort
Carson Army post, and the USOC are awaiting a ruling from the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, Sieracki said he wanted people to
know about the ear-biting incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't hook the legs,'' he said. ''It was incidental
contact. On top of that, he bit my ear and should have been
disqualified. The ear bite is a lot more apparent compared to the
leg call.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindland, an assistant coach at Nebraska until April, did not
deny biting Sieracki's ear and said he wanted the videotape to be
presented during arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I requested the videotape be used, and USA Wrestling didn't
want to look at it,'' Lindland said. ''They objected to using the
tape. ... All I will say is we can both agree the officials did a
poor job. At least we can both agree on that.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Wrestling spokesman Gary Abbott said videotape is used by
mat-side officials to make and review calls, but the governing
body's rules and bylaws do not allow video to be used in protests
or appeals to the Greco-Roman Sports Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the ramifications of a wrestler biting during
competition, Abbott said, ''That type of incident could have an
athlete expelled from a match and the victory given to an
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having his name accepted by the IOC on Thursday,
Lindland tempered his enthusiasm because of the pending appeal in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to get a medal at the games, not just be on the
team,'' he said. ''But you have to be on the team before you can
get a medal.''

<HEADLINE> Not Everyone's in Olympic Spirit  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The venues are ready, the athletes are
doing their final warmups and the bunting is going up all over
town. Sydney, are you ready to be part of the biggest show on
Earth?
</P>
<P>
   No thanks, says Lynn White.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really not interested in the Olympic games,'' said White,
who with her husband Jim will fly out of Sydney in time to miss the
opening ceremony for a vacation that will last just as long as the
Sept. 15-Oct. 1 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything against sport, I enjoy watching the
football. But the traffic around here is bad enough at the best of
times. It's about to go over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whites are not alone in wanting to escape what Lynn, a
bookkeeper at an electrical firm, described as ''the Olympic
hoo-hah.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by games sponsor Ansett Airlines published in July
found some 500,000 of Sydney's 4 million residents want out of the
city while the games are on.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't get a seat on an aircraft going out of Sydney in
early September,'' said Shirley McPhedran, travel agent with
Sydney-based Aegean Tours. ''It's Sydneysiders escaping from the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks to go, the buzz is building. Sydney has
given itself over almost completely to the games -- from giant
Olympic rings hanging from the landmark Harbor bridge to billboards
covering one side of an office tower to blanket newspaper and
television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiastic crowds along the countrywide route of the Olympic
torch and the quick sellout of premium tickets as they come on
staggered sale are indications of the general support for the games
in Sydney, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is getting in the spirit. Some say the games
are over-hyped, over-commercialized, over-expensive and overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a circus,'' said Craig Reucassel, who runs a Website
called ''Silly 2000,'' which satirizes the official ''Sydney 2000''
site.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a serious side to the steroid use, the abuse of games
processes, the bribery, but when you get down to it, the Olympics
is just a glorified Little Athletics tournament,'' he said,
referring to youth track meets.
</P>
<P>
   For Sydney residents, the excitement of being the center of the
world's attention is being countered by the reality of disruptions
to day-to-day life. With the start so close, the nuisance factor is
starting to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, getting home has become a difficult chore for
residents of Balmain, who have just been told they are not allowed
to make cross-traffic turns from the main road leading to their
harborside suburb because the road is an official Olympic route.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi fares are about to jump by 10 percent for the duration of
the games, and some restaurants -- even if you can get a seat -- are
about to raise prices by up to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other dining establishments are charging a non-refundable
booking fee to protect themselves against late cancelations.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the games is an opportunity for Sydney residents
and are encouraging them to take annual leave, find some Olympic
spirit and buy some of the 1.25 million general tickets still
unsold.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you're traveling to an event, please stay home to
relieve stress on the public bus and train transport system,
organizers say. Commuters can expect hours more travel time because
of Olympic demand, meaning some people will rise before dawn and
get home after dark just to work a 9-5 shift.
</P>
<P>
   Lanes on major roadways will be for official vehicles only, and
parking is banned at all times along those routes, where previously
minor traffic fines all of a sudden are astronomical. Traffic chaos
will be made worse by a vehicle no-go zone that will be declared in
a large section of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The problems radiate farther than downtown. Early morning
joggers, and anybody else who visits famous Bondi beach, will have
to swerve around the temporary 10,000-seat beach volleyball stadium
built in the sand. And police are already stopping and searching
cars passing through salubrious Rose Bay, where sailing events will
be held.
</P>
<P>
   While some airlines are cutting fares out of Australia during
the games to try to fill planes that will bring games visitors into
Sydney, McPhedran said demand was high in the weeks leading up to
the Sept. 15 start, particularly in first and business class.
</P>
<P>
   For the Whites, even the chance to see daughter Kelly take part
in the opening ceremony was not enough to keep them in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   A dancer, Kelly will take the field with around 5,000 others for
a brief appearance at the hours-long extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   But the ticket price -- starting at $570 -- was too much for the
Whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said 'Mum, you won't be there to see me,' but I told her,
well, what will we see anyway,'' said Lynn White. ''The seats (we
could afford) are so far away we wouldn't be able to see a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the VCR will be set to tape the performance, and the
Whites plan to scan the telecast from Zurich. ''Maybe we'll catch a
glimpse of her on TV,'' Lynn White said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying stories under headlines such as ''Greg Norman calls for
golf to be an Olympic sport: 'I'd be proud to choke for
Australia''' and ''Cyclists become Jehovah's witnesses: 'Blood
tests are against our religion,''' the ''Silly 2000'' site aims to
offer laughter as comfort for the inconveniences of the games, said
Reucassel.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the trains are derailing, when the drug scandals break,
when terrorists attack Sydney's nuclear facility, you are going to
need some light relief,'' he said, referring to recent Olympic
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a panacea to the Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Gerald Ford Starts Renovation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Looking suntanned and healthy, Gerald Ford
donned a hard hat and helped start a $9 million renovation project
on an amphitheater that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, accompanied by wife Betty, told a crowd of
about 200 he was pleased to return to the resort near his adopted
hometown of Beaver Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have such wonderful memories and recollections of the Vail
Valley over the last 32 years,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, was energetic and robust with no outward sign of the
small stroke he suffered earlier this month while at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, he declined to discuss his health, choosing
instead to chat with friends in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks great,'' Mayor Ludwig Kurz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford entered the hospital Aug. 2 and was released a week later
after being treated for the stroke and an abscess on his tongue. He
has been recovering at his desert home in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Vail Valley Foundation spearheaded the fund-raising effort
to renovate the Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater, which has become a
mainstay for the summer season of performing arts in the valley
since it opened in 1987.

<HEADLINE> 400 Respond to U.N. Tobacco Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Health Organization said Friday it had
received more than 400 responses to a request for views on the
creation of a treaty for global tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were expecting a good response and are now very encouraged
by the overwhelming and diverse range of submissions received,''
said Derek Yach, head of the WHO's Tobacco Control Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Interested parties had until Thursday to submit their views. The
documents will form the basis for two days of public hearings,
scheduled for Oct. 12-13 in Geneva. This will be followed by the
start of full negotiations between WHO member governments on a
draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
   WHO said it had received submissions from all the major tobacco
companies, as well as people involved in growing, producing and
selling tobacco products. Others who responded included public
health groups, smokers' rights groups, sports organizations, church
groups, the advertising industry and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   The agency hopes to post all the submissions on its Web Site
before the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that WHO has sought widespread views on a
public health issue. It hopes they will provide governments with
food for thought as they consider what to include in the treaty,
which will set out policies to control and contain tobacco-related
deaths. The treaty should be ready for signature by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   WHO estimates that tobacco use kills 4 million people every
year. By 2030, this is expected to rise to 10 million.

<HEADLINE> Logging Declines, Wildfires Studied  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An analysis by a bipartisan congressional
research group found little or no connection between wildfires and
the decline in timber harvests on federal land.
</P>
<P>
   ''The acres burned in any particular year appear to be at most
weakly related to the volume of timber harvested,'' according to
the report by the Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., requested the report and released it
Thursday to try to stem criticism about what is to blame for the
worst wildfire season in the West in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is that this is a problem that cries out for an
examination that goes far deeper than the next election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush and GOP Montana
Gov. Marc Racicot have said the federal government shared some of
the blame for the blazes that have scorched million of acres.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing timber and recreation interests also have
linked the fires and Clinton administration forest policies.
</P>
<P>
   Timber harvests have dropped about 70 percent in the last decade
as a result of lawsuits and Forest Service policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden asked the Congressional Research Service to examine Forest
Service timber harvests and acres burned on agency land from 1980
through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that two of the four worst fire years -- 1987 and
1988 -- occurred during the peak timber harvests of the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service harvested nearly 12.7 billion board feet of
timber in 1987 and 12.6 billion board feet in 1988 across the 192
million acres of federal land the agency oversees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Timber harvesting removes the relatively large diameter wood
that can be coverted into wood products, but leaves behind the
small material, especially twigs and needles,'' report author Ross
Gorte wrote. ''The concentration of these 'fine fuels' on the
forest floor increases the rate of spread of wildfires.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two worst fire years, 1994 and 1996, occurred during
low timber harvest years.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jumper, a spokesman for the American Forest and Paper
Association, said the analysis does not change his view that the
decline in timber harvests has been a factor in the wildfires. He
said it stands to reason that if there is more wood in forests,
there is a better possibility of a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, as bad as it is, will probably pale compared to
future wildfire seasons,'' Jumper predicted.

<HEADLINE> Intelligence Chiefs Defend Lee  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Two former counterintelligence chiefs
believe jailed scientist Wen Ho Lee was singled out for prosecution
on charges of breaching security because of his race, according to
newly unsealed affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits were unsealed Thursday, a day before the fired
Los Alamos National Lab physicist was to be released on bail. A
government appeal could delay the homecoming for Lee, who has been
jailed nearly nine months pending his November trial.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, leaders of three prestigious scientific
organizations took issue with the government's treatment of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Taiwan-born scientist was fired last year after
allegedly downloading restricted data about nuclear weapons to
unsecure computers and tapes. If convicted of all 59 counts, Lee, a
naturalized U.S. citizen, could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The counterintelligence chiefs' statements were submitted by the
defense to support its petition for disclosure of a huge volume of
documents that it says shows a pattern of racial profiling in the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker has not decided whether to turn
the materials over to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Washington, who led the Energy Department's
counterintelligence branch for several years in the 1990s, said he
knows of other employees who eluded prosecution for more serious
offenses. He said his agency routinely handles infractions like
Lee's by merely counseling violators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have concluded that if Dr. Lee had not been initially
targeted because of his race ... he may very well have been treated
administratively like others who had allegedly mishandled
classified information,'' he said in the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vrooman, former head of security at the lab, said Lee
became the focus of an investigation to the exclusion of other
potential suspects who fit a profile based on access to certain
information and travel to China. Others with those characteristics
were not pursued, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my opinion,'' he said in the statement, ''that the
failure to look at the rest of the population is because Lee is
ethnic Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, the leaders of
three scientific organizations protested Lee's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we make no claim as to his innocence or guilt, he
appears to be a victim of unjust treatment,'' said the letter,
signed by Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of
Sciences; William A. Wulf, president of the National Academy of
Engineering and Kenneth I. Shine, president of the Institute of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The three organizations are independent research groups
chartered by Congress to provide scientific advice to government.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors deny Lee was singled out because of race.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 FBI agents and support personnel searched for more than
12 hours Thursday at Lee's home in the Los Alamos suburb of White
Rock, looking for any sensitive scientific materials.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Nancy Hollander, who kept watch on the search,
said she knew of nothing seized from the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a long day. We did complete the tasks mandated by the
court order, and we feel we did a thorough and professional job,''
agent Doug Beldon said after the search ended Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered that Lee be freed at noon Friday on $1 million
bail. A government appeal with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver could delay his release if the court issued an
emergency stay of the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis and the U.S.
solicitor general's office had awaited Parker's memorandum
explaining his reasons for granting bail before deciding whether to
appeal. They got the memorandum Thursday afternoon, Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   The final conditions of the release order were not made public,
but the judge's proposal had included a search of Lee's home,
limits on his communication and travel, home visits and removal of
all electronic communication devices except for one phone line from
the house.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Friday, extending broad
gains from Thursday on optimism that the U.S. economy is growing at
a healthy rate.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 41.81 at 11,256.91.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was up 46.38 at 4,252.78. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 6.76 at 1,524.44.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment figures released Friday sent mixed signals, but
investors interpreted the numbers to mean that inflationary
pressures are under control.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and
total payrolls fell by a bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the
month, the largest drop in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business, the Labor
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investors are hungry again for technology stocks,
which has boosted the broader markets during recent sessions.

<HEADLINE> Orchestra May Have Been Fake  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- In this city of many fakes, from counterfeit
Rolexes to bogus Gucci bags, red-faced cultural officials were
trying to figure out Friday whether music lovers were duped last
month by a fake Russian orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fans paid up to $31 to listen to what was described
in programs and advertisements as the Moscow Philharmonic
Orchestra. But after it emerged that the Moscow Philharmonic may
have been performing in Europe at the time and that a group of
mostly free-lance musicians had taken the stage in Hong Kong, the
Leisure and Cultural Services Department demanded an explanation
from the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still investigating the evidence about this,'' said
Mary Ann Mok, senior marketing coordinator with the government
department. The department helped promote the concerts but found
itself holding emergency meetings Friday to try to find out what
had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Mok acknowledged officials were troubled upon hearing that the
Moscow Philharmonic was playing in France, Portugal and Spain at
the time of the concerts here from Aug. 7 to Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   An executive with the Moscow Philharmonic's agents, Artistic
Agency Sovinart (Moscow), said Friday that the orchestra performed
those European dates under the direction of guest conductor Dmitry
Yablonsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong concert was performed mainly by free-lance
musicians, although up to five staff members of the Moscow
Philharmonic may have played with the free-lancers, said Eilina
Tikhomirova, Sovinart's general director. Sovinart had nothing to
do with the Hong Kong concert, Tikhomirova said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There might have been one group playing in Europe and one
group playing in Hong Kong,'' Mok said Friday night. It was too
soon to say whether the orchestra assembled for the Hong Kong
concerts had lived up to its billing as the Moscow Philharmonic,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said it was too soon to say whether concertgoers could
expect refunds if officials decide the orchestra was not the
genuine philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians and orchestra managers for the Moscow Philharmonic
were on vacation and could not be reached for comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Couple Jailed for Falsifying Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A husband and wife involved in testing a
cancer drug have been sentenced to prison for falsifying results
that helped the drug win federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   Harry W. Snyder was sentenced Thursday in federal court to three
years in prison and his wife, Renee Peugeot, to 2&AMP;frac12; years for
conspiracy, mail fraud and making false statements to the Food and
Drug Administration. They were also ordered to make restitution of
$26,000 to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in March found that the couple falsified data from
clinical trials conducted between 1994 and 1995 on BCX-34, an
experimental drug to treat psoriasis and skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the two planned to cash in when the company's
stock prices rose on news of the drug's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, a former BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. vice president,
oversaw clinical development. Peugeot was a nurse who helped run
the drug trials.
</P>
<P>
   BioCryst reported the irregularities to the FDA in 1995 and
admitted that earlier test results were misleading. At the time the
Snyders were indicted, BioCryst said authorities made assurances
that neither the company nor any other employee would be targeted
in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge allowed the pair, now Texas residents, to remain out
on bond pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very complicated, lengthy case,'' said defense lawyer
Mark White. ''We feel confident on appeal.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 45; Nasdaq off a Fraction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Friday in lackluster
trading ahead of the holiday weekend. Investors' recent optimism
was only slightly dampened by conflicting economic data.
</P>
<P>
   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 44.77 at 11,259.87.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.79 at 1,518.47, and the
Nasdaq composite index was down 0.18 at 4,206.17.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and productivity figures released Friday sent mixed
signals, but seemed to indicate that inflationary pressures are
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, as a result of recent tame economic data, the
Federal Reserve Board seems to be out of the picture for the rest
of the year,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The benign inflation figures have prompted strength in both the
financial and technology sectors, as a feeling of optimism has
pervaded the markets, Ackerman noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense is that when many market players return from their
holidays in September we may see the market re-emerge as a magnet
for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment
rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and total payrolls fell by a
bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the month, the largest drop in
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, manufacturing activity declined in August after 18
months of growth, reflecting the influence of higher interest rates
and a cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investors hunger for stocks with certain interest
rate sensitive sectors has boosted the broader markets during
recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and computer stocks helped fuel the Dow
index. Vodaphone Airtouch PLC rose $2.38 to $43.50 and IBM climbed
$2 to $134.063.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 279.57 million shares, down
from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.20 at 536.69.

<HEADLINE> How Ready Is U.S. Military?  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When George W. Bush and running mate Dick
Cheney say the Clinton administration has squandered the strong
military it inherited from Bush's father, they point to a problem
that independent observers agree is real: a mismatch between
defense resources and demands placed on U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, few could challenge -- and Bush and Cheney do
not -- Al Gore's assertion that today's American military is the
strongest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that measures of military capability are really
political judgments: Under what circumstances should military force
be used? What are the odds that U.S. security interests will be
challenged, and by whom? To what extent does the peacetime presence
of U.S. troops abroad deter conflict? How willing are U.S. allies
to fight alongside American forces, and to share burdens like
peacekeeping?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military, in power and reach, is so superior to any
other on Earth that comparisons really miss the point. The United
States has set for itself a unique military role -- not of global
policeman but of global power. It is the only military that keeps
substantial numbers of troops and ships on duty around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the largely unasked question in the current
debate over military readiness: Ready for what?
</P>
<P>
   Ready to conduct an increasing number of open-ended peacekeeping
operations, beyond the current commitments in Bosnia and Kosovo?
Probably not, but neither Bush nor Gore is likely to allow that,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to keep up their peacekeeping in the Balkans? Yes,
although the Pentagon states openly that if war broke out
elsewhere, the forces (mainly Army) in Bosnia and Kosovo would have
to pull out immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to continue patrolling the skies over southern and
northern Iraq, as the Air Force, Navy and Marines have been doing
since shortly after the 1991 Persian Gulf War? Apparently yes,
although that mission has been a major strain.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration's Gulf War succeeded in expelling Iraqi
forces from Kuwait, but it left Saddam Hussein in power in Baghdad,
and the Clinton administration has sought to keep a lid on his
military.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether to begin deployment of a
national defense against ballistic missile attack. President
Clinton announced Friday that he will leave that question to his
successor, while continuing development and testing in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said Thursday that a new Bush administration would press
U.S. allies in Europe to share a bigger portion of the peacekeeping
load in the Balkans, so that the United States could pull out some
of its troops. At present there are 6,200 U.S. troops in Kosovo, or
about one-seventh of the total peacekeeping force. And in Bosnia
the United States has a slightly higher proportion: 4,600 of the
total 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's comments sparked a sharp response from the Gore
campaign, where a spokeswoman, Kym Spell, said Bush ''clearly
doesn't understand what is going on in the world.'' She said U.S.
forces comprised a low percentage of the peacekeeping forces in
both Kosovo and Bosnia, and that U.S. allies pay for 90 percent of
the peacekeeping effort.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Defense Department's own standard is to be
prepared to fight two ''major theater wars'' nearly simultaneously.
There is no precise definition of either ''major theater war'' or
''nearly simultaneously,'' but the general idea is to be able to
fight and win wars against, say, Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon told Congress Thursday in its quarterly report on
readiness that most combat forces are ready to execute their
wartime missions, although it expressed concern about shortfalls in
training and certain personnel skills as well as deficiencies in
equipment such as anti-aircraft radar jammers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report said that in today's context, in which U.S.
troops are on duty in the Balkans and in the Persian Gulf, the
''risk factors'' for responding to the outbreak of war on the
Korean Peninsula would be ''moderate.'' It judged the risk for
responding to a second war, theoretically in the Persian Gulf, as
''high.''
</P>
<P>
   Those risks are not meant to suggest the United States would not
prevail in either of the two wars, but rather that the potential
for American casualties would be greater.
</P>
<P>
   That's different from being able to fight a world war of the
kind feared during the Cold War struggle with the Soviet Union.
When the Berlin Wall fell and democracy swept through central and
eastern Europe in 1989-90, the Bush administration and Congress
decided to reduce U.S. forces, cut budgets and close bases.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and Bush now say the Clinton administration went too far
in cutting back on the military.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Hawley, recently retired as commander of the Air
Force's Air Combat Command, blames the Clinton administration for
taking a ''procurement holiday,'' meaning it slowed down the
purchasing of new weaponry to the point that wear and tear have
made it increasingly expensive to operate.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has forced the military to use money that would
otherwise buy new equipment to maintain the old.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the Pentagon is gearing up for what has become a
quadrennial review of the military, to determine how to balance
military requirements with national security strategy. The last
such review, in 1997, was headed by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, a Republican. The next one will start early next year when a
new administration takes office.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher Friday in lackluster trading
ahead of the holiday weekend. Investors' recent optimism was only
slightly dampened by conflicting economic data.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 63.63 at 11,278.73, after gaining 112 points on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which also rose more than 100 points
Thursday, was up 22.61 at 4,228.96. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 5.99 at 1,523.67.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and productivity figures released Friday sent mixed
signals, but seemed to indicate that inflationary pressures are
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, as a result of recent tame economic data, the
Federal Reserve Board seems to be out of the picture for the rest
of the year,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The benign inflation figures have prompted strength in both the
financial and technology sectors, as a feeling of optimism has
pervaded the markets, Ackerman noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense is that when many market players return from their
holidays in September we may see the market re-emerge as a magnet
for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment
rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and total payrolls fell by a
bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the month, the largest drop in
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, manufacturing activity declined in August after 18
months of growth, reflecting the influence of higher interest rates
and a cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investors hunger for stocks with certain interest
rate sensitive sectors has boosted the broader markets during
recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and computer stocks helped fuel the Dow
index. Vodaphone Airtouch PLC rose $2.25 to $43.38 and IBM climbed
$2.44 to $134.50.
</P>
<P>
   But investors continued to slam Internet portal site Yahoo!
following an analyst's warning earlier this week that the company's
second-half earnings could fall off in the face of an expected
decline in advertising revenues generated by Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s stock, which has lost about 10 percent of its value
this week, was down $7.81 on Friday to $113.69.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 390.13 million shares, well
below Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.14 at 538.03.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Reaction  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Reaction from the Republican and Democratic
presidential
candidates to President Clinton's decision to leave the question of
deployment of a national missile defense to his successor:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush: ''As president, I intend to develop
and deploy an effective missile defense system at the earliest
possible date to protect American citizens from accidental launches
or blackmail by rogue nations. Today's announcement that President
Clinton will leave this unfinished business for the next president
underscores the fact that for seven years, the Clinton-Gore
administration has failed to strengthen America's defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore: ''The United States faces the real
possibility that countries such as North Korea or Iran will succeed
in acquiring weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.
... The president's decision allows time for additional testing of
our NMD system. I welcome the opportunity to be more certain that
these technologies actually work together properly.''

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- After nine fans died in a frenzied crush during a
Pearl Jam concert in Denmark, the Seattle band considered breaking
up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the thought crossed all of our minds, but it wouldn't
have been a good way to end it all,'' guitarist Mike McCready told
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in a phone interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McCready said the band was devastated after the events at the
June 30 Roskilde Festival. Fans rushed the stage, crushing nine
concertgoers to death and seriously injuring three others. The band
appealed to the crowd to move back but couldn't prevent the massive
surge.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam decided to keep on going.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized we're making viable music,'' McCready said. ''We
can't stop. We can't end on a down note.''

<P>
   VENICE, Italy (AP)-- A vanity case lined in red leather that
Sharon Stone designed for Louis Vuitton has raised $16,000 for AIDS
research.
</P>
<P>
   The American Foundation for AIDS Research wasn't saying who made
the bid for the one-of-a-kind case during a celebrity auction held
Thursday at a benefit gala here. Hollywood stars are in town for
Venice's annual film festival.

   Stone's creation has nine little drawers for lipsticks and blush
and a glass pullout tray for mixing colors.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gere's lion made of golden Murano glass -- so heavy two
people had to hold it up during the auction -- went for $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stone herself made the biggest bid of the night, offering
$150,000 for a portrait to be done by Julian Schnabel, who won fame
by smashing plates and making portraits out of the fragments. For
now, no one is saying who the subject will be.

''maybe around $250,000'' to fund a new home for the theater
company he helped found more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schwimmer called the Lookingglass Theater ''my home, my family,

</P>
<P>
   The Lookingglass' new home will be in the landmark Water Tower

state each will provide $1.5 million to the $6.5 million
renovation. The rest of the money will come from Lookingglass
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, with the

<HEADLINE> 'Dr. T and the Women' Premieres  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Director Robert Altman and star Richard
Gere were girding themselves for flak about political correctness
with the world premiere Friday of ''Dr. T and the Women'' at the
Venice Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Skewering yet another slice of Americana, Altman tells the tale
of a Dallas gynecologist awash in a sea of idle, affluent women --
wives, daughters, lovers, mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy bears all the trademarks of the man who directed
''MASH,'' ''McCabe &AMP; Mrs. Miller,'' ''Nashville'' and ''The
Player'': ensemble acting at its freshest with a sharp satirical
bite and a dash of the surreal.
</P>
<P>
   The vast cast includes Helen Hunt, Shelley Long, Laura Dern, Liv
Tyler, Farah Fawcett, a bunch of Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders and a
bevy of real-life shop-a-holic society matrons.
</P>
<P>
   Gere plays Dr. Sullivan Travis, a man who loves women but really
doesn't understand them. He is awash in the female sex, both
professionally and personally. His waiting room is always packed
with dressed-to-the-nines neurotics.
</P>
<P>
   At home, his wife (Fawcett) has regressed into a childlike state
-- a victim of too much pampering and too much love -- on the eve of
their cheerleader daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the chaos, Dr. T's champagne-swilling sister (Dern)
and her three little girls have just moved in with him. Meanwhile,
Dr. T's other daughter, a Kennedy conspiracy buff, thinks something
is amiss in the choice of the maid of honor (Tyler).
</P>
<P>
   At lunch before the black-tie premiere, Altman and Gere rallied
to the defense of the movie and what Altman called ''all these
questions about being politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People say, 'You made them all foolish women. Do you think all
women are that way?''' He paused over his pasta. ''I think some
women have to present themselves that way because that's what the
culture demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T both exaggerates and embraces the women who inhabit a very
particular strata of American life and what Altman described as a
''very weird place.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, he said, is ''known for two things: the Dallas Cowboy
cheerleaders and the Kennedy assassination. There's nothing else in
Dallas other than shopping -- and women in silly hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Gere's character loves these women. He pampers the women in his
life, both professional and personal, and when things go wrong, he
fixes them. But he really doesn't understand them.
</P>
<P>
   ''For most of his life, he's been looking at them from the wrong
angle,'' Altman joked of his gynecologist-protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Gere said he accepted the role immediately after he read the
screenplay. He was so eager to work with Altman that he did it
without a salary, taking a cut of any profits instead.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hollywood's most stalwartly independent filmmakers,
Altman makes movies on a tight budget; ''Dr. T'' cost just $16
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. T,'' one of 20 films in competition at the Venice Film
Festival, is slated for release in the United States in October and
worldwide in December.
</P>
<P>
   Venice has been good to Altman over the years; in 1996, it gave
him the coveted Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old director was nominated for Oscars for ''MASH''
in 1970, ''Nashville'' in 1975 and ''Short Cuts'' in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Pill Effective  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- The anti-smoking pill Zyban could help
even some of the most hardcore smokers -- those who can't stop,
despite being sick with a debilitating lung disease, new research
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown the drug can help up to 30 percent of average
smokers stay off cigarettes for at least a year. But the medication
has never been tested in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, a smoking-induced lung illness that the World Health
Organization estimates affects 600 million people worldwide and
kills about 3 million every year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that about 60 percent of those with the condition,
known as ''smoker's lung,'' continue to smoke and that quitting
tobacco is the only thing that has been shown to halt or slow its
progression.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, presented Friday at the World Congress on Lung
Health, showed that taking the drug almost doubled the chances of
quitting, from 9 percent to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''They almost doubled their chances of giving up. That's about
the same chance as smokers in general,'' said Dr. Donald P.
Tashkin, a professor of pulmonology at UCLA and leader of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by Glaxo Wellcome, the drug's maker.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pierre Bartsch, professor of lung medicine at the University
of Liege in Belgium, said the findings are important because people
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have the most difficulty
giving up smoking, which is their only chance of retarding their
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course the results show a much lower success rate than in
the general population, but these are people who were smoking
almost two packets a day for 25 years,'' Bartsch said. ''It's
important to show that something can help these patients give up.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably wouldn't be a good treatment for those with the
advanced stage of the disease -- about 40 percent of all those with
the illness -- because it may not be a good idea to mix the drug
with the other drugs those patients use, Bartsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease causes gradual,
irreversible damage to the lungs, and encompasses such diseases as
emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   It afflicts about 15 million Americans and kills about 100,000
of them a year, according to the American Lung Association. It is
the fourth leading cause of death in the United States behind heart
disease, cancer and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by scientists at the University of
California, Los Angeles, involved 411 people about 54 years old
from across the United States who had the lung illness and smoked
almost two packs of cigarettes a day.
</P>
<P>
   All had mild or moderate stages of the disease, where patients
cough, wheeze and feel breathless but don't yet need inhalers to
help them breathe. Most had tried various methods to stop smoking
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 weeks, half were given the drug twice a day, while others
were given fake pills. They also got counseling.
</P>
<P>
   When the treatment ended, 18 percent of those on the drug had
not inhaled a single puff of tobacco, compared with 10 percent of
smokers on the fake pill.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, 16 percent of those on the drug had stayed
off cigarettes, compared with 9 percent of those not getting the
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists verified that the smokers had quit by testing their
breath for traces of carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people abandoning the medication early was about
the same in both groups -- 2 percent. Those on the drug reported
temporary insomnia at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Zyban costs about $60 per month. It has been available in the
United States since 1998 and is currently being launched across
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 54; Nasdaq Adds 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher Friday in lackluster trading
ahead of the holiday weekend. Investors' recent optimism was only
slightly dampened by conflicting economic data.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 54.01 at 11,269.11, after gaining 112
points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which also rose more than 100 points
Thursday, was up 13.49 at 4,219.84. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 1.42 at 1,519.10.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and productivity figures released Friday sent mixed
signals, but seemed to indicate that inflationary pressures are
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, as a result of recent tame economic data, the
Federal Reserve Board seems to be out of the picture for the rest
of the year,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The benign inflation figures have prompted strength in both the
financial and technology sectors, as a feeling of optimism has
pervaded the markets, Ackerman noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense is that when many market players return from their
holidays in September we may see the market re-emerge as a magnet
for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment
rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and total payrolls fell by a
bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the month, the largest drop in
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, manufacturing activity declined in August after 18
months of growth, reflecting the influence of higher interest rates
and a cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investors hunger for stocks with certain interest
rate sensitive sectors has boosted the broader markets during
recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and computer stocks helped fuel the Dow
index. Vodaphone Airtouch PLC rose $3 to $44.13 and IBM climbed
$1.81 to $133.88.
</P>
<P>
   But investors continued to slam Internet portal site Yahoo!
following an analyst's warning earlier this week that the company's
second-half earnings could fall off in the face of an expected
decline in advertising revenues generated by Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s stock, which has lost about 10 percent of its value
this week, was down $8.88 on Friday to $112.63.
</P>
<P>
   Internet parts and services companies accounted for much of the
Nasdaq's gains. Global Crossing rose $4.88 to $34.94, Commerce One
gained $3.59 to $66.13, and Lycos was up $3.31 to $74.31.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 633.48 million
shares, well below Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.51 at 540.40.

<HEADLINE> Rare Disease Hits Martha's Vineyard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST TISBURY, Mass. (AP) -- Health officials are investigating a
cluster of cases of the rare disease tularemia on Martha's
Vineyard, the island off Massachusetts known as a vacation haven
for President Clinton and other celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 residents have been infected with the disease and
one of them recently died. Normally, the state only sees one or two
cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are only about 100 cases per year nationwide, usually less
than 2 percent of which are fatal, said Dr. May Chu of the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is investigating
the Massachusetts cases. The disease can be effectively treated
with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Tularemia is a bacterial disease usually contracted by a dog
tick bite or by touching or eating an infected animal. Rabbits and
rodents are the animals most likely to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, known as ''rabbit fever,'' also can be transmitted
by contact with water or soil that has been contaminated by an
infected animal or by inhalation of contaminated particles. State
health officials have warned people who work in outdoor occupations
that they may be at increased risk.
</P>
<P>
   David Kurth, 43, of the town of Chilmark, died of the disease on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The disease typically has a sudden onset, usually with a high
fever, chills, headache and fatigue. Other symptoms can include
swollen glands, a skin sore, cough, sore joints, chest discomfort,
vomiting, eye inflammation, abdominal pain, diarrhea and a dry
cough.

<HEADLINE> Military Newspaper Editor Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The civilian editor of the Stars &AMP; Stripes
newspaper, a government publication aimed at U.S. troops abroad,
resigned Friday to protest what he called Pentagon pressure to kill
a news story.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which had been prepared for Friday editions of the
Stars &AMP; Stripes, was essentially the same as an article published
on the front page of Friday's Washington Post, Stars &AMP; Stripes
executive editor David Offer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that the Army had alerted a Patriot
anti-missile unit in Germany to be prepared for possible deployment
to Israel, reflecting U.S. government concern that Iraq might
attack Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Offer said Army public affairs officers in Germany told him they
did not dispute the accuracy of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, however, said the story should not run because it
contained classified information, according to Thomas E. Kelsch,
the civilian publisher of Stars &AMP; Stripes. Kelsch gave the order to
kill the story.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsch, who has a top-secret clearance, said he could not
discuss the objectionable material because of secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand behind my decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What troubled both Kelsch and Offer was that Stars &AMP; Stripes
ended up publishing the Post story in subsequent editions, even
though it contained the same information. Offer said he had argued
at that point that the Stripes' own version should be run, since
the Post story had already been published. Kelsch, however, said he
followed a Pentagon directive which prohibits Stripes from
knowingly publishing classified information but does not stop it
from running such stories generated by commercial newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes no sense to me,'' Kelsch said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Offer said that although he was upset at the initial decision to
kill the Stripes' own story, he felt compelled to resign when the
paper was not allowed to run it even after the Post published the
same information.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absurd and it's unacceptable,'' he said in an interview.
''This is news management by the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Offer, 58, was editor of the Newport Daily News in Rhode Island
for 12 years before taking the Stripes job five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The article, written by Stripes staff reporter Jon R. Anderson,
raised ''national security concerns'' and therefore could not be
published, according to Kelsch, who five months ago became Stars &AMP;
Stripes' first civilian publisher. It previously had been run by
military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was requested to do this'' by Pentagon officials, Kelsch
said. ''I was not ordered.'' He said he could have chosen to run
the story over Pentagon objections, but added, ''I don't know what
would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the request came through Clifford Bernath, director of
the Armed Forces Information Service, a Pentagon office that sets
policy for Stars &AMP; Stripes but is not supposed to interfere with
editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bernath said the decision to kill the story was
Kelsch's, although he discussed the matter with him at length after
learning through ''Army channels'' that Stripes planned to publish
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Bernath said the prohibition on publishing government secrets is
logical. ''We can't publish it -- we're the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The government owns Stars &AMP; Stripes, which is published only for
troops deployed abroad. The Pentagon pays about one-third of the
newspaper's budget; the bulk of the rest of its revenue is from
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsch said he was upset by Offer's decision to quit. ''It's
awful. It's a serious loss to our organization. He said he hoped
the incident would lead to changes in the newspaper's relationship
with the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still in the growing pains of becoming a fully free and
fully civilianized paper,'' Kelsch said.

<HEADLINE> State Colleagues Remember Courier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A memorial service was held Friday at the
State Department for a 31-year-old diplomatic courier killed in
last week's crash into the Persian Gulf of a Gulf Air jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   The courier, Seth J. Foti, was among 143 passengers and crew who
died when the Airbus 320 nose-dived into the water as it tried to
land in Manama, Bahrain, on a flight from Cairo, Egypt. Foti was
carrying classified material, which was lost in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Foti's wife, Anisha; his mother, Deyann; his father, Dominick;
and his stepfather, Max, attended Friday's ceremony in the State
Department lobby. A plaque to honor Foti was placed on a wall along
with others who died in their country's foreign service.
</P>
<P>
   Foti, who become a courier only 14 months ago, was praised by
Undersecretary of State Bonnie Cohen, who said he ''quickly
distinguished himself as a true professional. He understood the
importance of his tasks and performed them confidently.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic couriers carry classified material throughout the
network of U.S. diplomatic missions. Foti was one of 97 American
couriers. Six other couriers have died in crashes, the last in
1963.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Relieved At Missile News  </HEADLINE>
By PAISLEY DODDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin and NATO allies praised
President Clinton's decision to shelve a national missile defense
system, saying Friday the move will help preserve the world's
strategic balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who has been rallying worldwide opposition to Clinton's
missile defense plan, called the move a ''well thought-out and
responsible step.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The given step ... will lead to strengthening strategic
stability and security in the whole world, and will raise the
United States' authority in the eyes of the international
community, especially on the eve of the Millennium Summit,'' Putin
said, referring to next week's summit at the United Nations in New
York, which both Clinton and Putin plan to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 ABM treaty with Russia prohibits a national defense
against ballistic missiles, and the U.S. administration has tried
unsuccessfully to persuade Moscow to amend the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said the decision did not mean Washington and Moscow share
common opinions about a national missile defense. He said Russia
will continue to promote nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday he is not convinced the technology is at
hand to build an effective anti-missile shield and will leave it to
the next president to decide when, or if, to deploy a national
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid deployment of the system is strongly supported by
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush. Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has been noncommittal on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said his country welcomed
Clinton's approach, saying that the president had taken careful
account of the views of U.S. allies and other international
partners who cautioned him against making a rushed decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to continuing dialogue on this subject with
the current U.S. administration, and in due course with its
successor and with our NATO allies and others,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   A British Foreign Office spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, added: We think the way forward is to consult and talk,
rather than the U.S. going forward on its own. We've also always
said we'd like to see the ABM treaty preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac took note with ''great
interest'' of Clinton's decision, saying that the project ''risks
jeopardizing the strategic balance and restarting the arms race,''
according to Catherine Colonna, presidential spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A German government spokesman praised Clinton's move as a ''wise
decision.'' The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had personally urged
Clinton ''not to make a hasty decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada weighed in as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are gratified that, among other things, the president has
taken into account the concerns of U.S. allies and the potential
risk for global strategic stability in not committing at this time
to proceed with deployment,'' said Michael O'Shaughnessy, a
spokesman for the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed national missile defense, projected to cost about
$60 billion, is designed to protect all 50 states from attack by a
limited number of long-range ballistic missiles from North Korea or
the Middle East. It is a scaled-down version of the global missile
defense pursued during the Reagan administration that became known
as Star Wars for its focus space-based lasers and other exotic
weaponry.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Russia Sign Plutonium Accord  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Russia signed an
agreement Friday to begin disposing of 34 tons of weapons-grade
plutonium each -- enough for thousands of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore signed at his residence here and Russian
Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov in Moscow. The arms control
agreement was reached in Moscow in June by President Clinton and
Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   It demonstrates a joint commitment to reduce nuclear dangers
despite occasional blips in relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   However, Paul Levanthal, president of the nonprofit Nuclear
Control Institute, said the agreement does not deal with very
important problems associated with processing plutonium for nuclear
power reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
   He said there remains no agreement on who would be held
responsible if another severe Chernobyl-like accident occurred in
Russia. And he said it is a mistake to let Russia use plutonium as
fuel rather than dispose of it as waste.
</P>
<P>
   New facilities will be built beginning in 2007 to convert some
of the plutonium into fuel. The rest will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   The process will be monitored by the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved providing Russia with $200 million to help
carry out its side of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's signed in private at his official residence on
Massachusetts Avenue. The event was off-limits to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting in Moscow with Putin was their first. They are
due to meet again next week in New York while attending the
Millennium summit.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also agreed in Moscow to set up a joint center
to monitor missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the two developments ''major steps to reduce the
nuclear danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Disposing of the plutonium will cost an estimated $5.75 billion
-- $4 billion in the United States and $1.75 billion in Russia.
Other countries will be asked to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian plutonium is to be converted for use in civilian
nuclear power reactors. Some of the U.S. material will be used for
reactors, the rest will be buried.

<HEADLINE> Latin Grammys To Be Braodcast Live  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first Latin Grammys show, to be broadcast
live on network television this month, has been touted as a means
of bringing Latin music to a primetime audience.
</P>
<P>
   But it has angered some who claim it celebrates what has made
the music so popular among non-Latins -- crossover artists like
Ricky Martin -- at the expense of less-flashy regional styles.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement this week of the nominations by the Latin
Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences produced a boycott threat from
a Latin music label and the criticism of at least one artist who
said there aren't enough popular Mexican styles -- like norteno,
tejano and ranchera -- nominated for the biggest awards.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Estefan Jr., who is married to singer Gloria Estefan and
nominated for six Latin Grammys for his work as a producer of
various artists, rebuked those who criticized the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a time when we should be celebrating the coming
together of our culture and musical heritage, not creating barriers
that we as a Latino community have fought so hard against in our
quest for the American dream,'' said Estefan, a Cuban exile.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms came primarily from Fonovisa, which is owned by
Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa and is the nation's largest
Spanish-language music label. The label admitted last year to
paying more than $1 million to radio programmers in a payola
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Fonovisa sees a slant against Mexican music, even though
Mexicans represent a majority of Hispanics in the United States.
Pepe Aguilar, a ranchera singer, said he would boycott the ceremony
because the lack of Mexican regional artists nominated in major
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers for the Latin Grammys, scheduled to be broadcast
Sept. 13 on CBS, dismiss the charges. They insist the nominations
of Spanish- and Portuguese-language artists are representative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our process is beyond reproach. (The Latin Grammys) has
nominations which reflect a diverse population of Latin music,''
said Adam Sandler, an academy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Latin music has experienced a boom among non-Hispanics in the
past two years, with artists such as Martin, Marc Anthony, Jennifer
Lopez and Enrique Iglesias combining to sell millions of records
and generate numerous hits on the pop charts. Santana won a
record-tying eight Grammys earlier this year at the Grammys for his
multiplatinum ''Supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists nominated for the Latin Grammys' record of the year
include Martin, Anthony, Ruben Blades, Carlos Vives and Santana
with the band Mana. Lopez and Christina Aguilera were nominated in
other categories.
</P>
<P>
   During the show, 'N Sync will perform a duet with Son By Four, a
Puerto Rican salsa band, in another move to appeal to both Latino
and non-Latino audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations were determined by the academy's 4,000 members.
In several major categories, including record of the year, academy
members nominated artists who are easily recognizable to
non-Hispanic music fans.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will celebrate a diversity of genres, including pop,
rock, salsa, tropical, tejano, norteno, tango, jazz, classical,
merengue, and flamenco. Fonovisa, however, says the nominations
ignore its artists' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Fonovisa's general manager, Gilberto Moreno, told the
Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion that artists associated with
Sony Music's labels and Miami-based producer Estefan were favored
over stars who appeal to specific ethnic communities, particularly
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Fonovisa artists -- Los Tigres del Norte and Banda El
Recodo among them -- have been nominated among the estimated 200
nominees. All the label's nominees are in the Mexican regional
field.
</P>
<P>
   Los Tigres del Norte have enjoyed commercial success, along with
a fervent, loyal following among immigrant communities. During
their 30-year career, they have performed in front of 100,000
people at a time in Los Angeles, Monterrey and Guatemala City. The
band has made 30 records and 14 movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys-based Fonovisa label urged its artists to avoid the
ceremony, but it was unclear if any were going to follow suit.
Sandler said he was unable to get in contact with Moreno, but had
spoken with some Fonovisa acts, including Marco Antonio Solis, and
said they planned to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second controversy surrounding the Latin Grammys.
Organizers had considered holding the show in Miami, but the
Miami-Dade county's anti-Cuba ban would have prevented Cuban
artists from performing, and knocked the city out of the running.

<HEADLINE> CDC Measures Exposure to Chemicals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government scientists have discovered that
people's bodies absorb questionable chemicals used in such everyday
products as fingernail polish -- some, particularly in young women,
at levels that raise questions about possible health effects.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are chemicals called phthalates. Animal studies suggest
large amounts of certain phthalates may disrupt normal hormone
function and cause birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals, pronounced ''tha-lates,'' are found in numerous
products: plastic toys, medical equipment, food packaging,
cosmetics, varnishes, adhesives. But it was uncertain how much
people absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
tested urine from 289 adults and reported Friday that they found a
surprise: The most common phthalates -- ones environmentalists have
argued make toys and medical equipment dangerous -- float in
people's bodies only at low levels.
</P>
<P>
   But the body levels of three chemicals used in cosmetics and
solvents were higher than anticipated -- in some cases, higher than
other well-studied pollutants like PCBs, CDC lead researcher John
Brock said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Those found at the highest levels are diethyl phthalate, or DEP;
dibutyl phthalate, DBP; and benzylbutyl phthalate, BzBP.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most surprising thing was that the highest exposures (of
DBP) are in women of childbearing age. That's not where you want to
have them, when dealing with compounds that cause birth defects,''
said phthalate expert Paul M.D. Foster of the Chemical Industry
Institute of Toxicology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even women with the highest levels had 100 times fewer
phthalates in their bodies than the level that caused birth defects
in animals, Foster said. Nor do phthalates build up in the body --
they're excreted within days.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether repeated exposure might be harmful,
something the government is studying.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's study doesn't ''talk about any health effects at all,''
cautioned Brock, whose data was published in the journal
Environmental Health Perspectives. ''It would be premature for
people to assume this means anything other than we are exposed to
these compounds.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Discuss China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of delay, the Senate is taking up
House-passed legislation next week that would extend normal trade
relations to China, a priority of President Clinton that remains
snarled in a dispute over Chinese exports of military technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who wants to punish China with
sanctions if it violates international nonproliferation nuclear
agreements, expects to use the Senate debate to bring the arms
issue to a head. The move could scuttle the trade agreement this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, unable to get a vote on his measure before the summer
recess, says he sees little choice other than to attach it as an
amendment to the China trade bill, which passed the House in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless they change their mind, it looks like I'm not going to
get a separate vote,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and business lobbyists have scurried for weeks in
search of a lower-profile vehicle they could attach Thompson's
measure to without objection, but none has been found.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really see anything that would lend itself to that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To appease critics, Thompson and his measure's co-sponsor, Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., have revised their proposal to target
countries other than China deemed to be potentially major suppliers
of dangerous technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The new version also gives the president more flexibility,
making sanctions against a foreign government discretionary rather
than mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   But with Congress in session for only four weeks to complete all
work on tax and spending bills before adjourning for the election,
free traders argue that adding the Thompson language to the China
trade bill would doom it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would be saying no to a permanent China trade bill this
year,'' said Michael Siegel, a spokesman for China trade advocate
Sen. Max Baucus D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Business and agriculture groups who see China as the biggest
untapped market for U.S. exports as well as a future location for
low-cost factories have been lobbying against Thompson's measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to try to fight all amendments and try to keep the
bill clean,'' said Bill Morley, vice president of congressional
affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also opposes tying arms sanctions to trade with China.
''It unnecessarily limits the president's flexibility in conducting
foreign policy,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said he would
vote for Thompson's amendment, but finds himself under pressure not
to let it become part of the trade bill. ''I think it's going to be
close. We may have to have Al Gore come up here and break a tie,''
said John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott. As vice president, the
Democratic presidential candidate is Senate president but votes
only to break ties.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and his supporters maintain the new sanctions threat is
needed because Clinton has been reluctant to use existing law to
punish China for selling arms to Pakistan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general problem is the Chinese don't think we're serious
about this,'' said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin
Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson doesn't know whether he'll prevail. On the one hand, a
vote against a nonproliferation measure is ''a very untenable
election-year position,'' he said. On the other, he doesn't expect
to win any new converts to his side.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just have concerns that this will irritate the Chinese at
a time when they're trying to expand trade with China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Thompson bill is S. 2645. The trade bills are H.R. 4444 and
S. 2277.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Punts Defense Decision  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he is not
convinced the technology is at hand to build an effective
anti-missile shield and will leave it to the next president -- Al
Gore or George W. Bush -- to decide when, or if, to deploy a
national missile defense that is prohibited by a 1972 arms control
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not move forward until we have absolute confidence
that the system will work,'' Clinton said in a speech at Georgetown
University explaining why he believes it is too early to commit the
United States to missile defense. He ordered the Pentagon to pursue
a ''robust program'' to prove the effectiveness of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bush reiterated that if elected he would deploy a
missile defense ''at the earliest possible date.'' He characterized
Clinton's decision as evidence of failed leadership on national
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not say what kind of missile defense he would advocate,
but in the past he has said he favored a system that could defend
not only the United States but also its allies -- an approach that
the Clinton administration and many private defense experts say
would take longer to bear fruit than Clinton's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Gore welcomed Clinton's decision as providing needed time to
more thoroughly test the technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I welcome the opportunity to be more certain that these
technologies actually work together properly,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of Clinton's decision is that the Pentagon's 2005
target date for having an initial, limited means of defending all
50 states against attack by a small number of ballistic missiles
has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain that schedule, Clinton would have had to authorize
the Pentagon -- before the end of this year -- to award contracts for
initial construction on Alaska's Shemya Island of a powerful new
radar that would provide the missile-tracking capability needed for
an effective missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision likely means that work on the Shemya radar
cannot begin before 2002, which means that a national missile
defense could not be completed before 2006 at the earliest. The
decision gives the next president leeway to restructure the program
or reorder its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also pleased the Russian government, which, along
with China, has led the international opposition to a U.S. missile
defense. They argue that it would upset the international strategic
balance by placing in jeopardy the deterrent effect of their own
arsenals of offensive nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision not to take upon
himself the responsibility for deploying the national anti-missile
defense system is seen in Russia as a well thought-out and
responsible step,'' President Vladimir Putin said in a statement in
Moscow. Clinton's decision, he said, ''doubtless will lead to
strengthening strategic stability and security in the whole world,
and will raise the United States' authority in the eyes of the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried, unsuccessfully, to
persuade the Russians to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty, which explicitly forbids a nationwide defense against
long-range ballistic missiles. The treaty allows either party to
withdraw from its provisions after providing six-months notice.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Britain, France and Germany welcomed Clinton's
decision as a prudent step, and Canada applauded as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, reaction was predictably mixed and mostly
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the decision
''yet another example of the Clinton-Gore administration's legacy
of missed opportunities.'' The House's most vocal supporter of
national missile defense, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said Clinton
chose to ''beg our allies and our enemies for permission to move
ahead with missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said Clinton
made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be dangerous consequences for America and the world
if we rush to meet arbitrary decision deadlines,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said, ''I support the president's
decision and commend him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year passed a law requiring deployment of a
national missile defense as soon as ''technologically feasible'' --
leaving open to debate when the technology is mature enough to
build a reliable defense. Clinton also took into consideration the
cost, the level of threat of missile attack and the international
implications, including the impact on relations with Russian and
European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, a Republican and perhaps the
administration's strongest advocate of national missile defense,
issued a statement supporting Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's statement today underscores the importance of
having the next president fully involved in decisions regarding the
future of the program before committing the United States to a
deployment strategy,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in July that it would
be irresponsible for the administration to put off a decision. Such
a delay, she said, would give North Korea, Iran and other countries
more time to develop missiles that could threaten the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday how the statement squared with Clinton's decision,
the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''the president
has decided the technology is not at the point where we can go
ahead confidently.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton credited the Pentagon with overcoming
''daunting technical obstacles'' in the developing of missile
defenses. But he made clear he believes more testing is needed to
validate the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the last two flight tests of the proposed
missile interceptor have failed to hit their targets, and that
questions remain about ''countermeasures,'' or methods of defeating
a national missile defense, or NMD.
</P>
<P>
   ''I simply cannot conclude, with the information I have today,
that we have enough confidence in the technology and the
operational effectiveness of the entire NMD system to move forward
to deployment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 28; Dow Is Up 24  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Friday in lackluster
trading ahead of the holiday weekend. Investors' recent optimism
was only slightly dampened by conflicting economic data.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.68 at 11,238.78,
after gaining 112 points on Thursday. Friday's gain helped the blue
chip index rise 46.15 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which also rose more than 100 points
Thursday, was up 27.98 at 4,234.33. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 3.09 at 1,520.77. The Nasdaq jumped 191.65 for the week,
while the S&AMP;P 500 rose 14.32.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and productivity figures released Friday sent mixed
signals, but seemed to indicate that inflationary pressures are
under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, as a result of recent tame economic data, the
Federal Reserve Board seems to be out of the picture for the rest
of the year,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The benign inflation figures have prompted strength in both the
financial and technology sectors, as a feeling of optimism has
pervaded the markets, Ackerman noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense is that when many market players return from their
holidays in September we may see the market re-emerge as a magnet
for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment
rate edged up to 4.1 percent in August and total payrolls fell by a
bigger-than-expected 105,000 during the month, the largest drop in
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the decline in total employment, which is seasonally
adjusted, came from the departure of 158,000 temporary Census
workers and the impact of striking workers at Verizon, the nation's
largest local phone company and wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, manufacturing activity declined in August after 18
months of growth, reflecting the influence of higher interest rates
and a cooling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investor hunger for stocks with certain interest
rate sensitive sectors has boosted the broader markets in recent
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and computer stocks helped lift the Dow index
Friday. Vodafone Airtouch PLC rose $3.19 to $44.31 and IBM climbed
$1.56 to $133.63.
</P>
<P>
   But investors continued to slam Internet portal site Yahoo!
following an analyst's warning earlier this week that the company's
second-half earnings could fall off in the face of an expected
decline in advertising revenues generated by Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s stock, which has lost about 10 percent of its value
this week, was down $7.56 on Friday at $113.94.
</P>
<P>
   Internet parts and services companies accounted for much of the
Nasdaq's gains. Global Crossing rose $5.06 to $35.13, Commerce One
gained $3.47 to $66, and Lycos was up $3.63 at $74.63.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 3-to-2 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 948.81 million
shares, well below Thursday's pace and one of the lowest figures
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index closed up 4.02 at 541.91.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.72 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.78 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
1.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.84 percent.

<HEADLINE> Testimony on White House E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills
testified Friday she did not speak with President Clinton or senior
aides about a computer error that kept her office from reviewing
thousands of e-mail messages under subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   She also indicated she took a hands-off role in overseeing a
1998 search to determine if the glitch prevented subpoenaed e-mails
from being turned over to investigators in the Monica Lewinsky
case.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative legal group Judicial Watch, which brought the
lawsuit that uncovered the missing e-mails, contends the White
House knew the scope of the problem and found it a convenient
excuse for not turning over e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   White House witnesses have said a ''disconnect'' between lawyers
and technicians left the legal staff unaware of the matter's
severity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth has been holding
hearings for several weeks to determine how to retrieve the
thousands of messages that were not properly archived from
September 1996 to November 1998. Technicians are now trying to
restore the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said she assigned White House lawyer Michelle Peterson in
June 1998 to compare messages submitted to Independent Counsel Ken
Starr's office with ones produced by another search by technicians
of White House e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers wanted to determine if that second search
had produced missing messages under subpoena; they found none.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said she did not know how the technicians' search was
performed or what e-mail accounts it included. She said she did not
give Peterson specific instructions on how to compare messages.
</P>
<P>
   Mills also said she told her boss, White House counsel Charles
Ruff, of the findings, but did not put it in the form of a written
report.
</P>
<P>
   Mills' testimony frustrated attempts by her questioner, Judicial
Watch lawyer Larry Klayman, to portray the test as willfully
slipshod and designed to produce an answer her office wanted to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ''You didn't want to know'' if e-mails hadn't been turned over,
Klayman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't agree with that characterization,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman also sought to link knowledge of the problem and the
faulty test to Clinton, insinuating she was close to the president
because he recommended her for White House counsel, a job she
turned down. Mills left the White House last October.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said she could not recall talking with White House chief
of staff John Podesta about the problem. Her conversations about
the missing e-mails were limited to Peterson and Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems became public in February in a $90 million
class-action suit filed by Judicial Watch, which has filed several
lawsuits against Clinton since 1994. The lawsuit involves FBI
background files gathered in the White House on hundreds of
appointees from the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth recessed the hearing for at least a week, and will make
a decision later to either close the hearing or bring in more
witnesses. Klayman wants to question White House chief of staff
John Podesta and Virginia Apuzzo, the former assistant t the
president for management and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth indicated his decision may come before Sept. 15.

<HEADLINE> Latin Grammys To Be Broadcast Live  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first Latin Grammys show, to be broadcast
live on network television this month, has been touted as a means
of bringing Latin music to a primetime audience.
</P>
<P>
   But it has angered some who claim it celebrates what has made
the music so popular among non-Latins -- crossover artists like
Ricky Martin -- at the expense of less-flashy regional styles.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement this week of the nominations by the Latin
Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences produced a boycott threat from
a Latin music label and the criticism of at least one artist who
said there aren't enough popular Mexican styles -- like norteno,
tejano and ranchera -- nominated for the biggest awards.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Estefan Jr., who is married to singer Gloria Estefan and
nominated for six Latin Grammys for his work as a producer of
various artists, rebuked those who criticized the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a time when we should be celebrating the coming
together of our culture and musical heritage, not creating barriers
that we as a Latino community have fought so hard against in our
quest for the American dream,'' said Estefan, a Cuban exile.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms came primarily from Fonovisa, which is owned by
Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa and is the nation's largest
Spanish-language music label. The label admitted last year to
paying more than $1 million to radio programmers in a payola
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Fonovisa sees a slant against Mexican music, even though
Mexicans represent a majority of Hispanics in the United States.
Pepe Aguilar, a ranchera singer, said he would boycott the ceremony
because the lack of Mexican regional artists nominated in major
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers for the Latin Grammys, scheduled to be broadcast
Sept. 13 on CBS, dismiss the charges. They insist the nominations
of Spanish- and Portuguese-language artists are representative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our process is beyond reproach. (The Latin Grammys) has
nominations which reflect a diverse population of Latin music,''
said Adam Sandler, an academy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Latin music has experienced a boom among non-Hispanics in the
past two years, with artists such as Martin, Marc Anthony, Jennifer
Lopez and Enrique Iglesias combining to sell millions of records
and generate numerous hits on the pop charts. Santana won a
record-tying eight Grammys earlier this year at the Grammys for his
multiplatinum ''Supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists nominated for the Latin Grammys' record of the year
include Martin, Anthony, Ruben Blades, Carlos Vives and Santana
with the band Mana. Lopez and Christina Aguilera were nominated in
other categories.
</P>
<P>
   During the show, 'N Sync will perform a duet with Son By Four, a
Puerto Rican salsa band, in another move to appeal to both Latino
and non-Latino audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations were determined by the academy's 4,000 members.
In several major categories, including record of the year, academy
members nominated artists who are easily recognizable to
non-Hispanic music fans.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will celebrate a diversity of genres, including pop,
rock, salsa, tropical, tejano, norteno, tango, jazz, classical,
merengue, and flamenco. Fonovisa, however, says the nominations
ignore its artists' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Fonovisa's general manager, Gilberto Moreno, told the
Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion that artists associated with
Sony Music's labels and Miami-based producer Estefan were favored
over stars who appeal to specific ethnic communities, particularly
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Only five Fonovisa artists -- Los Tigres del Norte and Banda El
Recodo among them -- have been nominated among the estimated 200
nominees. All the label's nominees are in the Mexican regional
field.
</P>
<P>
   Los Tigres del Norte have enjoyed commercial success, along with
a fervent, loyal following among immigrant communities. During
their 30-year career, they have performed in front of 100,000
people at a time in Los Angeles, Monterrey and Guatemala City. The
band has made 30 records and 14 movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys-based Fonovisa label urged its artists to avoid the
ceremony, but it was unclear if any were going to follow suit.
Sandler said he was unable to get in contact with Moreno, but had
spoken with some Fonovisa acts, including Marco Antonio Solis, and
said they planned to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second controversy surrounding the Latin Grammys.
Organizers had considered holding the show in Miami, but the
Miami-Dade county's anti-Cuba ban would have prevented Cuban
artists from performing, and knocked the city out of the running.

<HEADLINE> OIC's Ray's Disclosures Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray's plan to
divulge his Whitewater conclusions just weeks before voters decide
whether to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate is being
criticized by Democrats and some legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   Ray ''is defying the law,'' declared Democratic Sen. Carl Levin,
saying the law requires the counsel to issue his findings under
seal to a court and makes no provision for a separate public
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress was very clear about this precisely to avoid an
independent counsel releasing or appearing to release a report for
political purposes,'' said Levin of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Former Watergate counsel Sam Dash, who quit as an ethics adviser
to the Whitewater probe over a dispute with Ray's predecessor
Kenneth Starr, said Friday that the law limits Ray to submitting a
secret report to the special panel of appeals judges who appointed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''His duty is to submit a final report to the court and that's
the law and it is up to the court's discretion whether to release
it publicly,'' Dash said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said critics are misconstruing his plan -- he has no
intention to release the report and only plans to make a general
statement about the conclusion and findings of the Whitewater
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our plan to make a public statement is not shocking,'' Ray
said in a statement. ''This office is not releasing a final report
or a portion of a final report without court approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray added that the U.S. Attorney's manual expressly authorizes
public statements regarding matters that have ''already received
substantial publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Providing the public with a statement regarding the ultimate
findings and conclusions at the close of this highly publicized
investigation is entirely consistent with that policy,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray plans to finish his report on the Whitewater investigation,
which examined the first family's business dealings and Mrs.
Clinton's Arkansas law work, before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   He'll submit the report to the judges who appointed him, and it
will likely remain confidential until early next year so the
Clintons' lawyers and others named in it have time to prepare
rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Christy, the first special prosecutor appointed under the
Ethics in Government Act of 1978, said he recalled making only a
brief public statement when he wrapped up his investigation into
alleged cocaine use by Carter White House chief of staff Hamilton
Jordan. Christy took no legal action against Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I recall it, the statute requires a report to the special
division of the court and that's what he's got to do and I don't
believe he can really issue a statement of findings which are
contained in the report,'' Christy said.
</P>
<P>
   When other independent counsels filed final reports under seal
with a special division of the U.S. Court of Appeals, they issued
terse statements, devoid of criticism, announcing an end to their
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised'' by what Ray is planning and ''I think Carl
Levin is exactly right,'' said George Washington University law
professor Stephen Saltzburg.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court makes a judgment on what to release,'' said
Saltzburg, a former Iran-Contra prosecutor who was a deputy
assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal
division in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   In the recently concluded probe of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, Independent Counsel Carol Bruce issued a brief statement
saying she ''will not seek an indictment of Secretary Babbitt or
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Ray took Mrs. Clinton and the White House to task
in a three-page news release in June announcing the end of his
investigation into the firings of White House travel office
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ray accused the White House of ''substantial resistance'' to
providing ''relevant evidence'' to his investigators and said there
was ''substantial evidence'' Mrs. Clinton played a role in the
travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
   That conflicted with the first lady's sworn statements that she
''had no role'' in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ray also issued a two-page statement announcing the end to the
probe of the Clinton White House's gathering of hundreds of FBI
background files of former Republican appointees. In it, he praised
the White House for its cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Levin criticized both of Ray's previous news releases this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Ray has followed this same pattern twice before'' and
''it's contrary to the very explicit requirements of the law,''
Levin said. ''Mr. Ray should refrain from further violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray responded that ''there were no complaints, from Senator
Levin or anyone else, that the statements'' on the FBI files and
travel office matters ''violated the independent counsel law.''
</P>
<P>
   One legal expert says Ray's approach seems reasonable, but is
open to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's not misbehaving by offering a general public
explanation of what the gist of the report is,'' former Iran-Contra
prosecutor John Barrett said.

<HEADLINE> Exception Sought on Reagan Monument  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A prominent site in the center of the capital
for a monument to former President Reagan will be discussed at an
official hearing Tuesday despite an agreement by federal
commissions that there should be no more memorials in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is sought in a bill introduced by Rep. Don Young,
R-Alaska. It will be taken up by the National Capital Memorial
Commission. The bill, now before the House Resources Committee,
would direct the commission to make an exception to the moratorium
on new memorials ''for a future memorial'' to Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, joined in introducing the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Memorial Commission and two others, the Fine Arts Commission
and the National Capital Planning Commission, agreed last year not
to approve any new memorials in an area called The Reserve. That
includes the Mall -- the long grassy sweep from the Capitol to the
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions were made for monuments already approved, including a
World War II memorial and one to Martin Luther King Jr. Plans for
them are going forward, though last month two dozen witnesses
appeared to oppose the site and design for the war memorial at a
public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Young's bill would order Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and
his successors to pick a spot and a design for the Reagan monument,
raise donations to build it and create a three-person commission to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, now 89, left office in 1989 after serving two terms. In
1994, he published a letter addressed to the American people
disclosing that he suffered from Alzheimer's disease. A major new
government building on Pennsylvania Avenue has been named for him
and National Airport has been renamed in his honor.

<HEADLINE> House To SmithKline: Turn in Info  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional committee has ordered
SmithKline Beecham to turn over documents detailing how it
determines the prices of Kytril, a drug used to prevent nausea in
cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee is investigating drug pricing
because of a Department of Health and Human Services report that
concluded that Medicare could have saved $447 million if prices had
been lower.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Friday to SmithKline chief executive Jean-Pierre
Garnier, committee chairman Tom Bliley set a deadline of noon
Tuesday for the company to produce the documents. If the files are
not in the committee's hands, the panel could subpoena them,
Bliley, R-Va., wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman SmithKline, whose U.S. headquarters are in
Philadelphia, did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   HHS' Office of Inspector General concluded that the Health Care
Financing Administration pays more for 22 drugs, including Kytril,
because those companies charge higher prices to physicians being
reimbursed by Medicare than they do the wholesale price.
</P>
<P>
   As a follow-up to the report, the committee requested pricing
information from SmithKline and six other companies on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline has submitted ''several'' boxes of documents but the
committee is still waiting for 11 documents, which focus on
reimbursement procedures, marketing plans and pricing, Sheffield
said.
</P>
<P>
   On August 14 the company said it would not turn over those
documents because they are protected by attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's letter, Bliley wrote that congressional committees
are not obligated to recognize attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline announced Thursday that it would sell Kytril to Roche
AG, of Switzerland, for $1.23 billion in cash. The divestiture is
part of SmithKline's effort to win regulatory approval for its
pending $75 billion merger with another British drug maker, Glaxo
Wellcome. The deal, which has been approved by shareholders of each
company, is scheduled to close on Sept. 25.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Cut Short Vacation Trip  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton began his Labor Day
weekend tasting barbecue at a fund-raiser where he depicted Hillary
Rodham Clinton as a prominent woman on the world stage who has a
lot to offer New Yorkers if they make her their senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everywhere I go in the world, people I don't even know come to
me and say 'I am pulling for your wife. I'm sorry she can't be
here,''' Clinton said at the Friday night fund-raiser that raised
$110,000 for her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a state dinner last month in Africa, the president of Nigeria
declared his support for Mrs. Clinton. On a trip to India, a woman
in Bombay spoke only of Mrs. Clinton, not of the work she is doing
to help Indian women improve their lives, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's daughter, Chelsea, has accompanied him on recent
foreign trips, but the Clintons decided to cut short their visit to
upstate New York and spend time with Chelsea, who is nursing a
summer cold.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was held at the Tudor style home of John Duke
Kinney, a childhood friend of top Democratic fund-raiser, Terry
McAuliffe. With high hopes that Mrs. Clinton will win a Senate seat
from New York, the Kinneys posted a sign on their garage that read:
''Welcome Senator &AMP; President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 guests, who each were asked to contribute $1,000, were
served pulled pork, spareribs, chicken, baked beans, salad and
potatoes catered by a Syracuse restaurant called ''The Dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very famous. Best ribs in the country,'' McAuliffe said
he told Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Being from Arkansas, the president initially disputed that, but
after dinner said: ''I come from a place where barbecue is not
food, it is a way of life. It is a philosophy of human nature. I
have rarely had anything as good as this.''
</P>
<P>
   The president intends to play golf on Saturday with McAuliffe
and others including Tom Scherrer, a 29-year-old Syracuse native
who in June won the Kemper Open golf tournament in Maryland. Also
Saturday, he plans to attend a fund-raiser for his wife in
Cazenovia, also in the Finger Lakes region of New York, and meet up
with her at the state fair, where the rock group Goo Goo Dolls is
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a restaurateur in nearby Skaneateles, N.Y., where the
Clintons are staying overnight, began selling a bologna sandwich in
a swipe against the first lady. This year, the first couple
received a warm welcome at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people greeted them Friday at the airport in
Syracuse, where they were serenaded on the tarmac by a male a
cappella group, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope all of you are registered to vote,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
A sign in the crowd read: ''Bill, shake my hand. Eight great
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons planned to return Saturday night to Washington.
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Chelsea, 20, who
accompanied her father on trips last week to Africa and Colombia,
originally wanted to join her parents in New York but was too worn
from her travels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the African trip, the day trip to Colombia, and a
little bit of a head cold has led her to decide she'd rather just
stay around the house here in Washington this weekend,'' Lockhart
said.
