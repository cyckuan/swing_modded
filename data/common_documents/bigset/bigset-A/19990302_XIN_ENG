Sino-U.S. ties on the basis of the three joint communiques signed
by the two countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income and Spending Rise in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal incomes increased
0.6 percent in January while personal spending rose 0.3 percent,
the Commerce Department reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increase, the first in five years, reflected a robust start
for the economy in 1999, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
The income figures, particularly December's, were influenced by
a number of special factors. These included a decline in farm
subsidy payments in December following one-time payments in
November and cost-of-living increases in January for Social
Security recipients and federal employees.
</P>
<P>
The incomes, if excluding the special factors, grew solidly in
both months -- 0.3 percent in December and 0.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The fact that personal incomes increased faster than personal
spending in January helped them record a positive savings rate for
only the second time in five months.
</P>
<P>
The key component of income -- wages and salaries -- rose 0.7
percent in January after increasing 0.4 percent the month before.
Government incomes surged 1.2 percent, reflecting the
cost-of-living increases. Income in services advanced 0.8 percent
while manufacturing incomes, hard hit of late by declines in
export sales, rose only 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Transfer payments such as Social Security also rose, as did
rental income as did business owners' income, rental income and
dividends. Personal interest income fell.
</P>
<P>
Spending during the month was led by a 0.8 percent increase in
services, followed by a 0.3 percent rise in purchases of
nondurable goods such as food and fuel, paper products and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods plunged 2.1 percent following a 3.3
percent surge in December, reflecting the pattern of auto buying.

<HEADLINE> IFC to Finance Regional Hotel Chain in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) has invested 2.7 million U.S. dollars and
acquired a 21 percent stake in Global Hotels Development Group
Poland S.A. to develop a chain of Holiday Inn hotels in regional
cities of Poland, the IFC announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
IFC's total investment in the project will comprise 3.6 million
dollars in equity and 7.2 million dollars in long-term loans, as
part of a 43-million-dollar package for the first phase of the
chain's development.
</P>
<P>
According to the IFC, Global Hotels Development Group Poland
S.A. is a hotel management company established by Global Group of
Companies Sp.zo.o., the Polish Enterprise Fund, and private
investors. It was formed to open and operate 20 Holiday
Inn-franchised hotels in Poland over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Global Hotels opened its first Holiday Inn hotel in January
1999, in the center of Gdansk, Poland's main port city on the
Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
IFC Director for Central and Southern Europe Harold Rosen
said that the project is designed to encourage private investment
in Poland's regions and will help to overcome the shortage of
quality hotel accommodation outside of Warsaw, the capital city.
</P>
<P>
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, has been investing in
Poland since 1988 and has approved investments of 556 million
dollars in equity and loans for 30 projects in sectors including
manufacturing, services and banking.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hezbollah Guerrillas Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Two guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, were killed in south
Lebanon Sunday, Hezbollah sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They were killed during conflicts with Israeli forces in the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the sources said,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in the country trying to
oust Israeli forces from south Lebanon where the Jewish state
set up a self-declared security zone in 1985 to allegedly protect
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fatalities raised to five the number of Hezbollah
guerrillas killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Hezbollah detonated a twin roadside bomb
inside the border zone, killing four Israelis, including a
general and a journalist.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen Erez Gerstein, 38, the head of the Israeli military
liaison unit with the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army, became the
most senior Israeli officer killed in Lebanon since the 1982
Israeli invasion.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's deadly attack provoked swift retaliation from
Israeli forces whose artillery and warplanes pounded the party's
bases throughout Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> RBI Decides to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Monday announced measures to lower its short- and medium-term
interest rates following the suggestions made in the
just-presented new budget for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
RBI reduced its cash reserve ratio (CRR) from 11 percent to
10.5 percent from March 13 releasing about 25 billion rupees (600
million U.S. dollars) to the banking system and cut the bank rate
from 9 percent to 8 percent from the close of business hours
Monday.
</P>
<P>
RBI Governor Bimal Jalan said that with a lower inflation rate
in recent weeks, slow credit off-take and a lower borrowing
program announced in the 1999-2000 budget, now conditions were
right for such a move.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the foreign exchange rate, Jalan said there is no
change at all in the RBI policy with regard to the management of
the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The RBI move was expected by bankers as indications were
provided in the finance minister's budget speech on February 27 to
the parliament here. Some commercial banks such as State Bank of
India and Bank of India have also announced their decision to
lower their lending rates.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba's Mediation Role to be Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) allied forces in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) meeting in Kinshasa Monday will review
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba' s mediation role in the
conflict-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The allied leaders Jose Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola, Sam
Nujoma of Namibia and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe are scheduled to
meet with their DRC counterpart Laurent Kabila, to review progress
in the peace process, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge Monday told Ziana in
Kinshasa that the four leaders' one-day summit would among other
issues "analyse the relationship between Angola and Zambia".
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was chosen as chairman of the SADC peace negotiation
effort to end the seven-month DRC war but Angola is now accusing
the Zambian government of supporting Unita rebels, a position that
compromises Chiluba' s supposed impartiality.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader has denied the allegations but with Dos
Santos adamant it appeared Mozambican President and SADC
Vice-chairman Joachim Chissano is wideny respected as neutral to
the DRC conflict, and is being encouraged to take over from the
Zambian leader.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the SADC allied leaders would also be briefed on
their forces progress on the war front as well as progress of the
regional and international efforts to end the war.
</P>
<P>
The DRC war began in August last year when Kabila expelled
Rwandan soldiers who had helped him oust Mobutu Sese Seko in May
1997. This angered Rwanda which together with Uganda have backed
the Congolese Tutsi rebels who are seeking to topple Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kabila then sought SADC's help and Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe
 responded by deploying troops to fight on Kabila's side.
</P>
<P>
However, since peace efforts began last year, SADC allies have
been confined to the western part of the vast country while the
rebels have consolidated power in the east.
</P>
<P>
The flurry peace talks at regional and international level have
yielded nothing and the Kinshasa summit could come up with an
allied resolution to launch a massive onslaught on the rebels and
end the war once and for all, the Zimbabwe news Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
While there is general consensus that there should be a
cease-fire followed by a peace process and democratization of the
system of the government in the DRC, there are differences on how
all that could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The allies also insist that peace talks only begin after Rwanda
and Uganda pulling out their forces first and an international
peace-keeping force deployed before they too can pull out their
armies.
</P>
<P>
The American and British governments are also in consultation
with the countries taking part in the DRC war trying to help in
seeking a solution with special envoys of both countries having
already visited some of the concerned countries.

<HEADLINE> Aid Won't Solve All Zimbabwe's Issues: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe Leornard Tsumba Monday said in Harare that people should
understand the money the government receives from international
financiers will not solve all the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Tsumba told a workshop on economic and business reporting that
once aid was received the onus lay with the government to manage
those funds wisely.
</P>
<P>
"People assume once the government gets the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank loans then all the problems are
solved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be so dependent on such measures as solutions;
these rest with us entirely," he said.
</P>
<P>
On whether the government was exerting any influence on central
bank policies, he said, "We have a considerable autonomy. We tell
the government what we want to do and they support us."
</P>
<P>
He projected that inflation would have dropped gradually from
its present 46 percent by year end.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to tighten its fiscal policy in a
bid to beat inflation.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop being attended by journalists from
southern Africa was organized under the auspices of the Zimbabwean
chapter of the Commonwealth Press Union in conjunction with the
British Council in Harare.

<HEADLINE> British Business Failures Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain recorded a significant
increase in the level of business failures last year, according to
a survey by business information specialists Dun &AMP; Bradstreet.
</P>
<P>
More than 38,000 UK businesses went bankrupt in 1998, an
increase of 6.2 percent compared to the previous year. It was the
first increase in six years, since the UK's last recession in
1992.
</P>
<P>
In the rest of Europe, business failures fell by 7.8 percent,
with Norway, Portugal, and Ireland the only countries with big
increases.
</P>
<P>
Another Dun &AMP; Bradstreet survey of 10,000 European company
managers showed that business confidence was at its lowest level
for five years.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that those two surveys provide evidence
that Britain is further ahead in the worsening economic cycle than
the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Philip Mellor of Dun &AMP; Bradstreet said: "Despite the latest
cuts in interest rates we do not anticipate any improvement in the
rate of business failures until the latter half of this year."

<HEADLINE> London Police Criticized for "Inadequate" Race Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Police forces in England and Wales
were failing to eradicate racial prejudice in their ranks, a
government inspector's report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted
"institutional racism" in London's Metropolitan Police following
the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager
Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
"There are pockets of good practise, but generally there is
room for substantial improvement," said Dan Crompton, the report's
author, who investigated how forces have implemented 20
recommendations made by the inspectorate 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need
to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his
report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week.
</P>
<P>
The Macpherson report denounced the Metropolitan Police as
fundamentally racist for its handling of the investigation into
the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, stabbed to death by
white youths in 1993. No-one has been convicted of the crime.
</P>
<P>
After the Macpherson report, the government promised to broaden
anti-discrimination laws and make immediate changes in policing
methods.
</P>
<P>
Straw has already announced that officers will soon be liable
to criminal prosecution for discrimination when police forces are
brought under the Race Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon has revealed
plans to introduce tests for racism as well as launching a major
study of what the public look for from the police.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Monday that the strongest burst of highway and street building in
24 years pushed a 1.6 percent increase in construction spending in
January, the most in seven months.
</P>
<P>
Construction was led by a 5.9 percent jump in government
spending, the most in eight years, fueled by a 25.7 surge for
highways and streets. Residential construction increased 1.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Commercial construction, however, fell 1.1 percent, pulled down
by drops at factories and other industrial facilities and at
shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
The Department said early that personal incomes and personal
spending also increased in January.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Management
said Monay manufacturing activity surged higher in February,
reversing an eight-month decline, as production and orders for new
business improved significantly.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Vows Continued Attacks on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Amid Israeli threat to launch a
full-scale offensive against Lebanon, the country's anti-Israeli
guerrillah group Hezbollah, or Party of God, Monday vowed that
it would not stop attacks on Israeli forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"There are no obstacles which could deter us from launching
such operations in any circumstance and place, as that is our
legal right," Saayed Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the party, said
at a news conference in southern suburb of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah's remarks came as Israel is threatening to launch a
sea, air and ground offensive against Hezbollah to avenge the
killing of four Israelis, including a general.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Hezbollah guerrillas detonated two roadside bombs
inside the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, killing
Brig. Gen Erez Gerstein, the head of the Israeli army's liaison
unit with the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA), and three
others.
</P>
<P>
This is the second heavy loss the Israeli forces suffered in
south Lebanon in less than a week. on Tuesday, Three Israeli
officers were killed and five others wounded in an ambush staged
by Hezbollah in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes blasted Hezbollah's suspected
bases in the country's southern and eastern areas later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the air strike on Hezbollah would continue for
a number of days.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah warned that any large-scale aggression the Jewish
state dared to conduct would lead to its abortion.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed guerrilla group is spearheading a war in
south Lebanon trying to oust Israeli forces and its ally SLA from
the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Highest Court Asked to Extradite Teenager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein Monday asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its
decision over an American Jewish teenager suspected of murder,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In the name of the state of Israel, Rubinstein made a plea
asking the court to "carry out another discussion" of its ruling
last Thursday on the case of 18-year-old Samuel Sheinbein.
</P>
<P>
Overturning a lower court's decision, the Supreme Court ruled
that Sheinbein, who is suspected of killing an acquaintance in
Maryland state in September 1997 before fleeing to Israel, could
not be extradited to the U.S. because he holds an Israeli
citizenship by birth.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his father, who
was born in pre-state Israel but settled down in the U.S. in
1952. Israeli laws bar citizens of Israel from being handed over
to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and other officials expressed
disappointment over the ruling of Israeli Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court, which made the controversial ruling by a
panel of five judges, can reopen deliberations with the
participation of a wider panel of judges.

<HEADLINE> German Inflation Remains Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Initial data for February indicate
that the long steady decline in prices in Germany has come to a
halt, but that inflation is still at an all-time low of 0.2
percent, a report of the German Federal Statistics Office said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Citing data from six states, the Office in Wiesbaden said
prices increased 0.2 percentage points from January to February
amid higher costs for package travel and holiday apartments.
</P>
<P>
The February rise ends a series of declining annual inflation
rates since April 1998 when inflation was measured at 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, import prices rose in February for the first time since
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
But despite the rise, the overall annual rate of inflation for
February remained at the all-time low of 0.2 percent, the office
said, basing its calculations on price data from the states of
Hessen, Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, North Rhine-Westfalia,
Brandenburg and Saxony.
</P>
<P>
The office's preliminary report was the first ever to include
data from the eastern German states of Brandenburg and Saxony. The
final price report for February for all 16 states plus Berlin will
be issued around mid-March.

<HEADLINE> National Unity Govt Called for in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Falae told a press conference held here Monday that the
establishment of a national unity government had become compelling
because of alleged "monumental" rigging of the elections by the
victorious People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
The APP has accused the PDP of electoral fraud, saying that the
results from Katsina, Kaduna, Rivers, Bauchi, Taraba and Niger
states showed about 75 percent turnout, which contradicted reports
of 20 percent voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
Falae, joint presidential candidate of the APP and the Alliance
for Democracy (AD), proposed that "The headship of that
government, composed of nominees of the AD, APP and PDP, should be
determined by consensus from within or outside the nominated
members of the said government."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the nominated members would constitute the
cabinet and perform the roles of the Federal Executive Council,
adding that all elected members at various levels should be sworn
in immediately so that they could perform their constitutional
role.
</P>
<P>
The results of the presidential election have reinforced the
belief that the "military is not in a position to conduct a truly
democratic election leading to the handing over of power to a
democratically elected government" in the country, said Falae who
was defeated in the Saturday election.
</P>
<P>
In separate statements issued in capital Abuja Monday, election
 observers were unanimous that Saturday's presidential election
was tainted by irregularities, but said they didn't have evidence
that they were enough to overwhelm the wishes of Nigerians as
expressed in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The statements were issued by the Commonwealth observer group,
the joint Carter Center and National Democratic Institute, the
European Union and the transitional monitoring group.

BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said here Monday that the western alliance is not going to
deploy any forces in Kosovo without an agreement by both sides,
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Solana told a group of Russian reporters in the NATO
headquarters that together with partners in the international
Contact Group, he would like to persuade Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic that it is necessary to send a NATO contingent into the
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in order to
implement the political arrangements reached at Rambouillet,
according to Russia's Itar-Tass news service.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary-general also said it will not be easy to
score success unless troops enter Yugoslavia. The presence of a
NATO contingent is planned for a period of up to three years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Kosovo, Solana said it is
complicated and tense because Serb armed forces are being
concentrated there and additional brigades and forces of the Serb
police are also being deployed in that area.

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Monday that U.S. airstrikes "may or may not" have
interrupted the flow of oil in Iraq to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Sunday that a U.S. air attack on northern Iraq, one

a pumping station along a major oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
"We responded to attacks on our aircraft... that placed our

Iraq's claim.
</P>
<P>
"We did in fact target a communications facility which may or
may not have interrupted the flow of oil temporarily to Turkey,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Oil Ministry said that the Sunday attack "resulted in
the stoppage of crude oil pumping through the Iraqi-Turkish
pipeline." One oil worker was killed and two others were wounded,

CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Swedish official on visit
to Egypt has said that his country supports the establishment of
an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium at Alexandria University, Swedish
Minister for International Development Cooperation Pierre Schori
said that Sweden recognizes the right of the Palestinians to
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has announced that he will
declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 when the Oslo
Accord signed with Israel in 1993 expires. He is rallying
international support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Sweden calls for economic aids to the Palestinian National
Authority in the development of its economy and democracy, Schori

He spoke highly of Egypt's "pivotal and effective role" in
nurturing a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East,
saying that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been striving to
help advance the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sweden supports Mubarak's initiative on rendering the Middle
East free of weapons of mass destruction and realizing peace in
this key region of the world.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Expanded Effort to Help Landmine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Monday called for widely-expanded
effort to help the landmine treaty bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF made the statement
on the occasion of entry-into-force of the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of
Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction on March, 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"A giant step has been taken, which shows that the world is
more and more reluctant to use these hidden killers. But the
real test lies in seeing that the treaty is fully implemented,
that stockpiles are destroyed and that demining proceeds
rapidly." Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Universal ratification of the treaty is crucial to ensure
that the production and use of landmines are truly abolished,"
Bellamy continued.
</P>
<P>
"Mine awareness is an essential activity. We have worked and
will continue to work with many partners to make sure that no
child in a mined area is without a clear warning about the
danger and how to avoid it," she said.
</P>
<P>
"But the true victory will come when such awareness is not
needed because there are no more mines in the ground. The day is
not here yet and it will not be until all the world's nations
act to guarantee the right of children and other innocents to
survive in a world free of these murderous devices," Bellamy added.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has been designated within the UN family as the lead
agency to educate and advocate on the landmine issue. Educational
campaigns have centered on teaching children about the danger of
landmines and safety procedures to follow in mined areas. Almost
all mined countries served by UNICEF have an educational program
in place.

In a statement issued via his spokesman, Annan said, "Today

<HEADLINE> Europe Heading For Slower Wage Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Monetary Union
will increase price discipline, leading to wage moderation and
a reduction of wage differentials in its members, the Conference
Board, a U.S. prominent research group, said in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Slower growth in wages combined with increased fiscal
policy competition among member states will support new business
opportunities and help to improve European labor market
participation rates," said Robert McGuckin, co-author of the
report and director of economic research at the Board.
</P>
<P>
The report said recent slackening in some countries'
restrictions on product markets will likely spread across the
region. Much of the new employment will be in the service
sector, but this expansion of the service sector will slow
productivity growth in Europe as previously unemployed low
skilled workers find work in relatively low productivity jobs,
it added.
</P>
<P>
"Despite slower productivity growth, increased participation
rates will improve per capita income levels across Europe,
which could create a wealthier European market for all types of
goods and services," said Bart van Ark, co-author of the report
and consulting director for the Board's international economic
research.
</P>
<P>
The report said since the official launch of the Euro in
January, this year, exchange rates between countries in the
EMU have become fixed and control over monetary policy has
shifted from the individual countries to the European
Central Bank. Individual countries will have fewer policy tools
to work with when they experience economic or political shocks
affecting their markets, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the reduction in policy tools will place
great pressure for adjustments on European labor markets to
buffer the effects of these shocks. And the report predicts that
the EMU member countries will continue to be buffeted by diverse
economic disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The EMU currently includes most members of the 15 European
Union countries except Denmark, Sweden, the U.K. and Greece.

<HEADLINE> Repairing Iraq-Turkey Pipeline Takes Time: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Oil official said Monday
that the resumption of pumping Iraqi crude oil via the
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline will take some time after it was bombed by
the U.S. and British warplanes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
General Director of the Iraqi North Oil Company Talal Ashour
Kanan was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that repairs
should be done to the pipeline's sixth relay transmission station
which was severely damaged by U.S.-British bombs.
</P>
<P>
He said that pumping Iraqi crude oil to the southern Turkish
port of Ceyhan has been halted due to the damages.
</P>
<P>
Kanan said the the sixth relay transmission station is the
essential link in the control system operating the oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
"This station is important and vital for the process of
pumping crude oil to Turkey, and it is impossible to pump without
it, (U.S.-British) bombardment has led to a complete devastation
to all thermal switches and control and communication systems,"
Kanan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that rehabilitating this station is impossible in the
present time due to the lack of necessary spare parts.
</P>
<P>
"But we shall try to find some partial solutions to resume
pomping oil," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the
northern no-fly zone reportedly bombed the pipeline, killing one
oil worker and injuring two oil observers.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that there were no military sites near the destroyed
section of the pipeline, which is around 40 kilometers away from
the Iraqi northern city of Mosul.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Iraq has protested to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan over the U.S. and British attack on the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
This oil pipeline is the major channel to transfer Iraqi oil
abroad under the oil-for-food deal which allows Iraq to export 5.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food and
medicine for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in Iraq
have intensified their bombardments on Iraqi targets this week.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S.-led western allies
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. F-15E jets dropped over 30
laser-guided bombs on communications sites, radio relay sites and
anti-aircraft guns in northern Iraq Monday, the U.S. military
said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at a press
conference that U.S. pilots had been given more latitude to hit a
range of air defense targets in no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq in response to threats from Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said attacks on air defense targets in the
western-patroled no-fly zones, set up after the 1991 Gulf War,
would continue as long as U.S. and British aircraft were targeted
by the Iraqi military.
</P>
<P>
"Pilots have been given greater flexibility to attack those
systems that place them in jeopardy. They are not simply going to
respond to a triple-A (anti-aircraft artillery) site or to a SAM
(surface-to-air missile) site," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They can go after command and control and communications
centers as well that allow Saddam Hussein to try to target them
and put them in jeopardy. So they have some flexibility and they
will continue to have that flexibility," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The latest attacks were the biggest of about 100 such incidents
in the no-fly zones since December. U.S. jets hit a communications
facility in the north on Sunday and apparently interrupted the
flow of Iraqi crude oil through a pipeline into Turkey. That oil
is used by Iraq to pay for food and medicine for civilians under
an agreement with the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands to Enhance Ties with Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands' Council of
Ministers has decided to concentrate the country's structural
bilateral aid on 19 developing countries in a bid "to enter into
what is intended to be a long-term development relationship with
these countries".
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Government Information Council said in a news release
available here on Monday that the developing countries included
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, India, Bolivia, Ghana,
Mali, Mozambique, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
According to Dutch Development Cooperation Minister Eveline
Herfkens, there are two reasons for concentrating aid on a smaller
group of countries. Firstly, there is a growing conviction at an
international level that aid only really reaches its target in
poor countries where the quality of administration and policy is
good, she said.
</P>
<P>
In the second place, the minister said, the Dutch
implementation capacity is too limited to enter into a lengthy and
comprehensive dialogue with the recipient nations.
</P>
<P>
Herfkens also said that the wishes and plans of the developing
countries concerned must be the key feature of this dialogue, and
the Netherlands will then consider how, as a donor, it can best
support their implementation.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Frowns on Security Council Arms Banning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Parliament, the
House of People's Representatives Monday called on the United
Nations Security Council to reconsider its resolution 1227 which
bans states from selling arms to both Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Adopted on February 10 resolution 1227
which " strongly urges all States to end immediately sales of arms
and munitions to Ethiopia and Eritrea".
</P>
<P>
In a nine-point resolution, the House considered resolution
1227 as " discriminatory, unfair and totally inappropriate",
according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The resolution accused the Security Council of having made an
"historic and grave mistake, reminiscent of the injustice done to
Ethiopia by the League of Nations, by equating the victim of
aggression with aggressor".
</P>
<P>
After Eritrea declared it accepts the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) agreement on the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict at the
weekend, the OAU has urged Ethiopia to stop the war starting
February 22 which has pushed 10 km into Eritrean territory over
the disputed Badme front.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the House Monday
submitted its resolution to the United Nations Economic Commission
for Africa, charging Eritrea with "aggression against Ethiopia".

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Trade Down by 17.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign trade turnover
dropped 17.6 percent last year to 133.4 billion U.S. dollars, the
State Statistics Committee announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports, at 73.9 billion dollars, went down by
16.4 percent while imports decreased 19.1 percent to 59.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The committee attributed the dwindling trade turnover in 1998
to lower prices for energy, ferrous and non-ferrous metals in the
world market and the financial crisis that forced down imports of
consumer goods and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Russia's trade volume with countries outside the Commonwealth
of Independent States last year was 104.8 billion dollars, 16.7
percent less than the previous year, Itar-Tass reported.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ends its Peace Mission in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The flag of the United Nations
descended slowly Monday froDiallo, U.N. Special Envoy to Angola said at a
brief ceremony of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
However, Diallo said that he was vcountry.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official blamed Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) for
"deceiving the international community and the U.N. in carrying
out the Lusaka Peace Protocol", sayithe
crisis- ridden country by bringing about the national elections in
1992 and signing of the 1994 Lusaka peace deal, since it started
its involvement in Angolan affairs in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The U. N. has sent about 7,000 peace observers to Angola, with
a budget of about two billion U.S. dollars during its 10 years of
peace mission.
</P>
<P>
After civil war renewed late last year, the two sides in Angola
all blamed the United Nations for failing to stop the war and
demanded it end its mission in Angola. Hence the U.N. Security
Council passed a resolution on February 26, declaring that it
would end its peace mission in Angola as of the same day.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Control Food Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik said here Monday that the government will exercise
"strict control" on foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
"Food prices are as important to the government as the
availability of foodstuffs on the market," said Kulik, who is in
charge of agriculture and related industries.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet cannot disregard food prices as the minimum
required for subsistence has increased by almost 80 percent since
August 17," Kulik said, referring to the date when the previous
government of Sergei Kiriyenko moved to devalue the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The national currency has since dropped to almost 23 to the
U.S. dollar from the original rate of 6.3 to one dollar, a slump
of over 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kulik said priority will be given to regulating prices for
bread, dairy products and vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
Russian producers must meet the citizens' minimal need in these
and other foodstuffs. Therefore, the government will "continue to
support the Russian producer," he said.
</P>
<P>
As compared with 1990, the per-capita consumption of meat and
dairy products has decreased "by approximately 40 percent" while
consumption of potatoes and bread "has somewhat increased," the
Interfax quoted Kulik as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Kulik noted that food prices in the country remain
"much lower than world prices and, on some foodstuffs, two or
three times lower."
</P>
<P>
The price for grain in Russia, for example, is 50-70 U.S.
dollars per ton as against the world market price of 110-120
dollars.

CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Slovenian Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek is expected to visit Egypt early this year for talks with
Egyptian leaders on regional and international issues, and
bilateral ties.

advance the Mideast peace process and resolve disputes in the Arab
world and Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Personnel Mine Convention Enters into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministers of Austria,
Canada, Mozambique, Norway and South Africa Monday welcomed the
entry into force of the Ottawa Convention, according to a release
by Foreign Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,
Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel(AP) Mines and on their
Destruction, commonly known as the Ottawa Convention, enters into
force on Monday, March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Opened for signature in Ottawa on December 3, 1997, the
Convention has been among the fastest to enter into force of any
such international agreement. To date, 134 countries have signed
the Convention, and 65 have ratified.
</P>
<P>
In addition to banning the manufacture, storage, transfer and
use of anti-personnel(AP) mines, the Convention lays the
foundations for international co-operation in mine action efforts.
</P>
<P>
With its entry into force, the Convention has started the clock
for States Parties to comply with their obligations: stockpiles
must be destroyed within four years, and mined areas must be
cleared within ten.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Foreign Minister, Wolfgang Schussel, declared:"
Today, the total ban on anti-personnel mines has become a reality
under international law. This encourages us in the pursuit of our
common goal: no more mine victims."
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted
that the degree of international support for the ban is
significant. "The way the Convention was developed broke the
rules, and now the speed at which it has entered into force has
broken the records, while we celebrate this achievement, we must
remember that our objective remains: freedom from the terror of
mines. Canada will continue to work with its partners to achieve
this goal."
</P>
<P>
Knut Vollebaek, Norway's Foreign Minister said:" The Convention
provides the international community with a framework for
effectively resolving the tremendous humanitarian problems caused
by AP landmines. We must now respond in a co-ordinated and
integrated way, in order to free the world of these weapons within
a finite period."
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Foreign Minister, Alfred Nzo, welcomed the entry
into force of the Convention:" it will significantly contribute to
eradicating this scourge from the African continant, thereby
assisting the socio-economic advancement of its people who have
been so gravely afflicted by the use of these deadly weapons."
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao noted that the
Government and the people of Mozambique are honored to host the
First Meeting of States Parties and look forward to welcoming all
participants. "It is our earnest hope that the Maputo Meeting will
succeed in devising joint actions against anti-personnel mines."
</P>
<P>
The five Ministers called upon all countries to join them in
becoming States Parties to the Convention, and pledged to work
together to promote effective global mine action, said the
release.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Defend Its Sovereignty: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- One day after a series of bomb
explosions rocked the capital city of Lusaka, Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba said here Monday that Zambia will defend its
sovereignty from acts of terrorism, which he said are being
perpetuated by "foreign forces".
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after visiting Angolan embassy and four
other scenes, where the explosions occurred Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia is not interested in going to war with any
country and urged the world community to condemn the attacks in
the strongest terms.
</P>
<P>
"If any country is exporting violence and terrorism, we are not
 interested and we will defend ourselves. We will continue to be
clean and violence is not our character of politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
His government will thoroughly investigate the incidents and
has already contacted the Unites States and other countries to
help investigate the terrorist acts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba castigated some politicians for being unpatriotic by
seemingly supporting allegations that Zambia is supplying arms to
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He urged the politicians to put first the sovereignty and
integrity of their country and support the government of the day
in trying to resolve conflicts, especially in the face of the
threat of war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Chiluba said Zambian embassy in Luanda, the capital
of Angola, is safe and his government is constantly in touch with
the embassy officials to monitor the security situation.
</P>
<P>
Lois Perdigao,charge d'affaires of the Angolan embassy, told
visiting Chiluba that the Angolan government has instructed the
embassy officials to cooperate with the Zambian government in the
investigations of the explosion, which left one Angolan security
officer dead and another wounded.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba visited Ibex Hill area where Zambia Electricity Supply
Corporation (ZESCO) pylons were uprooted by bombs and Chilanga
where the main pipe supplying water from Kafue to Lusaka was
damaged.
</P>
<P>
The president also visited Zambia Publishing House Flats and a
foot bridge near the downtown center, where bombs also exploded
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Recently Angola has repeatedly accused Zambia of supplying arms
to UNITA rebels and threatened to take military actions against
those countries including Zambia.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's opposition United Party
for National Development (UPND) has joined other organizations in
condemning the series of bombings which rocked Lusaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-chairman of the party, Love Mutesa, said here Monday that
some enemies of peace are trying to take advantage of the gun
running allegations to provoke Angola to hit Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement he condemned the bombings, which left one dead
and another injured.
</P>
<P>
He said the allegations that Zambia is involved in the supply
of arms to the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) are serious and should be investigated by independent
teams such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
He urged President Frederick Chiluba to focus more of his
attention on the growing insecurity in the country and promote
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Primary Education Teachers Union of Zambia has also
strongly condemned the bombings and called on all opposition
parties to unite and condemn the perpetrators of violence.
</P>
<P>
The union said Zambia needs a stable environment where children
 could complete their education.
</P>
<P>
The Economics Association of Zambia said the explosions are
sending wrong signals to investors and that the situation should
not be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the culprits should be brought to
book in order to restore confidence in foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Recently Angola repeatedly accused Zambia of supplying arms to
UNITA and threatened to take military actions against those
countries supporting UNITA.

UNITED NATIONS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has attached the highest importance to Nigerian return to
civilians rule, hoping that the ongoing elections can constitute
"a major positive step" forward in the transition to democracy, a
statement, issued on Monday through the U.N. chief's spokesman,
said.
</P>
<P>
"As you are aware, the Secretary-General has closely followed
the ongoing process of democratization in Nigeria, particularly
following his visit to (the capital) Abuja last year," the
statement said, "He attaches the highest importance to Nigeria's
return to civilian rule and hopes that these elections will
contribute a major positive step in the transition to democracy."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has been informed of the provisional
results of the presidential elections of Saturday, February 27,
1999 as published by the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has been providing technical assistance to
INEC throughout the electoral process and has also provided

</P>
<P>
"It appears that Mr. Olsegun Obassanjo has received a majority
of the votes cast," the statement said.

General Obassanjo, a former military ruler who campaigned as
the only man capable of holding together this vibrant and
fractious country, on Sunday scored an overwhelming victory to

<HEADLINE> UAE Complains About Iran's Move on Disputed Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Monday lodged a complaint with the Arab League over Iran's
opening of a municipal office and an educational complex on the
disputed island of Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
The UAE denounced the move as a breach of the memorandum of
understanding reached between the two countries, said Mohamed
Ahmed al-Mahmoud, UAE permanent delegate to the league.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after handing the complaint to Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran has opened a municipal office on Abu Musa for its local
elections last Friday, the first since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran started a nine-day military exercise Saturday in the
Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, which includes the seas around
Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran have claimed sovereignty over the three
islands of Abu Musa, Lesser and Greater Tunbs near the mouth of the
strategic Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A-Mahmoud said the UAE considered all the previous and future
practices by Iran on Abu Musa as "provocative and unwarranted."
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE have expressed readiness to resolve the
dispute by peaceful means. But the UAE favors a solution through
international arbitration while Iran insists on bilateral
negotiations.

LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets finished
deep in the red Monday owing to opening falls on Wall Street and
rising U.S. Treasury bond yields.
</P>
<P>
In London, shares in the FTSE 100 index of leading components
finished down of 114 points, or 1.8 percent at 6,061.
</P>
<P>
"People are starting to bond watch," said an equity dealer at a
UK brokerage. The 30-year Treasury long bond slumped more than a
point as investors reacted to more strong U.S. economic data.
</P>
<P>
Shares find it hard to make gains against rising bond yields --
higher bond yields result from lower bond prices which make bonds
more attractive to investors at the expense of shares.
</P>
<P>
German shares finished down as these overseas factors grabbed
traders' attention with little domestic news to move the market.
</P>
<P>
The leading Xetra Dax index finished down 125 points at 4,779,
a drop of 2.5 percent.

French stocks fell back sharply on the Wall Street sell-off.
The leading Cac 40 index closed down 61 points at 4,032.

This was announced by Minister of Energy and Mineral
Development Richard Kaijuka Monday, Radio Uganda reported Monday
evening.

The minister said that the World Bank, through the
International Development Association and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), will sign the Bujagali financing
agreement in December this year.

project, he added.

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government decided Monday to continue
the massive military action launched Sunday in Lebanon to
retaliate the killing of four Israelis by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the Israeli government's
"kitchen cabinet," or inner cabinet, which comprises Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Defense Minister Moshe Arens.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Netanyahu held further consultations with
the wider security cabinet.

Party of God, were killed in south Lebanon Sunday, Hezbollah
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They were killed during conflicts with Israeli forces in the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the sources said,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in the country trying to
oust Israeli forces from south Lebanon where the Jewish state set
up a self-declared security zone in 1985 to allegedly protect its
north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

such operations in any circumstance and place, as that is our
legal right," Saayed Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the party, said
at a news conference in southern suburb of Beirut.

<P>
Nasrallah's remarks came as Israel is threatening to launch a

<HEADLINE> EU, S. African Officials Meet to Salvage Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) chief
negotiator Philip Lowe Monday met South African trade officials in
Pretoria in an attempt to get free trade talks back on track,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A draft deal hammered out by South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin and Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EU commissioner
responsible for Africa, in Davos, Switzerland, in January was
rejected by five EU countries last week.
</P>
<P>
South African officials said Monday that a date had yet to be
set for a planned meeting between Erwin and Pinheiro.
</P>
<P>
Erwin has indicated South Africa's unwillingness to make any
more significant concessions to the EU.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of European parliamentarians visiting South Africa
on Monday expressed deep regret that ratification of the deal had
been delayed by the EU council of foreign ministers, according to
SAPA.
</P>
<P>
"The council has thrown a real spanner in the works. It should
not have happened," Terry Wynn, a delegation member, told the
trade committee of the South African National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"All we can say is that you still have a lot of friends who are
battling hard to make sure that this decision is overturned. And
it will be overturned."
</P>
<P>
Wynn said he had spoken to Pinheiro last Thursday, who was
confident that the outstanding issues could be resolved within a
month.
</P>
<P>
Wynn claimed it came as a shock to everyone -- other than the
five countries which objected to the Davos accord -- that the deal
had been blocked.
</P>
<P>
The five countries are France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
Hadar Cars, another delegation member, said: "It is one
country, and why not say it openly -- Spain -- that is the
problem.
</P>
<P>
"There must be some kind of pressure put on Spain... to find a
solution that is acceptable to Spain."
</P>
<P>
The South African parliamentarians expressed their anger and
disappointment at EU's failure to ratify the deal in strong terms.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Rob Davies said the chances of the deal
being passed by the country's first democratically elected
parliament were very slim as it was to be dissolved before the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
The Davos accord envisions EU markets being opened to 95
percent of South African exports over a 10-year period, and South
Africa removing barriers to 86 percent of EU exports over 12
years.
</P>
<P>
The EU council of foreign minister is like to consider the deal
again on March 22.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Filings by Americans Hit New High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of bankruptcy
petitions filed by Americans in 1998 increased to a new high of
more than 1.44 million, or 2.7 percent more than the 1.4 million
filed in 1997, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.39 million individuals and 44,000 businesses sought
protection from creditors in federal bankruptcy courts last year,
the data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts showed.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, about 1.35 million individuals and 54,000 businesses
sought such protection while the total bankruptcy filings were up
19 percent over the 1996 level.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal law provides various kinds of protection for
debtors.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy code's Chapter 7 lets individuals keep certain
belongings while selling off other property to repay creditors.
Companies that file under Chapter 7 sell off all assets and cease
doing business.
</P>
<P>
As in past years, most bankruptcy filings -- 1.03 million -- were
filed under Chapter 7 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The code's Chapter 13 lets debtors repay creditors in
installments, in full or in part, over a period of years. Nearly
390,000 individuals and more than 8,200 companies filed under that
chapter last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,500 businesses invoked the code's Chapter 11 last
year, which allowed them to reorganize and continue operations
while devising a plan to pay off debts.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy code's Chapter 12, designed to meet the needs of
financially distressed family farmers, was used in 807 filings
last year.

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen will leave Thursday on an eight-day Middle East tour which
will include visits to U.S. forces in the region and talks with
senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will hold talks with his counterparts and other officials

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cautiously Welcomes Nigerian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Monday welcomed
Nigeria's weekend presidential election but said that any claims
of vote irregularities should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria's transition to civilian rule is one of the most
significant events to happen in Africa this year," said U.S.
National Security Council spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's electoral commission declared General Olusegun
Obasanjo Nigeria's president-elect on Monday but the vote was
immediately challenged by his rival, Olu Falae, who cited reports
of fraud and called the election a farce.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly look forward to working with Nigeria as they
undertake this important step," Leavy said. "It's clear that a
Nigeria that is democratic and protects human and civilian rights
can be an anchor for the new Africa."
</P>
<P>
Foreign observers, including former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter, questioned the election's results, saying there was a wide
disparity between the number of voters observed at the polling
stations and the results reported from several states.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the charges of fraud, Leavy replied: "Any
allegations of vote irregularities should be looked into by the
appropriate authorities."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Inflation Rate Down to Nine Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 2 (Xinhua) --Tanzania's inflation rate has
been brought down to the current nine percent from 27 percent four
years ago due to stringent monetary policies, Finance Minister
Daniel Yona has said.
</P>
<P>
Yona told a press conference Monday that such a progress has
been achieved mainly by controlling the government spending like
limiting official travels and seminars, an official statement said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tax collection has also been improved from an average of 55
billion Tanzanian Shillings (one U.S. Dollar equals 690 Tanzanian
Shillings) to 60 billion Shillings per month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yona said the government has introduced a "cash budget" system
under which every department limits its expenses to the amount it
earns.
</P>
<P>
"Stringency in the management of public funds has resulted in
stability of prices, a trend that was reflected in stability of
the local currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
On payment of the country's foreign debt that has accumulated
to nine billion Dollars, Yona explained that Tanzania would
continue meeting its due obligations in order to maintain
credibility among its creditors.
</P>
<P>
"We are forced to pay the debt because you can only borrow when
you are trustworthy," he said.
</P>
<P>
On domestic debts, the minister said the government has started
paying off but in installments.

<HEADLINE> Lantern Festival Celebrated in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A great number of Hong Kong
families walked out of their homes Tuesday evening to enjoy
themselves under the full moon on the Chinese Lantern Festival,
the 15th day in the first month on the traditional Chinese lunar
calendar.
</P>
<P>
A celebration held Tuesday evening at Ko Shan Road Park in
Kowloon attracted thousands of visitors.
</P>
<P>
A special collection of festive puppets named "Rabbits Greeting
the Advent of Spring" was presented at the celebration by the
Guangdong Province Puppet Troupe to herald the Year of the Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a wide variety of colorful lanterns were displayed
at the gala organized by the Provisional Urban Council. A huge
lantern called "the dragon and the phoenix chasing the moon" was
also displayed.
</P>
<P>
Other programs included a Chinese orchestral concert, a shadow
puppet show, a magic show, roving street acts, traditional arts
and crafts stalls, lantern-riddle games, Chinese chess games and
games stalls.
</P>
<P>
A series of performances with strong Chinese traditional and
ethnic characteristics such as the Chinese Opera, folk songs and
dance were also staged at Ko Shan Theater.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, a lantern carnival was organized by the
Provisional Regional Council (Pro RC) at the Kwai Chung Sports
Ground.
</P>
<P>
This year the Pro RC organized two lantern carnivals to
celebrate the Chinese Lantern Festival in the "New Territories."
</P>
<P>
The one held Sunday night at the Tai Po Playground attracted
some 30,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
The programs included traditional variety street shows with
performers in costumes; folk games such as lantern riddles, crafts
demonstration and fortune telling, Chinese operatic performances;
and a pop concert.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale lanterns in traditional settings, which are
indispensable on the occasion, were set at the venue.
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights was the broadcast or bird chirping in the
classic Chinese lantern setting featuring 100 birds paying tribute
to a five-meter-high phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Celebration was also held on the Hong Kong Island. The Wan Chai
Culture, Recreational and Sports Association organized a carnival
on Sunday to celebrate the Lantern Festival in Southorn Playground.
</P>
<P>
The carnival featured lion dances, game stalls, palm reading,
children's choir, singing and lucky draw.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy Enjoys Mini-Boom in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada's economy turned in one of
its best quarters of the decade during the last quarter of 1998,
Statistics Canada reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) was twice as strong
as expected in December 1998, lifting the rate of growth in the
fourth quarter to 4.6 percent -- more than 2.5 times the rate in
the previous two quarters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The year's strong close left the economy's growth rate for 1998
at 3 percent, down from 3.8 percent in 1997. Analysts here expect
a further slow-down this year, although no recession, and many
said the fourth-quarter mini-boom was less impressive than it
looked on the surface.
</P>
<P>
"It's not as good as the raw numbers suggest," Royal Bank of
Canada chief economist John McCallum said of the report. "But it'
s decent and it's consistent with a gradual slow-down in growth,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth-quarter acceleration in production was largely auto-
related, and reflects not only a rebound effect from summer work
disruptions, but also a strong push to rebuild depleted
inventories in Canada and south of the border," said Statistics
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Canadian exports of motor vehicles soared nearly 25 percent in
the quarter, rallying back after summer factory shutdowns during
the General Motors Corp. strike in the United States.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has expressed disappointment with former
Inspector-General of Police Rahim Noor's assault on former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim while he was in police custody
</P>
<P>
"That is apparently what he has admitted to doing," Mahathir
said in response to a question at a news conference after the end
of the Second Summit of the Group of Eight Islamic developing
countries (D-8) in Dhaka Tuesday, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Rahim, who resigned from his post on January 7 to take
responsibility for the beating of Anwar, told the Commission of
Inquiry investigating Anwar's injuries Tuesday that he slapped
Anwar under provocation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the act was not prompted, directed or abetted
by anyone and that he could not remember delivering other physical
acts against Anwar.
</P>
<P>
On what action should be taken on Rahim, Mahathir said: "It is
not for me to decide what should happen to him.
</P>
<P>
"The due process of law should take its course and the person
responsible for this, the attorney-general, will decide to take
action."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would testify if called before the
commission, he said he would do so as this is what the law states.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Ecology Along World's Second Longest Inland River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China is planning to spend 1.5 billion yuan (
about 180 million U.S. dollars) on improving the ecological
environment of the Tarim River, the world's second longest inland
river.
</P>
<P>
"Once the project is accomplished, a green corridor stretching
more than 1,000 kilometers will appear along the Tarim River,
which might be the world's largest man-made oasis," said Xu Peng,
a professor with the Xinjiang University of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Xu, also deputy director of the Standing Committee of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's Congress, is here to
attend the Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC), which is to open on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Running a total of 1,321 kilometers, the Tarim River flows
through Xinjiang, China's largest provincial-level administrative
region with an area of some 1.65 million square kilometers, one-
sixth of the country's total, and is regarded by the local people
as the region's "mother river."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, ecological conditions in the Tarim
River Basin kept deteriorating, as areas along the river's lower
reaches have been frequented by natural disasters ranging from
droughts and windstorms to sandstorms and frostbite. Areas along
the river's middle reaches are also under the threat of
desertification now.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the annual water flow in the lower
reaches of the Tarim River has dropped to 289 million cubic meters
in the 1990s from 1.1 billion cubic meters in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the total area of poplar forests along the lower
reaches has dropped to 110,000 mu (about 7,000 hectares) now from
810,000 mu in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
According to the ecological improvement plan, five million mu
of poplar trees, bushes and grass will be planted along both banks
of the Tarim River, while another one million mu of land along the
river will be cultivated as either cotton fields or pastures.
</P>
<P>
"The project will be carried out by two phases, costing 300
million yuan and 1.2 billion yuan respectively," said Xu. "
Therefore, we're looking forward to possible assistance from the
international community," he added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Israel Could Quit Lebanon in a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel could get its troops out of
Lebanon within a year, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that he believes a
solution will be found to end Israel's 17-year military presence
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon twice before setting up a self-styled
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim to
protect its northern towns against cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu did not make an iron-clad commitment that
the deadline would be met after one year.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks came after Israel's opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak promised Monday night that he would withdraw
Israeli soldiers by June 2000 if he won the coming elections on
May.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the Channel Two of Israel Television that "within a
year after the formation of a government led by me, I will bring
our boys home from Lebanon as part of an arrangement that will
ensure the security of the northern communities."
</P>
<P>
The tensions in south Lebanon have been escalated as seven
Israelis including a brigadier general were killed by the Shiite
Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes attacked Hezbollah targets on Sunday night
in what Netanyahu described as part of a new, tougher policy
toward the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
As Israeli soldiers suffered from frequent casualties during
the clashes with the guerrillas, there is a growing support in
the Israeli society to withdraw the troops unilaterally from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu's government insisted that only after the
Lebanese government agreed to disarm Hezbollah and deploy its
troops in southern Lebanon to prevent cross-border attacks, Israel
would put its troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the demand, insisting that Israel must
withdraw unconditionally as called for by the U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israel had been defying the U.N. resolution for almost 20 years
until it decided last April to approve it. But the Netanyahu
government attached conditions to a real implementation of the
law.

<HEADLINE> Life of Flood Victims in Hubei Well Taken Care Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Victims of last summer's severe
flooding in central Hubei Province have all fairly well resettled
thanks in part to efforts by central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhuping, Hubei provincial governor who heads the province'
s delegation of deputies to the National People's Congress to
attend the congress' annual session here, said that most of the
290,000 families displaced by flooding last summer had moved into
new houses before the Chinese lunar new year in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government provided a relief fund of 17 million
yuan (about US$2 million) prior to the traditional Chinese
festival to ensure that the most needy have ample food for the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it had distributed 23 million yuan to flood victims to
help them tide over the winter.
</P>
<P>
Relief funds and donations totaling more than 1.2 billion yuan
in value have been provided so far to flood victims in the
province, according to the provincial governor.
</P>
<P>
Other problems concerning people's life like access to medical
care and school education have been properly resolved, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers are now busy working at water conservancy and
flood prevention projects, with some of them having been completed.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Cherish Memory of Famous Woman Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
who are here to attend the upcoming Second Session of the Ninth
CPPCC National Committee have expressed their profound grief over
the death of their counterpart Xie Bingxin.
</P>
<P>
Xie, one of the most prominent writers in China, died Sunday at
the age of 99. She was Honorary Chairperson of the China
Association for Promoting Democracy.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee members from China's art circle agree
that the death of the woman writer is a great loss to the country.
"The power of her works comes from the people," said Yuan Shihai,
a well-known Peking Opera master from the Chinese Capital.
</P>
<P>
Most of Xie's works are written for young people. In the 1980s
and 1990s, she raised many proposals on behalf of teachers,
calling for greater attention to be paid to the development of the
country's education, according to the members.
</P>
<P>
So far, departments concerned and Xie's relatives have received
many letters of condolences from home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges End to Bombing in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday called for an end
to the bombings being conducted by the United States and Britain
in the no-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We get the impression that an attempt is being made to get the
international community used to the actions which run counter to
the basic norms and principles of international law," Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The bombings "cannot be justified from either a legal or moral
point of view and hinder the settlement of the Iraqi problem,
which is being pursued in the U.N. Security Council," Rakhmanin
said.
</P>
<P>
"We stated repeatedly that the no-fly zones were set up without
authorization of the U.N. Security Council. They are illegitimate
from the point of view of U.N. rules and international laws," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Remarks that such zones are necessary to protect the civil
population from repression are beyond criticism," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts prove just the opposite. The list of civilian victims
who have suffered from the military actions being carried out by
the U.S. and British air forces is growing," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Party Leader Says Visit to China Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary Le Kha Phieu of
the Vietnamese Communist Party on Tuesday called his six-day China
tour a success and said Sino-Vietnamese relations are set to
develop in the future.
</P>
<P>
Le arrived in Hanoi Tuesday afternoon after he wound up his
official goodwill visit to China.
</P>
<P>
He described his talks with Chinese leaders as "quite frank and
cordial" and pledged that Vietnam will firmly adhere to socialism
with Vietnamese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the Sino-Vietnamese relationship will
develop in a proper manner and asked people and authorities at all
levels to do their utmost to encourage the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, who
accompanied Le on the visit to China, said three prominent
achievements made during the visit have boosted the relationship
to a new high.
</P>
<P>
The two nations agreed to build long-term, stable, good
neighborly and all-round cooperative relations on the basis of the
acknowledged principles of the joint statements after the
normalization of Sino-Vietnamese ties and the consensus reached by
their Party and state leaders.
</P>
<P>
The second achievement was that China and Vietnam agreed to
sign an accord on the land border in 1999 and to settle the issue
of border demarcation in Beibu Wan (Vinh Bac Bo) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The third achievement, said Nguyen, was that the two sides
strengthened mutual understanding through talks and meetings.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Hails Opening of CPPCC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Wednesday issue of the People'
s Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial
marking the opening tomorrow afternoon of the Second Session of
the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Discussing matters of vital importance
in solidarity and promoting development through maintaining
stability," says that the CPPCC, an organization representing the
widest united patriotic front in China, is an important body for
the multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), as well as a
vital component of China's socialist political system.
</P>
<P>
"It is conducive to developing socialist democracy, to
increasing unity among people from all ethnic groups and various
sectors, to bringing the superiority of the socialist system into
full play, and to mobilizing all positive factors for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics under the CPC leadership,"
the article adds.
</P>
<P>
Describing 1998 as an "extremely unusual year," the editorial
says that the past year has witnessed that the Chinese people,
under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, have withstood the Asian financial crisis,
have overcome a devastating flooding and have achieved new
progress in reform, opening-up and the socialist modernization
drive, which have drawn worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
"All these achievements are closely related to the painstaking
efforts of the CPPCC National Committee and CPPCC organizations at
all levels across the country," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial goes on to say that in the year of 1999, the
Chinese people will celebrate the 50th founding anniversary of the
People's Republic of China, as well as the return of Macao to its
motherland by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it says, it remains an extremely arduous task to
continue reforms, speed up growth and maintain stability in the
new year.
</P>
<P>
"This new situation has posed a greater challenge to the work
of the CPPCC while providing more room for the functioning of the
CPPCC," it says.
</P>
<P>
It expresses the belief that the CPPCC will continue with its
efforts to promote unity and democracy in China, actively perform
its duty of political consultation, democratic supervision and
participation in various government affairs, and unite all forces
that can be united with.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that with the joint efforts of all CPPCC
National Committee members, the upcoming session will surely turn
out to be a democratic, truth-seeking, united and inspiring
meeting," it concludes.

<HEADLINE> Hindu Festival of Color Celebrated in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Hindu festival of color,
"Holi," one of the major festivals, was celebrated throughout the
country Tuesday with traditional festivities and color.
</P>
<P>
Holi revelers went around with color powder or colored water
smearing it on the faces of friends and sprinkling color water on
one another or passers-by in the street.
</P>
<P>
The festival of color, which also marks the end of the cold
winter, was also celebrated by people dancing to the tune of
percussion instruments amid cries of "Holi Hai." During this day,
officials go to see their seniors and leaders and friends meet one
another to exchange greetings and smear color on one another's
faces.
</P>
<P>
The festivities which got under way last night with lighting of
bonfires to burn "Holika," the evil spirit, reached its peak
Tuesday morning. Notwithstanding the ban on throwing balloons
filled with colored water, passers-by became victims of children's
pranks and bucketful of water thrown from rooftop.
</P>
<P>
Police maintained a strict vigil on Holi revelers to check
hooliganism during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday is national holiday with all the shops and offices
closed. Most city public buses remained off the road leaving the
streets free for revelers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Constructed Mosque Extension Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Upon completion of its renovation
and extension, the Jamia Mosque in the downtown of Kenya's
capital becomes the largest mosque in East Africa, which opened to
worshippers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new extension was officially opened by Abdullah Bin Sultan
Al- Dhaheri, Director-General of the Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahaya
Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation, United Arab Emirates, who
is the sponsor and financier of this project.
</P>
<P>
Several thousands of local Muslims attended Tuesday's opening
ceremony of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
The extension, at a cost of 240 million Shillings (some four
million U. S. Dollars), was completed by China's Sichuan
International Corporation Company Ltd. (SIETCO) in a record 690
days.
</P>
<P>
The Jamia Mosque, built in 1925 by the Muslim community, has in
recent years failed to accommodate the ever-increasing number of
worshippers. Many of the Muslims had to pray out in the open.
</P>
<P>
The new extension with a floor space of over 8,000 square
meters can now accommodate over 8,000 worshippers at a time. It
consists of the 1,680-square-meter main prayer hall on the ground
floor and the 1,080- square-meter hall for ladies prayer on the
upper floor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the extension provides adequate space for
administration offices,lecture rooms, a modern library hall,
classrooms and a parking bay.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Jamia Mosque Committee said that with the
 extension completed, the mosque, as an Islamic institution for
various Islamic activities, would find it much easier to conduct
its activities more efficiently and effectively.

<HEADLINE> China to Extend More Loans to Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the country's central bank, announced today that China will extend
more loans to its rural areas in an effort to increase farmers'
income.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC urged rural financial institutions to readjust their
credit structure and improve the quality of their loans as well as
extend their loans to the rural market.
</P>
<P>
Rural financial institutions are also instructed to improve
their financial services, begin offering credit, extend housing
loans to farmers, and make loans for education.
</P>
<P>
Priority, however, will be given to loans for agricultural and
rural businesses. As local financial institutions endeavor to
extend more loans, they may be able to receive support from the
PBOC branches in cases of fund shortages.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC also urged rural financial institutions to increase
the quality of their loans and reduce non-performing loans to
prevent financial risks. The central bank also requires local
governments to establish guarantee funds to help farmers obtain
loans for expanded production.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rural financial institutions are to support the
processing of farm produce, and fuel the industrialization of
agriculture, according to the PBOC.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will commit itself to supervising financial
institutions in order to help them improve their financial
services and reduce non-performing loans.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
with Martin Jacomb, board chairman of the British Prudential
Assurance Company Ltd., at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here
today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Sino-British relations have opened up a new chapter
since the smooth return of Hong Kong, and bilateral cooperation in
various spheres has witnessed considerable progress ever since.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain are both important countries, and the further
consolidation of bilateral ties is not only in the fundamental
interest of both countries, but also beneficial to world peace and
prosperity, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he highly appreciates the company's business
operation in China as well as its assistance in personnel training
and education. Jiang told Jacomb that China's opening of its
insurance market is still in the primary trial stage, and with the
development of the market and the legal system, China's insurance
sector will open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Jacomb said his company has so far invested a total of six
billion yuan in China, and has conducted successful business
operations in China and other Asian countries. With the gradual
opening up of China's insurance market, his company will expand
its cooperation with China to promote overall bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1848, the Prudential Assurance Company Ltd. is
Britain's top insurer and one of the world's leading life
insurance companies. The company now has five representative

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing today began issuing daily
rather than weekly air-quality reports to demonstrate the city's
resolve in solving its pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
Today's report by the Municipal Environmental Protection
Monitor Center was published in major local newspapers, and said
the city was suffering third-degree air pollution (the worst is
five degrees) and the biggest pollutant is nitrogen oxide.
</P>

Environmentalists said that daily updates will be of great
value to local residents and will make the public more aware of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Beijing began to release air-quality reports on February 28
last year, and they have proved effective in pressuring the
government to take corresponding efforts to deal with the city's
air pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports for January, the density of noxious
pollutants in the air was reduced by over 10 percent compared with
the previous month.

<HEADLINE> HK to Put 25 Lots of Land for Sale in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
put up about 25 lots of land for sale by auction or tender in the
coming financial year after a land sale suspension of more than
half a year, an official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meet-the-media session, Robert Pope, director of
Lands, said: "In parallel, we will introduce an Application List
of sites which could be made available over the same period
through to March 2000. By this means, I believe that land supply
can be flexible in order to maintain stability."
</P>
<P>
Despite the land sale suspension from June last year, the Lands
Department received a total of about 20 billion HK dollars (2.56
billion U.S. dollars) in premiums from land transactions in 1998
including lease modifications, land exchanges and private treaty
grants, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government expects revenue from land sales in 1999/2000 to
be 30.8 billion HK dollars (3.95 billion U.S. dollars) in the
coming financial year beginning April.
</P>
<P>
Pope said prior to the suspension, the department sold 10 sites
for housing, one site for a film studio and three sites for the
Private Sector Participation Scheme.
</P>
<P>
In addition, seven sites were granted for the Home Ownership
Scheme, he added.

Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference held a reception this evening in honor of
reporters who have gathered here to cover the events.
</P>
<P>
Director of the press center Shen Zhangrong said the annual NPC
and CPPCC sessions attract attention from the press both at home
and abroad for the important role they play in Chinese people's
political life.
</P>
<P>
As of this afternoon, a total of 2,204 Chinese and foreign

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Group Peace Talks Scheduled in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Formal peace talks between the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
will be held in May following a coordinating meeting this month, a
senior government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando S. Mercado told reporters that no
venue of the formal talks has been agreed on but the government
has been consistent that talks with the MILF will be held "within
the territorial limits" of the country.
</P>
<P>
He brushed aside the suggestion that talks be held in a foreign
country, saying the MILF case is different from that of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) wherein the Organization of the
Islamic Conference was involved.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the preliminary meeting on March 25 and 26, during
which the most difficult and thorny questions will be resolved, is
vital before the formal talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the larger MNLF, is fighting for
an independent Islamic state which the government has rejected.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting broke out last month between government forces
and the MILF. But before the fighting spread further, the two
sides signed a new cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Philippine President Joseph E. Estrada and
MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat scheduled for last Sunday was
canceled due to disagreement on security measures and the venue,
government officials said.

</P>
<P>
Spokesman Tian Zengpei briefed a group of local and overseas

</P>
<P>
Over the past year, members of the CPPCC have played an active

participated in political and government affairs by making
investigations into a wide range of major issues attracting
popular concern, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
The major issues include the handling of layoffs from state-
owned enterprises, implementation of the state policy of
reinvigorating the nation through science/technology and education,
agriculture and rural work, control of major rivers and lakes, and
the economic situation, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman answered questions raised by reporters concerning
responsibilities of CPPCC members, China's reunification, public
security and efforts to ensure the quality of civil engineering
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that a special news section for the CPPCC session will
be opened at the news center and that reporters will be allowed to
attend some panel discussions as well as two news briefings on the
country's efforts to stimulate domestic demand and protect the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Banks in Vietnam Welcome New Forex Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- With foreign exchange reserves of
around 600 million U.S. dollars, Vietnam's central bank is strong
enough to intervene should any abrupt fluctuations occur, The
Saigon Times daily Tuesday quoted a banking official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said setting rates by averaging the previous working
day's transactions rather than imposing spot rates is a step
toward full convertibility of the country's currency, the dong.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of Vietcombank in Ho Chi Minh City Truong Van
Phuoc said, "The market aspect has been included in foreign
exchange more than ever before."
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language daily, bank executives said
following the announcement of the new rules late last week that
the Vietnamese central bank's decision to adopt more
market-oriented forex rules had been taken just at the right time.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that after the last adjustment in August, now is
the time when the forex supply-demand situation is most stable,
the executives said. Never before had commercial banks seen their
buying outstrip selling so much, resulting in mounting forex
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Daily spot quotations at commercial banks since last Friday
have been determined by adding at most 0.1 percent of the previous
working day's average.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Air Force Helping Free Yellow River Of Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 2 (Xinhua) --The Chinese air force is helping
look for ways to free the Yellow River of ice that has been
blocking it mainly in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, north
China.
</P>
<P>
Unlike western countries, where icebreakers are used to cut
through the ice, China has been using planes to bombard the ice on
the Yellow River since the 1950s because the river, which is the
country's second longest and muddiest, has a great deal of silting
and icebreakers can't be used. This morning, a Yun-5 plane made a
reconnaissance run to take a look at the frozen section to decide
on further action.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, about 52,000 people in Inner
Mongolia have formed rescue teams to reduce the ice menace on the
river during the thaw season. Material and equipment have been
made ready for rescue work in case the situation turns dangerous.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Yellow River froze along a 750-km stretch in
Inner Mongolia and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and it
started to thaw late last month, so, engineers from the Liujiaxia
Reservoir upstream slowed the water flow starting February 22, and
the Wanjiazhai Reservoir, downstream, has increased its water
discharge.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Rate on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Financial analysts believe that
inflation rate in Nigeria will go higher in the first quarter of
this year as compared to the 10 percent in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Since June last year, Nigeria's inflation rate has continued a
slow but steady rise up the scale, and it is the first time the
rate is attaining two digits points since 1997, the Post Express
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the energy crisis, economy analysts said the
rising trend is likely to be maintained in the subsequent months
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The regime of General Abdulsalami Abubakar has promised to keep
down the spiral, but recent trends are indications that the rate
will definitely rise clearly above single digit for the rest of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The recent activities of politicians who released funds in the
banks into the public hands during the presidential election
campaign in the country will further compound pressure on the
inflationary rate, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
With the activities of politicians and othez cost-inducing
developments in the process of democracy, analysts believe that
the inflation rate would continue to go up this year.

JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African
Football (CAF) will decide whether to reinstate the status of
Zimbabwe as host of next January's African Nations Cup finals,
officials said on Tuesday.

CAF president Issa Hayatou and members of his executive
committee will have a meeting with a Zimbabwean delegation which
is expected to include high-profile government ministers in Accra

CAF deprived Zimbabwe of the right to entertain the soccer
tournament last month, citing the delay by the Zimbabweans in
building and upgrading stadiums for the finals and the absence of
government guarantees to fund the 16-team competition.

A deadline for bid for a replacement host country has been set

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure to Spark Next Asian Crisis: Keating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Asia would face a deeper
financial crisis as it built up infrastructure during its recovery
from the current economic downturn, former Australian Prime
Minister Paul Keating said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the fresh crisis would only be reduced if
governments heeded the lessons of the current downturn, he was
quoted by Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Keating made the comments while giving his address Tuesday
afternoon to 600 civic and private sector leaders at the Second
Asia Pacific Cities Summit which is being held from February 28 to
March 3 in Brisbane, East Australia.
</P>
<P>
"This recession has simply delayed for a couple of years the
deeper Asian crisis and that's the real one, which the recovery
will bring on again," Keating said.
</P>
<P>
"And that's the crisis of funding and the building of
infrastructure ... required to support more than 2 billion people,
to feed and educate them and then to deal with profound
environmental consequences of that growth."
</P>
<P>
Keating said the growth and development would bring new
environmental problems including air pollution, deteriorating soil
quality and water shortages.
</P>
<P>
"No one can avoid the fact that the environmental challenge
facing Asia is real and pressing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Asian governments are beginning to recognize that the
protection of the environment in the Asia Pacific is not an
alternative for economic growth but ... the only thing that will
actually guarantee its continuation.
</P>
<P>
"The next Asian economic crisis can be ameliorated but not
avoided, but only if national and municipal governments start
planning now, and if they draw the right lessons from the current
crisis about the importance of greater transparency and more
productive investment decisions -- in other words, fewer shopping
malls and more public transport," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chen Bangzhu, director of the
State Economic and Trade Commission, has stressed that there are
new opportunities to stimulate domestic consumption this year,
according to today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remark at a national conference on commodity
circulation. He said that the purchase of houses and related
commodities, vehicles, information industry products and tourism
products will certainly indicate an increase in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the above-mentioned sectors did not become hot
spots in the economy last year mainly because of lack of consumer-
oriented policies.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the new policies focus on the expansion of
consumer credit, the establishment of laws governing rental sales
and the improvement of auction operations.
</P>
<P>
He added that car installments should be further encouraged
and installment payments for daily necessities and large farm
machines can be introduced in some areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more research work should be done on the sale of
stored goods and outdated goods in order to bring about more
effective means to stimulate consumption.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) and deputies to China's National People's
Congress (NPC) left here for Beijing by air Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They will attend the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee and the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth NPC
to be opened on Wednesday and Friday separately.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Beijing, Lee Cho Jat, a CPPCC National
Committee member from the industrial and commercial sector, said
that the "one country, two systems" principle has been
successfully implemented in Hong Kong over the past 20 months and
more.
</P>
<P>
"I will discuss with members from the inland areas how to
understand this theory in a more comprehensive and systematic way,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Wu, who has invested hundreds of millions of HK dollars
in the inland infrastructural undertakings, said he was encouraged
by the strong development of the economy of China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Investments in infrastructure have low returns, but they are
very important because these projects have promoted the economic
and trade links between Hong Kong and the mainland, Wu said. "I
will continue my investment in this area," he added.
</P>
<P>
David Chu, Chairman of the Hong Kong Happy Valley Athletic
Association, said he will try his best to promote the
industrialization process in China's physical culture. "Resources
in this area should be fully tapped so that China's physical
culture will better go into the market and provide more job
opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Hong Kong Baptist University Daniel Tse said
that he will try to promote cooperation between inland areas and
Hong Kong in traditional Chinese medicines and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy Tam Wai-chu said that the past year was a difficult
year for Hong Kong and the support from the Central Government is
very important for the development of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
She said that as a deputy from the HKSAR, she will try her best
to promote and coordinate cooperation between Hong Kong and the
mainland in high-tech area.
</P>
<P>
As a barrister, Tam said she paid close attention to the
legislative development in China. She would discuss the newly
approved Contract Law and the Securities Law with her mainland
counterparts for they are very important laws for China's economic
and financial reforms, Tam said.
</P>
<P>
Another NPC deputy Priscilla Lau Pui-king, a business professor,
said that she will focus her topic on China's economic and
financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
"I will suggest that China's economic and financial policies
should adjust according to the changes of the global as well as
the regional economic and financial situation," Lau said.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy Cheng Yiu Tong said that during the 20 months since
Hong Kong returned to China, the Central Government has committed
to its promises to the SAR and has never interfered in the affairs
which are within the autonomy of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a HKSAR deputy to the NPC, he will try to
enhance the contact, communication and understanding between
people from the SAR and the mainland. He suggested that a regular
communication mechanism should be established between the mainland
and the SAR.
</P>
<P>
A total of 79 out of the 158 CPPCC members and 22 out of the 35
NPC deputies from the SAR left for Beijing Tuesday.

<P>
LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo said his first business when he takes over the reins of
government will be to restore the people's trust in the government
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said Nigeria had for too long had governments of
"deception and oppression" that never lived up to their promises,
The Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I was put in power by ordinary Nigerians. It was millions of
ordinary Nigerians who voted for me, so, I will be president of
all Nigerians," he said Monday in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"People want change, they want change all around," he noted,
adding that to make it easy, "everybody feels involved, be
involved, feel they have a stake in government."
</P>
<P>
Following the declaration by the Independent National Electoral
 Commission Monday that he is the winner of last Saturday's
election, Obasanjo said he would first focus on education, the
economy and corruption.
</P>
<P>
On corruption, he said "from this day forward, if you are
caught, you'll be dealt with. If you find me wanting, point
accusing fingers at me."
</P>
<P>
"We will start the process of setting up an anti-corruption
agency which will leave no stone unturned to seek, search and
recover whether you keep it locally or externally," Obasanjo
added.
</P>
<P>
The retired general said he is going to be president of all,
especially of the poor, as "I was not put in power by one group of
Nigerians, but millions of ordinary Nigerians who voted."

<HEADLINE> Tooth Decay Hits Epidemic Proportions in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Tooth decay is reaching epidemic
proportions in China with an estimated two billion teeth already
affected and with a staggering 76 percent of five year old
children suffering dental problems.
</P>
<P>
The startling figures have been revealed after a countrywide
oral health survey and now the National Committee for Oral Health
(NCOH) is calling for the launch of an immediate campaign to
enhance public awareness to stop the rot.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among 140,000 people in 11 provinces
and municipalities in the 1995-1998 period.
</P>
<P>
According to the NCOH, which cooperated with the Ministry of
Health in carrying out the survey, it would take 290,000 dentists
an entire year to treat the affected teeth.
</P>
<P>
Ironically 80 percent of those surveyed said they brushed their
teeth at least once a day, often twice. But the NCOH says there
are probably not using the correct brushing methods which should
be adopted without delay. It also blames the lack of regular
dental check-ups and the use of other preventative measures.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of dental decay is on the rise in all of China's
main provinces and municipalities, except for Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Shandong, Sichuan and Hubei. The comparisons are made
against a similar survey in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Dental disease is posing a great threat to children's milk
teeth. according to statistics in the survey's report which
discovered that each five year old it examined had an average of 4.
5 decayed teeth.
</P>
<P>
Periodontic illnesses have now became the top oral health
problem for the Chinese people. Nearly 95 percent of adults were
found to have dental calculus, a major cause of periodontic
disease.

military and civilian targets in northern Iraq, the Iraqi News
Agency INA reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted an unnamed Iraqi military spokesman as saying that
"enemy warplanes" carried out two raids on the residential quarter
of Ein Zala Oilfield in Neineva province, part of the no-fly zone
over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The raids damaged a repeater station on the Iraqi-Turkish
pipeline and civil installations in addition to the human
casualties, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he added Iraqi air defense repulsed the enemy warplanes and
there has been semi-confirmed evidences that one of the jets was
hit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes enforcing the no-fly zones in Iraq
have intensified their bombardments on Iraqi targets this week.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S.-led western allies
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the warplanes bombed the sixth relay station on the
Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline, cutting the flow to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of the Iraqi oil export under the
U.N. oil-for-food program is transferred through the Iraqi-Turkish
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, implemented since November 1996, allowed
Iraq, which has been put under sanctions for over eight years, to
sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian food.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Gains 21b U.S. Dollars Surplus Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia last year gained a trade
surplus of 21.42 billion U.S. dollars from exports worth 48.84
billion dollars and imports worth only 27.42 billion dollars, head
of the Central Bureau of Statistics Sugito Suwito said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 48.84 billion dollars from exporting 7.76
billion dollars worth of oil and gas and 41.08 billion dollars
worth of non-oil/gas products, Suwito told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, however, spent 27.42 billion dollars from importing
2.65 billion dollars worth of oil and gas and 24.77 billion
dollars worth of non-oil/gas products, Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that total exports in 1998 decreased 8.6 percent
compared to 1997, with oil/gas exports going down 33.24 percent
and non-oil/gas exports dropping 1.76 percent over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Total imports in 1998, meanwhile, declined 34.2 percent
compared to 1997, with oil/gas imports sliding 32.37 percent and
non-oil/gas imports plummeting 34.39 percent over the same period,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Suwito attributed the decreasing value of both exports and
imports in 1998 to the monetary turmoil which hit Indonesia in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah plunged from 2,300 rupiah to the U.S.
dollar in mid-1997 to 16,000-17,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar in
early 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The weakening of the rupiah against the dollar has caused the
decreasing value of Indonesia's exports and imports last year,
compared to the previous year," Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia's inflation rate in February was 1.26
percent, lower than that of the January which recorded 2.97
percent, Suwito said.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli army have launched its most intensive attack
against the Hezbollah guerrillas since its punitive operation in

about 20 raids against the enemy positions, while hundreds of
shells were fired, mainly on the valley of Bekaa in southeast
Lebanon.
</P>

situation among people aged from 15 to 24 has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
-- The neighboring countries of Colombia have reinforced troop
deployment along their borders because of frequent incursion by
guerrillas, para-military men and arms and drug traffickers from

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Aims to Become World Gems, Jewelry Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is stepping up its
efforts to become the world's new gems and jewelry hub in the near
future, Thai Deputy Commerce Ministry Pravich Ratanapian said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, he said, Thailand would hold two
international exhibitions and trade fairs on gems and jewelry this
year to promote the country's promising prospect as the world's
new production and trade center.
</P>
<P>
The two exhibitions, the 23rd and 24th of its kinds in Bangkok,
would be held on between March 10 and 13, and between September 29
and October 2 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry's Export Promotion Department would
sponsor the 23rd exhibition, while the 24th event would be solely
organized by the Thai Gems and Jewelry Traders' Association to
promote the private sector's role in the lucrative industry.
</P>
<P>
Gems and jewelry traders and firms from various countries are
expected to take part in the forthcoming events, which will not
only boost Thailand's business potential and reputation, but also
help local gems and jewelry producers and traders to improve
quality and designs of their products to meet the international
standard.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had also set a clear target to increase export of Thai
gems and jewelry by five percent this year to 60 billion baht (1.6
billion U.S. dollars) from 57.4 billion baht (1.5 billion dollars)
last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Arrives in Kuwait to Resume Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdul Ilah Al-Khatib arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit
aimed at restoring diplomatic ties with Kuwait that broke off
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib made the visit at the invitation of his Kuwaiti
counterpart Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, who had indicated that
the visit will settle all remaining issues affecting the
normalization of relations between the two Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib said in Amman Monday that his visit to the Gulf
emirate will "set the ball rolling for the return of the relations
to normal."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the tour will be a chance to
exchange views with Kuwaiti officials on various subjects.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay, Al-Khatib will meet Kuwaiti Emir Jaber
Al-ahmed Al-Sabah to convey him a message from Jordan's King
Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The message is believed to touch on issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib is also scheduled to attend the reopening ceremony of
the Jordanian Embassy in Kuwait Wednesday, which will mark the
full normalization of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Jordan deteriorated sharply
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 when Jordan
was accused of supporting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's embassy in Kuwait was closed after 1991 Gulf War,
which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A rapprochement process began in May 1997 when Kuwait declared
it "likes to improve ties with all Arab countries except Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Since then the two countries have exchanged a number of middle
and high-level visits, including a trip by Kuwaiti Crown Prince
and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad to Amman early February to attend
the funeral of Jordan's late King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Jordan are also moving closer in the economic ties.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian Trade and Economy Ministry official said Monday
that the revival of economic and trade protocol between the two
states has reduced taxes and customs on the exchanged products by
100 percent since 1998.

<HEADLINE> hke030239-Myanmar Leader Calls for Rapid Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General Than
Shwe Tuesday called on peasants in the country to make efforts for
rapid agricultural development and flourishing agro-based
industries and other industries for overall development of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the 1999 Myanmar Peasants Day
which falls on Tuesday, Than Shwe, chairman of the State Peace and
Development Council, stressed the need to concentrate on
agricultural development in all ways to extend cultivation of
crops for self-sufficiency of yearly increasing population.
</P>
<P>
He urged the farmers to take it as a national duty to strive
for cultivation of a total of 18 million acres (7.29 million
hectares) of monsoon and summer paddy and get an average per-acre
(0.405 hectare) yield of 100 baskets (2.09 tons) every year for
sufficiency and surplus of paddy, the staple crop of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need to go on establishing industries
based on agriculture to boost industrial production.
</P>
<P>
He expects the achievement of sufficiency of edible oil and
less import of it in a few years as national entrepreneurs are
being invited to engage in extending cultivation of seasonal oil
crops and oil-yielding perennial plantations.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the peasants to expand multiple cropping year by
year to improve their socio-economic life and contribute in a way
towards national economic development.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government has been spending substantial
funds and employing various means and making arrangements to
ensure adequate water supply for agricultural purpose in states
and divisions.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar registered a 4.6-percent growth of its gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1997-98 fiscal year, in which agriculture, the
mainstay of the country's economy, grew by 2.9 percent in output
value, accounting for 35.6 percent of the total GDP and about 35
percent of the export.

<HEADLINE> SADC Allies in DRC to Step up Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) allies fighting in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) have indicated that they will step up their offensive
in the east of the country while giving material support to the
Angolan government fighting UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the allied nations, Angola's Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, Namibia' s Sam Nujoma, DRC's Laurent Kabila and Zimbabwe's
Robert Mugabe, Monday held a five-hour closed door summit in
Kinshasa "to review progress in efforts to end the DRC war and the
situation in Angola", the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, the group's spokesperson and Zimbabwean
President Mugabe said the allies were not happy with the lack of
progress in peace efforts for ending conflicts in the DRC and
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the allies had "reviewed ways to end the two
conflicts effectively" within their mandate as SADC members
responding to distress calls by fellow members of the community.
</P>
<P>
He said allied forces were disappointed with the rebels and
their backers Rwanda and Uganda who had reneged "in a very
disgraceful manner" on every effort to end the conflict
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt on our part that Rwanda and Uganda intend
the war and their occupation of eastern Congo to continue while
they exploit the country's resources," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to pressurize the two
countries to move out of the DRC because in terms of the United
Nations and the Organization of African Unity charters, they are
aggressors.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to a conclusion that we cannot allow their
aggression to continue. We have been reviewing ways to end the
aggression effectively," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
In fact, sources close to the talks said as the leaders talked,
their forces could have begun launching an offensive on the rebels
to recapture DRC territory now under rebel control in the east,
the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces offensive that was swift in the west when the
DRC war began last August, had been halted halfway to the east
when a flurry of mediation efforts began to end the war through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But numerous regional and international peace efforts have
failed to yield any results mostly because some of the individuals
championing a negotiated settlement have had their neutrality
questioned.
</P>
<P>
The latest such case is that of SADC's chosen mediator, Zambian
leader Frederick Chiluba whose government is now accused of
supporting the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) rebels in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe did not refer to Chiluba's case at the press briefing,
but Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge had earlier said the
summit would "analyse the relationship between Angola and Zambia."
</P>
<P>
After being briefed of the situation in Angola, Mugabe said the
allied leaders were considering material support for the Angolan
government under the auspices of SADC.
</P>
<P>
He, however, did not say what material will be given to Angola,
when and how.

<HEADLINE> Interview: China's Insurance Enjoys Sound Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The policy China has adopted to
develop its insurance sector is a sound one, which will help
establish a strong local market, said Rolf Hueppi, chairman and
CEO of Zurich Financial Services Group (Zurich).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua today, Hueppi said that while
making efforts to standardize the domestic insurance market, the
Chinese financial authorities have been gradually allowing some
overseas companies to enter the marketplace, which is the right
choice for an emerging market.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Hueppi has been visiting China regularly since 1993 when
Zurich set up its representative office in Beijing. He is now in
Beijing meeting with a number of Chinese government officials and
people from the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the financial services markets around the world
are undergoing dramatic changes as a result of technological and
telecommunications development and economic globalization. He also
commented that the Asian financial crisis has best shown the
volatility of the global financial market.
</P>
<P>
"China has played an important role as a provider of stability
in this region, particularly by not devaluing it's currency, the
yuan," he said, "By opening up the marketplace step by step, China
will have the opportunity to establish itself as a cornerstone of
stability in the financial market."
</P>
<P>
He maintains now that China has developed enough domestic
insurance market practice, knowledge and regulatory competence,
the important thing is to increase the professionalism of the
market. Insurance companies allowed to enter the Chinese market
must be capable of bringing the best global resources and best
practices to this market.

He added that the Chinese authorities are doing well by
imposing very strict controls and a regulatory system on the
financial services industry, which is different from the practices
in some crisis-hit Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He praised that professional level of the people in China's
financial sector, however, he urged that they should be given the
opportunity to be exposed to the best global practices to avoid
making the same mistakes that other emerging markets have made.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's good economic and policy environment has
encouraged companies like Zurich to assist China in building a
professional market environment.
</P>
<P>
Zurich is an international conglomerate with a history of more
than 100 years. It operates property insurance, life insurance, re-
insurance and asset management businesses in over 60 countries,
with total assets of 378 billion U.S. dollars and annual insurance
premiums of 44 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Presently Zurich is the world's second largest insurance
company and one of the top 10 asset management companies in the
world.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, March 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.4 million
individuals and businesses filed for bankruptcy during 1998, a 2.7
percent increase over the previous year, a bankruptcy group said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The data, released by the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, said personal filings in 1998 continue to drive the
increase, accounting for 1,398,182 filings, a 3.6 percent increase
from 1997 when filings totaled 1,350,118.
</P>
<P>
The number of business bankruptcy filings dropped 17 percent in
1998 to 44,367 from 54,027 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The third consecutive record year of bankruptcies correlates
closely with the increased debt load carried by American families,
" said Samuel Gerdano, executive director of the nonpartisan group
that tracks bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Last week bipartisan members of U.S. congress introduced
legislation to reform current bankruptcy laws and curb the
increase in personal filings. The legislation would make it harder
for consumers to abandon their debts.
</P>
<P>
With the new Congress getting to work, some lawmakers and a
coalition of deep-picketed banks, credit card companies and retail-
business groups are gearing up again to push for enactment.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
Malaysian exports of furniture and related products for last year
totaled 4.362 billion ringgit (about 1.147 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can achieve an average 40 percent year-on-year
growth in the next six years," Lim told reporters after the
launching ceremony of the Malaysian International Furniture
Exhibition 1999 here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lim stressed that the target could be achieved when the local
furniture industry pushed for the upmarket sector where Malaysia
could present furniture of the best quality and design.
</P>
<P>
There are already 3,000 furniture manufacturers in Malaysia, of
which about 300 are regulars exporting their products to almost
121 countries around the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will help to show that our export-oriented
industry has the tremendous potential to meet international
markets, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
In order to help the industry players, he said, the Malaysian
Furniture Design Center will be equipped with facilities to hire
or invite international designers to come and design local
furniture for the international market.

<HEADLINE> Lang Ping Quits Coaching for Healthy Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Volleyball Association
confirmed here Tuesday that Lang Ping has quitted her job as the
Chinese women's team coach due to healthy reasons for long-time
overwork.
</P>
<P>
Xu Li, Director of the Chinese Volleyball Management Center,
said today that former national team coach Hu Jin will step in to
take the helm of the women's squad.
</P>
<P>
He said Lang Ping, 39, whose health has been a vicitim of
overworking, was diagnosed as not fit to take on such high-
pressure job any longer after she underwent a physical check-up
early last year.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, who came to the rescue of the team four years ago,
shrugged off her poor healthy conditions to lead the restructured
national team to the runner-up of world championship in Japan at
the end of last year and regain the title of the Asian games.
</P>
<P>
After receiving Lang Ping's resignation, Xu said in view of her
healthy conditions, the association approved her retirement and
appointed Hu Jin to fill in the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, well known as the "Iron Hammer" in the 80s, was the
key element of then high-flying Chinese women's team that took
four straight major world titles. The ace spiker retired from the
team in 1986 and went abroad to study while she played with an
Italian club and had a stint as the coach of the world all-star
team.
</P>
<P>
Giving up the better-off life abroad she came back home in 1995
as the national women's team has suffered a slump in international
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Under her guidance, the re-shuffled team also finished third in
the World Cup in 1995 in Japan and lifted the trophy at the Ninth
Asian Championship in 1997.

<HEADLINE> One of Phnom Penh's Casinos Closed by Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government closed
a casino here Sunday night by order of Prime Minister Hun Sen,
local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I ordered one illegal casino in Phnom Penh to be closed down
before 11 p.m. tonight," Hun Sen was quoted by the Cambodian Daily
as telling the reporters at the airport Sunday afternoon when he
returned from Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week casino was located on the
third floor of the Hotel Inter-Continental. The one, once filled
with gamblers and guarded with metal detectors, now sits locked
and empty.
</P>
<P>
The government issued an order to crack down citywide on
illegal gambling two months ago, linking kidnapping in Cambodia's
capital to the prevalence of gambling.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping has been a growing problem in the capital over the
past years, especially among the business and ethnic Chinese
community.
</P>
<P>
The city has also tried to crack down on illegal casino several
times in the past years. But until now the efforts have yielded no
results.
</P>
<P>
Two other casinos -- the Holiday International Casino and the
Naga Resorts Floating Casino -- still operate in Phnom Penh, but
they have been ordered to shut their doors by the end of June and
must relocate at least 200 kilometers away from the capital.

As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
Zhu said, China is willing to continue its efforts together with
other members of the international community to seek a peaceful

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-EU Meeting to Be Held Soon: Thai FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and the European Union (EU) will soon hold their
delayed talks, Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are about to solve the problems delaying the
Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting between ASEAN and EU,
Surin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Surin did not say exactly when the meeting would be held. But a
Thai Foreign Ministry source said it could be held in the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The EU is opposed to Myanmar's participation in the planned JCC
meeting which consequently has been canceled twice in November
1997 and January this year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was admitted into ASEAN in 1997 despite strong
opposition from Western countries which accused the Myanmar
government of abusing human rights and harboring drug lords. As a
result, the EU bans entry visas for senior Myanmar officials and
generally refuses to accept their equal representation at
inter-government talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have new problem-solving measures and the meeting may be
held soon," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
He said preparations for an ASEAN-EU ministerial meeting
scheduled in Berlin, Germany, later this month were also being
obstructed by delays in the JCC meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to hold the ministerial meeting without the
meeting of the JCC," Surin said.

NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) ---A police team at a town of Eastern
Province returned to the interior of Mount Kenya forest Monday to
search clandestine bhang crops after its work was temporarily
called off two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The team's work, composed of 40 administrative police officers,
will cover 38,000 acres of dense forest land at altitudes of up to
2,400 meters above sea level, the Kenya Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to boost the search exercise, police commanders have
asked for helicopters which are not available, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the exercise was temporarily called off after
they failed to approach the dense sections of the forest where the
plantations are located.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister of State Marsden Madoka has expressed concern
that Kenya lacks adequate resources to reinforce the combat
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, police destroyed eight acres of cannabis sativa
cultivated on the rain-fed side of the forest overlooking Chuka
Town, bringing the acreage destroyed to 161, and arrested three
persons attending the crops.
</P>
<P>
The three arrests added up to 39 others apprehended by police
since the the illegal growing was first reported last year.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China is seriously concerned about
the Philippine government's construction of military facilities on
Zhongye Island in the Nansha Islands, according to Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
 Zhu made the remarks when asked to comment on the recent
statement by a senior Filipino official announcing that the
Philippines intends to expand the airport runway and build
military facilities on Zhongye island in Nansha.
</P>
<P>
 "China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands
and its adjacent waters," Zhu said, stressing that Zhongye Island
is part of the Nansha Islands and that the Philippines has
seriously infringed upon China's territory and sovereignty by
illegally intruding onto the island and building military
facilities there.
</P>
<P>
 He went on to say that in recent years the Filipino side has
built numerous military facilities on the islands which it
occupied illegally, sending warships and planes to the Nansha
Islands and conducting military exercises alone or with other
countries in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
 "These actions are detrimental to maintaining the peace and
stability in the region and will lead to the further tensions in
the Nansha Islands," Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese side asked the Filipino side to restrain from
taking any actions that might worsen the situation and create
tensions to maintain stability in the South China Sea area.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Launches National Organ Donation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the National
Association for Organ Donation has raised hopes that lists of
waiting recipients in Lebanon will shrink with the availability of
more body parts.
</P>
<P>
The association will work to raise public awareness in organ
donation and to ensure any donated organs are distributed without
discrimination, the local Daily Star reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, transplant surgeons have been finding
it difficult to know where and what organs are available. The only
possible way for them is personal contacts in their own hospital
and other hospitals, which often compete each other for the organs.
</P>
<P>
"The association will set up a national registry of donors and
recipients so that they can be matched," said Mohammed Khalifeh,
an association member.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, desperate patients are ignoring doctors' warnings
and traveling to Iraq or India where they can buy organs and
undergo transplants for about 10,000 U.S. dollars instead of
14,000 dollars charged in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The paper said only around 10 percent of patients needing
transplant in the country can receive organs from cadavers, as
opposed to 90 percent in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Stock Market Maturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Norbu, a middle-aged Tibetan, goes
to the stock trading center in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, every day
to watch the fluctuations on a big screen as he prepares to enter
the market.
</P>
<P>
Norbuo just retired from his job at a ferrochrome mine in
southern Tibet and explains that bank interest rates are just too
low and buying some shares seems a better bet. His idea is
supported by his family.
</P>
<P>
He is one of about 12,000 investors in Tibet, with Tibetans
accounting for half and Han Chinese, the rest, according to Deng
Can, deputy-general director of the Lhasa Securities Company. The
stock market is playing an important role in promoting the local
economy, she says. So far, five major Tibetan enterprises have
floated shares on the local market.
</P>
<P>
With the increase in the number of investors, the securities
company plans to open offices in Shigaze and Shannan prefectures,
Deng says. There have been no illegal operations found since the
stock trading center opened five years ago and she attributes this
to the support given by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges,
which supplied two million yuan worth of equipment in that time,
in addition to an increasing number of qualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
Deng says she is optimistic about the future of the local stock
market since the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress passed the Securities Law on December 29. It will take
effect on July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
She says the prospects of the local stock market are good and
more Tibetans will become investors as the securities market
develops and incomes of urbanites in Tibet increase faster than
those of people in the interior.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt. Places Hope on IMF Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
expressed the hope that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will
soon resume the suspended loan as the two sides are holding talks
in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Progress made in Kenya's economic reforms may have restored the
lost donor confidence in the country, which caused the suspension
of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in 1997,
Kenyan Finance Minister Francis Masakhalia said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the IMF technical team will notice the
development achieved. We are hopeful that the funds will resume,"
the minister said, adding that the government was on track in
economic reforms and toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team arrived in Nairobi last week, which could be a
signal for foreign donors to help the country with funds. The
team is reviewing the implementation by the Kenyan government of
reforms agreed on by the IMF in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the IMF headquarters is satisfied with
Kenya's implementation of a tight monetary policy, which has led
to a resumption of investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications
Cooperation (KPTC) has remained one of the major areas of
contention between the Kenyan government and the IMF, said press
reports here.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has also demanded the formation of an independent and
creditable board for the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority and the
speedy conclusion of the Goldenberg case, which involves an
alleged 5.8 billion Shillings (966 million U.S. Dollars) fraud
over false export.

TOKYO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese stock prices finished lower
Tuesday with the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closing below 14,
000 for the first time in more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The key index shed 300.69 points, or 2.11 percent, to end at 13,
921.66 as Japanese companies tried to sell their cross-holding
stocks prior to the country's fiscal-year which ends on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Arbitrage-linked selling spurred by a decline in index futures
prices also dampened stock prices, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all first-section
issues, lost 15.73 points or 1.42 percent to 1,092.08 and the
turnover on the major section increased to 457.37 million shares
from Monday's 420.19 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Share prices declined in all business sectors except fishery,
agriculture, electricity and gas.

government would come out with additional economic stimulus

<HEADLINE> 788 Palestinians Stripped of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel stripped 788
Palestinians of their residency in East Jerusalem in 1998 in what
the Palestinians call a campaign of "silent transfer."
</P>
<P>
Of the Palestinians stripped of residency, 441 cases came in
the last five months of the year, the local Haaretz daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz also quoted a government report as saying the Israeli
Interior Ministry issued 201 house demolition orders in East
Jerusalem last year and carried out nine of them.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem municipality issued its own house demolition
orders and had 13 houses demolished in both Jewish and Arab
sectors last year.
</P>
<P>
But according to the Committee Against House Demolition, an
Israeli activist group, a total of 35 houses were destroyed out of
600 demolition orders issued in 1998 in the Arab sector alone.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the high number of building violations in
East Jerusalem is an evidence of Israeli discrimination in issuing
building permits. Palestinians said it is extremely difficult for
them to get a permit.
</P>
<P>
The committee also said the Jerusalem municipality is
manipulating zoning laws to make it hard for Arab residents to
build houses, and has failed to to supply Arab neighborhoods with
adequate infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians has announced East Jerusalem, seized by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war, as capital of a future Palestinian
state. Israel, however, claimed that the whole Jerusalem is its
eternal capital.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Foreign Loan Management Ministry Calls for Good Management of Foreign Government Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Minister of Finance
Jin Liqun has called for improvement in the management of the
foreign government loans scheme.
</P>
<P>
Jin urged finance departments in all localities to help the
scheme's offices to further improve their work.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the raising and operation of foreign government
loans are part of the fiscal redistribution work. And the
borrowing, using and repaying of such loans are closely linked up
with government finance, and can affect the international
reputation of a country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China's foreign government loans are now under
the direct control of the Ministry of Finance which means there is
proper control of the scale of loans, strict examination and
supervision of loan projects and timely repayments.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and September 1998, the governments of 21
countries and two financial institutions had provided loans to
China, with contractual value hitting 42.89 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the period, China had used 36.82 billion dollars
of foreign government loans, and repaid 5.02 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,825 projects funded by foreign government loans, of
which 1,528 have already been completed.

<HEADLINE> China's Legislature Active in International Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The 9th National People's Congress
(NPC), China's top law-making body, has actively expanded friendly
exchanges with its foreign counterparts since its formation in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Through exchanges with its foreign parliaments, the NPC has
publicized the achievements and useful experience of China's
reform and opening-up programs, its NPC system and the development
of its democratic legal system, exchanged views on issues of
common concern with their foreign counterparts, and made clear
Chinese stand on major sovereignty-related issues, according to an
official in charge of the General Office of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Said Li Peng, chairman of the 9th NPC Standing Committee: "The
NPC Standing Committee's international exchanges aim to create a
sound international environment for China's reform, opening-up and
modernization drive by promoting world peace and development and a
multi-polarization trend of the world."
</P>
<P>
Since its formation one year ago, the 9th NPC has sent
delegations to a number of foreign countries and international
conferences attended by parliamentary delegations, including the
100th Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has received more than 30 foreign congressional
groups and delegations of international congressional associations,
including about 20 speakers and vice-speakers.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate bilateral friendly exchanges, the NPC has
established 51 bilateral friendly groups and associations, and its
special committees have also taken an active part in exchange
activities.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the NPC Standing Committee sponsored the Sixth
General Assembly of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Conference
on Environment and Development (APPCED) in Guilin in China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Congressional delegations from 20 countries and observers from
some international organizations attended the meeting. It was an
assembly with most participating countries since the establishment
of APPCED in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Observers hailed the assembly as a great success, saying that
the Guilin Declaration released by the assembly summarizes the
common ground of the participating countries on environment
protection and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The NPC also has had direct contacts with leaders and members
of foreign parliaments, helping them understand China better and
enhancing trust and friendship between them and their Chinese
counterparts through visits to China and on-spot observations.
</P>
<P>
The NPC continues to work hard to improve exchanges with
foreign parliamentary organizations. "China's rising status in the
world and its fast-growing economy promise broader prospects for
exchanges between the NPC and foreign parliamentary organizations,
" Li Peng said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Cancer-Urban Residents Types of Cancer Changing in Urban China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The use of refrigerators in China'
s urban areas has brought down the incidence of esophagus cancer,
while the greater intake of low-fiber food has increased the risk
of colon cancer, according to the Cancer Research Institute of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the incidence of esophagus cancer has decreased 60
percent in the past 23 years between 1972 and 1994, but the
incidence of colon cancer and gallbladder cancer have both doubled
their 1973 levels.
</P>
<P>
This has a lot to do with lifestyle and eating habits that
change as living conditions improve, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
Because refrigerators are more widely used, people can eat
fresh vegetables and meat instead of food preserved in salt, which
is thought to be related to cancer of the digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
And, the more sedentary life and lower intake of high-fiber
food like corn and millet or other coarse grains that were eaten
during hard times has increased the risk of colon and rectal

<P>
LUSAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has granted
the Zambian government 2.3 billion Kwacha (some one million U.S.
Dollars) for the country's drug demand reduction efforts during
the period of 1997-2001.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop organized by the Drug Enforcemernt
Commission (DEC) here Monday, Zambian Minister of Home Affairs,
Katele Kalumba described as "strategic" the involvement of various
ministries in the reduction of the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
The speech was read by DEC's deputy permanent secretary, Katuta
Nsemukila, on behalf of kalumba.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba paid tribute to the EU for the overwhelming support it
is offering in providing the technical expertise in the research
exercise for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
He said that the involvement of ministries in the drug problem
aims to help improve the overall health and socio-economic
well-being of Zambians, Zambia Daily Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry hopes to build and, or strengthen partnerships
with public agencies and non-governmental organizations involved
in drug abuse issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba urged the research team to recommend appropriate
measures on how to combat the drug problem among the vulnerable
segments like the youth mostly out of formal education, street
children and orphans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU representative Guy Rijcken said the EU was
happy to see what Zambia through the Home Affairs Ministry is

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- "I hope all the 280,000 country
fellows in my county could get well-off as early as possible,"
said Li Chunying, a woman deputy to the upcoming Second Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"As an NPC deputy, I'm obliged to do something to help my
hometown get rid of poverty," added Li who arrived in Beijing
shortly.
</P>
<P>
The annual NPC session is scheduled to open on March 5 and will
last through March 15.
</P>
<P>
Li, a 35-year old restaurant owner from Zhangjiachuan County,
in northwest China's Gansu Province, said she will propose that
her county be included in the state-funded biological and
environmental development program.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiachuan County has suffered from droughts for the past
six years, she said, adding that if her proposal could be accepted,
it will give a strong boost to the development of the county.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Li opened the first private restaurant in the
county town and gained her fame ever since. "Now there are a dozen
private restaurants in the town and they are equipped with better
facilities than mine," she told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Li is a Hui woman and her family now leads a happy and affluent
life. Hui is one of the 55 ethnic groups in China.  Pointing
to her white cap, Li said it shows she is married. "Many Hui women
are now involved in private business in my hometown, and my
husband, a manager of a state business, has always been on my side
whatever I do, either as a private restaurant owner or as an NPC
deputy," she said.
</P>
<P>
As a private businesswoman, Li added, she is greatly encouraged
upon learning that one of the most major topics in the coming NPC
session this year is to discuss an amendment to the Constitution
and to allow different forms of ownership in China.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Advice Vital to Decision Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Advice on various major state
affairs put forth by members of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body, has played a vital role in the decision-
making process of the country's top leaders, CPPCC officials said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past year, various special
committees under the CPPCC National Committee have carried out 65
special investigations into major issues relating to China's
development, and have submitted 57 investigation reports to the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
State Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"All these reports and related suggestions have been taken
seriously and highly praised by senior leaders of the central
authorities, and have served as vital references for state policy
making," said a CPPCC official.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth CPPCC National Committee will start its second annual
session Wednesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the CPPCC National Committee put forward suggestions
on a wide range of issues, including reform of state-owned
enterprises, guarantee of a basic living standard and re-
employment for workers laid off from state enterprises, anti-
corruption efforts in governments and judicial organs, crackdown
on theft of cultural relics and smuggling, development of the
environmental protection sector and eco-agriculture, and the
promotion of cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, officials said that the CPPCC National Committee last
year also organized 179 panel discussions participated by scholars
and experts from various fields to help the central authorities
find solutions to economic and political issues.
</P>
<P>
A report on China's economic situation worked out by the CPPCC
National Committee's Economy Subcommittee became key reference
material during a Central Conference on Economic Work convened at
the end of last year and was highly commended by Premier Zhu
Rongji and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, they added.

<HEADLINE> China Handles World Issues in Light of U.N. Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China, which assumed U.N.
Security Council presidency Monday, will, in strict accordance
with the U.N. Charter, uphold justice and better the efficiency of
the 15-member body when addressing issues concerning international
peace and security within its month-long tenure.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, China's permanent representative to the United
Nations, told Chinese reporters Monday night that the Security
Council will have a very busy working program for March to handle
major issues of great concern to the international community.
</P>
<P>
"African issues will be high on the agenda of the Security
Council in this month," he said.
</P>
<P>
They include the armed conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
the Lockerbie issue, the conflicts in the Great Lakes and West
Africa regions, and the extension of the U.N. Observer Mission in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council will also address the problem
of Kosovo, the Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians make up
some 90 percent of the population, and the Iraqi crisis, on which
the U.N. has set up three panels to deal with issues including
disarmament and humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
In order to seek proper solutions to these issues in the
Security Council, China will adhere to the following fundamental
positions:
</P>
<P>
First, China will handle various issues in strict accordance
with the U.N. Charter and in a fair and just manner. Qin said he
will play both the role of China's permanent representative to the
United Nations and that of the Security Council president for the
month of March.
</P>
<P>
"I will voice China's concerns over certain issues in my
capacity as the Chinese ambassador, and at the same time I will
also speak on the issues of common concern in my capacity as the
Council president," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Second, China will adhere to principles, uphold justice,
sympathize with and support the stand of the developing countries,
and in particular give more attention to Africa, said the Chinese
envoy.
</P>
<P>
In handling African issues such as peace and development, he
said, there should be no place for "double standards". "We should
give as much attention to Africa as we give to other regions in
the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Third, China will work hard to improve the transparency of the
Security Council, which is also a major part of the body's ongoing
reform drive.
</P>
<P>
"China, while assuming the Council presidency, will give prompt
briefing to all parties concerned, such as the president of the
General Assembly, regional groups sitting in the United Nations,
on where we are in the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, China will actively promote peaceful settlement of
regional conflicts, such as the one between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
China will participate in helping the two Horn of African
countries to end the conflicts and realize peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Last, China will help strengthen the authority of the Security
Council in the maintenance of international peace and security,
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, some countries resorted to force or threatened to
use force against an independent and sovereign state without the
authorization of the Security Council, he complained.
</P>
<P>
Right now, he noted, the U.S.-led NATO is stepping up pressure
on Yugoslavia over the issue of Kosovo with the threat of the use
of force.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer company Dell on
Monday reduced prices on its workstation computers by up to nearly
10 percent on the U.S. market, said a report from the Texas-based
company.
</P>
<P>
Effective Monday, the price of a Dell Precision WorkStation 210
with dual 450 MHz Intel Pentium II or Pentium III processors would
drop by 9.5 percent to 2,372 U.S. dollars, the most significant
drop from the previous prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"On the heels of incorporating the Pentium III processor, Dell
is bringing extra value to customers by offering a dual-processor
workstation with brand new technology at a lower price than some
competitors' older single-processor-capable systems," said Linda
Hargrove, vice president of Dell Precision WorkStations.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources noted that despite offering an extra processor,
Dell's workstation prices now range in some cases lower than the
equivalent models of rivals Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq
Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
Dell is neck-and-neck with Hewlett-Packard in the sales of
workstations, which are networked computers typically used by
engineers and others with data-intensive computing needs.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and its
committees at various levels have played an important role in
helping the central government and the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee acquire public opinions and suggestions for
reference in their policy-making.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth CPPCC National Committee received some 3,500 pieces
of information in 1998, the first year of its five-year term, from
its members and non-Communist parties. It also got a total of 18,
567 letters from the people of various social sectors.
</P>
<P>
The information and letters tell the CPPCC problems and topics
of general interest, according to CPPCC sources.
</P>
<P>
The issues and topics include those about how to stop some
people to let farmland go to waste, how to guarantee loans to help
aid the needy, and how to concentrate efforts on resettling people
displaced by the devastating floods, and on preventing diseases
and the springs of river and lake banks.
</P>
<P>
All these have attracted the great attention of the central
leadership, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC members at various levels made many fact-finding tours in
grass-roots units across the country to get first-hand information,
which helped address many problems in the life of the people.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee has put the findings of its
members and public opinions and suggestions into its either
reports or proposals to the central leadership last year.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Spending in Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's redoubled efforts for
environmental protection has resulted in a sharp increase in
investment in this field which came to an equivalent of one
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, according to
the State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the administration, said in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua that the state approved more than
330 environmental projects in 1998, with a total investment of 107.
6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's annual environmental investment was close to 40 billion
yuan in the period of 1991-1995, only 0.8 percent of the yearly
GDP.
</P>
<P>
Some state financial institutions including the State
Development Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China and the Construction Bank of China have put a number of
industrial pollution control projects in their major loan support
coverage.
</P>
<P>
"The fund will be mainly used for the control of urban air
pollution and water pollution in majors river and lakes," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
After years of effort, China has scored notable achievement in
water pollution control, with former polluters in the Taihu Lake
and Huaihe River valleys meeting state-set emission standards and
nearly four million cubic meters of silt eliminated in the Dianchi
Lake in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The state has reduced the production of mines producing high-
sulphur coal and even shut down some of them last year to control
acid rain. As a result, the frequency of acid rain in southwest
China's Chongqing City has declined to 70 percent from the
previous high of 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has also decided to ban the use of leaded gasoline
nationwide beginning from January 1, 2000. More than 20 big and
medium-scale cities have already done so. Beijing has even
implemented stricter tail exhaust emission standards to improve
its air quality.
</P>
<P>
"The central government is paying high attention to
environmental protection and the environmental awareness of the
public is improving," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that with the pollution situation being
serious, much still has to be done in pollution control and
ecological protection.

<HEADLINE> More Muslim Farmers Visit Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My cherished dream will be realized soon," said 68-year-old Ma
excitedly, adding that although the journey will cost about 25,000
yuan, he can afford it.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrimage, known as hajj, is required to be made at least
once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it.
</P>
<P>
Ma explained that for him, in the past such a trip to Mecca was
unthinkable because of his modest earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, ever since the reform and opening policy adopted by
China in 1978, the living standard of Ma's five-member family has
been improving steadily. Now the annual income of the family
exceeds over 20,000 yuan apart from the farmland and livestock
they own.
</P>
<P>
Following in Ma's footsteps this year, 187 farmers with an
average age of 65 years from the autonomous region will travel to
the holy city at their own expense, with 19 of them from Xihaigu,
the poorest area in the region.
</P>
<P>
The grain output of the prefecture stood at 900 million
kilograms in 1998, a record high which enabled 250,000 more people
to receive adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Five of the prefecture's eight poverty-stricken counties at the
state level, including the Pengyang County, have been lifted out
of poverty. The average per capita income of farmers in these
counties exceeds 1,025 yuan. As a result, more Hui nationality
Muslims can afford to go to Mecca on a pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.78 million Hui Muslims in the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, accounting for one-third of its total
population. Since 1978, 1,600 Muslims from the region have
traveled to Mecca at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
Bai Xiuhua, 62, from Dongta Township in Wuzhong City was the
only female to go to Mecca this year. She said: "Women of Hui
nationality used to be confined to home. It was unheard of them to
go to Mecca to perform in the past."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Zhongxiao, Section Chief of the Islamic
Division of the region's Religious Bureau, 63 female Muslims will
go to Mecca this year, accounting for one-third of the country's
pilgrimage delegation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is also the head of the delegation, said the local
government paid great attention to the work of the pilgrimage
every year. Interpreters and doctors were assigned to serve
members of the delegation to ensure the smooth development of the
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 when the Chinese government began to organize
delegations to Mecca, at the individual's own expense, over 50,000
Chinese Muslims had performed hajj in Mecca. This year, 2,000
Chinese Muslims will be joining the pilgrimage organized by the
Islamic Association of China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Favor Major Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Famous brand-name products have
basically taken control of the Chinese marketplace and sales of
lesser known goods are dropping, according to the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A recent market survey showed that 10 famous color TV brands
have 80.5 percent of the domestic market while the top ten washer
producers have 91.3 percent of the market, refrigerators, 91.6
percent, air conditioners, 76 percent, and video compact disk (VCD)
players, 81.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many lesser known brands are running into difficulties and some
have faded from the scene. The survey found that, against this
backdrop, buying is concentrated on household electric appliances
that are under consumed.
</P>
<P>
A study of the country's major department stores has found a
large increase in sales of personal computers, fax machines, VCD
players, and air conditioners, and large-capacity refrigerators
and electric appliances show potential.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show 99.9 percent of consumer goods either
over-supplied or with supply and demand equal.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government  to Sell HFCK Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to offer
for sale of 30 million shares worth of 420 million Shillings (some
seven million U.S. Dollars) of the Housing Finance Company of
Kenya (HFCK) at the Nairobi Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Francis Masakhalia said here Monday
that the sale of the government-held shares would reduce
government share holding in the HFCK to just 4.4 percent of the
company's total share capital.
</P>
<P>
With the government shedding 30 million shares of the HFCK, the
public and private sectors will hold 65.2 percent of the company's
share capital while the Commonwealth Development Corporation holds
the rest of 30.4 percent, the state-run Kenya Times newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Masakhalia as saying that the sale
demonstrated the government's commitment to divesting its share
holding in commercial enterprises in an organized way through the
ongoing privatization program.
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector to become more innovative in
mobilizing long- term savings from pension funds and other sources
and channel these funds into the housing sector.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Nairobi Stock Exchange, Jimna Mbaru, said that
54 percent of the HFCK's shares are now listed in the bourse
whereas other companies have less than 25 percent listed at the
market.

<HEADLINE> Female Farmers Achieve Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of scientific
farming and animal husbandry techniques has led to a substantial
increase in the number of prosperous female farmers in rural
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li Qiaoyun, chairwoman of the Municipal Women's Federation,
made the comment at a Monday conference held to honor the
outstanding achievements of 10 female farmers.
</P>
<P>
She noted that some 170,000 female farmers in the city were
each earning over 10,000 yuan annually by the end of last year,
with income levels for 956 women surpassing 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang Junying, a millionaire honoree from Beijing's Huairou
County, earned her fortune raising rainbow trout. Chang's 1998
income stood at 1.2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang's reputation is based more on the fact that she
donated some 600,000 yuan to poverty-stricken women in her
neighborhood to help them gain affluence.
</P>
<P>
The city women's federation has sponsored 15,000 agricultural
technology courses which have enabled over a million female
farmers to earn certification for various skills.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Needed to Stimulate Domestic Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists suggest that
simulative measures to lift consumption demand should be adopted
to ensure national economic growth this year in the wake of
sagging exports and weak domestic investments.
</P>
<P>
Today's Economic Daily quotes the unnamed group of experts as
saying that given the present situation, the level of consumer
demand will decide the growth pace of the national economy for the
current year.
</P>
<P>
However, they also note that various factors will be quite
likely to lead to a slowdown in the upward trend for consumer
demand during the year.
</P>
<P>
They point out the falling increase rate of family incomes and
the conspicuous gap in urban and rural income levels will
contribute to the slowdown in consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are fully aware that reforms of housing, medical care
and social welfare will lead to increasing personal expenditures
in the future. Therefore, the natural response is to reduce
spending and increase savings.
</P>
<P>
Economists nonetheless put forward a number of measures to
offset pessimism regarding the possible success of stimulating
consumption during the year.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that measures should be taken to ensure long-term
sustainable income increases, especially those of rural consumers.
</P>
<P>
The taxation system must be improved to narrow the gap between
the rich and poor, and measures be taken to increase subsidies to
the lower-income groups so as to generate consumption demand from
them, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
They express hope that policy-makers will carefully consider
lowering the high cost of housing in order to stimulate consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
Experts also suggest that highway construction and the
installation of power grids should be accelerated in both urban
and rural areas in order to make consumption more convenient.
</P>
<P>
They also say that irrational charges over automobile purchases
and extra fees extracted from extensive electricity users should
be revoked to encourage more spending.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Draw Up Strategy Against Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government would
draw up a national contingency plan in a few months to provide
foolproof safety measures against the millennium bug of computer
systems, government officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Presidential Commission on Year 2000
Compliance said the commission will require government agencies
this month to submit their contingency plans so it can formulate
the master plan to fortify the country's defense against the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Concerned agencies will carry out the plan then, with the
commission issuing the guidelines on implementation, they said.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council would be asked to help the
commission implement the plan, which is expected to be drawn up by
September.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
that uses two digits to mark dates, causing them, for example, to
recognize January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the world over are holding an international
conference on the problem in Manila to tackle the problem which

<HEADLINE> Rich Oil-Bearing Strata Found in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists recently
drilled three test wells and discovered a rich oil- and gas-
bearing strata in the northern basin in east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Xinzhu-1 Well has yielded two oil-bearing strata with a
total depth of 6.8 meters, as well as two gas-bearing strata with
a combined thickness of 15.6 meters. The region's verified gas
reserves of 10 billion cu.m. are equivalent to an oil field
capable of producing 10 million tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
Two other test wells -- Fa-2 and Sha-22 -- near Yangzhou have
also reportedly yielded promising traces of oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Qian Ji, chief geologist at the Jiangsu Oil Field, said the two
Yangzhou wells will form the basis for the establishment of an oil
field with an annual production capacity of 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, one of China's major developed areas, long suffers
from a deficiency of energy resources. The province produced one
million tons of crude oil in 1995 and has since increased its
output by 100,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The new discoveries will play an important role in helping to
adjust Jiangsu's energy structure and promote economic development,
according to local officials.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Tax to Net Huge Sum for UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates is
expected to net 272 million dirhams (about 73.44 million dollars)
this year in huge custom duties on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco tax revenues are forecast to increase to 303 million
dirhams (about 81.81 million dollars) next year, the Dubai-based
Khaleej Times daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco tax increased to 70 percent in April last year from 50
percent when the Federal Law No. 2 of 1998 was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that the tax will increase to 90 percent in
July this year, with a minimum of 72 dirhams (about 19.44
dollars) per 1,000 cigarettes, and finally to 100 percent in July
next year, with a minimum of 80 dirhams (about 21.6 dollars) per
1,000 cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, which rank with
highest cigarette consumption levels in the world, have
introduced tougher laws and heavy duties on tobacco products with
the aim to discouraging smoking.
</P>
<P>
They have pledged to increase the customs tariffs on cigarettes
and tobacco imports to 100 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the GCC countries import nearly
30 billion cigarettes a year worth over 800 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the total sum of their revenues from duties
on cigarettes and tobacco is likely to exceed 1 billion dollars
compared with less than 100 million dollars in the
mid-80s.

manufacturing expertise.
</P>
<P>
The two sides plan to develop markets in Russia and other

<HEADLINE> Officials Urge Auto Industry Conglomeration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile manufacturing
industry must establish conglomerates in order to increase
competitiveness, according to today's overseas edition of People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Daily quoted high-ranking officials from the State
Administration of Machinery Industry as saying that conglomeration
will be essential for coping with price slashes resulting from the
introduction of zero tariffs when China joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
China's 200-odd automakers produced 1.6 million vehicles in
1998, a figure equal to the annual output of a medium-sized
automobile manufacturing plant in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Domestic research and development costs for a single new model
currently stands at 150 million US dollars. And yet, China
invested altogether 1.3 billion US dollars in its automobile
industry during the Ninth Five Year Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The administration has drafted a plan to accelerate the
establishment of conglomerates in order to reverse the situation
where a large number of plants produce relative small quantity of
vehicles and have weak development capabilities. The plan calls
for forming three large automobile manufacturing conglomerates
that operate a dozen backbone producers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Unions Pulls out of Tripartite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Monday night pulled out of tripartite talks with the
government and employers and plans to form a workers' political
party to contest the year 2000 general elections.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was jointly made by ZCTU President Gibson
Sibanda and Secretary-General, Morgan Tsvangirayi, in Bulawayo,
the country's second largest city, the Herald newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution to form a workers' party was made during a
meeting of the national working people's convention of the ZCTU in
Harare Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is the 2000 election and depending on the people,
we will start working on the party in six months," Sibanda said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers who filled the large city hall to capacity
agreed to the proposal by a show of hands.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirayi said new measures to fight for workers' grievances
were needed as stayaways had outlived their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
He said the labor union would no longer participate in
tripartite negotiations as they had failed to benefit workers.
</P>
<P>
"We realized we were chasing a mirage... there is nothing at
the talks and it does not help to talk to people who are not
serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU resorted to stayaways last year to press for a 20
percent cost of living adjustment, removal of the development levy
and the reduction of sales tax.
</P>
<P>
The government subsequently gave in to some of the demands but
later banned stayaways through the presidential powers in
December.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said that the ZCTU would not negotiate with the
government on a social contract as long as the ban was in force.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Strives to Maintain Export Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of private Chinese
companies and 1,000 key enterprises have been granted the right to
engage in import and export related activities since 1998.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to maintain export growth under the pressure of
the Asian financial crisis also include the introduction of
simplified application procedures enabling various large
industrial trade companies to gain foreign trade rights in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We will try a thousand and one ways to maintain a certain
growth rate for exports which have emerged as an increasingly
important factor in national economic development," said a senior
trade official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Developing new export growth areas, exploring new means of
trade, improving the competitive edge of Chinese commodities,
diversifying the export market, reforming the foreign trade
management system and increasing imports to a proper level will be
included in the "one thousand and one ways," according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC has called on local trade officials and export companies
to use the advantages in their respective geographic location,
unique products and resources, and special expertise to develop
new export growth areas.
</P>
<P>
China will also encourage qualified enterprises, especially
ventures in the electronic, machinery, light industry, textile and
garments sectors to expand exports by establishing joint ventures
overseas and producing commodities using domestically manufactured
equipment, raw materials and parts.

<P>
In addition, foreign trade companies will be encouraged to
explore new ways to increase exports in accordance with
international norms. For example, they can export directly to
chain stores and supermarkets in countries and regions with
advanced market mechanism in order to reduce costs and improve
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC will adopt policies to help improve the quality of
export commodities and diversify export market, the official said,
adding that exports of equipment and brand-name and hi-tech
products will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
China will accelerate efforts to develop traditional export
markets in the United States, Japan and Europe, while at the same
time working diligently to tap the potential of markets in Africa,
Latin America, Eastern Europe, and nations in the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
</P>
<P>
More enterprises will be granted import and export rights, and
the number of export commodities under the licensed management
system will be sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will appropriately increase imports of
electronic products and machinery for coordinated development of
import and export.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of a series of policies and the efforts of
concerned firms will make it possible for China to achieve at
least a certain level of export growth," said a senior MOFTEC
trade official.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Africa Trade Shows Encouraging Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Trade and investments between
Malaysia and Africa had shown encouraging results over the last
five years, Malaysian Deputy International Trade and Industry
Minister Kerk Choo Ting said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said trade between Malaysia and Africa rose from 881 million
ringgit (about 231.842 million U.S. dollars) in 1993 to 4.65
billion ringgit (about 1.223 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
"Investments from Malaysia to Africa had increased from 12
million ringgit (about 3.157 million dollars) in 1992 to 115
million ringgit (about 30.263 million dollars) in 1996," he said
here at the opening of the four-day United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Asia-Africa business networking
forum on trade and investment diversification.
</P>
<P>
Kerk said in 1997, Malaysia's investments in South Africa
amounted to 133 million ringgit (about 35 million dollars) while
the main exports to Africa were palm oil, vegetable oils and fats,
plastic products, civil engineering and contractors equipment.
</P>
<P>
He added that Malaysia's investments in Africa were mainly in
the telecommunications, hotel, banking, infrastructure and real
estate sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia has always been keen on fostering and
enhancing South-South Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which is financed by the Japanese Government,
consisted of at least 25 entrepreneurs from 10 sub-Saharan African
countries.
</P>
<P>
It was aimed at facilitating trade and investments between
South Asia and sub-Sahara Africa through providing opportunities
for companies to network directly with their counterparts as well
as establishing new business contacts and promoting networking
among entrepreneurs from the two regions.

<HEADLINE> Estrada, Group Leader Talks Postponed for Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Meeting between Philippine
President Joseph Estrada and Hashim Salamat, chairman of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), was postponed for a few months, a
senior government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Aventajado, president adviser on economic affairs said
the meeting was postponed because of last minute security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"We postpone the meeting so we could sort out some security
problems," he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the talks could resume, Aventajado said, "perhaps in
the next few months."
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said Salamat already agreed to meet Estrada, who was
visiting Mindanao, the southern Philippines, last Sunday on board
the presidential yacht.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said what prompted the cancellation of the meeting
was the MILF's concerns about the security en route from the MILF
headquarters to the yacht.
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier said he was not closing the door on forging
peace with the MILF, despite the cancellation of his scheduled
meeting with Salamat last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada has repeatedly said that no talks can be held with
Salamat if it would involve discussing territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt. to Scrap 4,000 Posts by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
abolish over 4,000 posts in six ministries this year under the
second phase of the public service rationalization program, said
the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The move should make the civil service more efficient and cut
down on bureaucracy, the Herald newspaper Tuesday quoted the
lastest Treasury Monthly Bulletin from the Financy Ministry as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin issued here Monday, the posts will
be abolished from the ministries of education, sport and culture;
mines, environment and tourism; local government and national
housing; lands and agriculture; rural resources and water
development; and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, Public Service Commission Public Relations Officer
Dennis Rwafa did not comment on the abolition, saying that as far
as he was concerned, draft proposals on the civil service
restructuring exercise were still before cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of economic reforms, the Zimbabwe Program for
Economic and Social Transformation started in January 1997 and is
expected to be complete by December this year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, the Zimbabwean government also intends
to introduce a computerized financial management system to
overcome some of the existing problems in the management of public
finance.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said the new system would enable it to
carry out its accounting and financial transactions for all
ministries, replacing the systems currently operated by the
Central Payments Office and Central Computing Services.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Tibet-Hotel-Management Tibet Witnesses Improving Hotel Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Many people worried about the future
of the Lhasa Hotel in the capital of Tibet when the expiration of
a 10-year cooperative contract in August 1997 led to the departure
of managers employed by the Holiday Inn Group.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, frequent guests have since found that the current
hotel management has maintained the same level of quality service.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese possess the same hotel management skills as
foreigners," says Tibetan General Manager Jigme, adding that "the
expertise we have learned from our foreign partner established a
solid foundation for our success."
</P>
<P>
According to 57-year-old Jigme, his hotel has so far hosted
over 10,000 overseas tourists and earned record profits in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hotels dedicated to serving foreign travelers have mushroomed
since the early 1980s, according to Tang Zhengqi, director of the
regional tourism administration.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 57 related hotels currently serving overseas
tourists are under Chinese management, with the list of managers
including quite a number of ethnic Tibetans. Related facilities
currently employ over 4,200 people.
</P>
<P>
Local managers continuously strive to improve management,
services and facilities. Their strenuous efforts have gained many
Tibetan hotels listing in travel guides published overseas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 380,000 domestic and overseas
tourists have visited Tibet, with foreign exchange earnings
standing at 33.5 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: CPPCC Sessions, Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The First Session of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was held in
Beijing between September 21 and 30, 1949.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by 662 representatives from all walks of life
and Mao Zedong was elected chairman of the First CPPCC National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC
was held in Beijing in December 1954 with 559 participants.
</P>
<P>
In September 1954, the National People's Congress, the top
legislature of the country, came into being, and hence, the CPPCC
would no longer exercise the power of the National People's
Congress (NPC), but it has continued to exist as an organization
of patriotic united front with the broadest representation.
</P>
<P>
Annual sessions of the CPPCC National Committee have been the
most solemn gathering for political consultation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first sessions of the second, third and fourth CPPCC
national committees were held in 1954, 1959 and 1964, at which Mao
Zedong was elected honorary chairman of the national committees
and Zhou Enlai their chairman.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,988 members attended the First Session of the
Fifth CPPCC National Committee held from February 24 to March 8 in
1978. It is the first of its kind after the notorious "Great
Cultural Revolution". Deng Xiaoping was elected chairman of the
Fifth CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Sixth CPPCC National Committee was
held between June 4 and 22 in 1983 in Beijing with 2,039
participants. Deng Yingchao was elected its chairperson.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh CPPCC National Committee held its first session
between March 24 and April 10, 1988 with 2,081 participants. Li
Xiannian was elected its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee was
held between March 14 and 27, 1993 in Beijing with 2,093
participants. It elected Li Ruihuan its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee was
held between March 3 and 14, 1998 in Beijing, with 2,196
participants. Li Ruihuan was re-elected its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee is to
be held from March 3 through 11 this year in Beijing.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Injuries have wiped out the
Canadian figure skating team for the Grand Prix final this week in
St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
The International Skating Union Monday issued a medical bye to
three-time world champion Elvis Stojko, who has been recuperating
from a groin injury since the Nagano Olympics last year.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Figure Skating Association withdrew seven-time
Canadian champion dancers Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz.
</P>
<P>
Stojko worried the extra wear on his body would have caused him
to lose training time before the world championships later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Bourne tore cartilage in her left knee during a freak practice
accident before the Canadian championship. She was still in pain
at the Four Continents event last week in Halifax, where she and
Kraatz won the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
After winning, Bourne said her knee felt tender. Bourne said
she did not want to jeopardize their chances at the world
championships in Helsinki.
</P>

Bourne and Kraatz won the Grand Prix final in 1997, when the
event was called the Champions Series final.

BELGRADE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. mediator in Kosovo,
former Ambassador Christopher Hill, said the "Kosovo Liberation
Army" (KLA) should be transformed into a political organization.

Hill told a press conference in Pristina that KLA
representatives have been invited to Washington to discuss the
future of the organization.

The U.S. mediator said he would not meet Kosovo KLA political
representative Adem Demaci during his current visit to Pristina
because Demaci did not attend the Rambouillet peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Hill said Kosovo is still bogged down in a serious situation
and the problems there can only be solved after a political
agreement is reached and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
troops are deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Things are moving in a positive direction, Hill said, as ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo prepare to return to Rambouillet to

DHAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Poor revenue collection in
Bangladesh has forced the government to borrow heavily from the
banking system, a report in The Daily Star newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy failed to generate the targeted revenue
between July 1998 and January 1999, the first seven months of the

"The target could not be achieved as business activities were
heavily hampered due to countrywide prolonged floods last year,"
an official of the National Board of Revenue was quoted as saying.

Revenue collection in the seven-month period stood at 76,218.6
million taka (1,571.52 million U.S. dollars), falling 9.54 percent
behind the targeted 84,259.2 million taka (1,737.30 million

(60.25 million dollars) higher than the corresponding period of
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
As revenue collection slowed, the pace of government borrowing
was up.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the current fiscal year from July
to November 1998, the government's net borrowings from banks
increase by 7,400 million taka (152.58 million dollars), up from
1,210 million taka (24.95 million dollars) of the corresponding
period of the previous fiscal year, due to rising establishment
costs and wage bills of pubic sector enterprises, high interest
payment and a rise in subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for February was worse, as the revenue would be
even lower than that in the previous months because the 28-day
month had only 14 working days, with eight weekly holidays and six
days of countrywide strike sponsored by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall might exceed 10,000 million taka (206.19 million
dollars) by the end of the fiscal year, for which the government
set a target of collecting 157,000 million taka (3,237.11 million
dollars) as revenue, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Drug Traffickers Launder Money in Thailand: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual U.S. report on narcotics trade claimed that Thailand
is one of 46 countries and territories which, along with America,
are primarily responsible for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The report gave the Thai government high marks for anti-drug
efforts, saying the highlight of last year was the establishment
of an international law enforcement academy in Bangkok. The
U.S.-funded school will train lawmen from many countries to trace
and combat money laundering.
</P>
<P>
But the report revealed a new emphasis by U.S. authorities on
what they view as Thai shortcomings in trying to end the effort of
drug dealers to "wash" their money and make it appear legitimate.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that some Thai banks continue to accept
funds which they suspect are the proceeds of drug deals "out of
fear of losing accounts."
</P>
<P>
Drug money is invested in gambling and prostitution and there
was a danger money launderers would use legal casinos to widen the
scope of their business, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It wanted Thailand to enact its long-awaited anti-money
laundering law, noting that the Thai parliament had gutted the
proposed bill.
</P>
<P>
Washington continued to press hard for such a law. The report
said the United States has big plans once the law is in place.
</P>
<P>
The pending law is the only thing keeping Thailand out of the
1988 U.N. Drug Convention. In all other criteria Thailand is
qualified or even a regional leader, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Washington will "assist" in setting up decrees and programs to
implement the law, and then develop legal and enforcement tools,
including a strengthened conspiracy law and a Western-style
plea-bargaining system so as to allow accused criminals to plead
guilty to lesser offenses in exchange for having charges reduced,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that from 1991 to last August, Thai
authorities had seized or frozen 22 million U.S. dollars in assets
suspected to be from 439 cases of drug trafficking. Another 15
million dollars were pending in 51 other cases.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also has helped extradite both foreigners and Thais to
the United States on a variety of criminal charges, including
those related with narcotics. Last year, courts extradited five
Thais and nine foreigners to America, all with the help of
government prosecutors and the Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> UNPREDEP Ends Military Operations in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Preventive
Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) has stopped all its patrols and other
military operations in Macedonia since Monday, according to
reports from Skopje.
</P>
<P>
Thousand and fifty men of the force, mainly soldiers from U.S.
and the Scandinavian countries, are waiting for new orders, some
expected to return home and others may be redeployed as part of
NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo in two months, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The UNPREDEP will also withdraw its sentry stations in the
mountain areas, armored cars and other military equipment.
</P>
<P>
The UNPREDEP was sent in to Macedonia in 1993 under UN
Resolution 743 to deter the spread of fighting to it from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
For several times, the UN extended the force's mandate. Its
last term expired on February 28.
</P>
<P>
China on last Thursday vetoed a UN resolution to renew the
mandate for the facts that "its (Macedonia's) bilateral relations
with neighboring countries have been improved" and Macedonia "has

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Mulberry Group Proposes Election Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government's
Mulberry Group (young radical backbenchers) has proposed election
reforms which they will discuss with President Chandrika
Kumaratunga this week, political sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Their proposal has already been referred by the president to
the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Electoral Reforms, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The group had discussions Monday with Minister of
Constitutional Affairs G.L. Pieris who praised their contribution
for coming up with a valuable proposal on the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
The issue of electoral reforms was raised following the
violence-ridden North-Western Province Council elections which
took place on January 25. The electoral system was blamed for the
escalating of election-related violence.
</P>
<P>
The Mulberry Group will also meet opposition Leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe next week to discuss their proposal.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is a combination of the present proportional
representation system and the earlier first-past-the-post system.
It will, however, do away with the preferential vote system.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft proposal, elections will be held on a
electoral division basis for 160 seats. The balance 65 seats are
to be apportioned among the contesting parties in proportion to
the aggregate of votes polled by their defeated candidates.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Individual income in Xihaigu, one
of China's poorest areas located in the northwestern Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, doubled the 1995 figure to more than 1,000 yuan
(about 120 U.S. dollars) in 1998 thanks to gratis aid provided by
the World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The goal of the WFP project centers on helping the area escape
poverty. The project helped raise the local grain output from 42
million kg in 1995 to over 70 million kg last year.
</P>
<P>
A number of other areas in Ningxia have also benefited from
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The region has signed 68 assistance agreements with a number of
foreign countries, including Japan, Germany, Australia, Canada and
the United States, as well as the European Union, since 1995.
Ningxia has also inked agreements with international organizations
such the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization,
according to Regional Department of Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
Aid programs have not only helped reclaim farmland, harness
rivers and increase forestry coverage, but have also led to
substantial improvements in local medical care and education
services.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 40 percent of some 470 million yuan (57 million U.
S. dollars) in funding received during the period has gone for
afforestation and forest protection projects, with another 28
percent earmarked for agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
A family planning and maternal health care project funded by
Australia has provided vaccinations for more than 90 percent of
children in Xihaigu, with some 87 percent of children receiving to
prevent iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 medical workers have completed training on safe
birthing methods and will provide services to some 85 percent of
expectant mothers in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Three Measures Recommended to Spur Thai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Speeding up spending of the annual
budget, easing conditions for loans for social investment projects
and reducing taxes are the three measures recommended by the prime
minister's advisory team to stimulate the Thai economy, a source
from government house said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For the annual budget, the advisory team found that the budget
disbursement has been far behind schedule, indicating that there
are problems in state mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The team has recommended that all ministries be instructed to
prepare a clear spending plan in order to expedite disbursement of
money and each ministry report its spending on a weekly basis if
possible.
</P>
<P>
As for social investment projects, the advisory team said there
are too many conditions for granting loans.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that talks be undertaken with agencies which give
money for the scheme to ease the loan conditions and the operator
of each project, which has obtained the loan, make sure that the
money is spent as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Concerning tax reduction, the team proposed that the government
cut tax to increase people's spending power, saying a cut in
value-added tax (VAT) may be the best way of reducing people's
burden.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is reluctant to take this measure since
it is not sure whether a VAT reduction would be able to bring
goods prices down.
</P>
<P>
The government therefore turned the attention to the
possibility of reducing personal income and other taxes, though no
conclusion has been reached.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is the Chinese people's patriotic
united front organization, a key institution of multi-party
cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), and a major form to promote
socialist democracy in China's political life.
</P>
<P>
After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression in 1945, the CPC and the Kuomintang decided during
their negotiations in Chongqing to convene a political
consultative conference and organize a new government.
</P>
<P>
The conference was convened on January 10, 1946 and attended by
representatives of the Kuomintang, the CPC, the Democratic League,
the Youth Party and noted public figures. In November of the same
year, the Kuomintang unilaterally proclaimed the convention of a "
National Assembly" in violation of the resolution of the political
consultative conference and resulted in the dissolution of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The first session of a new political consultative conference
called CPPCC was held in Beijing in September 1949, functioning as
the supreme state body.
</P>
<P>
The session adopted a "Common Program of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference" which bore the nature of a
temporary constitution, proclaimed the founding of the People's
Republic of China (PRC), elected the committee of the Central
People's Government of the PRC with Mao Zedong as its chairman,
and elected the First National Committee of the CPPCC. It also
designated the Chinese capital, national flag and national anthem,
and decided the way of numbering the years.
</P>
<P>
In September 1954, the National People's Congress, the supreme
institution of state power in China, was set up and the CPPCC then
ceased to function on the NPC's behalf. But it has continued to
exist as China's patriotic united front organization with a broad
representation and played a vital role in the country's political,
economic, cultural and social affairs and international exchanges.

</P>
<P>
Top of the agenda will be the overlap between
confidence-building measures and preventive diplomacy. It is
expected to come up with a recommendation for ARF ministers, who
are scheduled to meet in July in Singapore. Some AFR members want
the process to move a step closer to the second stage of
preventive diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to be attended by more than 100 senior officials
from the foreign and defense ministers of the 21 AFR members.
These include the nine Association of Southeast Asian Nations

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGDONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The south China coastal province
of Guangdong, a major producer of aquatic products, plans to
improve resources protection by maintaining zero growth for this
year's fisheries output.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing has resulted in eight consecutive seasons of
declining fish harvests in sea areas near the province and the
virtual disappearance of many desirable species such as Spanish
mackerel and large yellow croaker.
</P>
<P>
The province will continue to implement the "fishing ban" this
year as part of its effort to promote the recovery of marine
resources. The fishing ban from June 1 through July 31 will apply
to an area in the South China Sea north of 18 degrees north
latitude.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has strengthened supervision over boat engines and
plans to allocate one million yuan annually to standardize marine
fishing operations.
</P>
<P>
The province's marine industry recorded an output valued at 85
billion yuan last year. The figure, which accounted for a third of
the national total, included 5.15 million tons of aquatic products
valued at well over 40 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Enjoy Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that some 444.5
million Chinese farmers, or 47 percent of the total rural
population, traveled to various destinations during 1998, up 15.5
percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey revealed that rural residents spent 87.6
billion yuan (10.5 billion US dollars) on domestic travel during
in 1998, up over 50 percent on 1997. Per capita travel
expenditures grew 35 percent, with the total volume hitting 19.7
billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the National Tourists Administration
and the National Bureau of Statistics covered 24,000 rural
households throughout China, with the sole exception of the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The survey defined travel as trips carried out for purposes
other than employment or business, with travelers using various
modes of long-distance transportation and staying at destinations
for more than 24 hours, but less than six months. The survey
excluded rural residents visiting relatives and friends within the
county and migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that domestic tourism accounts for approximately
66 percent of the nation's total tourism revenues. The large
number of potential rural travelers represents a major market for
China's tourism industry which has been adversely impacted by the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Domestic travelers generated total 1998 revenues of over 239.1
billion yuan, up 13.2 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Some 694 million Chinese citizens traveled within the country
during the year, with per capita expenditures standing at 344.5
yuan.

will be controlled at a level anywhere between 7-7.5 million units
in order to control rising stockpiles, according to China Goods
and Materials News.
</P>
<P>
While production cuts effectively balanced supply and demand
during 1998, stockpiles remain high and fierce market competition
will continue.
</P>
<P>
Products with high technical contents will be mainly marketed
in cities which currently lack adequate licensing systems for
motorcycle operators.
</P>
<P>
New models will mainly go to inland cities, with relatively
high-grade and some high-grade cycles destined for markets in big
and medium-sized cities and coastal regions.
</P>

Marketing experts also point to the vast potential for
motorcycle sales in the country's rural areas.

<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Archaeological excavations at the
Three Gorges Dam Project areas have resulted in rich discoveries,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A group of archaeologists from the Institute of Vertebrate
Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Beijing University, Jilin University and Chongqing
Museum launched their excavations in the dam area last October.
</P>
<P>
Bronze weapons have been found at the Lijiaba site in Yunyang
County, a Shang Dynasty site (circa 1600-1100 BC) to the Han
Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), and archaeologists say they are very
important discoveries concerning the ancient Ba and Shu cultures.
</P>
<P>
A specialist from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics said that
the Lijiaba site will be indispensable for future study of the Ba
and Shu cultures.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, excavations at the Zhongba site in Zhongxian
County have unearthed remains that belong to the Neolithic Period.
</P>
<P>
In the Suolong site in Wushan County, archaeologists determined
that the excavated pottery, stone and boneware were important
remains of the Longshan Culture, which also belonged to the
Neolithic Period.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Museum group has also found a valuable ancient
tomb of the Six Dynasties (AD 220-589).

<P>
Rio de Janeiro, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's aeronautic
authorities announced Monday that they will lease the Alcantar
airbase for space launchings to foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
The Alcantar base, which is located in the state of Maranhao,
in the northeast section of the country, is of primary interest to
other nations because of its geographical location, which is close
to the equator and provides ease of entry into space for
positioning orbiting satellites.
</P>
<P>
Certain major industries engaged in the exploration of space
transport, travel and communications, such as the North American
firms of Boeing, Lockheed-Martin and Orbital Science Corporation,
the French company Matra Marconi, and the Italian company Fiat
Avio, have expressed their interest in the base.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for The Brazilian firm, Infra-Estructurae
Aeroportuaria (Infraera), signed a contract with the Fiat Avio
company. The Italian company intends to have a definite agreement
about future rocket launchings by the end of the year.
</P>

The head of the Department of Aerospatial Development of
Infraero, Joao Ribeiro, Jr., said the government would invest 50
million U.S. dollars to improve the airfield's infrastructure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China will soon launch a
nationwide check on crop seeds, farm chemicals and fertilizers, in
the wake of rampant fakes and shoddy products.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture "has received consistent reports
that fake and shoddy products have harmed farmers," said Vice-

</P>
<P>
He stressed that no crop seeds, pesticides or fertilizers

<P>
In the first half of 1998, at least 40,000 tons of fertilizers,
14,000 tons of pesticides and 2,500 tons of seeds were found to be
fake or inferior in quality, according to sources with the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Ancient Relics Under Pollution Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's relics protection agencies
are confronted with an urgent task to rescue cultural heritage
from being damaged by suspended particles and other kinds of
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Suspended particle, some 23 million tons of which are emitted
by burning coal each year, is the biggest threat to ancient relics
across the country, said a report in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Suspended particles have accelerated the corrosion of stone
sculptures at Yungang Grottoes in Shanxi Province, the Yaowangshan
Grottoes in Shaanxi Province, and those at the Song Tombs in Henan
Province, where most of the emperors of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)
are buried.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the China Institute of Cultural Property blamed
acid rain and sulfur dioxide for the fading or peeling of the
colorful murals and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
"Acid rain has led 500-year-old bronze astronomical instruments
in Nanjing Purple Mountain Observatory in Jiangsu Province to
corrode at four times the speed bronze normally corrodes in an
unpolluted environment", the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sulfur dioxide emitted by chemical plants within ten kilometers
of Guangsheng Temples in Shanxi Province since the 1970s has
darkened the temple's 400 square meters of frescoes and 100
colored sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Tourists visiting the relics are becoming a new source of
pollution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Indoor temperatures and air humidity in Beijing's Forbidden
City, the Terra-cotta Warriors buildings in Shaanxi, and the Mogao
and Longmen grottoes have been raised by the dramatic increase in
visitors over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have established an environmental monitoring
network at major relics sites since 1995 in a bid to assess
pollution damage and its causes. However, they feared that some
relics might be damaged beyond repair before they could be rescued,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Call up Senior Athletes for SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) believes the country will have to enlist the
services of senior athletes to retain its supremacy at the 20th
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Bandar Seri Begawan in August.
</P>
<P>
KONI outgoing chief in charge of athletes development Mochamad
Hindarto said that topping the Games medal tally was among the
mandates from last week's meeting of the national sports community.
</P>
<P>
"It's not an easy task, however, because at about the same time
our best athletes are expected to qualify for the 2000 Olympic
Games," Hindarto was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The SEA Games, to be held in Brunei for the first time, will
offer 235 gold medals in 21 sports. It will be held from August 7
to August 12.
</P>
<P>
Several sports federation, including the Badminton Association
of Indonesia, have called on KONI to send second-string athletes
to the Games to enable their seniors to focus on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Competition for Olympic berths will also start in August for
several sports.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto insisted one event would not be sacrificed for the
other.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the two events equally important, so we have to
excel in both," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said KONI could not send second stringers to the SEA
Games due to limited preparation time.
</P>
<P>
Recruiting talent from training centers nationwide will be
another option for KONI to select athletes for the SEA Games, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will compete in 20 sports of badminton, basketball,
billiards and snooker, bowling, boxing, cycling, soccer, golf,
hockey, karate, pencak silat (k.o. system of self-defense), sepak
takraw, shooting, squash, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo,
tennis, track and field and traditional boat racing.
</P>
<P>
It will give a miss to bowls, virtually unknown in the world's
fourth most populated country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Badminton
Federation (PBSI) officials don't appear to be too carried by the
fact that the team brought home only a gold medal from the Brunei
Darussalam Grand Prix which ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
M.F. Siregar, PBSI chief of the development department, said
the federation had not set any target at the tournament on the
pretext that it had been disrupted by the rescheduling of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"That should have been a yearender event for the 1998 calendar.
Apart from the men's doubles, we couldn't hope for a medal in the
other events," Siregar was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The tournament was to have taken at the end of the year as it
used to be. But due to Indonesia's failure to organize, it was
moved to Brunei and rescheduled dates -- at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian team's gold medal was contributed by veterans
Deny Kantono/Antonius at the expense of countrymen Tony Gunawan/
Halim Heryanto.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said that the federation now turned eyes on the All
England, Sudirman Cup and the World Championship.
</P>
<P>
"We will be preparing hard for All England, a number of
European events and the Japan Open in early April," he said.
</P>
<P>
The players, who are also set for an away dual meet against
Denmark on March 3, will be evaluated and selected for a team to
be fielded in the Sudirman Cup, to be held in Denmark on May 10,
based on their performance in the last four prior tournaments.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Assembly Debates Bill to Create Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia National Assembly
began to debate a constitutional amendment Tuesday to pave the way
for the creation of a controversial and long-awaited Senate.
</P>
<P>
Assembly's President Prince Norodom Ranariddh presided over the
special session. 112 out of 122 parliamentarians attended the
session, but Sam Rainsy, president of his self-named opposition
party, is not present.
</P>
<P>
If the amendment is passed as drafted, the 61-member Senate,
headed by Cambodian People's Party (CPP) President Chea Sim, would
function as an institution reviewing assembly legislation and act
as a coordinator between the Council of Ministers and the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to create the Senate was reached by FUNCINPEC and
CPP in November last year as a part of the compromise to form the
new coalition government after months of post-election deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen said earlier that he expects the Senate
will be formed by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The failure to create the Senate was cited as a reason for
Cambodia's delay admission into the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to comprise 61 members, among them two
will be nominated by the King and two others are appointed by the
assembly, while the rest are elected from the three political
parties who have seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was said that 30 senate members are to be nominated by CPP,
20 by FUNCINPEC party and seven by the opposition Sam Rainsy
Party.

<P>
An official from the Election Institute said that less than 50
percent of the parties hoping to compete in the general election
were able to submit a completed set of papers by Monday's 4:00

<P>
The new political laws determine that political parties
eligible to take part in the June 7 general election must have
chapters in at least nine provinces with executive boards, as well
as having regional boards in at least 50 percent of the provinces'
regencies or municipalities.
</P>
<P>

whose members will be part of the 700-strong People's Consultative
Assembly, the nation's highest legislative body, which will select
the next president.

magnet for foreign investment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Some 10-odd multinational companies have established joint
ventures with the port and half of the world's top 20 shipping
companies have opened representative offices.
</P>
<P>
The port and the Orient Overseas Group from Hong Kong recently
established a container shipping joint venture with a total
investment of 78.85 million US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British bombing
raids are blocking distribution of food, medicine and other
supplies in the northern part of Iraq, a U.N. official said here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Hans von Sponeck, the Baghdad-based U.N.
coordinator of the "oil-for-food" program, said: "We had to take a
number of measures to react to this deterioration of the security
situation in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Sponeck said, between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. trucks no longer
ferried supplies there because that was usually the time of
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Overnight stays by U.N. monitors had also been curtailed and
that one staff member had resigned because of the pressure of the
attacks, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, what is happening right now is a certain
shrinking in the amount of freedom that we have to move our goods
and to move our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are continuing to do our work fairly much as it
is expected from us. But if the frequency and damages continue and
increase, then we have to rethink," he added.
</P>
<P>
The airstrikes are carried out mainly in the Western-imposed no-
fly zone in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Section of Yellow River Dry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- As of today, a section of the
Yellow River, the second longest in China, in central China's
Henan Province, has been dry for 24 days.
</P>
<P>
The dry-up was caused by a reduced water flow into the middle
reaches in recent weeks, and the increased use of water for
farmland after a long spell of drought at the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The country's water conservation departments have ordered the
controlled use of water to alleviate water shortages at the lower
reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River originates in northwestern Qinghai Province
and runs through nine provinces or autonomous regions to a total
length of 5,464 kilometers. Sustained drought since 1990 has led
to a sharp decrease of water flow in the upper reaches, causing
some sections of the river to go dry in the lower reaches,
affecting the economic expansion of the river valley. Sections of
the Yellow River dried up for as long as 226 days in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Growth ring samples from trees
growing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at 4,500 meters above sea
level have enabled Chinese scientists to study the history of the
plateau's climate.
</P>
<P>
The study was listed as one of the major breakthroughs in basic
research during 1998, according to sources from the Ministry of
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
A group of scientists led by Kang Xingcheng, a researcher with
the Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology (study of
frozen earth) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),
obtained the samples from a cypress grove in the Yarlung Zangbo
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
Scientists note that growth rings, or so-called "dictionaries
of natural history", provide information about environmental and
climatic changes.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies of the growth rings showed the cypress
trees are approximately 500 years old.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major events
in Tibet's History:
</P>
<P>
-- The Yuan Dynasty unified the whole of China in 1279. Tibet
became an administrative region directly under the administration
of the central government of China's Yuan Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
-- During its reign, the Yuan government established the
Xuanzheng Court or Ministry for the Spread of Governance to
directly handle important military and political affairs of the
Tibet region.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1368, the Ming Dynasty replaced the Yuan Dynasty in China,
and inherited the right to rule Tibet.
</P>
<P>
-- The third emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Chengzu (reigned 1403-
1424) conferred honorific titles on religious leaders in various
parts of Tibet such as the "prince of Dharma", "prince" and "
national master in Tantrism." Succession to such positions needed
the approval of the emperor, who would send an envoy to confer the
official title on each new prince.
</P>
<P>
-- When the Qing Dynasty replaced the Ming Dynasty in 1644, it
further strengthened administration over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1653 and 1713 the Qing emperors granted honorific titles
to the 5th Dalai Lama and the 5th Panchen Lama, henceforth
officially establishing the titles of the Dalai Lama and the
Panchen Erdeni and their political and religious status in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
-- From 1727, the Qing Dynasty stationed high commissioners in
Tibet to supervise local administration on behalf of the central
authorities.
</P>
<P>
-- The Republic of China, upon its founding in 1912, declared
itself a unified republic of the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan
and other races.
</P>
<P>
-- In March of 1912, the Nanjing-based provisional senate of
the Republic of China promulgated the republic's first
constitution, the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of
China, in which it was clearly stipulated that Tibet was a part of
the territory of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
-- The Bureau of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs was established
by the central government in 1912 to replace the Qing Dynasty's
Department in Charge of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs and was
renamed in May 1914 the Mongolian and Tibetan Council.
</P>
<P>
-- In April 1940, the Commission for Mongolian and Tibetan
Affairs opened an office in Lhasa as the permanent mission of the
central government in Tibet.

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson, who has led
Philadelphia to its best start in eight seasons, on Monday was
named NBA Player of the Month.
</P>
<P>
Iverson became the delayed season's first Player of the Month

rebounds and 2.31 steals in February for the 76ers, who are 8-5
and tied for third in the Atlantic Division.

LAGOS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A FIFA delegation has begun final
checks in Nigeria on facilities for the world youth cup next month.
</P>
<P>
"The Jack Warner-led team is only carrying out last-minute
checks to ensure we've followed their instructions on the
facilities," said Emiko Bake, spokesman for the Nigerian
organisers of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Although it said it was satisfied with facilities after an
inspection visit last month, the FIFA team criticised hotels and
stadiums in some of the eight venues, saying they had not met the
necessary standards.
</P>
<P>
"Their findings won't affect Nigeria's status of hosting the
tournament," Bake said. "But we've been working hard to ensure all
the facilities meet the required standards."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Warming Lengthening Europe's Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Global warming may be
causing Spring to arrive a little earlier in Europe, and the
fall to come later, the Washington Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
After examing data, collected by the International
Phenological Gardens, researchers at the University of Munich
found, from 1959 to 1993, "Spring events," such as the emergence
of leaves on trees, have moved forward by about six days, while
"Autumn events," such as leaves changing color, have been
delayed by 4.8 days.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that the growing season over this period has
therefore lengthened by 10.8 days on average. They said that the
changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of
the effects of global warming.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Tipped for Premiership Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea are the current favourites
to take the Premiership title, according to Arsenal boss, local
report quoted Arsenal Arsene Wenger as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, who watched his side drop two points in Sunday's
1-1 draw at Newcastle, said that United's involvement in the
Champions League may just give the Londoner's the edge.
</P>
<P>
"I would give a slight advantage to Chelsea," Wenger said.
</P>
<P>
"Not because of a difference in quality of teams, but
Manchester United are much more involved in the European Cup,
while Chelsea play in the Cup-winners' Cup with less demands.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in The Mail newspaper, Wenger said: "The Champions'
Cup is something special in everybody's mind - and I would say
even more so in United's mind - so I think they might lose more
energy."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, with 11 matches left to play, now have 50 points,
three behind Chelsea and seven adrift of leaders United, who have
played one game more.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger warns that Arsenal cannot be ruled out either.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody will drop points, but now, because of this result,
we can afford fewer mistakes than the others," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a long way to go, though, and Manchester United
have to come to Newcastle shortly. They won't find it easy," he
said.

But Houllier has asked the FA to let him meet referee Mike Reed
to explain in the 1-0 defeat at Charlton on February 13.

<P>
It was the second time this season Reed has dismissed a
Liverpool player and after the game Houllier could not contain his
anger.
</P>
<P>
He said at the time: "Maybe the referee wanted Charlton to win.
It was not harsh, it was dubious."
</P>
<P>
Carragher was dismissed for "violent conduct" after a foul on
Charlon against the French manager.
</P>
<P>
Houllier said on Monday: "I'm very disappointed to be charged
by the FA over comments I made after the game at Charlton two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"I have subsequently requested a personal hearing at which
point I trust the FA will provide me with the opportunity of
discussing the matter personally with referee Reed."

<P>
Farry had vowed to carry on but the suspension was announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He and Celtic Managing Director Fergus McCann are in dispute
over Jorge Cadete's move to Parkhead three years ago.
</P>
<P>
A statement read by SFA Vice-President John McBeth said: "The
Scottish Football Association advises that the arbitration raised
by Celtic against the SFA has been settled by the parties prior to
completion of the arbitration.
</P>
<P>
"The settlement is in favour of Celtic. The SFA has issued a
letter of apology to Celtic, will make payment of an undisclosed
sum of compensation to Celtic and will make payment of Celtic's
reasonable legal expenses in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
"The SFA also advises that its chief executive Jim Farry has
been suspended on full pay.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the legal nature of this matter, the SFA will not make
further comment presently."
</P>
<P>
Celtic had said the SFA delayed Cadete's registration, leaving
him ineligible to play in a cup tie against Rangers.
</P>
<P>
Cadete moved to Celtic in 1996 from Sporting Lisbon but was
forced to miss a Scottish Cup semi-final clash against Rangers,
which the Ibrox club won 2-1.

<HEADLINE> Annan Still Expects Libyan Response on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Monday that he is yet to receive an official Libyan
response to his letter on the trial of the two Libyans in the
December 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters
on Monday morning, Annan said, "I haven't heard from the Libyan
authorities yet."
</P>
<P>
"As you know, I wrote to them. I am expecting a formal
communication from them. In the absence of communication I cannot
comment authoritatively on their response," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan wrote to Tripoli last week to offer what he said "all
explanations and clarifications necessary" at the request of the
Libyan authorities, and he told reporters last week that "the next
stage" is up to Libya to make a decision on surrendering the two
Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Libya said that it could not accept a time limit
set by the United States and Britain to hand over the two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Those making the demands "do not really want to conduct a fair
trial," a Libyan foreign ministry official said on Saturday in the
capital Tripoli, "It is not possible to discuss a deadline before
an agreement on the arrangement and the guarantees that had been
demanded by Libya."
</P>
<P>
Washington and London warned Libya on Friday it had 30 days
to deliver the two men to be tried by a Scottish court in the
Netherlands. However, the two countries stopped short of saying
what could happen if Libya refused.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan permanent representative to the United Nations,
Abuzed Omar Dorda, said that full Security Council had not issued
an ultimatum. He said Tripoli still wanted U.N. sanctions lifted
rather than suspended in exchange for any surrender of the two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council completed its four-month review of its
sanctions against Libya on Friday without discussing or making
any changes.
</P>
<P>
A Security Council resolution, adopted in August last year,
calls for an automatic suspension of the sanctions once the two
suspects have arrived in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Libya in August last year accepted a U.S.-U.K. proposal to have
the two suspects tried before a Scottish court in the Netherlands,
but later Libya was locked in a dispute with the U.S. and Britain
on the place where the two suspects, if convicted, are to serve
their sentences.

<HEADLINE> Eurozone Money Supply Expands Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The supply of money in the 11-nation
Eurozone jumped sharply in the first month of 1999, showing a 5.7
percent annual growth rate, the European Central Bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rise for the broad-based M3 supply was due to an 18.3
percent surge in the annual growth rate for overnight loans, a
report of the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In December, the money supply growth rate had been 4.5 percent,
with overnight money expanding at an 11.4 percent clip.
</P>
<P>
For the three-month period November 1998-January 1999, the
money supply growth averaged 4.9 percent, up 0.2 percentage points
from the October-December period.
</P>
<P>
The M3 supply consists of cash in circulation, fixed deposits
under four years and savings deposits with mandatory withdrawal
period.
</P>
<P>
The countries of the 11-nation Eurozone are all 15 European
Union members except for Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Monday with the Dow Jones industrial average moving in the
positive territory after plunging last week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed at 9,324.78, up 18.20 from a morning loss of
83.40 points. The index suffered a total loss of 246.09 points in
the previous four sessions of trading.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 7.15 at
2,295.18. The index lost 38.79 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A rise in Americans' personal income in January had an effect
on the stock market. The Commerce Department reported that the
personal income increased 0.6 percent in January, pushing the
index of purchasing activity up to 52.4 percent in February from
49.5 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The surging both in personal income and purchasing activity
kept investors in worries that the economy is growing fast enough
to spark inflation, which, they think, could prompt the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.17 at 1,236.16 and
the NYSE index was down 1.03 at 585.43.

<P>
The American Stock Exchange index was unchanged at 698.29 while
the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.13 to 394.39.

GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have put off the deadline of March 12 for the
selection of the organization's new chief till March 30, trade
officials said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 134-member WTO has failed to meet at least three former

of Italy to be the next director-general.

<P>
As of March 1, 118 out of the 134 WTO members have expressed
their preferences during the consultation process which has been
kept with the "utmost confidentiality".
</P>
<P>
The four candidates are Morocco's Hassan Abuyoub, Canada's Roy
MacLaren, New Zealand's Mike Moore and Thailand's Supachai
Panitchpakdi.

<HEADLINE> British Business Failures Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain recorded a significant
increase in the level of business failures last year, according to
a survey by business information specialists Dun &AMP; Bradstreet.
</P>
<P>
More than 38,000 UK businesses went bankrupt in 1998, an
increase of 6.2 percent compared to the previous year. It was the
first increase in six years, since the UK's last recession in
1992.
</P>
<P>
In the rest of Europe, business failures fell by 7.8 percent,
with Norway, Portugal, and Ireland the only countries with big
increases.
</P>
<P>
Another Dun &AMP; Bradstreet survey of 10,000 European company
managers showed that business confidence was at its lowest level
for five years.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that those two surveys provide evidence
that Britain is further ahead in the worsening economic cycle than
the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Philip Mellor of Dun &AMP; Bradstreet said: "Despite the latest
cuts in interest rates we do not anticipate any improvement in the
rate of business failures until the latter half of this year."

<HEADLINE> London Police Criticized for "Inadequate" Race Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Police forces in England and Wales
were failing to eradicate racial prejudice in their ranks, a
government inspector's report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted
"institutional racism" in London's Metropolitan Police following
the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager
Stephen Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
"There are pockets of good practise, but generally there is
room for substantial improvement," said Dan Crompton, the report's
author, who investigated how forces have implemented 20
recommendations made by the inspectorate 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need
to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his
report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week.
</P>
<P>
The Macpherson report denounced the Metropolitan Police as
fundamentally racist for its handling of the investigation into
the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, stabbed to death by
white youths in 1993. No-one has been convicted of the crime.
</P>
<P>
After the Macpherson report, the government promised to broaden
anti-discrimination laws and make immediate changes in policing
methods.
</P>
<P>
Straw has already announced that officers will soon be liable
to criminal prosecution for discrimination when police forces are
brought under the Race Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon has revealed
plans to introduce tests for racism as well as launching a major
study of what the public look for from the police.

<HEADLINE> European Socialist Party Congress Opens in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of the European
Socialist Party opened Monday in the northern Italian city of
Milan to prepare for the mid-June European elections.
</P>
<P>
In the first European elections after the debut of euro in 11
European Union countries, the final victory between the Socialists
and the People's Party could depend on a handful of seats. In the
outgoing European Parliament, the Socialists have 214 out of 626
seats while the European People's Party has 202.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest polls, the People's Party is growing in
strength in several of the big EU nations governed by Socialists.
</P>
<P>
In Milan Monday, the president of the European Socialist Party
and the German defense minister, Rudolf Sharping, accused the
People's Party of being "a factor of instability" for EU policy
"because of the internal divisions between Federalists and
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
European caucus leader Pauline Green said "our adversaries in
Europe say they want to become the number one group in the
European Parliament but, by now, they no longer have significant
weight among the EU governments" and their guidance at the head of
the European Commission has been disastrous, she said.
</P>
<P>
The present president of the European Commission is Jacques
Santer, former head of the European People's Party in Luxembourg.
This is the first time he has been so sharply attacked by the
Socialist caucus leader who two months ago helped avert a censure
motion against Santer in Strasbourg.

<HEADLINE> Lafontaine Warns Firms Not to Leave Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Reacting to threats of a corporate
exodus from Germany due to taxes, German Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine warned Monday it could become difficult for
non-resident concerns to do business with German clients.
</P>
<P>
"I would advise the insurance sector -- every company -- to
consider if they were to turn up as insurance providers, based on
who knows where, whether they will have the same business in
Germany as now," said Lafontaine at a news briefing, according to
a report of the German Press Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
"And I do not want to say anything more about this," said
Lafontaine, who dismissed threats by several major German
companies to leave Germany due to his tax plans as "not credible."
</P>
<P>
The Munich-based Allianz insurance has said it could move its
entire headquarters out of Germany. Allianz employs 34,000 people
in Germany and is one of the biggest insurance companies
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Essen-based energy giant RWE says Lafontaine's tax reforms
will cost it 4.8 billion dollars in extra taxes in the coming four
years.
</P>
<P>
Given recent liberalization of Europe's energy market, RWE is
now thinking about making future major investments abroad, said
company spokesman Dieter Schweer in an interview with the Bild
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said, however, this would not protect the company
from paying German taxes. "In the end they earn their money here
if we are talking about energy concerns," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine rejected claims by the energy sector that his plans
would cost it a total of 14.5 billion dollars in new taxes.
</P>
<P>
This is "utterly wrong," said Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
But when asked how much his tax plans would cost the energy
sector, Lafontaine admitted he did not know.
</P>
<P>
"I do not learn all the figures and at least 1,000 play a role
here," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Paying taxes is not a reprehensible state of affairs or an
affront of democracy," he said.

OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Monday that the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) will support a
project in Mozambique to help Mozambican people to remove
landmines from their lands.
</P>
<P>
The CIDA will undertake a national minefield survey as part of
the CIDA's support for demining in Mozambique. The survey will
identify and map all suspected mined areas. Policy-makers and
field experts, in Mozambique, will be able to use the survey to
make priority decisions on where to assign landmine awareness
teams and where to begin landmine removal.
</P>
<P>
The CIDA will provide 1.7 million Canadian dollars (1.12
million U.S. dollars) for this initiative, which is part of the
Canadian Landmine Fund announced in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has approximately 1 million landmines. This threat
to human lives has paralyzed economic activities in many parts of
the country, which is one of the poorest in the world.
