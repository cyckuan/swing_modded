<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Address Nation Today, Return to Kremlin Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will appear on television later today to address the nation, and
will return to the Kremlin next Monday, his spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Yastrzhembsky said the president's
address would deal with his forthcoming return to active work and
the end of the recuperation period after he underwent a heart
by-pass surgery on November 5.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not specify the exact time of Yeltsin's
television appearance.
</P>
<P>
On December 23, Yeltsin will officially resume his work in the
Kremlin upon returning to his Moscow residence on Saturday or
Sunday from his out-of-town residence Rus in the Zavidovo park,
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will spend his first few days back to the Kremlin
familiarizing himself with the political and economic situation
and meeting his assistants, including presidential chief of staff
Anatoly Chubais and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"But one should not expect that the President's return to work
will immediately be marked with fate-determining decision,"
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that, in keeping with recommendations of the
Kremlin doctors, the president would work "sparingly" at the
beginning: the doctors insist on a "smooth" process of taking up
the entire scheduled workload.

<HEADLINE> Greek Ambassador to Peru Instructed to Escape: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government said today
that its ambassador in Peru had been instructed "to use the
opportunity given to him to escape" from the Tupac Amaru guerillas
who are holding about 200 people hostage at the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
"This was the message given to Ambassador Alciviades Karokis,
when he was a prisoner, through his wife," government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said in reply to questions from the press.
</P>
<P>
The Greek envoy was released by the guerillas along with three
other ambassadors to negotiate with the Peruvian government on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
Karokis, like the ambassadors of Germany and France, did not
return to the embassy. Only the Canadian ambassador returned.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said all the European diplomatic missions in
Lima agreed with the decision on the European ambassadors'
getaway.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Karokis did not play the role of mediator as
requested by the guerillas, Reppas replied that ambassadors are
representatives of their respective countries and "the Greek
government did not assign the role of mediator to our envoy in
Lima."
</P>
<P>
Reppas clarified that no request had been put to Greece to play
some role in the hostage crisis.

HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 14,000 Zimbabweans were
deported from South Africa between January and November this year
as part of the continuing exercise to flush out illegal
immigrants from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A media liaison official at the South African High Commission
in Harare said today it cost the South African government about
110,000 U.S. Dollars, excluding detention costs and other
incidental expenses, to deport the Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
She said a total of 28,124 Zimbabweans living illegally in
South Africa were arrested between January and October this year,
making Zimbabwe the second highest country with illegal
immigrants apprehended in that country after Mozambique, which
had 106,765.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 152,000 illegal settlers were arrested in South Africa
during the first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
She said, ''from January 1996 to November 1996, 13,667
Zimbabwean citizens who were illegally residing in South Africa
were deported back to Zimbabwe.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Wheat Exports Doubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government has
increased the total wheat export quota for farmers throughout the
country to 100,000 tons, up from 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Denis Norman today told the Zimbabwe
National News Agency that with a total yield of 275,000 tons of
wheat forecast for this season, it was only logical to increase
the tonnage due for export.
</P>
<P>
''We have plenty of wheat on hand. To me it would not make any
sense to keep the curb at 50,000 for export, as we have to pay
for storage, and other fees. So we have increased this to 100,000
tons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The expected domestic shortfall, only expected to be felt
later in 1997, would be made up by cheap imports as prices would
have fallen by then, Norman said.
</P>
<P>
This season's projected yield of 275,000 tons of wheat is an
improvement over last year's 65,000 tons. That, however compares
with annual consumption of between 325,000 and 350,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December (Xinhua) -- Former England goalkeeper Peter
Shilton makes his 1,000th league appearance Sunday at the age of
47.
</P>
<P>
Shilton served as the goalkeeper in 125 international games for
England and now plays for division three Leyton Orient at the age
of 47 and shows no sign of giving up after 30 years on the spot.
</P>
<P>
"Even in the third division you still have to make saves, so
I'll keep on going," Shilton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shilton made his league debut for Leicester in the 1965-66
season against Everton when he was only 16. Three years later he
appeared in the FA Cup final at Wembley when Leicester lost 1-0 to
Manchester City.
</P>
<P>
He made his first England appearance the following season at
age 20 in a 3-1 victory at Wembley over East Germany. But the most
famous of his international carrer was when he conceded the so
called "hand of god" goal scored in the 1986 World Cup by Diego
Maradona, who climbed above the 'keeper but punched the ball in
with his hand.
</P>
<P>
His final England appearance was against host Italy in the 1990
World Cup and he then continued his career as a player-manager of
division one Plymouth.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six members of
the Cape Town-based vigilante anti-drug's group People Against
Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD), including their leader Aslam
Toefy, were released on certain conditions this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to a house-arrest agreement, offered by Western Cape
Province's Attorney-general Frank Kahn, the 26 accused would have
to submit themselves to voluntary 24-hour house arrest until
their case was heard on February 13 next year, reported the South
African Press Association from Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
None of the accused would apply for bail, while those holding
down steady jobs would have to be contactable at working places
and return home immediately after work, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Among those accused, 14 were arrested on Monday during clashes
between PAGAD supporters and the police at Cape Town
International Airport and could be charged with attending an
illegal gathering.
</P>
<P>
Eleven others were arrested after subsequent skirmishes
outside a courtroom Tuesday morning, in which five policemen were
injured, and could face charges of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
Toefy, who handed himself over to the police on Thursday,
would possibly be charged with organizing an illegal gathering.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 300 PAGAD supporters, including family
members and friends, waited outside the court building, which had
been cordoned-off by police and soldiers, celebrating the release
of the 26 accused.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Import Sugar Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe might have to import
sugar next year to meet the local shortfall resulting from
reduced yields of 336,000 tons this year compared to 513,000 tons
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Sugar Sales General Manager David Rockliffe said here
today the small yield this year was largely due to last year's
delayed rainy season.
</P>
<P>
"Although this year's crop was small, we had very large stocks
from the previous year and we were able to supply our quota
markets in Europe, America as well as our regional and local
markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Before the next crop comes out, there will be a need for a
small amount of imports. But that has been arranged already," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's sugar industry normally produces an average of
500,000 tons of sugar a year and employs about 20,000 people
directly in the growing and processing of sugarcane.

<P>
LIMA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A sign was hoisted today in a
window of the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence in Peru,
demanding that water, electricity and telephones be reconnected.
</P>
<P>
Some 375 diplomats and other hostages have been holding at the
residence since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Live television images showed at least three men inside the
residence holding up the hand-painted sign which reads in
Spanish: "There is no water, power or telephone. Reconnect."
</P>
<P>
Red Cross mediators said the hostages were suffering from
overcrowding, heat and individual ill health.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government has tentatively decided to reject rebel
demands to free their jailed comrades in exchange for the release
of some 400 hostages, a Peruvian radio station reported today.
</P>
<P>
Radioprogramas del Peru said that after a Cabinet meeting last
night, the government tentatively decided to "approve a proposal
of the president of the republic to not accept the appeal to free
any terrorist imprisoned in a Peruvian penitentiary."
</P>
<P>
The radio station said its report was based on a fax from a
government official, but its authenticity had not been approved.
</P>
<P>
Leftist guerrillas broke into the residence of Japanese
Ambassador Morihisa Aoki Tuesday night and took hostage all the
people in the compound celebrating Japanese Emperor Akihito's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement,
armed with guns and grenades, threatened Wednesday to kill the
hostages one by one if the government didn't release their
imprisoned comrades. But the rebels let their noon deadline pass
without killing any hostages. They did not publicly reiterate the
threat Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross workers delivered drinking water, fruit, food,
medicine and clothes to the 375 men still held in the Japanese
ambassador's residence. All women have been released.
</P>
<P>
The remaining hostages are from at least 28 countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States asked Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori not
to give in to rebels' demands, but Japan cautioned him on any
action that could threaten the lives of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda was in Lima to help
solve the problem and the Washington also sent security agents.
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear how the rebels, only about 20 in number,
were able to break into the residence and round up so many people.
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he heard an explosion and then the rebels rushed
in, shooting in the air and yelling.
</P>
<P>
The MRTA guerrillas are the second largest anti-government
group in the country, after the Shining Path.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada will complain to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) if the United States makes good on
its threats to ban Canadian fish imports because of bowhead whale
fishing.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said the U.S. was
prepared to hit unspecified Canadian fish imports because of the
killing of two whales by Canadian Inuit last July and August.
</P>
<P>
"Canada believes there is no basis for trade sanctions," a
Department of International Trade spokesman was quoted as saying
by today's media report.
</P>
<P>
"Killing two whales does not endanger an entire stock," the
spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Kantor said Canada
allowed Inuit to kill two of the endangered whales without the
approval of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).
</P>
<P>
Kantor is reported to give a list of import restrictions to
Clinton before the February 10 deadline for a decision on a ban.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Canadian fish products imported by
the U.S. will be on the hitting target.
</P>
<P>
The IWC has also expressed concerns about whaling in the
Canadian Arctic because bowhead whale stocks are not recovering.

<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain has opened its telecoms
market to international phone competitors in an effort to attract
more investment and establish the United Kingdom (UK) as a
regional communications hub.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four operators, including AT&AMP;T of the United States and
the Global One alliance of Deutsche Telekem and France Telecom,
won licenses enabling them to compete on largely equal terms with
the two dominant UK telecoms companies -- British
Telecommunications (BT) and Mercury, the second largest telecoms
operator Cable and Wireless.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 46 companies applied for licenses in July,
44 of which have now been granted.
</P>
<P>
The licenses will allow new entrants and international carriers
to build and operate networks rather than rely on leasing lines
from BT and Mercury.
</P>
<P>
"The UK has proved to the world that liberalization pushes down
prices and improve services," Ian Taylor, British minister in
charge of telecommunications, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the move will attract 5 billion pounds (8.2
billion U.S. dollars) in additional telecommunications investment
in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> First Phase of Pakistan Elections to Be over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of
Pakistan's general elections to be held on February 3, 1997 will
be completed Saturday, the last day of filing nomination papers
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of election schedule last Monday, which
gave five days to file nomination papers, the progress of
submitting the papers so far has been slow due to various reasons,
said local press.
</P>
<P>
The most important reason was the late decision by the
political parties to award tickets to their candidates.
</P>
<P>
All the major parties have not yet finalized the tickets and
most of them have completed less than half of their work till
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the marathon sessions of their parliamentary
boards, it is hoped that finalisation of the party tickets will be
completed today and all the prospective candidates will file their
nomination papers on Saturday, the last day for the filing of the
nomination papers.
</P>
<P>
The other reason for the slow pace of submitting of the
nomination papers was the lengthy forms and attached declaration
forms with the assurance that the candidate or his relatives are
not defaulters of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has decided to arrange 100,000 ballot
boxes for simultaneous polling for national and provincial
assemblies.
</P>
<P>
According to existing electoral rolls, the number of voters in
the country is 52 million and is likely to touch 60 million mark
when all the fresh applicants will be included.
</P>
<P>
Scrutiny of the nomination papers will be held on December

<HEADLINE> US Economy Grows at 2.1 Percent Rate in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 2.1 percent in the third quarter, the U.S. Commerce
Department said today in its final report on the gross domestic
products (GDP) in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was a sharp slowdown from the 4.7 percent rate
in the second quarter but a tiny 0.1 percentage upward increase
from a 2.0 percent estimate reported a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that a slightly larger increase in
business inventories contributed to the upward revision.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the GDP, the total output of goods and
services in the U.S., reached an annual rate of 6.93 trillion
dollars in the third quarter after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of the U.S. economy in the third quarter reflected
a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of U.S. economic activities. It increased only at a 0.5
percent rate, the weakest performance in nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
In other areas, business investment in new plants and equipment
was up at a rate of 17.5 percent, a continued sign of strength in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, which has worsened considerably
this year, subtracted 22.7 billion dollars from growth in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Taking all factors into account, the GDP in the U.S. was rising
by 35.8 billion dollars in the third quarter at an annual rate,
down from 78.3 billion in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 2.1 percent growth rate in the third quarter actually
returned growth to where it started the year. The first quarter's
growth rate was 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists believe the economy is growing at around a 2
percent rate in the current quarter and they are forecasting
growth likely will continue at that pace through next year.
</P>
<P>
Growth between 2 percent and 2.5 percent is ideal for the U.S.
economy which is now in its sixth year of expansion because it
provides enough activity to absorb new entrants into the labor
market, they said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the prices increased at an annual rate of
1.7 percent in the quarter, the slowest pace in four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Traffic
Information Center (NTIC) of South Africa has appealed to bus
companies to urgently investigate complaints by passengers of
reckless drivers and unroadworthy buses.
</P>
<P>
Transport Department spokesman for traffic safety Perry
Perrirenyatwa said here fatigue due to long hours on the road,
unroadworthy vehicles, reckless driving and a bad attitude to
safety contributed to the large number of bus accidents.
</P>
<P>
"In the view of the high death number of bus accidents, we
appeal to law enforcers to act stringently against bus drivers
violating road rules and regulations," said Perrirenyatwa.
</P>
<P>
In a latest bus accident in Kwazulu/Natal Province, 10 people
were killed and 36 injured when the vehicle overturned, while in
another accident in Free State Province, 13 people were killed,
17 seriously injured and 25 slightly injured when a bus burst
through a bridge railing and fell into a river embankment.
</P>
<P>
This brought the road death toll to 510 since the festive
season began on December 3, with 97 in Gauteng Province, followed
by 95 and 85 in Eastern Cape and Free State, said the NTIC.

<HEADLINE> Former Irish PM to Appeal Against Libel Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds said today in Dublin that he would appeal against
a British court ruling to award him only one penny in damages for
his libel case against Britain's Sunday Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A London High Court ruled on November 19 that the 64-year-old
former Irish government leader had been libeled by a Sunday Times
article, but decided that neither journalist Alan Ruddock nor
Sunday Times editor John Witherow had acted maliciously in
publishing the story.
</P>
<P>
Although Reynolds has won the libel case, he was awarded only
one-penny damages and he had to pay the legal costs which are
expected to exceed some 800,000 pounds (1.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Reynolds was quoted by the Irish Radio as saying earlier today
in Dublin that the judge's final comments at the end of the 24-day
case had unfairly influenced the jury.
</P>
<P>
"The overall summing-up was unbalanced and grossly unfair and
undoubtedly affected the jury's verdict on malice and damages," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds had sued over a Sunday Times report in November 1994,
which alleged that Reynolds had misled the Dail (Irish parliament)
and lied to his cabinet colleagues.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Imports Goods Via Eritrean Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia imported over
110,000 tons of goods via the Assab Port of Eritrea between
November 10 and December 9 this year, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Ethiopian Representative Office in Assab
as saying that salt ana aid packets were among the goods
transported during the stated period.
</P>
<P>
The report further said over 77 million liters of fuel have
been imported to the country via the Assab Port during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 5,600 tons of coffee and 180,000 liters of
naphatha had been exported via the port over the same period, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, understanding has been reached
between the Ethiopian Representative Office and the Assab
Maritime Transport Office to launch a new system whereby goods
that have higher significance and importance would be given
priority in being transported to the center.
</P>
<P>
It added that shortage of equipment has thwarted efforts to
transport goods from the port to the interior within a short
period of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia became an inland country after Eritrea became
independent in May 1993. Its import and export commodities mainly
go through Assab by road transport while the Ethio-Djibouti
railway handles only seven percent of Ethiopia's commodities due
to old equipment and shortage of spare parts of the railway.

The reform program had cut the deficit from 19.147 billion
Yemeni rials (about 152 million U.S. dollars) to 7.122 billion
rials (56.5 million dollars) during the first nine months of the
current year.

The program has also scored tangible success in stabilizing
the rate of exchange of the national currency against foreign
currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. It has also stemmed the
growing inflation.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to control the cash flow, the Yemeni central bank
absorbed more than 8 billion Yemeni rials (63 million dollars) by
issuing Treasury bonds, besides the liberalization of trade,
abolition of import licenses, and encouraging exports. Exports
over the past year amounted to 108 million dollars, as compared

<HEADLINE> Arafat Expresses Doubt About Quick Agreement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said in Gaza this afternoon that he does not have much
hope about chances of reaching agreement with the (Binyamin)
Netanyahu government, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Arafat raised the pessimistic view after meeting with an
Israeli delegation composed of a number of Knesset (parliament)
members.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, who has just concluded an Europe
tour, told the Israeli lawmakers that he prefers European
mediation to American efforts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, upon his arrival in Cairo airport from
Europe, Arafat said he sees no signs of hope that an agreement
on partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank city of
Hebron will be concluded in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In view of the Israeli government's intransigence, Arafat
said, he could not expect a solution that will satisfy the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the Israeli Knesset delegation, however, urged
Arafat to speed up negotiations on Hebron redeployment. Yossi
Beilin, Labor member of Knesset and architect of the Oslo
Accords, persuaded Arafat not to reject the efforts of the
U.S. Middle Peace coordinator Dennis Ross to broker an
American-backed peace process. Beilin added that it would be a
mistake to do so.
</P>
<P>
Danny Naveh, Israeli cabinet secretary, said this morning
that Israel welcomes the U.S. decision to send Ross back to help
wrap up an accord on Israeli army redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to arrive in Israel Saturday night with a
mission of wrapping up a deal within a week, Israeli newspapers
said. Ross spent three weeks in the region in October, but failed
to bridge the gaps between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 1,000 Palestinians and Israelis participated

<HEADLINE> Greece Hails Deep Friendship with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos said today that the deep friendship between Athens
and Cairo will grow as a result of his four-day visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The president, who arrived here this evening after a stopover
at the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, said his visit
highlights the deep relations between the Greek and Egyptian
peoples and his personal friendship with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
These will contribute substantially to invigorating the
cooperation between the two countries, said Stephanopoulos in
statements made to the press in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The president said future ties with Egypt will not change and
continue to grow after Greece's entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
"Greece is member of the European Union and at the same
time a sincere and faithful friend to Egypt," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the conditions of Egyptian expatriate labor in Greece,
Stephanopoulos said this question will be discussed by the foreign
ministers of both countries.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Egyptians went to work in Greece, mainly in its
agricultural, tourist and fishing sectors, under the 1981
agreement on labor exchange between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In Alexandria, the president and his entourage visited the
Greek Museum, which exhibits an array of statues and relics from
the Greek and Roman areas as well as ancient Egyptian
monuments. He also visited the Greek community in the city.
</P>
<P>
He is slated to meet with Mubarak Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two leaders will focus on bilateral
economic ties, the peace process in the Middle East and other
issues of common interest, said the president before departure
from Alexandria, northwest of the Nile Delta.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Greek summit will also cover the situation in the
Mediterranean and Egyptian-EU economic partnership, according to
Foreign Ministry sources earlier.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmad Goweli will hold talks with
the Greek delegation on enhancing trade exchange and removing
obstacles hampering Egyptian exports to the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Greece comes seventh on the list of EU importing countries from
Egypt. Bilateral trade balance tipped in favor of Greece from 1993
to 1995, but it is now in Egypt's favor.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian exports to Greece include fresh fish, carpets, wool,
chemicals and iron and steel whereas the Greek exports to Egypt
include oil products, flour, vegetable oil and timber.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic relations between Egypt and Greece were
booming since they signed an accord to encourage and protect
investments in 1993.

<HEADLINE> No Punishment to Students Taking Part in Belgrade Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Education Minister
Dragoslav Mladenovic promised today that no measures would be
taken against students taking part in four-week demonstrations
triggered by the outcome of recent local polls.
</P>
<P>
Mladenovic told reporters after a meeting of the Serbian
parliament education committee, which had discussed the situation
at university departments and consequences of the students'
protest, that the lectures the students had missed should be held
later.
</P>
<P>
The students have been holding separate protests in Belgrade
over the past four weeks against the alleged government election
fraud, which added momentum to the protests of citizens in
Belgrade and other cities in Serbia organized by the opposition
coalition Zajedno (Together). Some University students even went
on a strike that has lasted more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
During their protests, the students asked a republic commission
to be established to confirm the election results on the basis of
the original voting records. They also demand the resignation of
Belgrade University Dean Dragutin Velickovic because he has
ignored the students' protest.
</P>
<P>
Mladenovic said that in keeping with talks held between
officials of university departments and the Serbian government,
all department councils and faculties should hold meetings and see
to it that problems of all students, whether they are taking part
in rallies or not, be handled properly.
</P>
<P>
The government and independent student associations have called
on university and high-school students to go back to classrooms
and accused the opposition parties of manipulating young people in
political events.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Outstanding assessed
contributions to the United Nations totaled 2.3 billion dollars as
of December 15, according to the office of the spokesman for the
UN secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 545 million dollars were for the regular budget
and 1.71 billion dollars for peacekeeping operations. Additional 8
million dollars were owed for the International Tribunals.
</P>
<P>
Arrears of the United States alone stood at 1.3 billion
dollars, over a half of the total.
</P>
<P>
On the causes for the financial crisis, the UN Department of
Public Information said that some member states failed to pay
their dues on time and in full because of budgetary technicalities
or poverty. But some had withheld payments as a pressure tactic or
to make a political point.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has urged repeatedly
and also in his farewell statement at the General Assembly the
major contributor to pay its dues on time and in full.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan, secretary-general elect, at his first press
conference after election, also urged the United States to pay its
arrears. "It is not really in the interest of the United States
not to pay its contribution to the United Nations. It offends
friends and foes alike," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Satisfied with EU Fish Catch Quota Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
expressed satisfaction over the European Union's (EU) fish catch
quota agreement, saying it was "good news" for British fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission, acting on scientific advice, had proposed
further reductions in order to safeguard fish stocks, but
Britain's mackerel and plaice quotas rose by 21,000 and 2,700
tons, according to BBC television reports today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry was quoted as saying
today that Britain had secured "the best possible deal" for its
fishermen after obtaining catch quotas next year very close to
1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the changes secured from the EU were worth 16
million pounds (about 26 million U.S. dollars) to the country's
fishing industry, increasing the fish stocks available in British
waters by 23,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> UK Money Supply Rises 10.8 Pct in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Money supply in Britain rose
10.8 percent year-on-year in November, the fastest growth for
almost six years and indicating that interest rates might have to
rise soon, according to the Bank of England Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the broad measure of money supply,
M4, which includes cash circulating in the economy and bank and
building society deposits, jumped by 1.1 percent in November from
October.
</P>
<P>
The M4, a possible indicator of future inflation and is closely
watched by the central bank and the Treasury, has exceeded the
upper limit of the government's 3 percent to 9 percent target
range since autumn last year.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend has gained momentum over the past three
months, fueled by soaring demand for mortgages and other forms of
consumer credit, as well as by heavy borrowing by the banks'
commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
The November increase, from October's 10.5 percent, follows
recent strong economic data, including a record fall in
unemployment and buoyant retail sales released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were taken by surprise by the surge and believe that
although Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has been
anxious to avoid raising interest rates before next May's general
election, he may have to order another rates rise at the Bank of
England's monetary policy meeting next month.

ultimately corruption, an enemy of justice," President Amour said
in his speech read on his behalf by Zanzibar Chief Minister
Mohamed Bilal.
</P>
<P>
He urged police commanders to enhance solidarity and love
among themselves and to strengthen close cooperation with the

which is a pre-requisite for maintenance of peace in the
country".

strengthen the police force and make it more responsible in
enforcing law and order.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Somali Factions to Cease Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today called on all Somali factions to cease immediately all
hostilities and to restore an effective cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Italian Ambassador Paolo Fulci,
the council president for December, said that the Security Council
was gravely concerned at the resumption of fighting in Mogadishu,
where the latest clashes were taking an increasingly heavy toll in
human lives.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council fully supported the efforts of the
countries of the region as well as of international and regional
organizations, in particular the Organization of African Unity and
the League of Arab States, to facilitate a political settlement of
the crisis in Somalia, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council appealed to all Somali factions to join in such
efforts to start a process of national reconciliation aimed at the
establishment of a broad-based national government, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed its commitment to a lasting solution to the
crisis in Somalia and encouraged the UN secretary-general to
continue to monitor closely the situation and to report to the
council on any further development, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been plagued by regional clan-based rivalries for
over three decades. The civil war between 1988 and 1990 claimed a
toll of over 50,000 lives. The lasting warfare and a severe drought
in 1991-1992 created over 2 million refugees and widespread
starvation with an estimated death of 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence comes at a time when Ethiopia has convened
all but one of the clan-based political groups in Mogadishu to
attend talks at a town near Addis Ababa. With peace talks stalled,
rival factions in Mogadishu have been waging street battles since
last Friday. At least 300 people have died in the recent fighting,
many of them civilians.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says He Will Return to Kremlin Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, who underwent a heart by-pass surgery on November 5, said
tonight that he will return to the Kremlin on Monday, or December
23, to resume his work.
</P>
<P>
In his first televised interview after the operation, Yeltsin
announced, "The rehabilitation period has ended. I will return to
the Kremlin on Monday." He now stays in his Rus residence at the
Zavidovo park outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs an active and energetic president now more
than ever before. The doctors did all they could, they did even
more, now it is up to the president," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said earlier today that
Yeltsin will get back to work on Monday upon completion of the
rehabilitation period. The president will work at the beginning
"according to a sparing regime," because his doctors insist on his
"smooth" entry into the working schedule, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The president focused on priority problems in the televised
interview. "There have accumulated plenty of problems, which
require attention of the president. These are, primarily, social
problems, timely payment of pensions and salaries."
</P>
<P>
He thought it necessary to put tax collection in order, saying,
"It is impossible to make payments from the budget without
replenishing it." He said he had decided to raise this problem at
a meeting of the commission on tax and budget discipline.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no indulgence at the commission meeting. It will
be a conversation without any allowances. I want to remind
enterprise heads: if you cannot pay, you cannot be equal to your
task. And if you cannot be equal to your task, resign," Yeltsin
said.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces require close attention, the president said.
He stressed, "We need a military doctrine, a reform in the first
turn. We must take a decision what kind of armed forces we need,
their key tasks and goals and social problems."
</P>
<P>
He said he will hold a meeting of both the Defense Council and
the Security Council in the next few days to discuss these issues
in detail.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also described the Chechen solution still as "one of
the most important" problems, saying, "The policy of peaceful
settlement remains unchanged."
</P>
<P>
In his words, when back to the Kremlin, he will hold a number
of separate meetings with top-ranking officials including Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, presidential chief of staff Anatoly
Chubais, several deputy prime ministers and ministers. They should
report on their work, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone will be made to answer regardless former services,
and the criterion will be one for all -- the quality of people's
life. We will part with those who cannot face people's needs. The
lack of improvement is viewed by people as marking of time, it
lads to disappointment and mistrust of the authorities," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He declared, "We need new impulses, more courage and energy of
all."
</P>
<P>
Asked to estimate control over Russia during his ailment,
Yeltsin said, "Life in this country remained in the normal channel
during my ailment. The recent months tested our constitution,
matureness of democracy in Russia, and society withstood this.
This makes me sure we are on the right path."

ATHENS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece said today there was "no
problem" in contacts between Cyprus and Russia concerning
Nicosia's plans to buy s-300 surface-to-air missiles from Moscow
in order to bolster its defense against air attack.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the s-300 was
not an "aggressive" system and he recalled a similar statement by
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Reppas made the statement when asked to comment on remarks by
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller who reportedly said that on
her recent trip to Moscow, she had received assurances that Russia
would not go ahead with the sale after beating her fist on the
desk of Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin four times.
</P>
<P>
A Russian diplomat who was present at the Ciller-Chernomyrdin
meeting later denied that such assurances had been given.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriot officials said talks had been held with Russia
on buying weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is the site of a heavy military build-up and at the
heart of tense relations between Turkey and Greece.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Somali Factions to Cease Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Boutros-Ghali urged the Somali
leaders to demonstrate political wisdom and patriotism and to
desist from all actions which serve to undermine the positive
contributions to peacemaking coming from within the region.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general considered the renewed fighting
particularly worrying as it could deal a fatal blow to the recent
agreement signed in Nairobi by the three Somali leaders based in
Mogadishu, under the mediation of President Daniel Arap Moi of
Kenya, and to hopes for a reinvigoration of the peace process in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The fighting since last Friday has taken a toll of over 300
people as rival factions in Mogadishu have been waging street
battles.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Croatia to Help Return of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council urged on Friday Croatia to adopt a comprehensive approach
in order to facilitate the return of Serb refugees.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council noted that although
the security situation has improved slightly, there are continued
acts of harassment, looting and physical attacks against Croatian
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"It calls upon the government of Croatia," the statement said,
"to intensify its efforts to improve the security situation and to
ensure adequate security conditions for the local Serb population.
</P>
<P>
On the question of refugees, the statement noted the failure of
the Croatian government to safeguard effectively their property
rights and the situation where many of those Serbs who have
returned to the former sectors have been unable to regain
possession of their properties.
</P>
<P>
"The council calls upon the government of Croatia to apply
immediately proper procedures to the question of property rights
and to stop all forms of discrimination against the Croatian Serb
population in the provision of social benefits and reconstruction
assistance," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The council also underlined that equitable application of
the new amnesty law is vital for building confidence and
promoting reconciliation in Croatia as well as for the peaceful
reintegration of the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and
Western Sirmium.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa on HK Provisional Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief
Executive designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), today called on Hong Kong people to unite and support the
work of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) which is
shouldering historic tasks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here late this afternoon,
Tung said that the 60 members of the PLC elected at the fourth
plenary session of the Selection Committee for the First
Government of the HKSAR are widely representative.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Today is a historic day, for the Selection Committee
has completed its second major task: 60 members of the PLC of the
HKSAR were elected."
</P>
<P>
He said that all the 60 members are among the elite of Hong
Kong. Thirty-three of them are members of the existing Legislative
Council.
</P>
<P>
Tung said, "I have noticed that the vast Hong Kong citizens, in
fact, are supporting the PLC, for they knew that the establishment
of the PLC results from the failure to realize the 'through
train' due to the breaking-down of the Sino-British negotiations
on 'constitutional package'."
</P>
<P>
He said that the setting up of the PLC will avoid a legal
vacuum in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the tenure of office of the PLC is limited, within one
year. In fact, the legal panel of the Preparatory Committee for
the HKSAR is studying how to form the first Legislative Council of
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On the statement of the British government on the question of
the PLC, Tung said that he was very disappointed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the words of the British government did no good to
Hong Kong's smooth transition, adding that the statement will
exert great pressure on the civil servants in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He urged the British side to take into consideration Hong
Kong's overall interests, face the reality of the establishment of
the PLC, and increase cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa said that he is confident of Hong Kong's smooth
transition at the critical moment.
</P>
<P>
He called on Hong Kong people to make efforts to support the
work of the PLC and the government team designate as well as his
cooperation with the Hong Kong government in the transition
period.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Becomes Oil Exporter </HEADLINE>

ULAN BATOR, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia became an oil
exporter by selling 15,900 liters of oil for the first time
earlier this month, according to news reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian Prime Minister Mendisaikhan Enkhsaikhan said the
deal, small in quantity, was aimed at exploring the possibility of
selling and shipping oil from Mongolia to the international market.
</P>

A traditional oil importer, Mongolia, with the help of oil
companies from the United States, Russia and Canada, has been
tapping its resources in its eastern part in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Economic Restructuring Emphasized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice Minister of Finance Zhang
Youcai has urged in an article that China should place more
emphasis on economic restructuring and optimizing the distribution
of available state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is also director of the State Administration of
State Property, said that poor liquidity is a major factor
contributing to the poor economic performance of China's
state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
"To improve the situation, we should direct state-owned assets
to move to the highly-efficient sectors, in order to maintain and
increase their value," Zhang said, adding that China should
undertake economic restructuring and pursue economies of scale
through enterprise mergers and alliance.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China should establish enterprise groups and
give full scope to their role as the backbone of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The irrational distribution of existing assets must be halted
and the frozen assets should be newly invested into the economy,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
An irrational economic structure, poor management, lack of
funds and a rigid operational mechanism are the leading causes of
the problems and contradictions confronting Chinese enterprises,
such as economic losses among a large number of enterprises, in a
wide range of areas and in a concentration of economic sectors,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"The key to solving the problems lies in accelerating our pace
of reform and making a greater effort to improve the economic
structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
More specifically, China should improve the industrial,
enterprise organizational, regional and product structure, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises, with 67 percent of the country's
workforce, account for 65 percent of China's total amount of
assets and more than 60 percent of the national fiscal revenue,
according to Zhang.

<P>
PARIS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Within weeks, France's foreign policy suffered three bitter
set-backs due to the lack of resoluteness of President Jacques
Chirac. They are the planned international intervention in eastern
Zaire, the naming of the United Nations secretary general, and the
Europeanization of the NATO South Command. The U.S. political and
diplomatic power and the lack of consensus within Europe are
another two factors leading to the French set-backs.
</P>
<P>
-- A delegation of the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe, led by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez,
arrived in the Serbian capital Belgrade Friday to help end the
crisis in the country, caused by the confrontation between
President Slobodan Milosevic and the opposition parties which are
demonstrating in the streets everyday to protest the nullification
of last month's municipal election results.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Four days after the arrest of its leader Francois Santoni,
the Corsican nationalists group FLNC-Canal Historique has been
launching new attacks against the paramilitary police,
Gendarmerie. They accused Prime Minister Alain Juppe of
manipulating a recent racketeering case on the island to harden
its crackdown on them. A lawyers' group of Corsica also called on
Juppe to respect the right of presumption of innocence of the
arrested nationalists.

<HEADLINE> UN Contacts Underway to Denounce Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian official said
today that contacts are under way to hold a meeting by the
15-member U.N. Security Council to prepare a resolution calling
upon Israel to halt expanding settlements.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Sawt al-Arab radio, Egyptian Ambassador to the
U.N. Security Council Mahmoud Abu al-Nasr said that the council is
close to such a resolution, but the U.S.is opposed to condemning
Israel in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Arab delegates in the U.N. have held contacts with their
European colleagues to clarify the Arab stand and the European
member states of the Security Council have welcomed the move and
expressed their readiness to back a draft resolution condemning
Israel, said the Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. opposition would eventually block the way for
tabling such a resolution at the Security council. Washington
always takes the side of Israel at any time of international
effort to condemn the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The recent criticisms made by Washington against the settlement
policy of the Jewish state did not represent a shift in its
policies regarding the peace process in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador urged the U.S., the main architect of the peace
process initiated five years ago in Madrid, to press Israel to
abide by the agreements reached with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The recent Israeli decision to build some 130 houses for Jews
in the heart of Arab East Jerusalem has been regarded as a brazen
provocation to Palestinians and Arabs and an attempt to preempt
the final status negotiations with the Palestinians supposed to be
concluded in 1999.

<HEADLINE> IRA Claims Responsibility for Shooting Policeman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
claimed responsibility today for shooting a policeman guarding a
prominent pro-British politician in Belfast, capital of Northern
Ireland, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The policeman was shot and wounded by gunmen Friday night while
acting as bodyguard for Nigel Dodds, secretary of the Democratic
Unionist Party and former mayor of Belfast, who was visiting his
ill son in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British politicians were quoted as saying that they had
been warned recently by security sources against growing risk of
assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman of the IRA Belfast Brigade said as for the
incident the target was the police, not Dodds.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, London's police chief urged the public to be on
the alert for possible pre-Christmas attacks by IRA guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The IRA abandoned a 17 month cease-fire in February, setting
off a string of bombs in both Northern Ireland and mainland
Britain.
</P>
<P>
It has refused appeals by Britain, Ireland and the United
States to a new cease-fire for it to win a seat at peace talks for
its political arm, Sinn Fein.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislators Pledge To Fulfill Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected members
of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) today pledged to
fulfill their duties to contribute to the smooth operation of the
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, who collected 317 votes to make the
60-seat PLC, expressed her wishes to devote wholeheartedly to the
work of the legislature. "The PLC work has a great bearing on the
smooth transition and long-term stability and prosperity of Hong
Kong. It is a strong sense of mission to push me to come out to do
my bit for the society at this historic moment,"
</P>
<P>
"I will take a positive and constructive attitude to discuss
acts at the PLC and serve the Hong Kong citizens, and I will
handle affairs in an objective, just and impartial manner," said
the former legislator and executive councilor. "A clear government
and rule of law are the key areas I will concentrate my energy
on," she added.
</P>
<P>
Howard Young is one of the 33 incumbent legislators who
succeeded in getting into the PLC. In his view, the PLC work
should be carried out in two phases.
</P>
<P>
Before July 1, 1997, he said, the PLC should focus on affairs
essential to the founding of the HKSAR, such as enacting laws
concerning the SAR passport, adopting international laws in Hong
Kong and endorsing the appointment of judges of the Court of Final
Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, 1997, the PLC should fully exercise powers and
functions as the first Legislative Council will do, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tan Yiu-chung, vice-chairman of the HK Federation of Trade
Unions, became the champion in the secret ballot by winning 345
votes. Learning about the voting results, he said: "I'm very happy
and excited. I thank the Selection Committee members and the Hong
Kong people who give me strong support."
</P>
<P>
Having participated in the work of the Preliminary Committee
and the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR, Tan has rich
experience in handling legal affairs. The trade union leader said
he hoped the knowledge and experience would help him in his future
work in the PLC.
</P>
<P>
The oldest winner among the 60 elected PLC members is
83-year-old Elsie Tu, who has been engaged in social work in the
Hong Kong community for 45 years. Tu, a British citizen, collected
252 votes to make the PLC.
</P>
<P>
She said that within its one-year operation, the provisional
Legislature should discuss emergency acts and tackle affairs that
have an impact on Hong Kong's economy, livelihood and stability.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Wong Wang-fat, chairman of the current Legislative
Council, also gained a seat in the PLC with 317 votes. A lecturer
in government and public administration at the Chinese University,
Wong has been working as a legislator for 12 years. He said that
as a responsible politician, he should face the reality to join
the race for the PLC membership, so as to contribute to the smooth
transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The PLC will operate up to June 30, 1998 when the first
Legislative Council of the HKSAR is founded. It is to fulfill
major tasks such as enacting laws absolutely necessary to the
smooth operation of the HKSAR, and amending and repealing laws in
light of the specific conditions.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Hails UN Postponement of Air Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sudan welcomed the
U.N. Security Council's decision to postpone the implementation of
the U.N. resolution 1070 which imposes an air embargo on the
country, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan believes that there are no justifications for the
U.N. resolution adopted in August, Foreign Minister Ali Osman
Taha was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed relief towards the Security Council's request from
Ethiopia to provide all necessary documents on the investigations
and trials of the three suspects allegedly involved in attempts on
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's life in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
last year.
</P>
<P>
The request can be explained as being in favor of Sudan, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided Friday to postpone the
implementation of the resolution for another six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted on August 16, calls for imposing an
air embargo on Sudan's airline by the end of November this year
for its failure to hand over the three suspects.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the resolution was postponed for
30 days on November 23 due to a French-Russian request that offers
the U.N. Security Council an opportunity to assess the consequence
of the implementation of the resolution.

recent upswing in market performance, a senior securities official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the nation's effort to balance the supply and
demand in the stock market and curb excessive speculation," Zhang
Dongsheng, a deputy director of the Finance and Banking Department
of the State Planning Commission, told Xinhua in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
He added that top priority will be given to those state-owned
large and medium-sized enterprises supported by the State Council
-- China's highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
China plans to issue a total of ten billion yuan worth of new
stocks in 1996, almost double the amount for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Stock investment has become increasingly attractive to an
increasing number of Chinese in recent years -- especially in the
past few months. Official statistics show that a total of 21
million Chinese have opened trading accounts, up from 12 million
at the beginning of this year and 14 million in September.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that a rapidly-growing number of stock investors
has caused the market to overheat and a shortage in the supply of
stocks, resulting in runaway price rises and excessive speculation.
</P>
<P>
"The current market size allows some institutional investors to
manipulate the stock prices and drive them up to ridiculous
highs," said Cao Fengqi, a financial expert with Beijing
University.
</P>
<P>
"An accelerated expansion of the Chinese stock market will
boost the capital market and help pool more funds for those
capital-strapped enterprises," he said, adding that market
speculation can be cut to the minimum level only if the market
size is adequate.
</P>
<P>
Expanding the stock market in an active but gradual manner has
already been included in the nation's development strategy, and
the market is bound to become a major indicator of the national
economy, the financial authorities reaffirmed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
However, the market needs greater regulation, given the fact
that it is still plagued by insider-trading, excessive speculation
and trading on margin, according to an official of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, the industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
"It will remain at the top of our work agenda for a fairly long
period of time to further supervise the stock market, and curb
over-speculation and irregularities, in order to better protect
the interests of the smaller investors," the official stated.
</P>
<P>
As many as 520 Chinese companies had been listed in the
country's two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen by December
18, up from 323 at the end of last year. They issued shares valued
at 109 billion yuan (about 13.1 billion US dollars) in aggregate,
a rise of 42 percent over the year-end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The current market capitalization of more than 1.33 trillion
yuan, almost triple the 1995 figure, accounts for 18 percent of
China's gross domestic product, as against six percent at the
end of last year.

<P>
SEOUL, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in
South Korea in the first 11 months of 1996 amounted to 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars, up 32.6 percent from the same period last year, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy said today.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1962 that South Korea saw inbound
direct investment surpass 2 billion U.S. dollars in a single year.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector in the country received 1.28 billion
U.S. dollars in the January-November period of this year with an
increase of 44.4 percent, while non-manufacturing sector rose 11.8
percent to 1.02 billion dollars.

As a result, the ratio of the investment in the manufacturing
sector accounted for 56 percent of the total, up from last year's
47 percent, the ministry said.

The United States is the biggest investor in South Korea with
766 million dollars, followed by the European Union with 564

<HEADLINE> HK Selection Committee Members Criticize British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Many members of the
Selection Committee for the First Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region criticized the statement made Friday
by the British foreign secretary and urged the British to stop
creating troubles that may hinder the smooth transition of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Selection Committee were here today for its
fourth plenary session to elect the 60-member Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary threatened in the statement to
bring the issue of the PLC to the International Court of Justice
and intended to provoke international legal bodies to interfere in
this issue.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kai-nan said that there is nothing new in the statement.
The British had no choice but stick to what they have said before,
which is quite wrong.
</P>
<P>
"If any other foreign countries want to get involved in this
issue, they should first study the history of the negotiations
over Hong Kong's political reform and the arguments of the
election model. Many times when we talk to foreign diplomats, they
don't know in Hong Kong there is a basic law, they don't know
there is 17 rounds of negotiations between the two governments,
they know nothing. So before they give any comment, they should
study the history," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan Hsu Lai Tai said that the whole thing has been created
by the British themselves. Originally there was a "through train"
for the legislative body, but they destroyed it. As a result,
there is no other choice but to establish the PLC, which is also
an indispensable measure in the process of Hong Kong's smooth
handover.
</P>
<P>
"The British should ask themselves what they have done wrong
instead of asking us," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Arculli said he doubted very much if the British can get
any support from any international legal bodies.
</P>
<P>
"There might be one or two who might make some sort of
sympathetic noises, but I don't think they could get any
substantial support. I really want to ask this question: What is
the British government seeking to achieve? Is it seeking to
achieve a successful transition? Then this may be not the best way
to do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wong Yu-hong said that the legislative election conducted by
the British Hong Kong government in 1995 was against the Basic
Law. It was the British who broke the original "through-train"
arrangement. They have no reason to criticize the PLC.

<HEADLINE> China Completes Construction of Major Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- After years of strenuous
effort, China has completed the construction of a major power
station located on the Yuanjiang River in southern Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held today to mark the connection of Unit 5 of
the Wuqiangxi Power Station with the local power grid.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the station, with a total installed capacity of
1.2 million kilowatts, has surpassed seven billion yuan (about 843
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The hydro-electrical station, Hunan's largest, will have
additional functions of flood control, navigation and aquatic
breeding.
</P>
<P>
The new power station boasts a number of world advanced
equipment and has well demonstrated China's ability in building
hydro-electrical engineering projects in the 1990s, experts said.
</P>
<P>
China began to build the power station in the 1950s, but the
project was suspended. Construction resumed in 1986 with the
approval of the State Council, China's highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
The power station has five units, each with an installed
capacity of 240,000 kilowatts. The station will be able to
generate 5.37 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually,
which will greatly ease power shortages in the province, officials
said.

<P>
The meeting between the two leaders focused on bilateral
economic ties, Cyprus, the peace process in the Middle East and
other issues of common interest.

<P>
MAPUTO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The government effort to
guarantee the welfare of its citizens in 1996 has achieved
positive results, President Joaquim Chissano has said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the remarks at a reception here in honor of
foreign missions on Friday, the Noticias paper reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the past year saw good results in national
reconciliation, reinforced justice system and the strike at
crimes.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, Chissano noted, production has been
improved, the exchange rate of local currency stabilized and
inflation down at a great margin.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Paris club countries for writing off part of
Mozambique's debts which run at 5,500 million U.S. Dollars at
present, but pointed out that the issue can only be solved
thoroughly after all the debts are canceled.
</P>
<P>
On the war in Liberia, the chaos in Somalia and the situation
in the Great Lakes region, Chissano said all this shows that
Africa will not realize general peace if no greater efforts are
being made.
</P>
<P>
As these hinder the political stability and economical
development in the continent, other countries, especially those
with higher level of development, should provid assistance to
Africa, said the Mozambican President.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Worried Over US Claims on Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has expressed grave
concern over the reported U.S. claim of information to the effect
that the violence would continue till January 16, 1997, following
this weeks bomb blasts in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The "New Nigerian" paper reported today that the government is
disturbed and will take up the united states on the matter at the
appropriate quarters, said foreign affairs minister tom ikimi on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was addressing the closing session of the 13th regular
course of the Foreign Service Academy in Lagos, the commercial
center and former capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the government-owned newspaper, the U.S. State
Department on Tuesday issued a statement warning its nationals
worldwide who might wish to travel to Nigeria between now and
January 16, 1997 to exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the State Department had received
information that "bomb attacks may take place at Nigerian
airports during the last two weeks of December".
</P>
<P>
"The government is still investigating the source and veracity
of the claim and the motive behind America's latest action," said
the foreign minister, quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
If the outcome of the investigations falls below expectation,
the minister affirmed federal government's preparedness to take
the matter to the United States mission for proper understanding
of what they mean, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two bomb blasts rocked Lagos earlier this week, a
reinforcement of the country's already poor security situation.
</P>
<P>
An explosion on Monday seriously injured three persons in the
convoy of Lagos State Administrator Col. Mohammed Marwa. The
administrator escaped unhurt however.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 12 soldiers were injured when another explosion
rocked a bus conveying members of the Lagos state task force on
environmental sanitation and special offenses to work.
</P>
<P>
As a result, security has been tightened in Lagos and Abuja,
capital of the country, while at least 10 persons have been
arrested in connection with the bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, arrangements are being made
at the highest quarter to make sure that the incidence of
bombing, which he described as a worst act of terrorism, does not
become a permanent fixture in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Suspect of Jetfoil Robbery Case Arrested in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Another suspect of the jetfoil
robbery of 10 million HK dollars (about 1.29 million US dollars)
last year was arrested in Macao on Friday, the Macao Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chan Kui Qing, 38, was arrested when he arrived in Macao Friday
noon on a flight from Taiwan, following his arrest and expulsion
by Taiwan police.
</P>
<P>
Chan was charged with the offense of piracy. He was suspected
to have participated in the hijacking of a jetfoil on June 22,
1995 and robbed a Macao bank of 10 million HK dollars together
with several other criminals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a leading criminal of the case, Wu Shu
Cheong, 37, was convicted on offense of piracy in Macao and
sentenced to 19 years and six months in jail, plus 6.50 million
Patacas (823,000 US dollars) of compensations.
</P>
<P>
Several other criminals of the case were either sentenced to
death penalty, death penalty on suspension, or years of
imprisonment by courts in China's mainland, Hong Kong or Macao.
Only one suspect is still at large after Chan's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Chan fled to Vietnam after the robbery case was exposed, and
was arrested by Taiwan police this week on crime of perjury. He
was later found to have involved in the jetfoil robbery case.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Speaks at Selection Committee Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qichen, chairman
of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), said that it was useless for
Britain to play "international card" on the issue of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark when he delivered a speech this afternoon
at the closing of the one-day fourth plenary session of the
Selection Committee of the First Government of the HKSAR here
today, at which the 60-member Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC) of the HKSAR had been elected.
</P>
<P>
He said that from the drafting of the method for the election
of the PLC to the nomination of the applicants and to today's
election, people can find that opinions of the masses of Hong Kong
people had been canvassed in the process of forming the PLC and it
also won active support and participation from Hong Kong people of
different circles.
</P>
<P>
"The election was just, fair and open. It reflected the
principle of democracy. Because of this, the PLC elected today is
widely representative as far as composition is concerned, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that among the 60 PLC members, there are people from
both industrial and commercial circles and labor and grassroots
sectors, as well as many of the professional elite. It is
especially worth noting that 33 incumbent legislators were also
elected. This fully proves that when members of the Selection
Committee cast the votes, they had the overall interests and
smooth transition of Hong Kong in mind.
</P>
<P>
"The election of those people with practical experience in
legislative work will be beneficial to the operation of the PLC,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British foreign secretary expressed worries on
the establishment of the PLC Friday. The fact is that it's the
British themselves who created this situation which they are
reluctant to see.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Basic Law and related decisions made by the
National People's Congress, there was a 'through-train'
arrangement for the legislative body," he said. "It was the
British side who stubbornly clung to the constitutional package in
contravention of the stipulations of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and
the Agreements and Understandings reached between China and
Britain, thus destroying the 'through-train' arrangement."
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the Chinese and British sides held 17 rounds of
talks on this issue, but no agreement was reached because the
British side discontinued the talks. Under these circumstances,
the PLC was established to protect the Joint Declaration and
ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the PLC's task is to draft the laws
indispensable to the HKSAR after 1997, it will neither affect
British administration in Hong Kong before 1997 nor replace the
incumbent Legislative Council; the laws drafted by the PLC will
become valid after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is what I told the British foreign secretary, and there
should not be any misunderstanding," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that related decisions made by the Preparatory
Committee have also clearly regulated the term of the PLC: the PLC
will operate till the day when the first Legislative Council of
the HKSAR is founded, and the time will not exceed June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Qian reminded the British side that in the last few months of
its administration in Hong Kong, it should not interfere in the
affairs of the HKSAR through the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to ensure the timely formation of the
first Legislative Council of the HKSAR, the Preparatory Committee
has set up a panel to study the detailed method for forming it.
The first Legislative Council will be formed wholly in line with
the Basic Law and related decisions of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Qian said people with the least bit of knowledge know that the
issue of Hong Kong is the affair between the Chinese and British
governments before the handover, and it will be China's internal
affair after the handover. It would be useless for the British to
play the "international card", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the successful election of the first Chief
Executive and the PLC created quite beneficial conditions for Hong
Kong's smooth transition and further promoted the confidence of
the 6 million Hong Kong people in their future. The trend of
development in Hong Kong is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the PLC will surely be able to meet any
challenge and eliminate any interference to operate successfully.
We firmly believe that the great practice of 'One country, Two
systems', 'Hong Kong people running Hong Kong' and a high degree
of autonomy will lead to one success after another," he stated.

<HEADLINE> HK Drink-drivers Hit New High as Christmas Around Corner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The run-up to Christmas has
recorded a new weekly high in the number of drink-driving cases
since breath-testing was introduced in Hong Kong last December,
the English-language Hong Kong Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted police as saying that 25 drivers were found to
be over the prescribed limit last week, including 10 at the
weekend alone.
</P>
<P>
Chief Inspector John Lau Po-sang of the Drink-Driving Unit said
this compared to the year's weekly average of 15 cases. "The
increase is more serious than what we've expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lau warned motorists not to risk drink-driving over the
Christmas and New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
"It could lead to immediate imprisonment, suspension of the
driver's licence, a fine and point deduction on the driving
merit-system," he said.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, a total of 9,308 drivers had been breathalysed
since the legislation was implemented last December, with 279
persons convicted of drink-driving offenses.
</P>
<P>
Police would stop a car to breathalyse the driver if they
noticed unusual driving, and they would also breathalyse drivers
involved in car accidents or traffic offenses.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Hong Kong Buildings on Hazards "Watchlist" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Home Affairs
Department has been urged to get tough on owners of some 1,000
private buildings that have been targeted as potential fire and
safety hazards.
</P>
<P>
The buildings have been put on a government "watchlist" because
they could become fire hazards or have structural defects and
hygiene problems, local English-language newspaper Hong Kong
Standard reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Lap-sun, deputy director of the department, said that the
department has been continuously surveying private buildings.
</P>
<P>
Most of the buildings are old residential and commercial
buildings in Yau Ma Tei. And they were "targets for improvement"
because of various defects -- mostly fire safety standards,
illegal structures and poor hygiene, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Department liaison officers coordinate with the department and
the Fire Services Department if faults are found and action
needed.
</P>
<P>
Although about 400 residential buildings have been removed from
the watchlist, new one are being identified.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean that these buildings are dangerous. Only
some aspects of them need to be improved, Lee said. But, "It's
wrong to say that they are blacklisted," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM's Visit to Jordan Fails to Narrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister David Levy's visit to Jordan failed to narrow
the differences on the peace process between the two countries,
the local newspaper Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper disclosed that the meetings between Jordanian King
Hussein, Crown Prince Hassen, Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
and Levy Thursday failed to resolve the differences that have
been pushing the two countries apart since the Likud-led
government took power in June.
</P>
<P>
Jordan demanded that Israel implement all the agreements it
has signed with the Palestinians and regarded the expansion of
settlement as a direct threat not only to the Palestinians but
also to Jordan's national security and the future of the whole
peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, at a joint press conference held Thursday with
Jordanian Minister of Information Marwan Muasher, Levy gave no
indication that Israel was willing to change any of its policies.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli foreign minister reiterated his country's refusal
to halt the expansion of settlements and accused the countries
condemning Israel's settlement policy of trying to "isolate" the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Levy urged for the restoration of trust in the region and said
Israel remained committed to the peace process and would implement
all the agreements it entered.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said the only way to restore confidence is to see the
agreements implemented on the ground, adding that the whole
region was awaiting Israel's implementation of the agreements it
signed with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Broadly Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The composition of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Council (HKSAR), elected by the Selection Committee
here today, embodies the spirit of broad representation and
balanced participation.
</P>
<P>
The 60 PLC members are from different social strata and sectors
in Hong Kong community, including former and incumbent
legislators, former executive councilors, lawyers, accountants,
engineers, academicians, surveyors, doctors, architects, bankers,
businessmen, entrepreneurs, teachers, social workers and trade
unionists.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Arculli is among the 33 incumbent legislators who won
the race for the PLC membership today. Immediately after the
election, the solicitor said: "I haven't been able to study the
personal profile of the successful candidates, but from the ones
that I know, it seems to be fairly broadly representative." "You
have people from academic, social welfare, business, professional
and teaching background," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the election is open, fair and just. "Names of the
candidates and votes they gained were all recorded on boards, and
everybody can see," The event, televised live on the circuit, drew
more than 250 journalists from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his criteria in choosing the PLC members,
Selection Committee member Howard Young Hau-wah said that he first
took into consideration the candidate's ability in discussing
government and political affairs. The incumbent legislators who
joined the race were among his first choice, said Young, who
himself has sat on the Legislative Council for five years and
succeeded in securing a seat in the PLC today.
</P>
<P>
He also stuck to the principle of balanced participation in
picking up some former legislators, and a dozen people from
different parties and social groups.
</P>
<P>
Many of the elected are members of the Liberal Party, the
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, Hong Kong
Progressive Alliance, Liberal Democratic Federation, Association
for Democracy and People's Livelihood, New Hong Kong Alliance and
even Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Like Young, many Selection Committee members ticked 60 names on
the ballot, choosing the PLC members according to the candidates'
representativenesss, personal integrity, and ability and
experience in participating in government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of winners have been involved in the
establishment of the HKSAR from the very beginning. Some have
taken part in the drafting of the Basic Law, the constitution of
the future HKSAR, and some have served on the Preliminary
Committee, the Preparatory Committee or the Selection Committee.
Some PLC members are also Hong Kong deputies of the National
People's Congress (NPC) or members of the national or provincial
committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Tam Yiu Chung, vice-chairman of the HK Federation of Trade
Unions, won the most ballots in the secret balloting with 345
votes. He said: "I'm very happy and excited." He pledged to
fulfill his obligations in the provisional legislature, and do his
part for the smooth transition and long-term stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Provisional Legislature Good to HK's Prosperity, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people from
various social sectors said here today that the establishment of
the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) is called for by the
normal operation of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) and the continuous prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Woo Man-kai, managing director of the Hong Kong Auctioneers and
Estate Agency Ltd., watched the election of the 60 PLC members on
television, which was conducted in Shenzhen, southern China,
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Xinhua over telephone, he called the election "a
good thing." After the British side destroyed the "through
train," it became necessary for such a body to be produced to do
some legislative work in the early period of the HKSAR, he pointed
out. The body would be positive to Hong Kong's smooth transition
and the normal operation of the first HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Leung Chi, managing director of Goodfirst Industrial Ltd., said
the formation of the PLC is both reasonable and legal, and
embodies China's sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
There should not exist a "legal vacuum" after mid-1997, he
noted. The PLC is a key body which would guarantee the smooth and
normal operation of the HKSAR after July 1, 1997, when China
resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that many industrialists and businessmen from the Hong
Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters' Association, of which
Goodfirst Industrial is a member, had applied for PLC membership,
wishing to assist the Chief Executive in contributing to Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
"I'm greatly concerned with the process of electing the PLC,"
said She Wing-ling, who heads Shee Hing Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
Since the British side unilaterally carried out the electoral
reform package and led to the failure of the "through train"
arrangement for the Legislative Council, a provisional legal body
is imperative to handle the legislative work on the threshold of
the HKSAR, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest opinion poll conducted by a local youth
organization, over 40 percent of the respondents believed that the
PLC will play a role in Hong Kong's stability after the handover,
showing that an increasing number of local people have turned to
accept the PLC, said Law Wing-cheung, chairman of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
When local people see that the Central Government is
implementing sincerely a series of policies towards Hong Kong and
that the Preparatory Committee and Selection Committee members are
working hard in the interests of Hong Kong people, it is very
natural for them to stand with the PLC, Law added.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong University professor devoted to Asia study said
that the PLC is formed in accordance with China's law and it is
China's internal affair in which the British side has no right to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
The PLC, which is to function formally on July 1, 1997, has no
relations or conflict with the current Legislative Council, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There is enough legal basis for the formation of the PLC, the
professor stated. The fact that many current and former
Legislative Council members ran for PLC membership at least
demonstrates their backing for the PLC, which is undoubtedly good
to Hong Kong's smooth transition, he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Iron, Steel Industry to Win 220 Million Yuan Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's iron and steel
industry is expected to earn 220 million yuan in profits this year.
</P>
<P>
The profits allow for a six million yuan increase in the price
of coal, electricity and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Local steel output is expected to rise 7.5 percent this year
over 1995. Although the city's demand for rolled steel has not
grown by a large margin, nearly 98 percent of steel produced this
year has been sold.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the sector promoting a new market strategy
this year, to serve major local construction projects, as well as
establishing long-term cooperation relationships with local major
steel-consuming industries, such as automobiles, shipbuilding and
machinery items.
</P>
<P>
It has increased production of some to selling and
high-value-added products, with output of fine-quality steel
plates, stainless steel plates, and ship-building plates rising 49
percent, 54 percent and 47 percent over 1995, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the industry attachs more importance to cost
reduction and management, with the number of employees in the
industry cut by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to restructuring practices, the local iron and steel
industry has formed three product circulation systems, in a bid to
build a plates, strips and section steel base, heavy and thick
stainless steel plates and strip bases, as well as a big national
special steel production base.

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Freeze Loan Guarantee To Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
Authority official has called on the Clinton Administration to
freeze its loan guarantees to Israel, reported Israel Radio
today.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation, made the call after the PA weekly cabinet meeting in
Gaza Friday night. Sha'ath said that the move should be taken in
light of the Likud-led rightwing government's policy of
settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet voted on December 13 to reinstate
financial subsidies to all Jewish settlers by conferring "top
national priority" status on the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The decision is seen as an incentive accorded to Jews to move
to settle in the occupied territories and an attempt to preempt
the final status negotiations with the Palestinians supposed to be
concluded in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision has aroused stern Arab and international
condemnations. The PA called it a "declaration of war" against the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath said that the Palestinians will confront the Jewish
settlement drive from all directions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said at a White House press
conference that Israel's settlement policy is "preempting" a final
 status agreement.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he would agree to the characterization of
settlements as an obstacle to peace, Clinton responded
"absolutely."
</P>
<P>
The comments were Clinton's strongest on the settlement issue
since his November 5 reelection. Until now, the Clinton
Administration has used more restrained phrases such as
"troubling" or "complicating."
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, then U.S. President George Bush held up $10
billion loan guarantees to express the U.S. anger about the then
Likud government's policy of settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. resumed to award them to Israel only after the late
Labor Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin froze the settlement
building.

<HEADLINE> Garbage Disposal Plant in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A garbage disposal plant that
turns household waste into valuable fertilizer is proving that
even rubbish has a value in the world.
</P>
<P>
The plant in Guanghan in southwest China's Sichuan Province
has produced more than 400 tons of organic compound fertilizer by
disposing of 6,000 tons of garbage since it went into operation in
August.
</P>
<P>
Built at a cost of five million yuan, the plant now is capable
of handling 50,000 tons of garbage, and producing 30,000 tons of
compound fertilizer a year.
</P>
<P>
It will be able to earn more than two million yuan in economic
returns annually by selling fertilizer and other business.
</P>
<P>
A garbage-disposing technology, which was developed by a
research institute in Mianyang, has enabled the plant to dispose
of garbage within two hours, and then turn it into organic
fertilizer in the following nine to 12 days.
</P>
<P>
Research of the advanced and profit-making technology has been
listed as a leading national technological project during the
coming five years by the State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to dispose of all local garbage, easing
pollution caused by garbage in the city.

<HEADLINE> Service System for Transient Population Takes Shape in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, home to a transient population of more than 10 million,
has become a model in controlling transient populations in China.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is the first in the country to experiment with a
liberal labor market system. During the 1991-1995 period, it
provided employment services for nearly two million farmers from
both in and outside the province, with 930,000 of them finding
jobs.
</P>
<P>
A labor market information network for south China opened at
the end of last year, centered around Guangdong. So far the
Guangdong Center has collected more than 20,000 pieces of
information and has developed some 3,000 members.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province has strengthened the training of
rural laborers. By the end of last year, 134 job training centers
have been set up in the province, which can train over 200,000
people annually. A job training network covering the whole
province has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
Foshan City alone has set up 33 job training bases in 60
townships, which trained over 40,000 people last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than a dozen other provinces have set up
labor service organs in Guangdong. In Shenzhen alone there are
some 70 labor service organs set up by the labor incoming
places. These service organs provide the transient laborers with
advices concerning policies and laws, and safeguarding of their
legal rights in cooperation with local labor departments.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Qian Qichen, chairman
of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Council (HKSAR), said here today that he is fully
confident of Hong Kong's future with the election of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fourth plenary session of the Selection
Committee performed the election, Qian said that the election of
the PLC embodied the principle of democracy, fairness and
openness, and the elected PLC is widely representative.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PLC is the product of the British side's
unilateral act. A "through train" had been originally arranged for
the HK Legislative Council, but the British side went it alone
with so-called electoral reform in contravention of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and the agreements
and understandings reached between the Chinese and British
governments.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the PLC will enact the laws indispensable to the
HKSAR and will not replace the existing HK Legislative Council.
Moreover, the laws passed by the PLC will not go into effect till
July 1, 1997, and the PLC will not remain beyond July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the PLC will not in any way affect the
functioning of the existing HK Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he made these remarks in response to the statement
issued by the British foreign secretary Friday. He also warned the
British side to heed its doings and not to overact itself.
</P>
<P>
Qian's speech won rounds of warm applause from the members of
the Selection Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR
present.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A German charity named "Bread for
the World" in Stuttgart today urged people to aid the hungry in
the developing countries with money saved from luxuries.
</P>
<P>
Hans-Otto Hahn, head of the organization, said that people
while spending money on fireworks, alcoholic drinks, cigarettes and
other luxuries should not forget those in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, who badly need international aid for survival.
</P>
<P>
Now about 840 million people, or 20 percent of the population
in the developing nations, are threatened by hunger and nearly
40,000 children are dying of diseases caused by malnutrition each
day.
</P>
<P>
Hahn added that at the eve of New Year, part of the money for
luxuries should be saved and given to the poor.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in Germany, money spent on New Year
celebration fireworks alone amounts to 150 million marks (about
100 million U.S. dollars) each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Minister for Natural
Resources and Tourism Juma Alifa Ngasongwa (55) has resigned.
</P>
<P>
Ngasongwa's resignation comes a few days after his name was
mentioned in the Presidential Commission on Corruption report
which was released in Dar es Salaam last week.
</P>
<P>
The Press Secretary to the president, Patrick Chokala, told
the Official Daily News by telephone from Masasi, Mtwara region
last night that the minister tendered his resignation to
President Benjamin Mkapa on Wednesday. President Mkapa is now on
a tour of Mtwara region.

state organs to investigate the allegations that feature in the
commission's report, according to Chokala.

Ngasongwa for the decision, saying it has demonstrated how the
former minister is civilized and loyal to the ruling
Revolutionary Party (CCM).

Mkapa said that he has accepted Ngasongwa's resignation with
regrets and lauded him for his efforts to boost the country's
tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Asks Workers Not to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe has
implored workers with labor-related grievances to desist from
taking industrial action, but rather, find other ways of
presenting them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Christmas party he hosted for people from his
office on Friday, Mugabe said even if the grievances were just
and genuine, striking would erode their genuineness.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was referring to strike action by civil servants in the
latter part of this year, which paralyzed government services.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''this year had a demonstration of what I might call
a deviation from the correct way of behaving regarding
grievances.''
</P>
<P>
''We had the misfortune of an irregular strike from just
grievances... even if the cause is just, the way of fighting for
it might be irregular and there is no need for that at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Zimbabwe's 161,000 civil servants downed tools for
two weeks in August this year, to press for better salaries and
conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
Recently, nurses and junior doctors went on a work stoppage
for almost two months, again to press for increases in salaries,
various allowances and improvement in working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe acknowledged that the civil servants' salaries were
''very low'' and said it was understandable for them to grow
impatient since they had had long periods of hardships.
</P>
<P>
Health services which had been paralyzed by the nurses and
doctors strike, are slowly coming back to normal, after some of
the health workers fired by the government for taking part were
rehired.
</P>
<P>
mugabe said the industrial action was the only dent to an
otherwise ''successful'' year.
</P>
<P>
he said agriculture, industry and manufacturing all did well
in 1996, with the only exception being mining, although prospects
for next year were bright. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Crimes Up: Policeman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Reported crimes rose two
percent Between July 1 last year and June 30 this year despite
major police successes in fighting stocktheft, armed robberies
and murder, Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said.
</P>
<P>
He said on Friday that theft of motor vehicles, rape,
housebreaking and theft all showed significant increases and so
the police are looking for new strategies and beefing up
resources to fight these.
</P>
<P>
Targets set in the 1995/96 service plan, which intended to see
a decrease in most serious crimes by about 20 percent and also a
decrease of road traffic accidents and fatalities by 30 percent,
were not met in some fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chihuri has called for revision of strategies and operations
with a view to decreasing crime and creating an environment
conducive for economic growth, peace and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by Chihuri, 804 vehicles were
stolen during the period, representing a 50 percent increase,
while rape maintained its position as the most worrying crime.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''it is disappointing to report that rape against
juveniles went up again this year. As if that is not enough, more
juveniles than adults were reported raped. This year, 796
juveniles, 116 more than adults, were raped.''
</P>
<P>
On the roads, an almost 40 percent increase in fatalities was
recorded where 491 people were killed in crashes and 8,356 more
people were injured, a figure which is considered too high for
the country's small vehicle population, he said.
</P>
<P>
''I wish to urge the public to continue giving us support. May
I appeal to members of the public to make us aware of any
incidents where we fail to meet their expectations so that we
make the necessary correction,'' said Chihuri.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Sex Trade Operators to Face Tougher Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai sex trade operators will
face hasher punishment as a new law comes into effect today with
officials and law enforcers having been told to target at them.
</P>
<P>
The long-waited prostitution prevention and suppression act,
which take effect today, revises some articles of the country's
old anti-prostitution act introduced in 1960, with an aim to
punish clients, pimps and operators harder instead of prostitutes
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The article five of the new law states whoever gathers with a
prostitute for benefits will be subject to imprisonment up to one
month and/or a fine up to 1,000 baht (40 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The article seven states that whoever advertises for
prostitution will face imprisonment between six months and two
years and/or a fine between 10,000 and 40,000 baht (400 and 1,600
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some judicial officials said that the articles are not aimed at
punishing prostitutes themselves but at those who are approaching
them with assistance.
</P>
<P>
Prostitutes themselves have been punished by the society
enough, they added.
</P>
<P>
The new law also attaches more importance to the protection of
underage sex workers.
</P>
<P>
The article eight of the new law stipulates that those who have
sex with prostitutes under 18 will face one to three years in
prison and/or a fine of 20,000 to 60,000 baht (800 to 2,400
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Those who have sex with prostitutes under 15 will face two to
20 years in jail and/or a fine of 40,000 to 400,000 baht (1,600 to
16,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the law, parents or patrons who bring children under 18
into prostitution are liable to a prison term between four and 20
years and/or a fine between 80,000 and 100,000 baht (3,200 and
4,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 1996 act requires only those prostitutes under
18 to be sent to vocational training centers, while the 1960 act
required all ages to be sent there.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare officials say that the underages are easily
returned to the brothels and the training centers will help them
to learn some vocational skills before returning them to the
society.
</P>
<P>
Other officials said that the 1960 act gave too light
punishment for those involved and the tougher new act would will
contain demand in the sex trade market in order to help women,
especially underage girls.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governors, police chiefs, attorneys, judges and
public welfare officials have been told about the enactment of the
new act and they believe that the new law will help ease the sex
exploitation in the country.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed mixed this
week.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals closed higher this week on strong sentiment
of the futures market spurred by bullish data released by the Palm
Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) at the beginning
of the week.
</P>
<P>
December-South increased 20 ringgit (about 8 US dollars) to
1,255 ringgit (about 502 dollars) per ton from last week's close
of 1,235 ringgit (about 494 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
PORLA reported that palm oil production for November dropped
13.83 percent to 762,540 tons from 884,887 tons, and the palm oil
export dropped to 632,441 tons from 728,393 tons.

turnover due to lack of interest ahead of the Christmas and
year-end holidays.
</P>
<P>
There were interests from Europe, local and Japan this week,
but Japanese traders were in the market only on the first two
trading days.
</P>

The Malaysian rubber market this week also closed lower in
quiet trading on lack of interests.

half sen each to 316.50 sen (about 126.6 cents) per kg and 308.00
sen (about 123.2 cents) per kg respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was slow as players were already away
for the Christmas and year-end holidays.
</P>
<P>
During the week, mostly SMR 20 were traded for the January and
February shipments to South Korea, South Africa and China. And
inquiries for the SMR 20 also came from Hong Kong, Taiwan, New

<HEADLINE> India's CPP Leader's Election Postponed to January 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The election of a new leader
of India's Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) to succeed P.V.
Narasimha Rao, who was forced to resign on Thursday, has been
postponed from December 23 to January 3 to enable senior party
leaders to work out a consensus choice.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected decision to defer the CPP leader's election was
announced after an emergency meeting of the Congress Working
Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the party, here
on Friday evening. There were indications that the CWC wanted to
make a serious effort for a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Senior party leader Sharad Pawar said that filing of
nominations, scrutiny and withdrawals would all be done on January
3 and voting, if necessary, would also be held the same day.
</P>
<P>
Though present congress party chief Sitaram Kesri may want to
don the mantle of CPP leadership, the realization of this seems a
fairly difficult task given the presence of other senior party
leaders such as Sharad Pawar and Rajesh Pilot who also wanted to
be the CPP leader. Both the contenders have dropped enough hints
that they would like a formal contest allowing the MPs to elect a
leader democratically.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Ban Operation of Russian-made Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided not to allow the Russian-made MI-17 helicopters to carry
out passenger flights in the country from the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Citing safety reasons, the Department of Civil Aviation
recently has amended its air worthiness requirements to allow
commercial operations by the helicopters only with the
certification of American, British and European aviation
authorities from December 30.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments, the existing 12 MI-17 helicopters in
domestic service with four private airlines in the country, which
represents about 46 percent of Nepal's domestic air seat capacity,
will be prohibited to carry passengers.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian-made helicopters will be allowed to ferry
cargo for another one year.
</P>
<P>
Helicopter operators here said that most of such helicopters
are currently carrying passengers and cargo to remote areas,
especially some favorite tourist destinations, where land
transport means are not available.
</P>
<P>
The MI-17s have been carrying out commercial services since
1993, making significant contribution to the transportation of
passengers and goods to remote hilly areas, the operators said.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Helicopter Operators of Nepal (AHON) Friday
held a press conference to express its regrets at the government's
decision to forbid MI-17s' operation in the passenger sector.
</P>
<P>
The decision will have an adverse impact on the country's
tourism industry and obstruct disaster relief measures in remote
areas, the association argued.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange, following a sharp unexpected surge on Wall Street on
Friday, closed firmer this week with the benchmark composite index
reaching the 1,200 points level.
</P>
<P>
The buying spree, to take advantage of the country's favorable
economic data released recently, saw second board counters and
lower liners on the main board showing some fresh signs of renewed
interest after their recent slide.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also looking for an excuse to buy stocks and the
major development with the Dow Jones, whose industrial average
rose sharply by 126.87 points Friday, lured more buyers into the
market.
</P>
<P>
Volume was, however, thin for most part of the trading days
this week, and this is expected to continue until the year-end.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said some profit-taking took the composite index off
its highs, signaling an end to the short upturn.
</P>
<P>
The composite index ended 1.23 percent higher at 1,203.06 while
the broader Emas index was 0.56 percent better at 338.47 and the
industrial index inched up 0.66 percent to 2,299.25.
</P>
<P>
The second board, however, eased 0.87 percent to 540.31 points.
</P>
<P>
As for the immediate outlook, if the composite index can
sustain itself at the current level, the market should be able to
breach the 1,250 points level, the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The second board is also anticipated to inch up next week and
poise itself for a good run up to the new year.
</P>
<P>
This week saw the debut of four new stocks, one on the main
board, and three on the second board.
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board ready turnover rose to 811.932 million
shares worth 4.407 billion ringgit (about 1.7628 billion US
dollars) against last week's 586.598 million shares valued at
3.645 billion ringgit (about 1.458 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Second board turnover dipped to 180.193 million shares valued
at 2.112 billion ringgit (about 844.8 million dollars) versus
206.496 million shares worth 2.160 billion ringgit (about 864
million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals rose substantially this week to 416.589
million shares worth 2.139 billion ringgit (about 855.6 million
dollars) against last week's 122.544 million shares valued at
979.442 million ringgit (about 391.7768 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Expected to Recover Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A moderate recovery in
Thailand's exports is expected next year, with an estimated total
value of 1,578 billion baht (63 billion U.S. dollars) and a
10-percent growth over this year, according to the Thai Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry organized a seminar on Friday to present its
projections of exports, imports and the trade balance for next
year.
</P>
<P>
The export target figure is based on the assumption that this
year's returns will total 1,435 billion baht (57.4 billion
dollars), up by 2 percent on last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry indicated that the prime reason for the increase
is the world economy, which the International Monetary Fund
predicted would expand at a rate of 4.1 percent next year, as
against 3.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth in Thailand's major markets would also grow
at an acceptable rate of 2.3 percent in the United States, 2.7
percent in Japan and 2.5 percent in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
World trade is also expected to grow by 7.2 percent next year,
compared with 6.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN will continue to be the largest export market for
Thailand with projected imports worth 325 billion baht (13 billion
dollars), up by 11.68 percent from this year.
</P>
<P>
It will be followed by the United States with 280 billion baht
(11.2 billion dollars), Japan with 265 billion baht (10.6 billion
dollars) and the European Union with 260 billion baht (10.4
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai Commerce Ministry forecasts put Thailand's
total imports next year at 2,173 billion baht (86.9 billion
dollars) and the country's trade deficit at 595 billion baht (23.8
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Power Failure Cripples Life in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Life in all the five
northern states including the country's capital, New Delhi, came
to a standstill following the total collapse of the northern power
grid Friday, the local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Life was completely thrown out of gear and industrial activity
came to a stop as the capital experienced a prolonged spell of
power failure which started early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
More serious was the ordeal of patients in hospitals and
passengers traveling by trains as the doctor could not do
operations and the train services were seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
The problems were compounded as the power crisis caused a
resultant fall in water supply. Besides, there were frequent
traffic snarls in every corner of the capital as the entire system
of traffic signaling became non-functional.
</P>
<P>
For most part of Friday, the states of Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh went without electricity after
all power transmission lines and generation in most power stations
were completely disrupted. Himachal Pradesh and the India-held
Jammu and Kashmir were also partially affected by the disruption
in power supply.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the worst-ever collapse of the northern power
grid in recent years as all the stations together generating
14,000 mw of power went out of operation.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle traffic, rail movement, water supply, hospitals,
industrial production, trade and business were seriously affected
by this fourth major power breakdown one within a year.

<HEADLINE> Revolt at Dhaka Central Jail Crushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 jail wardens and an
unspecified number of prisoners were injured Friday as security
personnel foiled a revolt bid in the Dhaka Central Jail, jail
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Prisoner revolt, which has plagued three jails in Bangladesh in
a week, spread to the Dhaka Central Jail Friday morning. The
trouble erupted when a group of prisoners chased the jail police
who were distributing lunch among the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Some injured jail policemen said that during the clash,
prisoners chanted slogans against the jail authorities and
demanded better food.
</P>
<P>
The attempted revolt was quelled in an hour by the jail police,
who resorted to a massive baton charge on the troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, jail authorities in the northern district of Tangail
restored normalcy to a prison there Friday after a successful
discussion with the revolting prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Jessore Central Jail in the southwest was
also improving Friday as the revolting inmates sat down twice with
officials and were showing interest in a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
In the southern district of Barisal, the jail authorities have
seized jail control from the revolting prisoners, who also
demanded better food and living conditions.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, Canada To Take Helms-Burton to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and Canada today
asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) to study alleged United
States violations of international agreements resulting from its
enforcement of the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from both countries said the Helms-Burton law hurt
human rights and violated international agreements. They spoke
during the closing here of the 12th meeting of the Mexico-Canada
Ministerial Commission that began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a joint statement they would try to take
measures to solve the problems generated by that law. The law
posed a threat to countries involved in negotiations with Cuba
over assets which were claimed to have been confiscated by the
Cuban government from U.S. citizens during the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
The law penalizes foreign companies investing in and trading
with the Caribbean country. It was passed by the U.S. Congress on
March 6 in retaliation for Cuba's downing of two small U.S. planes
piloted by Cuban exiles on February 24.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move has outraged many countries, including its
European allies, which charged that the legislation violated
international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Canada, also said they would adopt measures to solve
controversies still unresolved in the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta).
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Canada are members of the three-member Nafta, the
other being the United States. Nafta, was signed on August
12,1992, and went into effect on January 1 in 1994. It aims at
clearing all trade obstacles among the three countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: HK Provisional Legislative Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of
the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) is necessary for Hong Kong's smooth
transition and for HKSAR's effective functioning.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has declared time and again that the setting
up of the council is a measure the Chinese side has to adopt after
the British side unilaterally carried out its "constitutional
package".
</P>
<P>
The "constitutional package", which contravened the
Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, the
principle of convergence with the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the
agreements and understandings reached between the Chinese and
British sides, has destroyed the "through train".
</P>
<P>
The "through train" mainly means that members of Hong Kong's
last Legislative Council may become, upon confirmation by the
HKSAR Preparatory Committee, members of the first Legislative
Council the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
From April to November 1993, the representatives of the Chinese
and British governments held 17 rounds of talks on the
arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong, which are to
produce the three-tier political structure: the Legislative
Council, urban and regional councils and district boards.
</P>
<P>
However, before the representatives could reach agreement for
the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong, the British side unilaterally
discontinued the talks at the 17th round and submitted to the Hong
Kong Legislative Council part of the questions under discussion
between the two sides, which directly led to the termination of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it was the British side's disruption that scuttled
the talks for the 1994-95 electoral arrangements, which, in turn,
destroyed the "through train" for Hong Kong's three-tier political
structure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) have made it clear that the Hong
Kong Legislative Council, district boards and urban and regional
councils elected under Chris Patten's political reform deal will
stop functioning in mid-1997 when China resumes the exercise of
its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The political structure of the HKSAR after July 1, 1997 will be
built in accordance with the relevant decisions of the NPC and the
provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Now that the "through train" has been destroyed due to the
British side's unilateral act, it is impossible for the first
Legislative Council of the HKSAR to be formed at the time when the
HKSAR is established.
</P>
<P>
In that case, a lot of legal work stipulated by the Basic Law
and the NPC decisions for the HKSAR Legislative Council to handle
will be either delayed or suspended, such as the law on the
application for HKSAR passports and visa issuing, the law on HKSAR
flag and emblem, as well as the appointment of the judges of the
Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the legal vacuum after July 1, 1997, a provisional
legislative council is imperative to enact necessary laws and
ordinances for the future HKSAR in the later stage of the
transition period.
</P>
<P>
At its second session in Beijing on March 24, 1996, the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR of the NPC made a decision on
setting up the HKSAR Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the PLC is elected by the Selection
Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR and it starts work
after the HKSAR Chief Executive is chosen.
</P>
<P>
The PLC consists of 60 members, with the majority being
permanent Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship. Permanent
Hong Kong residents without Chinese citizenship or with right of
abode in foreign countries account for no more than 20 percent of
the PLC members.
</P>
<P>
At the seventh session of the Preparatory Committee held in
Shenzhen on December 12, 130 candidates for the PLC were confirmed
out of the 134 applicants.
</P>
<P>
The election of the PLC members is now in process in Shenzhen
at the fourth plenary session of the Selection Committee for the
First Government of the HKSAR.

<P>
The council will continue working until the first Legislative
Council of the HKSAR is founded, and the deadline is set on June
30, 1998, the decision said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is setting an
outstanding example for the highest number of healthy moms and
babies in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital has set up a range of improved health care
facilities for both women and children, with low mortality rates
in childbirth for both mothers and infants.
</P>
<P>
Almost half a century ago, when new China was founded,
childbirth was risky. Around a quarter of all babies born in Old
China failed to survive childbirth or their early months of life.
</P>
<P>
The death rate among newly borns and young babies has seen a
staggering fall nationally over almost five decades. So has
mortality rates among pregnant and nursing mothers dropped
considerably over the same period.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing the survival rates of both new mothers and babies is
even higher.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of pregnant and nursing mothers is 22 per
100,000 in Beijing, and the mortality rates of new-born babies is
7.52 per 1,000, or about one-third and one-fifth of the country's
average.
</P>
<P>
Now at least 96 percent of women and 82 percent of children in
Beijing are under systematic health care.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has three municipal women and children health care
organizations and 19 organizations at district and county level,
according to the Department of Women and Children's Health of the
Public Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The small health clinics in neighborhood communities, which
mainly serve women, children and elderly, have risen to 264,
township hospitals to 278, and specialist medical workers have
increased to 1,344.
</P>
<P>
The local health bureau has taken special care of orphans and
disabled children. Beijing has earmarked 26 top-level hospitals to
perform operations and treatment on orphans and disabled
children suffering serious congenital diseases.
</P>
<P>
Highly-skilled surgeons at the hospitals have so far operated
on approximately 100 such children and helped them shake off
deformities.

BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's coffee bean export
in the coming harvest from December 1996 to November 1997 is
expected to drop to 31,000 tons from 60,000 tons in the previous
year, according to the Bangkok Post today.

62,000 tons from 81,398 tons forecast earlier because to rains, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Higher local demand, which was around 30,000 tons, also reduced
supplies of beans available for export, Chalermphol said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand produced 78,801 tons of coffee beans in 1995-96 and
exported 60,000 tons on the same year.

Overseas investors will continue to enjoy the treatment of
tax-reduction and exemption.
</P>
<P>
Investors in agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry will be
allowed to enjoy a further reduction of between 15 and 30 percent
in income tax, after tax reduction on the first 10 years of
operation.
</P>
<P>
They will also be given priority in the selection of laborers
and use of raw materials, water, electricity and fuel.

<P>
LHASA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Work has started on a water
conservancy project, the Mamla Water Control Works, in Southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The water project, the largest among the 62 projects the
central government launched to help the development of Tibet, is a
large-scale comprehensive scheme that includes flood prevention
and tourism, in addition to its main function of irrigation and
electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
The the project, located on the upper reaches of the Nyang Qu
River in southern Tibet, requires a total cost of 960 million
yuan, and is scheduled to be completed in five years.
</P>
<P>
The designed capacity of the reservoir is 157 million cubic
meters. The general generating capacity of the power station will
reach 20,000 kw. An extra 16,000 hectares of land is expected to
be irrigated after its completion.
</P>
<P>
The Nyang Qu River valley, the biggest 'barn' of Tibet, has not
developed as expected in agricultural production and animal
husbandry because of the lack of water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the irrigation works is conducive to the
growth of local economy, and an increase in the living standard of
the residents.
</P>
<P>
It is also of great significance for Tibetans to provide enough
food for themselves.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A specialized United
States group has arrived here to take part in a proposed rescue
operation of hostages held in the residence of the Japanese
ambassador in Lima, a local radio claimed today.
</P>
<P>
The "Delta Force" was brought Thursday from North Carolina to
the U.S. Army Southern Command Headquarters in Panama for
Operations in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
This was the first mention of a mobilization of
U.S. specialized forces for "difficult missions" in relation to
the Lima situation.
</P>
<P>
The situation was delicate and any comment could be premature,
said a U.S. military officer who asked to remain anonymous,
reported the RPC Radio.
</P>
<P>
A commando of the Revolutionary Movement Tupac Amaru (MRTA)
stormed and occupied the residence of the Japanese Ambassador to
Peru, Morihisi Aoki. They took more than 400 people hostage,
including diplomats and ministers.
</P>
<P>
United States Army Southern Command head Wesley K. Clark called
the hostage crisis "a deplorable" illegal action.

Clark refused to comment on the critical situation in the
Peruvian capital but expressed his desire that the hostages be
released soon.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Justice and Interior Minister Raul Montenegro said
he had received no information about a Panamanian involved in the
guerrilla commando.
</P>
<P>
An investigation carried out last year in Panama and Peru
revealed that the MRTA was using Panamanian territory to buy
weapons. The organization used several bank accounts, according to

</P>
<P>
Ramos made this appeal on Friday after he met with Senate
President Ernesto Maceda and House Speaker Jose de Venecia. During
the meeting, he expressed to them his concerns that the deadlock
would smirch foreign investors' perception of the Philippines.

meet on December 23 and 24 to work out a compromise to break the
standoff between the Senate and the House of Representatives over
the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
Congressmen continued to fume over 9 billion peso (343.5
million U.S. dollars) in insertions made by the Senate in the
proposed budget as senator leaders said the special session will
be "fruitless" unless the representatives agree to cut the
Countrywide Development Fund by 40 percent as proposed by the
senators.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- South China's prosperous
Guangdong Province collected 2.7 billion yuan (about 325 million
US dollars) in personal income tax between January and
Mid-December, the highest among all areas of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese province's revenue of individual income tax, which
was first levied in 1980, remained very small until 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Since then personal income tax revenue has grown by a big
margin for three years in a row," a provincial taxation official
said, adding that local citizen's increased awareness of tax and
enhanced collection are two major reasons for the rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the rapid development of the provincial economy, the
number of personal income tax payers in Guangdong increased by
four million in 1994 and six million last year. It has risen by
seven million so far this year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the tax revenue for the past two years reached 1.5
billion yuan and 2.2 billion yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The individual income tax has become one of the largest three
local tax items, and an important source of our fiscal income,"
the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Voting for members of
the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) started at 10:15 here today.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred and ninety-nine Members of the Selection
Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR took part in the
balloting in Shenzhen which is adjacent to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Method for the Formation of the PLC, 60
members of the PLC are to be elected through secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
Each member of the Selection Committee can vote for 60 PLC
members. The ballot would be invalid if the number of the
selected exceeds 60 or if the number of non-Chinese nationals and
Hong Kong citizens with right of abode in foreign countries
exceeds 12.
</P>
<P>
The 60 PLC members will be produced according to the number of
votes. If the number of the elected legislators of non-Chinese
nationals and Hong Kong citizens with right of abode in foreign
countries exceeds 12 among the first 60 people elected, the first
12 will be valid. The vacancy will be filled by Chinese nationals
without right of abode in foreign countries according to the
number of votes.
</P>
<P>
If there are two or more candidates having the same number of
votes at the bottom of the list of the PLC members elected, which
leads to a difficulty in deciding who will be the 60th member, the
Selection Committee will have to vote again on these two or more
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The entire election process is expected to last three to four
hours.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Orders Halt to Charter Change Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
has ordered a halt to efforts to amend the country's Constitution
and extend the terms of President Fidel Ramos and other elected
officials, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a temporary restraining order, the court barred the
Commission on Elections (Comelec) from hearing further petitions
to "lift the term limits of elected officials (through) people's
initiatives."
</P>
<P>
The tribunal also ordered three founding members of the
People's Initiative for Reforms, Modernization and Action (PIRMA)
-- former ambassador Alberto Pedrosa, his wife Carmen and lawyer
Jesus Delfin -- to desist from conducting a signature drive to
amend the charter.
</P>
<P>
The court made the ruling Thursday in response to a petition
filed on Wednesday by opponents of charter changes, which
criticized PIRMA's signature campaign as unconstitutional and
questioned the ongoing Comelec hearings on charter changes.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, which the high court deemed should run
indefinitely, gave the PIRMA and the Comelec 10 days to answer the
petition.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA, which was launched earlier this month, has been
seeking to amend the constitution which provides for a single
six-year term for the president. PIRMA leaders said economic
reforms initiated by Ramos were in danger of withering away if he
cannot run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos has said repeatedly that he will step down when his
six-year term of office ends in 1998.

province has signed up more than one million telephone users, and

<HEADLINE> Long-term Steady Growth for China's Economy: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Beginning in 1997, China's
economy will usher in a stage of long-term steady growth, the
Beijing-based "Outlook" weekly reported in the upcoming issue,
which hits newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
The theory was based on an analysis of economic development in
the first three quarters of this year, and a forecast for the
general trend of the economic situation in 1997, the weekly quoted
Zhang Liqun, an official from the Macro-Economic Development
Research Institute under the State Planning Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic operation in the first three quarters of
this year was characterized by:
</P>
<P>
-- Relatively big potential in the growth of the total social
supply. The grain output will climb to a record of 480 billion kg,
10 billion kg more than last year's amount, the foreign exchange
reserve has surpassed 100 billion US dollars, and industrial
production indicated great potential for further growth;
</P>
<P>
-- Steady balanced growth of total social demand. Investment,
consumption and export reported both increases and decreases,
though individual sectors recorded a decline;
</P>
<P>
-- The shift in the country's monetary and fiscal policy, which
moved from stringent control to moderate growth and;
</P>
<P>
-- The halt to the sustained drop in the economic efficiency of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China recorded a low inflation rate and an increase
in the number of non-state-run sectors this year, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Looking toward the future, Zhang added, economic growth in 1997
hinges on the monetary policy, regulation on financial affairs and
new government policy on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He predicted a higher economic growth rate and a lower price
index for 1997.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the country should regulate the growth of
supply and demand in a bid to help maintain their steady
growth. Moreover, efforts will also be made to readjust the
structure and improve the supply system, he said.

</P>
<P>
The session is to elect the Provisional Legislative Council

</P>
<P>
Application for the 60-member Provisional Legislative Council
started on November 18. A total of 134 people had completed their

</P>
<P>
According to a senior official of the Preparatory Committee,
Hong Kong was originally considered as the venue of the ongoing

meeting of the Preparatory Committee decided to move it to
Shenzhen considering that the British Hong Kong authorities have
made it clear that they would not support or assist the
establishment and operation of the PLC.

Similar to the previous three plenary sessions of the Selection
Committee held in Hong Kong, today's session proceeds with the

<P>
SHENZHEN, China, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of
the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) will benefit Hong Kong's smooth
transition and long-term prosperity, a senior Chinese official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Plenary Session of the Selection
Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR, Qian, chairman of
the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR, said that the PLC will be
a guarantee for the normal function of the future HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He said that although its tenure of office is not long, the PLC
will be playing an important role in a special historical period.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR
elected by the Selection Committee and appointed by the State
Council, the Selection Committee has fulfilled its first-phase
task.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the committee will start another important task,
that is, the election of the 60 members of the PLC today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the election should be conducted in Hong Kong.
But, due to the British side's refusal to cooperate, the Chinese
side was forced to decide to hold the election in Shenzhen city
bordering on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the Seventh Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee, the chairman and vice-chairmen meeting made
public the list of 130 candidates for the PLC.

<P>
He stressed that the formation of the PLC should embody
balanced participation by various strata and sectors.
</P>
<P>
Qian said, "Our goal is to elect a PLC to represent Hong Kong's
overall interests and to reflect Hong Kong citizens' opinions."
</P>
<P>
He urged members of the Selection Committee to take into
account candidates' virtue, ability to discuss policy matters and
experience in legislation in electing the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the Selection Committee members are expected to
cast their sacred votes in the election in accordance with the
committee's commitment to Hong Kong, to the state and to the

<HEADLINE> Chinese IT Companies Intensify Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- International companies are
facing fiercer competition on China's information technology (IT)
as Chinese IT companies come into their own, said the Ministry of
Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicts that of the projected two million PC
sales volume this year, Chinese PC firms will hold 30 percent, as
against the 30 percent by foreign firms and 40 percent by domestic
assembling plants with imported parts and components.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, Chinese computer companies
had just 20 percent of the domestic market in the early 1990s and
less than 10 percent in 1980s. Now, they have nearly one-third.
</P>
<P>
Fully aware of the fact that technology is the cornerstone of
the domestic IT industry, Chinese firms are also quickly learning
the importance of good marketing and public relations.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to win the trust of Chinese consumers,
the state-run Legend Group announced Friday it will donate 600
desktop personal computers to Project Hope, a charity organization
that helps poor children that drop out of school regain
education.
</P>
<P>
Legend's PC sales will exceed 200,000 units in its fiscal year
ending in March 1997. During the March-December this year, the
company has already sold 179,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms are also working hard to cope with the fierce
competition from their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chong, deputy director-general of the ministry's computer
and IT department, said that the Chinese-version of Windows 95 was
jointly developed with 70 Chinese companies such as the Stone
Group and Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Also, IBM also plans to invest two billion US dollars to set up
IT projected in China over the next five years in an effort to
strengthen its position in the market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Offer New Ideas on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said on Friday that Middle East envoy Dennis Ross will leave
Washington on Friday night with some new ideas aimed at pushing
forward Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis is the primary intermediary between the two -- the
Palestinians and the Israelis. He certainly has some ideas of his
own -- American ideas that he will be offering on this trip,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Ross's brief trip will aim mainly to revive the stalled talks
on an Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron
and was unlikely to produce an immediate agreement, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Ross will spend only a few days in the region, returning to
Washington next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that perhaps the best we can hope for here is that
he's able to convince Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu
that they've got to re-engage seriously on Hebron."
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron has been agreed
upon by the former Israeli Labour government and the Palestinians,
and, according to an interim accord, the Israeli troops should
have been pulled out last March.
</P>
<P>
But Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud government, succeeding the
Labour after the May election, has changed its predecessors'
policy, stressing that security of Jewish settlers in the city
comes first before considering the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
After more than ten weeks talks, the two sides -- the Israelis
and Palestinians -- remained deadlocked over security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"It may take some more time for any final agreement to be
reached," Burns admitted.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $219 Mln in Financing for Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a combination of two credits for
Azerbaijan totaling the equivalent of some 219 million U.S.
dollars to back the government's economic program for 1996-99.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, about 135 million dollars are available under
the enhanced adjustment facility (ESAF) and about 84 million
dollars under the extended fund facility (EFF).
</P>
<P>
Major macroeconomic targets over the medium term are to achieve
an annual growth rate of 5 percent in 1997, rising to 7 to 8
percent in subsequent years and a reduction in the annual rate of
inflation to 6 percent by 1999. The external current account
deficit is expected to widen to 24 percent of GDP in 1999 from 19
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Within the medium-term framework, the 1996-97 program aims at
an annual GDP growth of 5.1 percent, decreasing the annual rate of
inflation to 9.1 percent and narrowing the external current
account deficit to 15.9 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for backing its member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. The EFF is an IMF financing facility that assists
medium-term programs that seek to overcome balance of payments
difficulties stemming from macroeconomic imbalances and structural
problems.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan joined the IMF in September 1992. Its quota is about
168 million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF
credit currently stands at about 168 million dollars.

WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
on Friday rejected Iraq's claims that it had broken a spy network
working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
</P>
<P>
Report on U.S spy network was a "laughable propaganda ploy"
aimed at finding a scapegoat for Iraq's problems, State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi state television also showed on Friday four Iraqis who
confessed to spying for the CIA. And Saad Daham Awad, one of the
men shown on the television, said he had been recruited by the CIA
to carry out espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
But Burns said: "Saddam Hussein has made a history... of lying
to their own population, as well as to the rest of us around the
world.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody believes these reports, they ought to have their
heads examined," he added.
</P>
<P>
Awad said he worked for a Kurd named Houker Ahmed Ali and his
brother Haiman based in northern Iraq, who asked Awad to collect
information on the Iraqi army and later on asked him also to
recruit his brother Salah.
</P>
<P>
When the Iraqi troops entered northern Iraq in September at the
invitation of a Kurdish faction to take control of the area, many
Kurds working for the CIA were evacuated by the United States from
the war-torn place.

<HEADLINE> Serbian President Receives OSCE Delegation Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks here Friday evening with Felipe Gonzalez, the
former Spanish Prime Minister who heads the delegation of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Both sides expect that the delegation will have the opportunity
to find out all relevant facts, it was underlined during the
meeting held in an open atmosphere of understanding, Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Milosevic, Gonzalez arrived here late
Friday heading the OSCE delegation on a two-day fact-finding
mission regarding recent local elections in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told Gonzalez he hoped the high-level OSCE delegation
will be able through an unbiased report to contribute to removing
the deformed picture created in a part of the world public
regarding the recent local elections in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
He also believed this would contribute to removing the
reservations in the attitude of some countries and international
circles towards Yugoslavia stemming from this deformed picture,
according to Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the OSCE delegation and its interest and
commitment should also constitute a step forward towards
normalizing the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in
the OSCE, and its relations with that organization of which
Yugoslavia is a founder, Milosevic added.
</P>
<P>
While greeting Gonzalez at Belgrade airport, Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Milan Milutinovic told reporters he expected the
delegation would look into the situation concerning the local
elections.
</P>
<P>
"It is a known fact that discontent over election results and
protests by part of the opposition have created a distorted
picture in the international public over facts pertaining to the
elections for local rule in Serbia," said Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he went on, "the federal government has decided to
invite an eminent OSCE delegation to visit our country and find
out, directly and truthfully, about the facts concerned, so that
all reservations regarding the procedure and results of the
elections might be removed in the international public and in view
of our relations with the international community."
</P>
<P>
He said the "upcoming meetings of the delegation with
representatives of relevant institutions in charge of the
elections will help create a realistic and objective picture about
our electoral system, electoral procedure and the election
results."
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez told reporters at the airport that the aim of the
visit was not to mediate but learn about the facts concerning the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said no conclusions should be expected at the end of the
mission, and added that the delegation would report to the OSCE
chairman of its findings in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE delegation, which consists of several high-ranking
diplomats and experts, will meet with representatives of all
political institutions, judicial organs, media and other
organizations which could help them determine the circumstances in
Serbia. It will return to Vienna, the OSCE headquarters, on
Saturday night or Sunday.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Expands Commercial Banks' Underwriting Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Board (Fed) today unanimously increased the ceiling on what banks
can earn from securities underwriting, the latest move to allow
them into Wall Street-type businesses.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed agreed to increase the limit for banks' earnings
from securities underwriting to 25 percent from the current 10
percent. The expansion comes after Congress declined again this
year to pass a bank modernization bill.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will become effective in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Fed staff said the expansion wouldn't threaten the safety or
soundness of the banking system and that it would result in
greater competition, convenience and efficiency for bank
customers.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the next move would be up to Congress to review this
whole area," said Alice Rivlin, the Fed's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. law, the Glass Steagall Act, was passed in the
Depression to separate banks and securities firms following major
bank failures. Glass Steagall Act forbids banks from owning or
affiliating with a company that's "engaged principally" in
underwriting or securities dealing.
</P>
<P>
But the law was actually violated in 1987 when J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. found a way around the act.
</P>
<P>
J.P. Morgan's lawyers successfully argued they could set up a
securities arm that deals in securities only to a limited extent,
generating only 5 percent of the company's revenues, thereby not
violating the "engaged principally" test.
</P>
<P>
What was called as "fateful loophole" by some economists was
later broadened so banks could underwrite stocks and bring in 10
percent of their revenues from securities deals.
</P>
<P>
Most economists now believe that commercial banks can safely
underwrite stocks and bonds without posing big risks to the
federal deposit insurance fund. In fact, stock underwriting is
safer than some of the risky derivatives that banks sometimes buy
and sell, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's rule is expected to trigger a new type of merger
activity in the U.S., with regional banks acquiring smaller,
regional brokerage firms, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
While banks were ready to praise the move, the U.S. Securities
Industry Association argued the Fed's expected action would create
an unfair playing fields for Wall Street firms.

<HEADLINE> New York City Sees Crime Rate Falling Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- New York City's crime rate
has fallen sharply for the third straight year, dropping 16
percent below last year's figure, preliminary police Department
records show.
</P>
<P>
By December 15, 937 crime cases had been reported, 16 percent
drop compared with last year. The decline in major
felonies--murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, auto
theft-indicates that the City could end the year with the sharpest
drop in such crimes since 1968.
</P>
<P>
The substantial decrease in major crimes is attributable to a
series of crack-down campaigns launched by police and using of
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
"It's really remarkable. I don't think there's is ever, in
history, been a city with three consecutive years of double digit
drops in crime statistics. All the strategies that have been put
in place are working better," Ruldoph Giuliani, Mayor of the City
was quoted today by the New York Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
In recent polls and interviews, residents around the city have
said that they feel safer.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Underlines Need for Revolutionary Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani caretaker Prime
Minister Malik Miraj Khalid today underscored the need for
revolutionary changes to solve the country's socio-economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Lahore High Court Bar Association in Lahore,
capital of Punjab Province, Khalid said the country is passing
through a difficult phase which requires positive contribution
from everyone to rectify the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the caretaker government, which has the mandate for
only 90 days, has taken a number of far-reaching measures to
reform the society.
</P>
<P>
Some of the steps concern the restoration of political
stability, elimination of economic disparity and the strengthening
of the democratic institutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the results of the reform will be
visible before the completion of the mandate.
</P>
<P>
"True democracy can only be possible if a fair system of
justice prevails in a country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On elimination of the VIP culture, Khalid said his government
has taken some measures in this regard by abolishing VIP lounges
and bringing in austere living as an example for others to follow.
</P>
<P>
However, the VIP culture cannot be wiped out unless austere and
simple living is adopted by the rulers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing accountability, Khalid said this is the earnest
desire of the people who are simply tired of corrupt and dishonest
politicians and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
"The Anti-Corruption Commission has been constituted and cases
are being put up before it," he said.
</P>
<P>
If there is no accountability, the situation which existed
before November 5 when the government led by Benazir Bhutto was
dissolved would continue, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also reiterated his government's desire to
hold free and transparent general elections on February 3,
declaring that there is no ambiguity about it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed his fears that old faces might return
in the upcoming elections and called upon people to vote for a new
leadership which is sincere and honest.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Calls for Stronger Social Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Sun Baiqiu, executive
chairwoman of the Chinese Red Cross Foundation today urged people
from all walks of life both at home and overseas to come to the
aid of China's poor population.
</P>
<P>
The foundation held its formal inauguration ceremony yesterday
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross movement, which has as its basic principles
"humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary
service, unity and universality," was formed in China more than 90
years ago, said Sun, who is also a vice-chairwoman of the Chinese
Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the major task for the foundation is to mobilize
Chinese both at home and overseas, international friendly
organizations and people from all sectors of society to contribute
to social assistance.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will observe the basic principles of the Red
Cross movement in its publicity activities and daily operations,
and will provide the Chinese Red Cross Society with solid
financial support, she added.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was approved by the People's Bank of China,
China's central bank, in December of 1993, and registered as a
social organization at the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the foundation has received many
donations and carried out numerous relief activities, including
the health care project for poor mothers and infants in south
China's Fujian Province, and the construction of hospitals and
primary schools in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
It has invited Song Ping, a former senior leader of the Chinese
Communist Party, to be its honorary chairman.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the Selection Committee for the First Government
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, who took the lead
in donating to the foundation, were also invited to be honorary
chairmen.

Klinsmann said he respected Bayern coach Giovanni Trapattoni

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Provisional Legislature Ensures Smooth Transition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency issued a
commentary today in Beijing calling the election of the
Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) an important guarantee for the smooth
transition of Hong Kong and the effective operation of the future
SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council, composed of 60 members,
was elected today through secret ballot at the fourth plenary
session of the Selection Committee. The meeting was held in
Shenzhen, a coastal city neighboring Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that according to the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, the People's Republic of China will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The political structure of the future Hong Kong SAR will be set
up in accordance with the Basic Law and the related decisions of
the National People's Congress, while reflecting the principles of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree of
autonomy, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
It said the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR
should be established following China's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure a smooth transition, and according to the
suggestion of the British side, the Chinese side agreed that if
the composition of the existing Legislative Council of the British
Hong Kong government is in conformity with the relevant provisions
of the NPC decision and the Basic Law, those of its members who
meet certain requirements may, upon confirmation by the
Preparatory Committee, become members of the first Legislative
Council of the Hong Kong SAR, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990, Chinese and British foreign ministers also
reached agreements and understanding through the exchange of seven
diplomatic letters on this issue, which was also approved in a
decision adopted by the National People's Congress, it reviewed.
</P>
<P>
This is what is usually called a "through-train" arrangement,
the commentary explained.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Provisional Legislature Ensures Smooth Transition (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Chris Patten took office as governor of Hong Kong in 1992,
he unilaterally put forward a so-called "political reform package"
which violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principles
in line with the Basic Law, and the agreements and understanding
reached between China and Britain, the commentary claimed.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese side had adopted a cooperative attitude in
the 17 rounds of negotiations and made great efforts to reach an
agreement, the British side showed no sincerity in the talks and
ended the negotiations, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
As the "through-train" arrangement cannot be realized, it is
necessary to establish a provisional legislature, in order to
ensure a complete system of executive authorities, legislature and
judiciary for the future SAR, and to avoid the "legal vacuum" when
the SAR is established, it emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council has sufficient legal basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the "one country, two systems" principle and the
Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR will exercise a high degree of
autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial
power, including the right of final appeal, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also said the "Decision of the National People's Congress on
the Method for the Formation of the First Government and the First
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region" stipulated the Preparatory Committee shall be responsible
for preparing the establishment of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
That is to say, the Preparatory Committee has the right to
decide, supervise and carry out matters related to the smooth
transition, including the establishment of the SAR executive,
legislative and judicial organs, the commentary explained.
</P>
<P>
However, a small number of people have continued to adopt a
negative attitude toward the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council, and have maliciously attacked this move, the
commentary said, pointing out that their opposition is entirely
groundless.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the first Legislative Council cannot be set up before July
1, 1997 under the British rule, the Preparatory Committee made the
decision to establish the Provisional Legislative Council through
repeated discussions, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The decision won the recognition of the majority of Hong Kong
people, it added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that when the specific method for forming
the Provisional Legislative Council was approved at the
Preparatory Committee's fifth plenary session, people held that
the method is objective, just and open.
</P>
<P>
According to the method, anyone who meets the requirements can
run for the election. This ensures the high quality of the
Provisional Legislative Council members, who will then be able to
serve the Hong Kong people better, the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
People in various sectors of Hong Kong took an active part in
the application process for the membership of the Provisional
Legislative Council, it said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the process, a total of 134 people had completed
application procedures, and 130 became candidates after their
qualifications were checked, it said.
</P>
<P>
Among this group were members of the major political parties
and social organizations, well-known social figures, and the
existing Legislative Council members, the commentary said, adding
that the enthusiastic participation of the people in various
sectors provided the basis for the establishment of a balanced and
representative Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
It said the 60 Provisional Legislative Council members, who
were elected by the broadly representative Selection Committee
members, not only reflect the desire of the people in the various
sectors of Hong Kong, but also show the Hong Kong people's
determination to maintain a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the majority of Hong Kong people, the
Provisional Legislative Council will surely fulfill its duties and
contribute to the smooth transition and long-term prosperity and
stability of Hong Kong, the commentary noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China will conduct a host of
reform initiatives in 1997, and the job will be exceptionally
difficult, according to a national working meeting on economic
restructuring which concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
All the country's departments in charge of economic
restructuring are urged to further heighten their sense of
responsibility and urgency, work hard and strive for the
establishment of a socialist market economic system as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and minister in charge of the
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy (SCRE), attended
the closing ceremony of the meeting, which opened on December 18,
and marked the 18th anniversary of the historical Third Plenary
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The delegates attending the meeting reached a consensus that
China must adjust the economic structure and explore new areas of
development in order to maintain rapid, sustained, and sound
development for the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Haoruo, SCRE vice-minister, pointed out that China will
make breakthroughs in next year's reform by giving priority to the
establishment of large companies and enterprise groups, listed
companies and designated key enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the small state-owned companies
could be invigorated after next year's strenuous efforts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that an increasing number of enterprises will
be either merged or forced into bankruptcy next year, but the
central government does not encourage too many enterprises to go
out of business.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the social security system, he said that China will
pay closer attention to the standardization of the retirement
insurance system for urban workers and staff, and that more
retired and unemployed people will be cared for and reemployed by
the social security departments rather than by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China will also dramatically step up housing and medical care
reforms and introduce a market-oriented system to provide the
residential houses which are traditionally distributed to people
on a welfare basis.

ISLAMABAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief Justice of Pakistan
Sajjad Ali Shah today denied charges that the judiciary is
interfering in the affairs of the government.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters in Lahore, the second largest city of
Pakistan, Shah said the judiciary would never become a tool of any
setup.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice made the remarks in response to the
allegation made by former caretaker Law Minister Fakhruddin
Ibrahim, who resigned last Wednesday, that he had interfered in
the appointment of the law secretary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the judgment pertaining to deposed Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's petition for the restoration of her
government would be announced before the general elections
scheduled for February 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said a verdict in this regard would be given strictly

against the judiciary, would have nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
Answering another question about any differences between
President Farooq Leghari and the judiciary, Shah said, "The
judiciary has neither any differences with the president nor any
close cohesion with him."
</P>
<P>
"We never asked the president to hold the process of
accountability; we are impartial people and what the president did
was on the demand of the masses for booking the corrupt," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Administrative Interference in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Election
Commissioner Justice Fakhr-e Alam today ruled out the possibility
of administrative interference in the country's general elections
scheduled for February 3 next year.
</P>
<P>
Alam told reporters here that there is no truth in the
allegations that there could be interference in the Election
Commission's affairs from the presidential house or the prime
minister's house.
</P>
<P>
Both President Farooq Leghari and caretaker Prime Minister
Malik Miraj Khalid are keen to have free and impartial elections,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Interference from the government's side might be the practice
in the past," he said, noting that it would now be impossible to
interfere in the upcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully independent, with full authority as far as the
administrative nature of the elections' arrangements is
concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the Election Commission lacks
financial autonomy and this may cause delay in the elections'
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Alam said his commission has to approach the Finance Ministry
for almost each and every matter, like producing ballot boxes and
printing ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the commission should be fully empowered to
meet the financial needs, without any lapse of time.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission, authorized to reject the nomination
papers of those candidates found to be defaulters, will scrutinize
the candidates between December 26 and 28 for defaulters of loans
and utility bills.
</P>
<P>
Alam said officials of the commission have already received
some lists of defaulters.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Zambia for
November recorded a fall of 2.4 percentage points to 33.5 percent
from October's 35.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest new consumer price index published by the Central
Statistics Office (CSO) says that the November inflation level,
though being a very marginal improvement over the October rates,
was the lowest recorded this year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics revealed that the highest inflation levels
attained were in the months of May and June which recorded the
year on year inflation levels of 50.7 percent and 50 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fall of inflation rates indicates an improvement of the
country's economy. The CSO earlier predicted a 6 percent real gdp
growth in 1996 compared to gdp declines of 5.1 percent and 3.9
percent in 1994 and 1995 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Wall to Be Renovated with Original Bricks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Beijingers
carrying bricks gathered today at the remains of the ancient city
wall in the southeastern part of the Chinese capital, eager to
donate original bricks from the aged structure for a renovation
project.
</P>
<P>
The city of Beijing was built more than 500 years ago, with
straight roads, beautiful architecture, and the wall around the
city. At the time, it had the reputation as one of the greatest
works of human civilization at that time.
</P>
<P>
However, the wall has deteriorated over the past centuries, and
only a small section remains.
</P>
<P>
Nothing had been done to save the old wall, until the Beijing
Cultural Relics Bureau called on Beijing residents to donate
bricks from the former wall that they have kept in their homes,
believing that the bricks bring good luck.
</P>
<P>
At least 20,000 bricks have been donated so far.
</P>
<P>
Among the volunteers today was He Luli, vice-chairwoman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference and deputy mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Two students from the US, who are now studying in Beijing
University, also came to the spot today and offered to help with
the work.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian PM Announces His Resignation at Party Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan
Videnov announced today that he had presented the resignation of
his Cabinet at the opening of a special congress of the Bulgarian
Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Videnov told the congress that the resignation would be
submitted to the parliament today to be voted on before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 42nd congress of the Socialist Party, Videnov,
who became prime minister after his party won the parliamentary
elections in December 1994, declared his firm intention not to run
for a leading post in the party, the government or parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that he felt he lacked the necessary support from party
colleagues and from society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
But he proposed that his future successor should still hold the
posts of prime minister and party leader simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Videnov pointed out that Bulgaria is facing a
severe economic crisis and the socialist government should be
responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
He said the party should now speed up its reform and gain the
confidence of the society in an effort to win the new general
elections two years later.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists suffered a decisive defeat in last month's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Some 680 representatives participated in this congress. They
are expected to elect the new leadership of the party and vote on
whether the party will form a new cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Macao Tourism Booms As Economy Slows down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Macao economy as a whole
continued to slow down this year, but the tourism sector has kept
growing following the opening of the Macao International Airport
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourist arrivals and local residents traveling
abroad have both risen, helping boost a booming business in
Macao's catering business, hotels, transportation and travel
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Macao Census and Statistics showed
that the number of tourist arrivals between January and September
reached 6.14 million, up 4.6 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the figure for tourist arrivals could
climb further to eight million by the end of this year, compared
with 7.7 million last year.
</P>
<P>
A noticeable fact is that the number of travelers from Taiwan
surged by the largest margin with over 156 percent, while the
number of tourists from Hong Kong dropped by nearly seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that was the result of the opening of the Macao
Airport with several flights to Taiwan each day. Travelers from
Taiwan had usually arrived by ferry via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore,
Portugal, Japan also jumped between 40 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The booming tourism sector has benefited local restaurants and
hotels. More than two million passengers stayed in Macao overnight
between January and September, up 7.8 percent from the same period
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Salavessa da Costa, secretary for Media, Tourism and
Culture of the Macao government, said in a recent seminar that
tourism has become the leading source of revenues for Macao this
year, benefiting the local transportation industry, restaurants
and hotels, and travel agencies, and creating new job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry has now become one of the four leading
economic sectors in Macao. The others -- foreign trade, finance
and real estate -- all dropped a bit this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of Macao residents going abroad for
sightseeing has increased rapidly after the opening of the
airport, rising by 50 to 100 percent as compared the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
The number of travel groups going abroad shop up by more than
50 percent between January and July. Among them, the number of
groups to Taiwan quadrupled, to Japan up 60 percent, to China's
mainland up 40 percent, and to Thailand and Australia up more than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local travel agencies now have a better business. The total
number surged to more than 100 from only 20 a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of travelers arriving and leaving
here has been attributed mainly to the opening of the
international airport, which is expected to handle some 1.2
million passengers this year. More than a dozen air companies from
around the world are now using the airport.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao hosts such annual events as the music
festival, grand prix and fireworks contests which have won fame
across the world.
