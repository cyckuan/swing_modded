<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Opposition Leader Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the opposition
Tanzania People's Party (TPP) Aleck Che-mponda and five others
were arrested Thursday in capital Dar es Salaam for illegal
demonstration, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe told
reporters that Che-Mponda and his followers were arrested around
the State House premises by the police.
</P>
<P>
Gewe said the six were arrested following the TPP statement to
the press which said they would demonstrate Thursday before the
State House by any means so as to force the government to release
subsidies to the opposition parties to facilitate campaigns in the
by-election at Ubungo and Temeke constituencies in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Che-Mponda told a press conference in the city
that according to the National Electoral Commission's 1995
election guidelines, all political parties were supposed to get
subsidies but he wondered why the opposition parties were denied.
</P>
<P>
The regional police commander said that Che-Mponda and his
followers will be arraigned when the investigation of the incident
is completed.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Che-Mponda ran for the presidency but later withdrew
from the general elections. The reason, as he explained in January
this year, was that he was not able to pay one million shillings
(about 1,400 U.S. dollars) of deposit money to the electoral
commission.
</P>
<P>
He was also unlucky in the following years -- ran and lost as
candidate for the parliamentary seat in Kinodoni constituency in
Dar es Salaam in 1995, and lost again in the 1996 Temeke
parliamentary by-election.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leoneans Protest Against Power-Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) - A pressure group in Sierra Leone
staged a protest Thursday in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital,
against a possible power-sharing deal between the government and
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The protest brought Freetown virtually to a standstill when
most shops, banks and markets were closed, local radio reported
Thursday..
</P>
<P>
An official of the Civil Society Movement for Democracy, one
organizer of the protest, was quoted as saying that "This is a
pressure move to the ongoing peace talks in Lome, Togo, indicating
that Sierra Leoneans are against power-sharing."
</P>
<P>
We cannot see democracy being tampered with by rebels who have
 destabilized the nation, said the official.
</P>
<P>
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and his government made no comment
on the protest but some members of the government have privately
expressed support to the protest.
</P>
<P>
Whether the government and the rebels should share power in a
transitional government has been the main obstacle to reaching a
peace deal between the two sides during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demand that they should secure some key posts in a
transitional government while the Kabbah-led government insists
that they must disarm first and form a political party to take
part in the next election.
</P>
<P>
But the Sierra Leone government is under increasingly strong
pressure from some mediators including some members of the
Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) to make certain
compromises on this matter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airline Industry Unveils Measures to Improve Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. airline industry
unveiled Thursday a package of voluntary measures to promise
passengers a better level of services.
</P>
<P>
Buffeted by customer complaints and threatened by congressional
action, the airlines agreed to tell customers of the lowest
available price, notify people of delays and cancellations,
provide prompt ticket refunds, handle bumped passengers with
fairness and meet customers' essential needs during long
on-aircraft delays.
</P>
<P>
"We heard the bell ring, we have felt the whip," said Gerald
Greenwald, chairman of United Airlines and of the Air Transport
Association Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
The measures were prompted by several highly publicized
incidents last winter when passengers were made to sit on runways
for hours without access to food or restrooms. They followed
several months of negotiations among the industry, the Department
of Transportation and members of Congress who had introduced
legislation that would have mandated airline companies to take
steps to improve service.
</P>
<P>
Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee
and sponsor of a "passenger rights" bill, said the industry had
taken "some very significant steps."
</P>
<P>
But he said they have yet to work out the issue of notifying
passengers of overbooking and he would still seek legislation
requiring the Transportation Department's inspector general to
monitor the industry to make sure they were complying with their
promises.
</P>
<P>
Many of the promises contained in the plan are already airline
policy, according to a report released by the Wall Street Journal
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"But the industry agreed to restate the policy as a firm
commitment, such as agreeing to deliver delayed bags within 24
hours and attempt to deliver unclaimed baggage if it contains a
name, address or telephone number," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Exports and Imports Decline in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's exports declined 0.9 per
cent in April and imports fell 0.3 per cent in the same month,
according to the official statistics released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the exports offset March gains to continue a
downward trend that started last November, the information said.
</P>
<P>
The decrease, a result of a sharp fall in auto shipments to the
United States, brought exports back to February levels.
</P>
<P>
Exports of passengers cars slumped 13.3 per cent in April and
truck sales fell 3.3 per cent, the information added.
</P>
<P>
Imports were also reported down by 0.3 per cent in April, again
continuing a trend from last fall.
</P>
<P>
Lower imports of gold, steel bars and auto parts pushed down
import totals, the information said, indicating that tariffs on
imports of steel from several countries appear to have had an
impact.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to hold Population Census in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oti Boateng said a population and housing census is important
since it would provide facts essential to governmental
policy-making, planning and administration.
</P>
<P>
The statistician said information on the size, distribution and
 characteristics of a country's population, is essential in
describing and assessing its economic, social and demographic
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
Oti Boateng said the population and housing censuses are being
put together because they closely related.
</P>
<P>
On the problems associated with the political demarcation of
some districts, Dr Oti Boateng said, "we will not be involved with
any legalities of demarcation going on in some of the districts.
</P>
<P>
 "Though they are important determinants, we are ensuring that
the census is done according to statistical boundaries. We will
not dabble in those problems."
</P>
<P>
He said, the Service has decided to go ahead with the census
since "if we decide to wait till these demarcation problems are
solved, there will be no census in Ghana".
</P>
<P>
 He said everybody in the country, including foreigners would
be counted, adding that the upcoming census is a de jure type, in
which the number of foreigners must be known for fertility and
demographic reasons.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Continue Search for Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
said Thursday that the United Nations system will not lag behind
in its search for concrete solutions to combat desertification.
</P>
<P>
Annan said this in a statement released to the media in Accra
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to mark the
celebration of the Fifth World Day to Combat Desertification and
Drought, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The World Day is marked to commemorate the adoption of the
U.N. convention to combat desertification in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Annan said: "today, June 17, we have an opportunity to
reaffirm our support for all initiatives taken to combat
desertification at all levels as well as our commitment to join
forces to overcome the obstacles to sustainable development for
all, including the degrading of arid lands and all its
consequences, environment, social and political."
</P>
<P>
The secretariat of the convention will continue to encourage
all organizations concerned to join in the search for concrete
solutions worked out not only with governments and also with civil
society as provided for under the convention.
</P>
<P>
Annan said more than 110 countries are affected by
desertification and it would be a big mistake to think that this
is a problem that concerns only developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said North America and several countries in the European
Union are also affected, adding that desertification has
repercussions on biological diversity, climate change and fresh
water supplies against which no country in any part of the world
is an outsider.
</P>
<P>
Annan said desertification leads directly to the loss of
fertile land and a decline in agricultural productivity, which
in turn is reflected in famine, population displacement, social
and political conflicts.
</P>
<P>
 He said ecology and the wellbeing of populations, environment
and sustainable development are linked.
</P>
<P>
 The number of parties to the convention last year rose from
125 to 151, showing how committed the international community is
to a process that specifically addressed the commitments made at
the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government will soon
table a motion before parliament to set up a national security
council (NSC) to replace the existing National Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Minister of Security Muruli Mukasa when
presenting a paper on the management of security at a six-day
workshop in Mukono District near Kampala Thursday, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop for deputy and assistant resident district
commissioners, the minister said that because of the multiplicity
of security agencies in the country, the government had found it
necessary to create a focal point for effective monitoring and
coordination.
</P>
<P>
He urged better cooperation among the security agencies in
strengthening security in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to recent media reports, there is often
misunderstanding between some security agencies in their duties
and spheres of power, which leads to laxity of security agents
belonging to various groups.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Regulation on Quality of Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The director of Mozambique's
National Fisheries Bureau Herminio Tembe announced here Thursday
that the country's regulation on the quality of fishing products
takes effect as demanded by the international market especially
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The regulation is the result of consultations with the EU.
Mozambique exports about 7,000 tons of shrimps and thousands of
tons of fish every year, of which 60 percent is heading for the EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was approved three months ago by the country's
Council of Ministers, said the director.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the regulation is a condition EU sets for
Mozambique's fish exports. The regulation stipulates on the
hygienic requirements for the catching and processing of the fish
products before the products are exported to the European market.
</P>
<P>
The EU suspended importing fish and shrimps from Mozambique
following the break-out of cholera in some coastal areas in the
southern African country at the end of 1997 and in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EU sent a delegation to Mozambique early this year to
inspect on the fish producing and processing process in the
country. In April this year, the country's exports to EU was
restored.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique exports yearly fish and shrimps worth about 80
million to 90 million U.S. dollars, which accounts for about 40
percent of the country's total export value.

slavery, conscription, prostitution and other gross violations of
their human rights," he said.

ILO adopted a treaty Thursday banning the worst forms of child
labor, including slavery and forced military recruitment,

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Provide Lebanon With Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to provide a three-year
200 million U.S. dollars loan to finance Lebanon's development
projects, a visiting Kuwaiti official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abdul Rahim, president of Kuwaiti Arab Economic
Development Fund (KAEDF), made the announcement after his meeting
with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss. An agreement to this
effect will be signed next week.
</P>
<P>
"The visit of the KAEDF delegation marks the start for the
Kuwaiti government to honor its commitment to provide 200
million dollars for Lebanon's road and water projects," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on loans was first reached orally last month
when the prime minister visited Kuwait on his regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Hoss used the trip, which took him to Saudi Arabia, Egypt,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to seek Arab countries'
continuing support for his country's reconstruction efforts and
attract more foreign investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first project to benefit from the loan is a 10-kilometer
Dbayyeh-Antelias highway project in the northern entrance of
Beirut, Nabil said.
</P>
<P>
As the second biggest financial bankroller after Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait has granted Lebanon a total of 331 million dollars in
donations and soft loans since the end of the country's 1975-1990
civil war.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Japan at Asia Basketball Superleague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- China came from behind to
outclass Japan All-Star 87-80 in the first match of the Hong Kong
leg of the Asia Basketball Superleague (ABSL) here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese All-Star side, which consists of most of China's
national team members, met strong resistance from the Japanese,
especially in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Japan took the upper hands with a man-to-man defense, forcing
their opponents to many turnovers before they cruised to a 27-21
lead in the first quarter. But the Chinese equalized the score at
44-all after the first half.
</P>
<P>
China had to field their best line-up to face the Japanese, but
they could not enlarge their margin and the match became a see-saw
one.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes before the final whistle, China dominated the
game, collecting seven points in a row against Japan's zero.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the Japan's points were scored by 2.05-meter-
tall American center Demetrius Alexander who got 39 points.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Regal also came from behind to edge South Korea All-
Star 113-103 through two extras in the day's other match.
</P>
<P>
The ABSL is divided into two groups of four. Group A consists
of China, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, China, while Group B
features Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> UK's New Curbs on Tobacco Adverts Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 17 (Xinhua) - The British government brought
forward Thursday plans to ban tobacco advertising in almost any
forms by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Under proposed laws, all forms of advertising will be banned
from December 10, together with general advertising in shops and
newsagnets apart from price lists and stock display material.
</P>
<P>
Launching the draft legislation, Health Minister Tessa Jowell
said Labor would do everything in its power to also ensure that
sport "kicked the habit".
</P>
<P>
The new rules will take effect almost two years before an EU
ban comes into force in July 2001 and triggered protests from the
industry which said thousands of jobs could be lost.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest announcement will not affect the issue of
tobacco sponsorship in sport, which must be phased out by the year
2003.
</P>
<P>
Sports classified as having a global appeal, such as Formula
One motor racing and the World Snooker Championship will be
exempted from the sponsorship ban until 2006.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposed laws, Health Secretary Frank Dobson
said in a statement: "Smoking kills. It kills 120,000 people every
year. It first hooks people and then kills them off at a rate of
120,000 a year in the UK alone."

<HEADLINE> Tunisia's Tourism Revenues Up in First Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia's tourism saw a marked boom
in the first five months of this year, with its revenues reaching
603 million dinars (548 million U.S. dollars), compared with 551
million dinars (500 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of tourists in the first quarter of this year
reached 1,147,000, up by 31.7 percent as against the 871,150
arrivals in the same period last year, said a Tourism Ministry
report issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 546,306 Europeans visited Tunisia in the first
quarter of this year, an increase of 17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that up to June 7, the nights the tourists
stayed for in Tunisia totaled 11.48 million, up 13.7 percent over
the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and Handicrafts Minister Slaheddine Maaoui attributed
the boom to the war in the Balkans, a traditional tourist
competitor to Tunisia, as well as Tunisia's efforts to diversify
its tourist products and provide amenities for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the main source of Tunisia's hard currency
earnings. In 1998, Tunisia earned some 1.707 billion dinars (1.61
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Romania Allows Czech, Polish Troops to Transit Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Parliament approved,
on Thursday, a request of President Emil Constantinescu to allow
Polish and Czech troops to transit its territory en route to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament passed a decision allowing Polish and Czech
military to transit Romania's territory over June 25-July 2.
Polish and Czech KFOR contingent of seven and respectively three
trains would cross through Romania to Kosovo in the date.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also okayed the president's request to extend
the mandate of about 200 peacekeepers deployed in Bosnia
Herzegovina since the mid-1990s and to allow them to be redeployed
in Kosovo alongside NATO-led troops in the province.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidency's request for the Czech and Polish troops to
transit Romania's territory observes legal provisions", the chief
of the General Staff, General of Army Corpus Constantin Degeratu
said, during the Chambers' joint session. Degeratu also stressed
that the Law on defence stipulates the authorization for
transiting the country by foreign troops to the interest of the
collective security and in accordance with the obligations Romania
has assumed by international treaties.
</P>
<P>
In order to prove the legal validity of President Emil
Constantinescu's request, the chief of General Staff invoked the
Law No 23/1996 whereby Romania's Parliament okayed the signing of
an Accord with NATO and the Alliance's partners, stipulating also
the territory's transit for military drills or peace missions.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Romania rejected Russia's demand for an air
corridor to Kosovo, saying that it would take into account the
demand only after UN and NATO accord.

presidency was Essop Pahad.

<P>
GENEVA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) ended its meeting here Thursday with calls for
its 174 member states to take immediate and effective measures to
eliminate the worst forms of child labor.
</P>
<P>
In the "Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention 1999" adopted at
the end of the 87 session of its governing body, the International

urgently to take "immediate and effective measures to secure the
prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labor".

<P>
The newly adopted convention applies to all persons under the
age of 18 and will come into force after two states have ratified
it.
</P>
<P>
The worst forms of child labor defined in the convention
include:
</P>
<P>
-- All forms of slavery and practices similar to slavery, such
as the sale and trafficking of children, forced or compulsory
labor, debt bondage and serfdom;
</P>
<P>
-- The use, procurement or offering of a child for prostitution,
production of pornography or pornographic performances;
</P>
<P>

is carried out, is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or
morals of children.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Kosovo Task Force Head to Brief Security Council on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. deputy
secretary-general, Louise Frechette, is scheduled to brief the
Security Council on her two-day visit to Geneva, during which she
held a series of meetings with representatives of European
organizations, which are beginning to work jointly with the United
Nations as part of the newly-formed U.N. Mission in Kosovo, known
as UNMIK.
</P>
<P>
Frechette, who returned to New York on Wednesday night, is to
brief the 15-nation body on her talks with representatives from
the European Union (EU), NATO and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to coordinate their future
cooperation with the United Nations in the Kosovo peace process,
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution adopted last Thursday, NATO is leading the
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, OSCE is in charge of the
building of institutions and the organization of elections in the
Serbian province, and EU is leading the post-war reconstruction in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, Frechette will not go int details on the size and cost
of UNMIK, which is to set up an interim administration for Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians make up a majority of the province's
population of 2 million, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The acting head of UNMIK, Sergio Vieira de Mello, has joined
the commander of the Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR) in a
television appeal to Serbian civilians not to leave the Yugoslav
province, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The joint appeal by de Mello, who is the U.N.
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, and General
Michael Jackson, was Wednesday broadcast on local television.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported,
however, that 24,000 Kosovar Serbs had entered Serbia and 9,000
more went into Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for independence.
Following the withdrawal of Serbian forces as scheduled under the
U.N. resolution, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), rebel forces
set up by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to fight Serbs, seized
positions and refused to be disarmed, and even publicly stated
that they are running administrations in some areas in kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Italy has demanded a quick action by KFOR to
disarm KLA in accordance with U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes to Improve Relations With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Thursday voiced its
willingness to improve its relations with neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statements by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit regarding the disputes between the two countries in the
eastern Aegean Sea, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said at a press briefing that Athens wanted to build good
relations with Turkey but this must be based on the principles of
international law and respect for international conventions.
</P>
<P>
He accused Turkey of failing to respond to Greece's repeatedly
proposal for efforts by Turkey to better Greek-Turkish ties, which
have been strained over decades for the two countries' disputes in
the territorial waters, air space limits and the delimitation of
the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stressed that Greece was expecting a goodwill gesture
from Ankara for the improvement of bilateral relations, since
Greece had repeatedly made moves in this direction.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Ecevit's request for Turkey to check to ascertain
whether there were indeed any terrorist training camps in Greece,
the spokesman said that this lacked seriousness. Turkey would be
advised to see what was happening in its own country rather than
making such allegations, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, Reppas described Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash as "a negative force," saying that the
international community was showing great interest in a settlement
of the Cyprus problem and the Turks and Turkish Cypriots could not
hold captive an independent country.

TEHRAN, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces seized
2,455 kilograms of opium Wednesday night in the northeastern
province of Khorasan, Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Taliban Appeal for Assistance to Extinguish Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Thursday
renewed appeal for immediate international assistance to
extinguish a forest fire in the northeast Afghan province of
Kunar.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the forest fire in Kunar province has
been raging for the fifth day and is rapidly approaching to
Pakistan's border town of Chitral.
</P>
<P>
The fire in Kunar province broke on June 12 and has engulfed
trees over hundreds of hectares and 10 villages, the Taliban's
chief representative in Islamabad, Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have no resources to deal with the fire and make urgent
appeal to the world community for help," Haqqani said. About 500
to 600 people have been trying to put off the fire for five days
but failed to extinguish it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said that he had contacted Pakistan, the United Nations
and the Organization of Islamic Conference, however, so there is
no response so far.
</P>
<P>
letters have also been sent to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan for urgent assistance from the international community,
according to the Taliban representative.
</P>
<P>
The fire is advancing rapidly through Dara Pech valley, some 30
kilometers south of the provincial capital of Asadabad, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Local people have been asked to try to contain the fire by
cutting down the tree and digging trenches around the burning
trees.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Hints Fed Would Take Pre-emptive Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Thursday that the central bank should consider
taking pre-emptive action to prevent any threat to continued
economic growth, even though inflation remains in check at
present.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep the economy growing, "It is useful to pre-empt
forces of imbalance before they threaten economic stability,"
Greenspan told in a testimony before the Joint Economy Committee
of Congress. Sometimes that is not possible because the future
"can be too opaque to penetrate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When we can be pre-emptive, we should be, because modest
pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more drastic actions
at a later date that could destabilize the economy,'' Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's testimony came just a day after the government
reported that inflation remained tame during May.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said by using the word "pre-emptive", Greenspan
was sending a signal that the Fed is prepared to act soon to raise
short-term interest rates to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Because monetary policy operates with a significant lag, we
have to make judgments, not only about the current degree of
balance in the economy, but about how the economy is likely to
fare a year or more in the future," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan reiterated what he told Congress earlier this week,
that increases in U.S. workers' productivity linked to
improvements in technology have so far kept inflation in check, a
significant change over the way the economy operated in years
past.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "Despite its extraordinary acceleration, labor
productivity has not grown fast enough to accommodate the
increased demand for labor induced by the exceptional strength in
demand for goods and services."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is in the middle of an exceptional period of
strong growth and continued low inflation. "For the period
immediately ahead, inflationary pressures still seem
well-contained," the Fed chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"There are developing imbalances that give us pause and raise
the question: Do these imbalances place our economic expansion at
risk?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth overall has averaged 4 percent a year, he said.
Of that, about 2 percentage points are attributable to the
increased worker productivity and another 1 percentage point to
the growth in the number of working-age Americans.
</P>
<P>
"The remainder was drawn from the ever-decreasing pool of
available job seekers without work," Greenspan told the committee.
"That last development represents an unsustainable trend."
</P>
<P>
Inflation tends to appear when the pool of available workers is
so tight that businesses have to begin raising wages beyond what
is merited by productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has not raised interest rates in more than four years.
When interest rates go up, borrowing becomes more expensive,
consumers and businesses tend to spend less and thus the economy
eventually tends to slow.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that one of the things Fed policy-makers must
take into account is the relative importance to place on stock
market prices. Because of the growing optimism in a period of
economic growth, stock prices can climb to unsustainable levels
even when underlying product prices are relatively stable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
While it is not clear that the current high stock market prices
represent a "bubble," Greenspan noted that "bubbles generally are
perceptible only after the fact."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said even when bubbles burst, "the consequences need
not be catastrophic for the economy," and the Fed does best to
focus its interest rate policies on the general level of prices of
goods.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Hopes for Chinese Presence in 2002 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Chung Mong-joon, president of the
South Korea Football Association, expressed his hope Thursday that
China qualifies for the 2002 World Cup finals to end their
longtime absence from the premier soccer event.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Japan will co-host the 2002 World Cup, which
will be the first time that World Cup Finals be staged in Asia and
co-hosted.
</P>
<P>
China, who had never succeeded in its six attempts for the
World Cup finals, failed to reach the previous World Cup finals in
France, the last of this century, as they could not make the top
ten play-offs in Asia Zone last year.
</P>
<P>
Chung, also vice-president of FIFA, told foreign reporters here
that South Korea also plans to conduct some World Cup-related
cultural celebrations in soccer-crazy China.
</P>
<P>
Chung said he wished to have China involved in the 2002 World
Cup finals. "China enjoys a good atmosphere for soccer," Chung
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the key to the World Cup success was to raise the
playing standard of co-hosts South Korea and Japan, although
things like venues, traffic and accommodation are also important
for the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the significance of launching the first
Northeast Asian soccer tournament, which will feature China, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chung predicted that such an event could begin from next year
and it can be hosted by China or Japan. "It is not only a soccer
event, but also a festival of soccer for the four Northeastern
Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
Chung was optimistic of the response to the television coverage
of the 2002 Finals, predicting it could draw an audience up to 60
billion, especially considering the growing popularity of
televisions in China and India.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Table Motion to Reject Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Some members of Parliament (MPs)
in Uganda have tabled a motion in Parliament Thursday seeking to
amend the constitutional provision on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The motion, tabled by Omara Atubo, member of parliament for
Otuke County, aims at rejecting the coming referendum and
preferring elections as the best way to determine a political
system for the country, Radio Uganda reported Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
As soon as it was taken to floor, the motion met strong
opposition from Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs
Mayanja Nkangi, and Political Commissar of the ruling National
Resistance Movement (NRM) James Wapakhabulo who dismissed the
motion as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
As the debate on the matter was heated and prolonged, Speaker
Francis Ayume had to adjourn the House to Friday to allow other
MPs to express their views on the motion.
</P>
<P>
According to Uganda's Constitution made in 1995, a referendum
should be held after the NRM has been in power for five years in
order to determine the country's future political system.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's ruling NRM refuses to admit that it is a party and the
 Constitution bans all official activities of other political
groups.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the NRM will win in the pending
referendum and continue to rule the African country.

<HEADLINE> Asian PC market Grows 25 Percent in Q1 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asia/Pacific personal
computer (PC) market excluding Japan posted an almost 25 percent
growth to a shipment of 2.95 million units in the first quarter of
1999, the U.S. International Data Corporation (IDC) said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first quarter in over three years that every
Asian country market enjoyed positive annual growth, and it is the
highest figure produced since the second quarter of 1996 when the
market generated over 30 percent annual growth.
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts-based IDC also said the shipment in the first
quarter is 2 percent higher than the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the regional PC market recovering, IDC increased its
regional shipment forecast to 12.9 million units in 1999, or a 23
percent growth over 1998.
</P>
<P>
IDC said China, sharing 35 percent of the regional market,
played an integral role in supporting the region's growth.
</P>
<P>
First quarter PC shipments in the PRC amounted to more than 1
million units for a 22.1 percent increase from the year-ago
quarter, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other big market players are Australia, South Korea and India.
The highest growth of 66 percent was achieved by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Despite positive growth rates in Southeast Asian markets which
endured harsh economic conditions in 1998, most of these markets
are still not back up to pre-crisis shipment levels, IDC noted.

IBM, Compaq, Legend, Samsung and Hewlett-Packard are top five
vendors in the region.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Election Results Remain Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The results of Malawi's second
multi-party elections remain unclear Thursday, since both the
ruling party and the opposition alliance claim that it is leading
in the presidential and parliamentary ballot.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six hours after Tuesday's poll, the Electoral Commission
has announced the results of only 33 out of the 193 parliamentary
seats, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential race, there were results from only four of
the 26 districts, which show that Gwanda Chakuamba, leader of the
opposition alliance of the former ruling Malawi Congress Party
(MCP) and Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), are
leading in three districts while President Bakili Muluzi's United
Democratic Front (UDF) in one.
</P>
<P>
The Malawi Daily Times newspaper, run by the MCP, reported
Thursday that the MCP/AFORD alliance was leading in the
parliamentary race with 90 seats against the UDF's 87, while the
private Nation newspaper gave Muluzi's party 51 seats and the
alliance 14.
</P>
<P>
"We should be able to meet the deadline to announce the results
within 72 hours from the end of polling," Chief Electoral Official
Roosevelt Gondwe told a press conference in Blantyre, the major
commercial city in the country .
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malawi Electoral Commission has confirmed that
at least eight cabinet ministers have lost their bids for the
193-member Parliament as counting of ballots from Tuesday's polls
continued into Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exit polls show that all cabinet ministers who defected from
AFORD to the UDF have failed to retain their seats on the UDF
ticket. These include Foreign Affairs Minister Mapopa Chipeta and
Environmental Affairs minister Fran Mayinga Mkandawire.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission has expressed its satisfaction with
the voters' turn-out during the election. Gondwe predicted that
over 90 percent of the nearly five million registered voters
turned out to vote.
</P>
<P>
Malawi held its first multi-party elections in 1994, which saw
President Muluz's UDF defeat the MCP led by former President
Kamuzu Banda.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Small Businesses Hit by Cramming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of small business
owners have lost millions of dollars in the past two years after
responding to a phone call from firms offering to design a Web
site for them during a free 30-day trial period, the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The commission said this is just the latest variation of firms
fraudulently "cramming" unauthorized charges onto phone bills.
</P>
<P>
According to the FTC, business owners were charged for the
service even though they hadn't agreed to purchase it at the end
of the trial period or had canceled their order. Many never
received notice telling them their 30 days were in effect and were
shocked when charges from the firms appeared on their phone bills.
</P>
<P>
In its third annual report to Congress on fraud, released
Thursday, the FTC said cramming has become the fifth largest
source of consumer complaints in the last 18 months. Since October
1997, the FTC has received 10,000 complaints about cramming.
</P>
<P>
The FTC warned small businesses to review all phone bills
carefully as soon as they arrive, document all purchases and buy
services from companies they have worked with before.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Eight Eastern African countries
met here Thursday at the second Eastern African Police Chiefs
Conference to discuss the set- up of the eastern African
sub-regional headquarters of the International Criminal Police
Organization (Interpol) here.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Commissioner of Police Philemon Abong'o said at the
opening ceremony that the establishing of the Interpol
sub-regional bureau in Nairobi will enhance the exchange of
criminal intelligence by member countries and thus contain the
escalation of organized crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The Kenyan government and the Interpol signed the Headquarters
 agreement of the Interpol sub-regional bureau in October 1998 and
the agreement has entered into force and now provides the
sub-regional bureau for the eastern African countries with the
necessary legal framework for its operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has done much work in a bid to make the
sub- regional bureau operational, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to sustain this momentum, it is of paramount
importance that all issues regarding financing, staffing and
equipping of the bureau should be addressed without further delay,
said Abong'o, who urged the member countries of the Interpol to
note this point.
</P>
<P>
The financial situation is quite encouraging as a lot of member
 countries have either partly or entirely paid their dues for 1997
and 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan police chief also called on member countries to make
 preparatory arrangements to facilitate an early and smooth
opening of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference has brought together some 30 delegates
from Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan, Uganda, Somalia, Burundi, Rwanda and
Djibouti.

<HEADLINE> UNEP to Assess Environmental Impact of Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a news release issued by the UNEP headquarters
here Thursday, United Nations Under Secretary-General Klaus
Toepfer announced in London Wednesday that a team from the joint
Balkans Task Force on environment and human settlements would soon
travel to Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro for this.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer, also the Executive Director of UNEP and the United
Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) said it was urgent
that work begin on thoroughly assessing the environmental damage
and risk resulting from the conflict, thereby enabling
environmental rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the joint Balkans task force would look at the
direct environmental and human settlement impacts of the conflict
in the Balkans and the wider consequences to countries of the
region, including Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the task force is to collect, evaluate and
monitor the environmental situation in cooperation with
governments, inter-governmental and non-governmental
organizations, Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, UNEP/Habitat participated in a U.N. inter-agency
assessment mission to Serbia and Kosovo. The report of the
assessment mission presented to Toepfer recommended a
fact-finding mission to the region should be undertaken involving
UNEP, Habitat and the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that a large number of civilian
industrial facilities including oil refineries, fuel dumps,
chemical and fertilizer factories, destroyed by the NATO bombing
had contributed to levels of environmental pollution in urban
areas, which will in turn have a negative impact on health and
ecological systems.
</P>
<P>
Given the gravity of potential environmental consequences of
the conflict and NATO bombings in Yugoslavia and their regional
ramifications, a more detailed assessment of the full extent of
the environmental impact is urgently required, the report added.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate a fast and appropriate response to the
 environmental effort, Toepfer said, the task force was in close
contact with key players in the peace and reconstruction process,
including the European Union, Russia, the United States, World
Bank and other relevant United Nations agencies.

<HEADLINE> Only RCD Rebels to Sign Congo (K) Peace Deal: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Thursday that only the anti-Kabila rebel Rally for Democracy
in Congo (RCD) will sign a peace agreement and no other rebels
faction from Congo (K)

will be part of the cease-fire accord to be signed here next week.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who returned here from South Africa, where he attended
new President Thabo Mbeki's inauguration, said two documents will
be signed and that one is the cease-fire and the other on
modalities to the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who was mandated by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the war in
congo (K), said he has invited former South African President
Nelson Mandela, former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and
former Botswanan President Ketumile Masire to grace the signing of
the peace documents.
</P>
<P>
Eight African leaders including Chiluba met in Pretoria earlier
Thursday for consultations on how to resolve the war in the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said they agreed that the Lusaka peace initiative must
be continued and consultations must be continued within and
outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the Pretoria talks are meant to pave a way for the
crucial regional summit on peace in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) due in Lusaka on June 26.
</P>
<P>
Everything is being done to ensure that the cease-fire
agreement can be signed at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Organization for African Unity (OAU)
Ahmed Salim, who attended the Pretoria talks Chaired by Chiluba,
said Africa cannot afford to be plagued by strife and turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of RCD did not attend the Pretoria talks
although its members arrived in Johannesburg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the talks were Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, countries
backing Congolese President Laurent Kabila and Uganda and Rwanda
which support the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kabila was not at the inauguration of Mbeki and did not attend
Thursday' s talks.
</P>
<P>
Zambian former President K. Kaunda's opposition party thursday
asked the government to involve Kaunda in the peace process of
Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The Information Secretary of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), Bwendo Mulengela, said here Thursday
that Kaunda should be involved in the process just like other
former presidents in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said leaving Kaunda outside the framework does not augur
well for the talks.

<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets,
except London, closed higher Thursday as the hint from
U.S. Federal Reserve pointed to a rise rather than fall as
the likely next move for rates.
</P>
<P>
Strong rises on Wall Street Wednesday set the FTSE
100 off to a buoyant start first, but the gains were
quickly eroded as the day progressed.
</P>
<P>
Concern focused on evidence to the U.S. Congress given by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan raising concern
that U.S. interest rates may soon rise. By the close, the
index was down 11.3 points at 6493.6, having hit a highs
of 6548 and a low of 6465.
</P>
<P>
Market players have been waiting all week for Alan
Greenspan's speech, but now that his thoughts are out in
the open, those same players don't appear to be reacting,
said an investor.
</P>
<P>
The electronically traded Xetra Dax closed at 5415.5,
up 32.8, having traded a range of 5385 - 5384. In floor
trade, the Dax closed at 5412, up 30.7.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President's Proposal on Congo (K) Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
said Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu Thursday made a new
proposal to him to bring about peace in the war-torn Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"My dear brother, the president of Rwanda tonight offered me a
new proposal, a very important proposal... to find a solution to
the problem," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted
Gaddafi as saying in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi would not reveal the proposal, saying he wanted first
to examine it.
</P>
<P>
He said Libya would take part in a summit on the DRC conflict
to be held on June 26 in Lusaka, Zambia. The summit had been
scheduled for June 25.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki said earlier Thursday that
the heads of state of seven African countries agreed in a meeting
in Pretoria to press ahead with multi-national efforts to end the
civil war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the meeting, at a South African government guest
house in Waterkloof, Pretoria, agreed the foreign ministers
involved in the peace process would meet in Lusaka, Zambia Monday
ahead of the June 26 summit.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's closed-door meeting -- one of Mbeki's first
engagements after being sworn in as president Wednesday -- was
also attended by his counterparts from Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Botswana, Uganda and Zambia, and representatives of the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila was also represented at
Thursday's meeting, SAPA quoted South African officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting delayed the start of a press conference Thursday at
which Mbeki revealed the names of his new cabinet and deputy
ministers. The press conference was originally scheduled to start
at 11.30 a.m. (0930 GMT) but was put off till 3 p.m. (1300 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told journalists at the press conference that the leaders
agreed they had to work to ensure the summit "produces an
inclusive agreement" between the warring parties in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state wanted a cease-fire followed by "a political
process to resolve the conflict".
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who has led peace efforts
since last year, was given the go-ahead to prepare for the summit,
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is the coordinator of efforts by the 14-nation Southern
African Development Community to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
South African government officials confirmed representatives of
the DRC rebel group -- the Congolese Rally for Democracy, had not
taken part in the meeting but were in Pretoria and were regularly
consulted, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo Wednesday indicated at a
press conference in Johannesburg that his country could consider
sending peace-keeping troops to the DRC under the "right
conditions."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, quoted in the Business Day
newspaper Thursday, blamed the rebels and their supporters for
delaying a cease-fire. He said he believed the 10-month conflict
could be over by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia are fighting alongside
Kabila's army.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Secessionist Refugee Leaders Abscond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Four leading members of a
group of nearly 2,500 Namibian secessionists have absconded from a
Botswana refugee camp, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana government stripped them of their refugee status,
SAPA quoted a statement of Botswana's President Office as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four, who absconded from Kagisong Center, 15 kilometers
outside of Gaborone, are Steven Mamili, Martin Tubaundule, Thadeus
Ndala and Moses Mushwena.
</P>
<P>
"They have disqualified themselves as refugees and forfeit the
protection of the Botswana government," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The four were granted refugee status along with 11 other
members in February.
</P>
<P>
The two most senior of their colleagues, Mishake Muyongo and
Chief Boniface Mamili, have already left Botswana to live in
Denmark. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)
is still looking for countries to accept the others.
</P>
<P>
The group left Namibia between October and December 1998 when
Muyongo, who leads the opposition Namibian United Democratic
Party, declared he was seeking the secession of the Caprivi from
the Windhoek government.
</P>
<P>
They said they feared for their safety following a subsequent
security crackdown in the Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
Botswana said repeatedly that none of the refugees would be
returned against their will, but that it was committed to the
principle of voluntary repatriation as a durable solution to the
problem and would collaborate with Namibia to that end.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight of the refugees have returned to Namibia
voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> Kosovar Refugees In Australia Told to Stay at Singleton or Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Six Kosovar refugees was warned
Friday by the Australian government to stay at Singleton Army
Barracks they fled or go back home.
</P>
<P>
The blunt message was voiced by Australian Immigration Minister
Philip Ruddock to a family of six Kosovar refugees who are not
satisfied with the conditions in the barracks and fled the base
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said the Salihu family, who traveled to the East Hills
Army base in Sydney's south-west under farcical circumstances
Thursday night, was not allowed to stay there and could be
returned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Staying at East Hills is not an option. The government has
made it clear that the Kosovars do not have the option of picking
and choosing accommodation," Ruddock said.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said another 100 refugees arrived at East Hills Friday,
with another 410 due on Sunday, squeezing the accommodation to its
limit.
</P>
<P>
"However, they have rejected the Singleton offer so there is no
option but to give them their other choice to return home."
</P>
<P>
Australia has accepted nearly 4,000 Kosovar refugees as
promised on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
A busload of the refugees refused to leave their bus for more
than 24 hours last Friday in protest against the harsh living
conditions in the barrack.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Overnight Rates Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
announced here Friday that it will cut its overnight rates for the
18 times this year by another 25 basis points Monday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's borrowing rate will be reduced from 9.50
percent to 9.25 percent while its lending rates from 11.50 percent
to 11.25 percent, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
This move brings the cumulative reduction in both overnight
borrowing rate and lending rate since the start of this year to
412.5 basis points, from 13.375 percent and 15.375 percent
respectively, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Lower interest rates are expected to mitigate corporate stress
by alleviating leverage ratios. An acceleration of the loan
payment cycle of the corporate sector, in turn, would raise the
availability of loanable funds of banks at lower cost," it said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that this move would encourage banks to
resume active lending operations, a key factor in boosting
domestic demand towards sustained economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Interview: CDMA Technology Leader Interested in China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Qualcomm Incorporated, pioneer
and world leader of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital
technology, has expressed its confidence and optimism about the
prospect of the development of CDMA in China.
</P>
<P>
The access of China United Telecommunications Corporation (
China Unicom) into the CDMA Development Group, a global
association of CDMA products and service providers, and its plan
to deploy CDMA networks in China is very encouraging, said Anil
Kripalani, vice president of the Planning and International
Administration department of Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm is very interested in the Chinese market and likes to
help China Unicom achieve its goal of developing CDMA network in
China, Kripalani told Xinhua during the 4th CDMA World Congress
workshops held in Hong Kong between June 14-18.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom announced during the congress that the CDMA
network construction will start in 1999 with the capacity of 2.6
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2000, the CDMA network in China will reach the
capacity of 10 million covering 250 cities and after 2000, a new
capacity of 10 million will be added annually to the CDMA network.
By the end of 2003, the network will reach the capacity of 40
million with as many as 28 million actual subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Based in San Diego, the United States, Qualcomm is holders of
many CDMA technologies and many major wireless telecommunications
companies in the world are licensees of its technology.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm is now talking with some potential Chinese partners
for its localization in China, Kripalani said. It will continue to
offer technology to China in order to make it able to take
advantage of the latest CDMA technology.
</P>
<P>
The company is now seeking opportunities to set up joint
ventures in China to manufacture its handsets. Qualcomm's handsets
have entered the 5th generation and the company is a leading
manufacturer of CDMA chips, which are used by many CDMA network
and handsets manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Compared with GSM, CDMA networks and handsets have advantages
in larger capacity, wider coverage, better voice quality and low
fail calls rate, Kripalani said.
</P>
<P>
Larger capacity and wider coverage can make it possible for
setting up as little as base stations to serve as many as
subscribers and through this the operation cost will be reduced,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Also the transmission power of CDMA handsets are lower and that
is good for environment, he added. The 3rd generation (3G)
wireless telecommunications, which connect mobile phones to
Internet, will be based on the CDMA technology, Kripalani said.
</P>
<P>
The CDMA networks are easy to be upgraded by changing some
chips, Kripalani said. The existing equipment do not need to be
thrown away and through this way, the operation cost will be
further reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
CDMA is the fastest growing wireless technology in the world.
Among the total 30 million subscribers, 18 million of them are in
Asia Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> SIA Exercises Options for 10 B777-200 IGW Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 18 (Xinhua)-- Singapore Airlines (SIA) has
decided to exercise the options for 10 B777-200 IGW aircraft in a
1995 order as part of its bid to phase out the A340-300 fleet,
according to its press release Friday .
</P>
<P>
The press release said SIA concurrently announced the exercise
of options for the 10 planes and its options to sell 17 A340-300
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The 10 options for B777-200 IGW were contained in the order
made in November 1995 for 77 aircraft comprising 34 on firm and 43
on option. Of the 77 aircraft, 61 airliners were for SIA and the
rest for its associate company, Singapore Aircraft Leasing
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The Press release said that the 10 B777-200 IGW aircraft, the
type of the increased gross weight version powered by Rolls Royce
Trent 892 engines, will be delivered between 2001 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
This order, together with spares, is worth 1.9 billion U.S.
dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
The press release affirmed that a commitment has been made by
the Boeing Company to purchase the 15 A340-300 aircraft in SIA's
fleet and the two remaining A340-300 aircraft on order to be
delivered in 2003.
</P>
<P>
It underlined that the acquisition of B777-200 IGW will allow
SIA to phase out progressively the A340-300 fleet, which is
currently deployed primarily on the thinner routes to Europe and
North America.
</P>
<P>
The press release said SIA now operates 89 aircraft including 7
freighters and expects to have a fleet of around 120 aircraft by
the end of the financial year 2004-2005, comprising B777s,
B747-400s, the super long-range Airbus A340-500s and possibly one
other smaller type for regional operations.
</P>
<P>
SIA expects to finance the purchase largely from its cash flow,
it said. But if necessary the airline will resort to borrowing or
leasing, it added.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges G-8 Leaders to Play Role to Resolve Pak-India Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has called on the leaders of G-8 to "play a positive role
individually and collectively" to resolve the Pak-India crisis and
avert a conflict.
</P>
<P>
This was the main message contained in a letter which Sharif
wrote Thursday to the G-8 leaders on the eve of the Cologne
Summit, Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said at a press
briefing Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said in his letter that Kargil on the Line
of Control (LoC) in Kashmir has underscored the centrality of the
Kashmir dispute which has always been recognized as the root cause
of tension and conflict in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Kargil can not be viewed in isolation from the larger issue,
nor dissociated from the record of India's past transgressions to
alter the Line of Control to its advantage," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always respected the LoC in Kashmir, said Sharif,
adding that the G-8 should call on both sides for restoring
respect for the sanctity of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the current situation on the LoC, Sharif
called the G-8 to "support resumption of talks between India and
Pakistan for the final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 should avoid taking a narrow view of the situation
which could encourage India to justify its escalation and
belligerence, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The G-8 must, instead, adopt a constructive and
solution-oriented approach that would contribute to preserving and
promoting the cause of peace and stability in South Asia," the
prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Pakistan will send Ambassador Munir
Akram as the special emissary to the G-8 Summit in Cologne to
brief the G-8 leaders on the latest situation in the Kashmir area.

<HEADLINE> French FM Says KFOR Sectors Can Be Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Friday that the five sectors of the Kosovo
Peacekeeping Force (KFOR) can be reshuffled so that Russia can be
integrated into the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to exclude anything which concerns detailed and
exact organization (of KFOR), in terms of both the plan of methods
and the plan of geography," he told the press.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States have been seeking an agreement on
the way of letting Russian troops participate in KFOR for a third
day of talks in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the military and technical arrangement will be
solved as soon as possible, in the respect of one very simple
principle: There is only one security policy for the whole of
Kosovo under the control of KFOR," said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted a senior French diplomat as saying
that Russian and U.S. officials are now focusing their talks on
the question of geographical sectors to be put under the control
of different nations.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that NATO countries do not want to let
Russians in charge of the security of the civilian population of
one whole sector.
</P>
<P>
The present five security sectors are separately under the
control of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

<HEADLINE> China Topples South Korea at Asia Basketball Superleague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Asian Games champions China met
no serious challenge as they powered past South Korea All-Star 100-
80 in the second match of the Hong Kong leg at the Asia Basketball
Superleague (ABSL) here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese All-Star side, which consists of national squads
players, was largely in control with fast attacks and delicate
shots from all angles, leading all the way to finish the first
half 58-28.
</P>
<P>
China then got relaxed in the second half and encountered stiff
charge from tenacious Koreans, conceding 22 points after the third
quarter at 74-56.
</P>
<P>
After many substitutions in the final quarter, China again
found their rhythm and never gave any chances to their opponents,
wrapping up the match with an advantage of 20 points.
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, China's head coach Jiang Xingquan appeared
unsatisfied with the performance of his side.
</P>
<P>
"In my eyes my team can score only 70 points in this match,"
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense is not so solid that we allowed South Korea's
Carlos Williams 36 points."
</P>
<P>
China's defense was caught up in the match against Japan here
on Thursday when Demetrius Alexander, the 2.05-meter-tall center,
scored 39 points.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other match, Hong Kong Regal held off Japan All-
Star 89-75.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ROK-based LG Electronics Establishes Tianjin Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- LG Electronics from the Republic
of Korea and north China's Tianjin Municipality have announced
plans to jointly establish a comprehensive household appliance
production base in the coastal city.
</P>
<P>
LG (Tianjin) Company Chairman Jim Sohn announced the agreement
earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Sohn said the agreement calls for total investments of 240
million U.S. dollars by the end of next year. The base, set to be
the largest of its kind in north China, will mainly manufacture
air conditioners and compressors, microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners
and related spare parts. The Chinese partner will hold a 20
percent share of the venture.
</P>
<P>
LG Electronics (Tianjin) has witnessed rapid growth since its
establishment in August 1995, with last year's business volume
approaching three billion yuan (361 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company currently produces one million microwave ovens
annually, with annual exports standing at 700,000 units and
projections calling for its output to rise to 1.5 million units in
the near future. Its air conditioner output has grown by 100
percent annually since 1996, with last year's output standing at
300,000 units. The company expects to produce 500,000 air
conditioners, 240,000 compressors and three million motors during

<HEADLINE> Thailand's First Bankruptcy Court Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Central Bankruptcy Court of
Thailand, the first of its kind in the country, opened here Friday
with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai presiding over the inauguration
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Chuan said the opening of the
court, with 69 judges and 85 court officials, represented a step
ahead of the development of Thailand's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
The court's main task would be focused on trials and rulings of
sensitive cases affecting the country's economic and social
conditions in the macro-level, which would also ensure the public
of legal justice, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Decisions of the 60 judges will help rehabilitate and revive
large-scaled firms, as well as support recovering process in the
Thai economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said that the newly-established court
will help restore confidence in the Thai economy among investors
and enhance foreign investment projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government-sponsored court is empowered to trial and rule
bankruptcy cases of both individuals and firms, with at least one
million baht (27,027 U.S. dollars) fund involved each for the
former and at least two million baht (54,054 dollars) for the
latter.
</P>
<P>
It can also issue orders with attached evidences before a
litigation begins and to administer deposition outside the court.
</P>
<P>
An appeal can be made directly to the Supreme Court against a
court ruling without having to go first through the Court of
Appeal as in normal civil proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Central Bankruptcy Court, the
country's fourth special court along with Labor Court, Revenue Tax
Court and Intellectual Property Court, followed the enactment of
Thailand's Bankruptcy Law passed in April.

<HEADLINE> G-7 to Fund Ukrainian Atom Craft Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 18 (Xinhua)--Against what the German host has
expected, its partners at the Group of Seven (G-7) summit have
been ready to financially aid the two Ukrainian atom craft plants,
said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a television interview in Cologne while attending
the Summit, Schroeder said, "I will be engaged in looking for a
resolution without atom craft."
</P>
<P>
The two plants are due to use the last active reactors in
Chernobyl, where a catastrophe occurred in 1986. German government
has long been skeptical about the security of the plants, and has
planned to cancel the financial aid.
</P>
<P>
"At last it will depend on the decision of the Ukrainian
President Leonid Kutschma," stressed Schroeder, adding that he
would discuss the issue with Kutschma at the German-Ukrainian
government consultation in early July.
</P>
<P>
The West will approve an ultimate closure of the reactors, but
what compromise G-7 leaders will achieve is a question to be
answered later in Cologne, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same afternoon, the Bonn parliament approved German
ruling coalition's bill to cancel the credit for Ukraine, a
decision expected to put Schroeder and his cabinet under pressure.
The credit was a promise by Germany's former cabinet under Helmut
Kohl.

<HEADLINE> Chen Zuo'er Addresses HKSAR Basic Law Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Differing views concerning the
Basic Law of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region HKSAR are
quite understandable due to the different legal systems in inland
areas and the region, according to Chen Zuo'er, deputy-director of
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen stressed that there can be only one correct
understanding based on the basic law and reality in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the comments today during a seminar sponsored by
Beijing University's Research Center on Laws for Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan, and the Research Association for Chinese Law at Hong
Kong's Shue Yan College.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin had pointed out that maintaining the
authority of the Basic Law will maintain the dignity of the
Chinese legal system, according to Chen. The Basic Law, a national
law and an important part of the legal system in the HKSAR, are
above all other laws in the region, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong some
two years ago and the Central Government has strictly adhered to
the Basic Law, with its effort winning credibility and applause
from both the Hong Kong and the international communities,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
He said the HKSAR government, led by Tung Chee Hwa, has
weathered the severe challenges resulting from the Asian financial
crisis and various other events under the guidance of the Basic
Law. The success proves that Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong
is workable and that the Basic Law guarantees the region's
prosperity and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 experts attended the seminar and discussed wide-ranging
issues, including the relationship between Central Government and
HKSAR, the freedom and rights of Hong Kong residents, the
relationship between the Legislative Council and the HKSAR
government, and the right of abode issue.

ATHENS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Friday expressed its
dissatisfaction with the U.S. for the latter's statements
concerning the support by Athens to the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK).
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Thursday's statements by U.S. State Department
spokesman James Foley, who said that Washington had reports on the
training of the PKK in Greece, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister
Yiannos Kranidiotis said that the Greek government was irked by
Foley's such statements.
</P>
<P>
Greece did not accept insinuations, when they did not reflect
reality, nor recommendations, at a time when efforts were being
made to fight terrorism, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis said that Greece had made great efforts to combat
terrorism and had the political will to continue in this
direction.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was Greece which had proposed a
multinational agreement for the purpose of combating terrorism in
the Balkan region.
</P>

Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas also said at a press
briefing that Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou might raise
the issue when he meets with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on the sidelines of an extraordinary meeting of NATO

<HEADLINE> Indian Caretaker Prime Minister Visits Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee is set to leave for a two-day visit to
Bangladesh Saturday, during which he will discuss with his
counterpart Sheikh Hasina relations between the two neighbors,
mainly on trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the much fanfare trip to Pakistan last February when he
took a bus to Wagah on the Indian-Pakistan border, Vajpayee will
fly to Dhaka this time and, along with Hasina, receive the two-way
buses from Calcutta, the biggest city in east India.
</P>
<P>
While Indian and Pakistan have been engaged in a fierce
conflict in Kashmir, which began less than three month after
Vajpayee's bus trip to Lahore, New Delhi wants to show to the
world that its "neighborhood first" policy is not wrong in
principle.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said that talks between Vajpayee and
Hasina would focus more on trade and commerce than the recent
developments in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka has clearly indicated that it would maintain a neutral
stand on the conflict between India and Pakistan while urging the
two countries to take measures to defuse tension along the
so-called line of control.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has also offered to play some sort of a mediatory
role to fine a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kargil sector
of Kashmir, but India has maintained that Pakistan committed an
aggression and the onus was on Islamabad to vacate the occupied
areas.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that "wide canvas" of growing ties, from
economic links to a clampdown on terrorists operating from
Bangladesh, had made the trip possible.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are reportedly working to achieve a
breakthrough agreement allowing the passage of goods through
Bangladesh to India's northeast area.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two pilots were killed and another
injured on Thursday night when two Mig-21 warplanes collided and
crashed in the central Czech Republic, the military said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two planes collided on the way back to their base in the
central part of the country after finishing their training courses,
Peter Fajl, spokesman for the Czech Air Force, told reporters.
</P>

Rescuers found two pilots dead on the crash site and another,
who baled out of his plane, slightly injured.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australian High Court Landmark Ruling Throws Court System into Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canberra, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian High Court's
landmark decision on Thursday, which wiped out the system of
cross-vesting between federal and state and territory courts,
throws the country's court system into turmoil, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The High Court, by a vote of 6-1, ruled unconstitutional the
cross-vesting arrangements that have allowed state corporations
and family law cases to be heard in the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
Cross-vesting, first introduced in 1988, was designed to end
the inconvenience and cost of cases that could fall within some or
all Australia's nine legal jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
It also forms the basis of Australia's uniform corporations
law, of many family law arrangements and underpins other
cooperative laws.
</P>
<P>
The decision will prevent the Federal Court hearing
corporations cases and stop the federally-based Family Court
dealing with property disputes and custody of children of de facto
couples, forcing the state supreme courts to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the Federal Court faces the biggest impact,
losing thousands of business cases, from bankruptcies to creditors
suing company directors, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams acknowledged many cases
which were previously dealt with in one court could now be heard
in separate courts simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Professor Bob Baxt, a leading corporate lawyer and former head
of the Trade Practices Commission, described the High Court's
ruling as "a lawyer's dream and a business person's nightmare."
</P>
<P>
The substantial body of expertise in the corporations law built
up by judges on the Federal Court would now have to be replicated
in the state supreme courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is likely to lead to delays as the workload of
the Federal Court shifts to overstretched state systems, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The real losers in the ruling were the Australian people, they
said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a decision causes significant disruption in the affairs
of many people and creates uncertainty for the future which is
highly detrimental for the whole community," said Jan Wade,
attorney-general of the Victoria state.
</P>
<P>
"It will cost people lots of money," he said. "It will cost
people extra in litigation and they will have to go to two courts
instead of one," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will also put in doubt an unknown number of past
decisions of the federal courts dating back to 1988 when the
cross-vesting scheme began, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They warned that there are a lot of aggrieved people who have
lost in the Federal Court and might now challenge.
</P>
<P>
Another principal concern is the impact on family-related cases
and litigants with minimal resources to recommence proceedings in
another court.
</P>
<P>
"In the Family Court, many litigants may now face the prospect
of running proceedings in two superior courts simultaneously,"
said Fabian Dixon, president of the Law Council of Australia.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it would be hard to explain to his unmarried
clients why the Family Court cold still deal with their custody
argument but their property disputes would now have to go to a
state court.
</P>
<P>
"You've really just got to say everything we do is governed by
the constitution, and they say what's that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with this scenario, the state governments now are forced
to urgently bring forward legislation to retrospectively validate
the rulings by the federal courts since 1988, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams said the commonwealth
and states would act quickly to minimize any adverse consequences
from the High Court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to allay business and community concerns over the
decision, he said that the commonwealth and state governments
would move quickly to devise a long-term alternative to the
cross-vesting laws.
</P>
<P>
Draft legislation had been prepared which, when enacted by the
states, would ensure that any affected decisions of the Federal
and Family Courts would continue to have effect and could be
enforced as if they were decisions of a state court, sources of
local government said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would also enable cases before federal courts
to be transferred to a state supreme court, they said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their expectations, the sources said this could be
done in the near future and with a minimum of disruption to
litigants.

<HEADLINE> Indian Prime Minister Writes To U.S. President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee has written a letter to U.S. President Bill
Clinton, apprising him of New Delhi's perception and views on the
conflict situation in Kargil of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said at a special
briefing here Friday that the letter was in response to the recent
telephonic conversation Clinton had with Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
It was handed over to U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy
Berger in Geneva by Vajpayee's Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra,
who was reportedly on a secret mission in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Mishra's meeting with Berger was said to have gone off
"extremely well", during which he briefed the latter on India's
views on "how the Kargil crisis was triggered by Pakistan and on
the on-going military operations in the area."
</P>
<P>
Officials here said Mishra was in Geneva for consultations with
western powers ahead of the G-8 summit, which would discuss the
escalating tension between Indian and Pakistan amid rising anxiety
in the international community over a nuclear flash-point in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials claimed that Clinton had expressed his support
to New Delhi's stand on the on-going conflict with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held a 20-minute talk with Pakistan Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif through telephone last Tuesday following his
10-minute call with Vajpayee a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
In his talk with Sharif, according to a White House spokesman,
"the president basically indicated that he did not see how
progress could be made on this issue (the conflict in Kashmir)
until those forces are withdrawn".
</P>
<P>
India took this as a major diplomatic boost for it, asserting
that its position on the current conflict had been recognized by
the United States and Clinton was in fact asking Pakistan to pull
back its forces from where Indian claimed as its territory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese Embassy in New Delhi issued a statement
Thursday night saying that while Japan did not have "sufficient
means to verify whether the militants which have infiltrated to
the Indian side are backed by the Pakistan regular forces", it
asked India and Pakistan to respect the line of control in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statement, the External Affairs Ministry
spokesman said today that the Indian government was in touch with
Japan and trying to clear any lack in perception on the Kargil
issue.

<HEADLINE> Japan Beats Hong Kong in Olympic Football Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Seeded Japan conceded one goal,
and the only in four matches, in the dying seconds in a match here
on Friday against Hong Kong but still won 4-1 to top the Asian
Group Six football qualifiers for the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Japan now maintained a perfect record of four straight wins in
the group, which also features Malaysia, Nepal and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In another match earlier Friday, Malaysia trounced the
Philippines 6-1 thanks to two goals each from forwards Muhammad
Khalid bin Jamlus and Akmal Rizal Ahmad Rakhli.
</P>
<P>
Japan entered the game aggressively when they led 2-0 in just
14 minutes by goals from Shunsuke Nakamura and Shinji Ono.
</P>
<P>
Japan missed a penalty in the 17th minute when Hong Kong's
keeper Chan Ka Ki saved the spot kick from Atsushi Yanagisawa.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the brilliant save, Hong Kong tried hard to
launch counter-attacks but failed to create real chances in front
of a solid Japanese defense.
</P>
<P>
A header from Kota Yoshihara in the 44th minute built up a 3-0
half-time lead for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan almost made it 4-0 when Yoshihara found himself clear at
the edge of the box in the 54th minute but shot just went wide.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the local fans, the Hong Kong team fought
desperately for a goal in the second half but their loose defense
allowed another goal from Japan substitute Yoshiteru Yamashita in
the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Another fine save by the Hong Kong keeper in the 87th minute
denied a shot from Nakamura at the near post, and substitute Poon
Man Chun finally found the net in the injury time to give Hong
Kong a long-awaited consolation goal.
</P>
<P>
Japan's French coach Philippe Troussier, who led the South
Africa side to last year's World Cup finals in France, said he was
happy with the result and praised the players for their individual
performance.
</P>
<P>
Despite the goal conceded in the injury time and the missed
penalty, the coach said he was satisfied because it is important
that the team won and chalked up three points.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects even better performance when the team return
to Tokyo next week for the second round matches.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, who lost to Japan 4-0 two days ago, were too strong
for the Philippines and they scored three goals in each half to
chalk up their first win.
</P>
<P>
Philippine substitute Richmond Braga gave his team a face-
saving goal two minutes into the second half.

<HEADLINE> Pak Army Denies Seizing Indian Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani military spokesman
Friday strongly denied an impression created by "a section of the
international media" that the Pakistani army had seized strategic
posts atop high mountain peaks across the Line of Control (LoC) in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Inter-Services Public Relation (ISPR)
said those media repeatedly misquoted Brigadier Rashid Qureshi,
ISPR Director General, to create the wrong impression.
</P>
<P>
Trying to make the facts clear, the ISPR spokesman
re-emphasized that the Pakistani army has neither captured nor
occupied any Indian post.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the Pakistani army is continuing to hold its
positions and defending strategic heights on the LoC, which the
Indians are "trying to capture by aggression".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the activities of the Kashmiri "Freedom Fighters"
in India-administered Kashmir, the spokesman stated that the
Mujahideen (holy war fighters) combat Indian occupation forces
everywhere in the Indian-held part of Kashmir, "probably in the
Kargil-Drass area as well".
</P>
<P>
"The Indians are cunningly linking the activity of the
Mujahideen with that of the Pakistani army and on this pretext
attacking Pakistani positions on the LoC," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any impression given by the media contrary to these facts is
totally untrue," the spokesman concluded.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges G-8 Leaders to Play Role to Resolve Pak-India Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has called on the leaders of G-8 to "play a positive role
individually and collectively" to resolve the Pak-India crisis and
avert a conflict.
</P>
<P>
This was the main message contained in a letter which Sharif
wrote Thursday to the G-8 leaders on the eve of the Cologne
Summit, Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf said at a press
briefing Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said in his letter that Kargil on the Line
of Control (LoC) in Kashmir has underscored the centrality of the
Kashmir dispute which has always been recognized as the root cause
of tension and conflict in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Kargil can not be viewed in isolation from the larger issue,
nor dissociated from the record of India's past transgressions to
alter the Line of Control to its advantage," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always respected the LoC in Kashmir, said Sharif,
adding that the G-8 should call on both sides for restoring
respect for the sanctity of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the current situation on the LoC, Sharif
called the G-8 to "support resumption of talks between India and
Pakistan for the final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 should avoid taking a narrow view of the situation
which could encourage India to justify its escalation and
belligerence, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The G-8 must, instead, adopt a constructive and
solution-oriented approach that would contribute to preserving and
promoting the cause of peace and stability in South Asia," the
prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Pakistan will send Munir Akram,
Pakistan's ambassador to Geneva, as the special emissary to the
G-8 Summit in Cologne to brief the G-8 leaders on the latest
situation in the Kashmir area.

<HEADLINE> Legislation Promotes Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Six laws and numerous
environmental regulations enacted over the past 20 years have
greatly enhanced China's efforts to tackle pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based Procuratorial Daily recently reported that the
laws were designed to protect the ocean environment and both
prevent and control air, water, solid wastes and noise pollution.
The revised Criminal Law, enacted in 1997, contains an specific
article on environmental and resource protection.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine related regulations issued by the State Council,
China's highest lawmaking body, have been supplemented by 970
rules adopted by central and local environmental protection
departments.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) has
significantly enhanced law enforcement over the past year and has
organized fact-finding tours to 11 provinces and municipalities,
according to SEPA Director Xie Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
However, SEPA's most recent Bulletin on Environmental
Conditions in China shows that the country continues to face
serious environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that the 11th Meeting of signatories to the Montreal
Protocol on Ozone Layer Depletion Substances will be held in
Beijing in late November and early December this year.

<HEADLINE> Group of Eight Summit Overshadowed by West-Russia Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cologne, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries are gathering here on Friday to discuss
world political and economic issues at their annual meeting
currently in the shadow of a row between the West and Russia over
Kosovo peacekeeping affairs.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French
President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, US President Bill Clinton,
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, will also meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who
is expected to come here at the final day of the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are mainly focusing on international financial
topics and Balkan situation. However, the so-called Group of Eight
Summit is being overshadowed by the NATO-Russia wrangles over
Russia's role in the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The German government has assumed that by the time the summit
starts, the NATO-Russia dispute will have been resolved. But the
talks between Washington and Moscow in Helsinki on integrating
Russian forces into the Kosovo peacekeeping force broke off on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
And all-night talks between Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and his US counterpart, William Cohen, failed to resolve
the Russia's demand that it be given its own zone in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But, Yeltsin said in Moscow he hoped a deal could be finalized
when he meets with Clinton on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the western countries have to consider how
to rebuild the Balkan region after the conflict between the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Now they have agreed on a
stability pact on Balkan's future and need to put forward an
action plan for reconstruction of the region.
</P>
<P>
At present, Kosovo reconstruction will be the priority for G-8
countries.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and European Commission, the European Union (EU)
's executive branch, are being jointly responsible for
coordinating the Kosovo reconstruction issue and the aid to
neighboring countries of Yugoslavia, EU sources said.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also focus on the issues of international
financial architecture, debt relief initiatives for poor countries,
world economic coordination as well as the financing of Ukraine
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said the G-8 talks on Saturday will deal with
other crisis such as Kashimir conflict. And current world economic
situation and protectionism in world trade will also be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other possible topics will be the environment,
health issues, the "millennium bug" computer problem, and
educational issues under the slogan "lifelong learning in the 21st
Century".
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the summit is unlikely to tackle
any other substantial issues except debt relief for 41 poorest and
most heavily-indebted countries.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Warns Malaysian Of Attempts By Foreigners To Weaken UMNO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad Friday reminded Malaysians of attempts by foreign powers
to weaken and destroy the United Malays National Organization
(UMNO), the Barisan Nasional (BN) and the government by supporting
and helping the opposition pact.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who is UMNO president, said the foreign powers were
very happy at the eagerness of the opposition parties and their
affiliates to weaken UMNO, the ruling BN coalition and the
government.
</P>
<P>
He said this in his speech themed "National Dignity UMNO's
Responsibility" when opening UMNO's 53rd general assembly at the
Putra World Trade Center here.
</P>
<P>
Although the foreign powers were least interested in Islam,
this did not stop them from praising and supporting PAS, which was
said to be an Islamic party, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said: "Maybe, they too know that actually PAS is not
as Islamic as it claims."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the foreigners treated UMNO as the stumbling
block because they were aware of UMNO's strength which formed the
backbone of the government and Malaysia's firmness.
</P>
<P>
He said only UMNO's destruction would fulfill their desire.
</P>
<P>
"They are aware without a formidable UMNO, Barisan Nasional
will not be stable and strong. Therefore, they will support
whatever actions by anyone, and they will continue to work alone
to weaken or destroy UMNO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning names, Mahathir said their plan to install
their puppet as UMNO leader and prime minister failed and that
they could no longer control the country through their puppet.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said foreign critics claimed that he blamed
foreigners with all sorts of things to divert domestic problems
that he was facing.
</P>
<P>
He asked: "But are my accusations baseless? Is it not true
that the foreign media are deliberately tarnishing our image?"
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the foreign media carried no good report on the
country and made no mention of Malaysia's finer points of being a
peaceful and stable multi-racial country and developing rapidly
compared to other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that not once were the successes of Malaysia's New
Economic Policy and in privatizing corporations recognized, let
alone be given positive comments.
</P>
<P>
Also not given due recognition by the foreign media were the
fact that the attacks on the country's currency and stock market
did not permanently damage the economy and that the government
managed to bring about economic recovery through its own ways, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In turn, they tried to curb our economic recovery, lowering
our ratings so that we cannot obtain credit. They also tried to
threaten our political stability by deliberately encouraging
demonstrators to riot to topple the government through violence,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the foreigners branded him a dictator only
because he refused to bow to them.
</P>
<P>
"The real dictator is supported by them if he subscribes to
their wishes or buy arms from them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the accusations he had thrown against foreigners were
not to cover up internal problems, "but because they actually
threaten and worsen our economy and the country's image."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he did not have to divert the people's
attention to the activities of foreigners due to domestic
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it crosses the mind that the foreigners and their
media's hatred towards Malaysia stems from Malaysia being a
country coincidentally ruled by a party comprising Muslims," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said what was fueling their hatred was that UMNO, being a
credible, disciplined and well-organized Muslim party, was able to
administer and develop the country.
</P>
<P>
"Many among them are of the opinion that Muslims cannot
possibly succeed, more so when their skin color is brown.
Obviously they cannot administer a country until it can progress
rapidly and modernize," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that to avoid recolonization by foreign powers,
Malaysians must realize that their independence and freedom could
be lost within a short period.
</P>
<P>
"When independence is lost, it is not easily restored," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians should recognize this reality if they valued their
independence and wish to maintain their ability to determine their
destiny.
</P>
<P>
He said although direct colonization by any nation on another
country was unacceptable today, it did not mean that the desire to
colonize has vanished from the culture of the colonialist,
particularly ethnic Europeans.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM Flies to Yugoslavia on Rescue Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer flew to Belgrade to press for their release of
two Australians jailed for spying.
</P>
<P>
Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, who worked as aid workers in
Yugoslavia, have been jailed by Belgrade for spying for NATO
during U.S.-led NATO air strikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
Downer was expected to arrive in Belgrade Friday night
(Australian time) accompanied by Wallace's parents Ross and Judy.
He had joined the Wallaces in London after flying in from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The minister planned to spend two days in Belgrade and was
expected to meet his Yugoslav counterpart Zivadin Jovanovic and
possibly President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Downer was given no assurances or guarantees that his
visit will secure the release of Mr. Pratt and Mr. Wallace," his
spokesman said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Pratt and Wallace and their Yugoslav colleague Branko Jelen
have been in custody since March 31, when they were arrested by
the Yugoslav military on suspicion of espionage while trying to
cross into Croatia.
</P>
<P>
A Belgrade military court last month sentenced Pratt to 12
years' jail, Wallace to four years and Jelen six years after
convicting them of passing on military information.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian media, Pratt used to a soldier and spy
for the United States in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Stops Deployment of More Soldiers in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has temporarily halted the
deployment of more troops to the war-torn Sierra Leone in a bid to
create a conducive atmosphere for the peace talks currently going
on in Lome, Togo.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel Sam Tella, acting director of Defence
Information, said Thursday that the deployment of troops to
reinforce the already existing west African peacekeeping force
ECOMOG in Sierra Leone was not in the interest of the country when
peace talks are going on between the government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, "it is not possible for the military to
move soldiers outside the country without the consent of the
president and the National Assembly" as democracy is enthroned in
Nigeria, The Post Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said over 200 soldiers to be deployed to Sierra
Leone are stranded at the military wing of the Murtala Muhammed
international airport in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman described the reports as "false and
without foundation," saying they have been there in Sierra Leone
and were only going back after exhausting their welfare pass in
the country."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Sierra Leonean capital Freetown revealed that the
withdrawal of the ECOMOG troops from the country was part of the
demands for lasting peace raised by the rebel Revolutionary United
Front at the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Raises Fund for Rights Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Human Rights
Commission (NHRC) set up a special trust fund Thursday which is
aimed at assisting victims of past human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
The fund, worth 100 million naira (about 1.05 million U.S.
dollars), would also be used for the promotion and protection of
human rights in Nigeria apart from rendering financial assistance
to the victims of the past abuses, said Justice Peter Nwokedi,
chairman of the commission, in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The chairman explained that creating awareness on human rights
issues was not a task that could be accomplished within a short
time. For this reason, he added, the commission had mapped out
long-term programs to realize its objectives, The Guardian
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Nwokedi, training and sensitization for target
groups, like the lower court judges, the police and students,
prison officials, as well as the establishment of human rights
clubs, were some of the strategies the commission had adopted to
create and sustain awareness on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
Nwokedi said the commission had performed creditably in the
area of redress of complaints of violations. In 1996, it
received 41cases, treated 27 and rejected 14.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he added, 174 complaints were filed, out of which 80
were accepted and investigated, while 34 were rejected; while the
number of complaints went up to 222 with only 62 cases rejected
last year.
</P>
<P>
The chairman attributed the steady increase in the number of
complaints brought to the commission to increased awareness about
human rights and the existing mechanism for its protection.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission enjoyed excellent relationship with
credible non- governmental organizations involved in human rights
activities such as the Civil Liberties Organization,
Constitutional Rights Project, and Center for Law Enforcement
Education in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
However, Nwokedi called for an amendment of the law
establishing the commission, to grant it clearly defined powers to
enforce its decisions.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for an autonomy status for the commission, saying
like the judiciary, it should be allowed to draw its funds from
the consolidated funds, and should also be made to report directly
to the President and the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people were executed without court rules or simply
missing during the 29 years of the military governance out of
Nigeria's 39-year history after independence.
</P>
<P>
The Sani Abacha government, which ruled between November,1993
to June, 1998, was widely criticized for its culmination of human
rights abuses.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Moves to Stop Dioxin-Contaminated Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese quarantine and food
hygiene inspection authorities have taken various actions
nationwide over the past week to check the import and sales of
dioxin-contaminated food imported from four European countries.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hubei Province, authorities have sealed up
for safekeeping three batches of fodder imported from Belgium.
Local authorities have also issued an emergency notice to all
supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and retail markets, demanding
that they check all poultry, meat, eggs and milk imported from
Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, local public health officials have tightened checks on
dairy products and meat in all wholesale and retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, for instance, quarantine officers found 20 cans and
another 10 bags of Belgium-produced milk powder produced after
January 15, 1999 at a local department store, and immediately put
them into sealed storage.
</P>
<P>
The China Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Newspaper
reported this week that quarantine authorities in Guangdong
Province have found a proper way to examine whether imported
products are contaminated by dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Those actions were taken following a joint statement by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and six other
ministerial departments last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement called for the suspension of the importing
of livestock, poultry, fish, fodder, meat, eggs and dairy products
from the four countries as of June 11.
</P>
<P>
The report in the China Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine
Newspaper also said that China imported 101 tons of livestock and
poultry meat produced after January 15 in the above four countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, the Chinese media has widely reported the
ban and relevant knowledge about dioxin, a cancer-causing agent.
They have also reported on a similar ban made by numerous
countries across the world.

<HEADLINE> Warri Peace Meeting Adjourned Amid Hope of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- After two-day close-door
deliberations among Nigeria's warring ethnic groups, Warri peace
meeting has been adjourned till next week, with "substantial
progress."
</P>
<P>
No formal statement was released at the end of Thursday's
session, said The Guardian newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
But James Erhuero, the secretary to the state government,
hinted that "substantial progress has been made" in the two-day
session of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The three ethnic groups - Ijaw, Urhobo and Itsekiri were
engaged Wednesday in deliberations on the situation of the crisis
until about 12:00 p.m. local time (1100GMT). Then the meeting
reconvened by 9 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One of the delegates representing the Itsekiri at the meeting
said there was a ray of hope as "this time around, we seem to be
agreeing on the need for peace, I mean real peace." Similarly,
Chief Edwin Clark, leader of the Ijaw delegation, said "so far, so
good."
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, the vice-president,
Thursday called on warring factions in the various ethnic
conflicts in the country to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill message at a lecture to mark the 30th anniversary
of the Africa Refugee Day in Abuja, the capital, Atiku advised
Nigerians against destroying the country's endowments which would
take substantial resource and time to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government would run an equitable, caring
and responsive administration, to restore public confidence and
help repair the damage inflicted on the country by years of
military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-president, the lack of discussion, which
he described as "the hallmark of military rule," had "desecrated
and almost completely destroyed" critical national institutions,
including those that provided the country's cohesion.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our national leaders whose statesmanship credentials
were otherwise impressive were either coerced into acquiescence
or they simply maintained a studied silence for the sake of
self-preservation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Atiku explained that since the country had been spared the
calamity of a crisis from military misrule, Nigerians should
nurture the democratic values that were needed to repair the
damage done to the national psyche by the distortions of military
rule.
</P>
<P>
He called for the adoption of a democratic culture anchored on
dialog, equity, justice and tolerance, adding the culture should
encourage robust debate that would ensure the balancing of
legitimate demands.
</P>
<P>
The Warri peace meeting represents the latest effort by
Governor Ibori to realize reconciliation among the warring ethnic
groups in the southern Nigeria city and its environs. Earlier,
the governor unveiled a disarmament package offering cash and job
opportunities for the surrender of arms, which had encountered a
cool reaction from the three ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had pleaded for time to
enable his government to resolve the underlying problems behind
the Warri crisis when he visited the city last week after ethnic
clashes has claimed about 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
The Niger delta region generates nearly all of the country's
oil and above 90 percent of the nation's foreign currency
reserve, yet it finds itself struggling in deep poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wide-spread unemployment and deep poverty are blamed for the
frequent and rampant conflicts in the region, while idle youths
kidnapping oil company personnel and fighting with each other are
common place in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- This metropolis of China is
expected to be able to establish a framework of electronic
commerce (e-commerce) within this year, according to a government
official.
</P>
<P>
"As a rising international economic, financial and trade center,
Shanghai should perceive and promote e-commerce from the height of
a strategic perspective," said Fan Xiping of Shanghai Municipal
Economic and Information Office.
</P>
<P>
Electronic business activities, such as on-line ticketing,
shopping, banking and securities trading, are gaining popularity
among Shanghai enterprises and residents, Fan said.

<P>
Increasing e-commerce has accelerated the circulation of goods,
funds and information in Shanghai and the integration of Shanghai
with the world economy, he said.

As planned, Shanghai will have established an e-commerce
authorization center and an Internet payment gateway,
significantly improved its electronic economic and trade data
exchange program, among others, by the end of October this year,
Fan said.
</P>
<P>
By then, relevant standards, policies and regulations governing
e-commerce will have been basically formulated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that Shanghai plans to establish a fairly complete e-
commerce support system within the first three years of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
An engine of China's economic growth, Shanghai reported 368.8
billion yuan in gross domestic product last year, which translated
into an annual per capita GDP value of more than 3,400 US dollars.
</P>

Official figures also show that Shanghai's telephone
switchboard capacity has reached 6.2 million lines and number of
telephone subscribers 4.3 million.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak is seeking to form a broad-based government with the
support of 77 members in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament),
Israel Radio reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following his meetings with several political parties, Barak
said he will build a strong government with a large coalition.
</P>
<P>
The parties expected to join Barak's government include the
left-wing, the centrist and the religious parties.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing parties are Barak's One Israel coalition, the
biggest party in the parliament with 26 seats, and Meretz with 10
seats.
</P>
<P>
The centrist parties comprise Yisrael Ba'aliya with six Knesset
seats, which represents the interests of Russian immigrants, the
Center party with six seats and One Nation with two seats.
</P>
<P>
There are also three religious parties that may enter the
coalition government:
</P>
<P>
Shas with 17 Knesset seats, United Torah Judaism and National
Religious Party, both with five seats.
</P>
<P>
The hope of forming a broad-based government came only after
Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri quitted his political leadership
early this week.
</P>
<P>
Since Deri was sentenced to four years in jail last month on
conviction of bribery and fraud, Barak has said he could not bring
Shas into the government if Deri continued to be the party leader.
</P>
<P>
Following Deri's resignation, Barak held tense meetings with
the political parties over forming the new government, which
began on Thursday night and lasted until Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Sources in One Israel coalition told Israel Radio on Friday
that Barak will talk about the coalition agreements with the
concerned parties on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the sources said that Barak wants to make sure before Shas
enters the government that Deri will be in fact not involved in
the political affairs of the party.

<P>
KUNMING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve,
in southwest China's Yunnan Province, has been engaged in
developing environment-friendly industries in an effort to protect
environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna, a place populated mainly with ethnic minorities,
is known for its beautiful scenery and abundant natural resources
including animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
The administration of the nature reserve has made hard efforts
to help local residents protect the resources while developing
environment-friendly industries including tourism, plantation and
animal raising.
</P>
<P>
About 300 local households of farmers have been removed to make
room for tourism projects like "Wild Elephant Valley", "Tropical
Forest Tours", "Bird Garden" and "Butterfly Garden".
</P>
<P>
Other projects include a handicraft factory, to make up
pictures with wings of butterflies, and a beverage mill to produce
medicinal alcoholic drinks with ants.
</P>
<P>
So far, local villagers have returned over 200 hectares of
farmland to forests, handed over more than 1,000 hunting guns, and
set up 36 fire-fighting teams and 70 forest fire monitoring points.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts have paid off. Currently, the nature reserve has
243,000 hectares of natural forests, compared with 198,000
hectares 20 years ago, while the number of wild elephants has
increased from 100 to 250.

<HEADLINE> China's Urban Environment Needs More Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's latest environmental
situation report said the country's urban environment is facing
great pressure from rapid urbanization, dense population and an
increasing number of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The annual report issued by the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) indicated that about 52 percent of the
rivers in Chinese cities suffered from serious pollution. And the
underground water level and quality in most cities dropped last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, although most Chinese cities improved
their air quality somewhat compared with 1997, they still suffered
from serious pollution. The situation in northern China was worse
than in the southern, and the major problems are smog and
automobile gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution index shows that Taiyuan, Beijing, Urumqi,
Lanzhou and Chongqing were the most air polluted cities in China
last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that noise pollution in Chinese cities was at a
moderate level last year, with traffic noise affecting people's
life the most.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has determined that leaded gasoline will be
banned in China by the end of the year 2000. So far, more than 20
large and medium-sized cities have banned the use of such fuel.
</P>
<P>
Last year the SEPA named another five cities - Yantai,
Rongcheng, Laizhou, Kunshan and Zhongshan - as environmental
protection model cities.
</P>
<P>
And a total of 59 cities had started to issue air quality
weekly reports by the end of last year.

<P>
JINAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese woman who hijacked a
passenger aircraft to Taiwan with her husband in 1993 has been
sentenced to seven years' imprisonment by Jinan city Intermediate
People's Court, in the capital of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Han Fengying, a 35 year old native of northeast Liaoning
Province, in collusion with her husband, Yang Mingde, hijacked a
flight from Jinan to Guangzhou on September 30 1993, armed with
two knives, a short dagger and fake explosives.
</P>
<P>
Han was sent back in July 1997 from Taiwan and was escorted to
Jinan for trial, where the original idea for the hijack first
struck the couple who were depressed about their economic
situation. Her husband is still in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Another similar case was also resolved recently in Fuzhou,
capital of southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
A man named Zou Weiqiang was recently sentenced to 15 years in
jail by Fuzhou city Intermediate People's Court for hijacking a
plane to Taiwan in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zou had sought "revenge on society" when no adequate
compensation was made after his cousin died in a car accident and
because his relationship with his wife was on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
Zou was sent back on February 9, 1999 after serving time in a
Taiwan jail for the hijack, and formally arrested by Fuzhou
prosecutors on February 15.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Slams Civil Servants' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The strike of the Zimbabwean civil
servants is unjustified as avenues for negotiations are always
open, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The strike for a 25-percent salary increase and cost of living
adjustment entered its third day Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was quoted by Friday's Herald newspaper as saying that
he was puzzled by the civil servants' decided to go on strike when
negotiations were still going on.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his government had agreed to give the
workers a five percent salary adjustment and would continue
negotiations with them on the remaining 20 percent they were
demanding.
</P>
<P>
The strikers vowed not to return to work until their demands
have been met, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, it appears completely unjustified and
they are not any different from us," Mugabe said Thursday soon
after his return from Pretoria where he was attending the
inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as South Africa's second
democratically-elected president.
</P>
<P>
Most schools in the capital city were deserted and pupils were
sent back home as most of the teachers also went on strike.

<HEADLINE> 11th Panchen Lama Worships Statue of Sakyamuni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Early this morning, more than 100
lamas at the Johkang Monastery in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, lined up to greet Erdeni Losang Qamba Lhunzhub
Qoigyijabu, the 11th Panchen Lama, who came to worship the statue
of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
This was the nine-year-old Panchen's first visit to Lhasa since
he was selected as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama on
November 29, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At about 6:00 a.m. this morning, the Panchen Lama arrived at
the monastery, about 70 kilometers from Lhasa, by car amid
deafening sounds of religious trumpets and drums.
</P>
<P>
After a series of solemn religious ceremonies, the Panchen Lama
bowed to the statue of Sakyamuni and presented a hada, a piece of
white silk used by the Tibetans to show respect, to the figure.
</P>
<P>
Then he led a scripture recitation, praying for good crop
harvests, peace and stability. The Panchen Lama also blessed
believers by touching their foreheads in the major hall of the
monastery.
</P>
<P>
A lama aged over 50 said very excitedly after being touched by
the living Buddha that the Panchen is warmly welcomed by lamas and
monks.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama was selected as the reincarnation of the
10th Panchen Lama during a lot-drawing ceremony held in front of a
statue of the Buddha Sakyamuni.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, approved the
selection and the ceremony was conducted in strict accordance with
historical conventions and religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomi Kamdalozhub, a living Buddha of the monastery,
the 11th Panchen Lama is the most talented and diligent one among
the 200 students he has taught over the past decade. He is proud
of the Panchen, said the 81-year-old living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The monastery, with a history of 1,200 years, is the most

<HEADLINE> Nigerian VP Defends Appointment Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar has defended the government's recent appointment and
retirement policies by saying that they were made after careful
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in capital Abuja Thursday,
Abubakar said that contrary to some insinuations, the decisions
taken by the government were based on clear principles and
criteria which were not only realistic but also verifiable in
Nigeria's present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Talking about appointment of service chiefs, ministerial
nominations, retirements in the military and the appointment of
permanent secretaries, the vice-president said that the government
has acted on these issues with high sense of equity and
objectivity.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar noted that after many years of misrule, people's
confidence and trust in the government has been thoroughly shaken
and government's decision are suspended as people seemed to have
been conditioned to analyze government's actions and decisions
purely from ethnic and religious angles.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the appointment of service chiefs, Abubakar said the
 unanimity of opinion within and outside the military on the need
to restore professionalism has made the government place high
premium on professional competence and seniority rather than
ethnic or religious considerations.
</P>
<P>
However, a careful analysis of service chiefs shows that
geo-political considerations were not completely jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
On ministerial nominations, the vice-president said that the
government' s first consideration was the structure of governance
and the enormity of the challenges facing the administration.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the ministerial nomination is not "another
case of finding jobs for the boys", pointing out that the
president is mindful of the difficult economic situations and
would reflect it in his actions from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president restated that the retirement of military
officials was strictly based on those that have held political
officials in the past and those whose continuous stay in the
military has become inimical to morale, discipline and
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that insinuations of ethnic and religious
considerations are not only unfounded but also extremely unfair.
</P>
<P>
On appointment of permanent secretaries, the vice president
said that a two-week intensive reorientation program was
conducted, at the end of which an objective assessment of all
participants was undertaken and used as the one factor in deciding
whom to appoint.
</P>
<P>
Other factors include the principle of ensuring that each state
has a minimum of one and a maximum of two permanent secretaries,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Sceptical of Barak's Peace Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi said Friday that he was not optimistic about the
peace promises made by Israel's Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks in reference to Barak's claims that
he would withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon within a year
and revive peace talks with Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak won the prime ministerial election on May 17, beating
incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hard-line Likud leader
whom Arab countries blame for the deadlock of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The recent pullout of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army from
Lebanese southern Christian town of Jezzine was the result of
Lebanese resistance movement, Kharrazi told reporters after
meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Early in June, the 2,500-strong militia left Jezzine it has
held for 14 years under the pressure of Lebanese guerrillas'
intensified attacks that have killed a total of 155 SLA members
and wounded 400 others around the area.
</P>
<P>
As long as the resistance continues, Israel will have to pull
out of south Lebanon unconditionally in the end, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who came here Thursday night on a two-day visit, is
the first Iranian senior official to visit Lebanon since Lahoud
took office in November last year.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kharrazi will also hold talks with Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss on regional affairs and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Lebanon improved after Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami visited Syria, a main power broker who
has deployed 30,000-strong troops in Lebanon, in May.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Urges to Fully Utilize Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has urged to fully and rationally utilize the land
resources of the country for the well-being of the people.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the call when opening the national conference on
the strategy of the implementation of the land law and its
regulation in the central city of Beira Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Friday quoted the president as saying
that the Mozambican people should take an active and creative part
in the development of the cherishable land so as to ensure food
security and peace and stability in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted that women enjoy equal rights as men in the use
and development of the land according to the new land law adopted
last year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there needs a formatted standard in
implementing the land law, which is essential to maintain social
stability and peaceful environment in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged governments of all levels to provide
farmers with convenient access to land or the use of land, and to
prevent potential clashes over the ownership or the use of land.
</P>
<P>
Since the new land law was adopted one year ago, a number of
problems emerged with some cadres occupying more land than they
deserve, leaving much land deserted.
</P>
<P>
The on-going conference on the land law is aimed at
establishing a unified strategy of its implementation.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people including cabinet ministers, provincial
governors and representatives from some non-governmental
organizations attended the meeting to be closed Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.N. Staff in Iraq Not to Work for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has officially asked
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to prevent U.N. staff working in
Iraq from dealing with "U.S. spies and saboteurs."
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
disclosed the identity of one of those spies, Staford Klari, a
United States citizen, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Klari worked in Iraq in 1991-1992 as coordinator in
the United Nations Refugees Committee headquarters, then he moved
to work in Habitat Organization at the Iraq Program Coordinator
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that in December 1998, Iraq demanded the Coordinator
Bureau to exclude Klari "as he practiced activities out of his
tasks as an international official." Aziz did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Aziz affirmed that Iraq is sure that Klari
entered its territories illegally on May 1 and left on June 5, and
held meetings with representatives of a number of U.N. agencies
working in northern Iraq, particularly the Habitat Organization.
</P>
<P>
Aziz asked the U.N. secretary-general to prevent
representatives of U.N. organizations and agencies working in
Iraq from contacting such "spies and saboteurs."
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier also asked Annan to demand that the
U.S. administration "stop sending its spies under U.N. cover."
</P>
<P>
After last December's U.S. and British bombardment of Iraq,
the Iraqi government requested the U.N. to replace U.S. and
British nationals working in U.N. agencies in Iraq with staff of
other nationalities.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cleans up Moat Around Forbidden City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese capital Beijing has
basically completed the clean-up project on the moat around the
Forbidden City, an imperial palace that is regarded as the largest
and best-preserved traditional Chinese architectural complex.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 pollution sources have been eradicated, with more
than 120,000 cubic meters of silts and garbage being cleared away
from the moat and more than 700 families relocated from around the
moat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the riverbed is also reinforced and surrounding
walls of the palace renovated to improve the environment around it,
and the renovation and afforestation work is expected to be
completed by September.
</P>
<P>
Winding 3.51 kilometers around the Forbidden City, the city
moat has a history of nearly 580 years and was designed to protect
the imperial palace and beautify the environment surrounding the
palace.
</P>
<P>
But the moat could hardly serve this beautifying function with
its water heavily polluted, river silts piling up, and garbage
widely scattered.
</P>
<P>
The project, which started in April last year, was sponsored by
the State Development Planning Commission, Beijing municipal
government and the Palace Museum.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Surplus in International Payments in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A balance sheet published today by
China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange shows that the
country's international payments continued to maintain a favorable
balance in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The current account continues to maintain a fairly big surplus
while foreign direct investment achieved steady growth, foreign
exchange reserves remained stable with some increases, and the
country's payment ability was further reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Driven by the trade surplus and foreign direct investment,
China's international reserve assets continued to increase. In
1998 China's international reserves increased 6.4 billion U.S.
dollars from the end of the previous year, of which foreign
exchange reserves grew by five billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China's foreign exchange reserve had
reached 144.9 billion U.S. dollars, according to the balance sheet.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations on International Protection of Industrial Designs Started </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) has started negotiations on adopting a new
multilateral agreement on international protection of industrial
designs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Wednesday at the diplomatic conference on the
adoption of a new Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the
International Deposit of Industrial Designs, WIPO Director-General
Kamil Idris urged negotiators to show necessary political goodwill
to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from WIPO's 171 members, meeting from June 16 to
July 6, will consider the adoption of the new act which offers
business and industry a simple and cost-effective way to obtain
protection for their industrial designs in any or all of the state
parties by making a single international deposit.
</P>
<P>
Without the multilateral system, an owner would have to file
separate applications in each of the countries in which protection
was sought.
</P>
<P>
In its current form, Idris said, the Hague Agreement is under-
utilized, despite its great potential in simplifying the procedure
to obtain protection for an industrial design in several countries.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO head said that the aim of the diplomatic conference "
is to come up with ways of improving the system of international
protection of industrial designs in order to better serve the
needs of the creators and owners of designs".

<HEADLINE> World Bank Aids China's Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has approved a
loan of 350 million U.S. dollars to China for construction of the
300-kilometer Wuhan-Changsha expressway, according the WB's
resident mission in China.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth National Highway Project is the fourth project in a
series of WB-funded operations to help China improve its highway
system between Beijing and Guangzhou, providing an important trade
link between some of the country's major cities, and integrating
remote parts of the country with major urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan-Changsha expressway is the central portion of a
larger, 2,500 kilometer Beijing-Guangzhou expressway. When
completed, it will connect the provincial capital cities of Hubei
and Hunan and will serve approximately 40 million people in its
wider area of influence.
</P>
<P>
The project will also help alleviate growing income disparities
between interior and coastal provinces through improved access to
coastal port cities and increased integration of Hunan and Hubei
into the world trading system by contributing more to China's
international trade.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan-Changsha project will cost a total of 952 million U.S.
dollars and 602 million U.S. dollars will be financed by the
Chinese government. The WB loan has a maturity of 20 years,
including a five-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> France Suggests Separation of Serbs, Albanians in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- France suggested on Friday that
Kosovo's ethnic Serbs be separated from ethnic Albanians in
different zones, rather than dividing the province into two parts.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard told the French Senate
that co-existence of ethnic Serb and ethnic Albanian communities
will be easier, if they are brought to live in separate zones.
</P>
<P>
He said that as it is the case in Macedonia, a separation of
the two ethnic communities is better than a division of the
province.
</P>
<P>
French troops joining the Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR) are
charged with guaranteeing security in northern Kosovo, home of
most of the Serbs in the province.
</P>
<P>
Richard also said that the method of withdrawal of Yugoslav
forces conforms to the commitment they have made.

<HEADLINE> WB Grants Environment, Clean Water Loans to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's Resident Mission
in China said today that the WB has granted a loan of 150 million
U.S. dollars and an International Development Association (IDA)
credit of two million U.S. dollars to provide five cities in
Sichuan Province with cleaner, safer water and a healthier
environment.
</P>
<P>
Six million low-income urban people in the cities of Chengdu,
Deyang, Leshan, Luzhou and Zigong will enjoy the benefits of this
project, WB sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Sichuan Province has been urbanizing rapidly," said Geoffrey
Read, task manager for the project. "This project aims to support
and strengthen government programs that will improve essential
urban services, to protect the environment, and to support a
framework for future service investments."
</P>
<P>
The five cities within the project area were selected by the
provincial government because of the strength in their previous
urban-environmental commitments and contributions to water and
wastewater management.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan Urban Environment Project aims to halt the
deterioration of water quality of the Minjiang, Tuojiang and
Yangtze Rivers, so that the rivers could be used as sources for
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
By the completion of the project in 2006, the water quality of
the rivers is expected to improve for both domestic and industrial
use so that they adequately service the area's growing urban
population.
</P>
<P>
The maturity of the loan is 20 years, including a five-year
grace period, while the IDA credit has a maturity of 35 years and
a 10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Under Pressure of Deflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- There are growing concerns that
Vietnam will experience a more difficult time ahead if it does not
take prompt measures to ease the mounting pressure from deflation
sparked by falling demand.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Vietnam's English business newspaper
The Saigon Times Daily on Friday, in the first five months of this
year, inflation dropped drastically from 6 percent in the
year-earlier period to 1.9 percent largely because consumer prices
fell 0.7 percent in March, 0.6 percent in April and 0.4 percent in
May.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, gross domestic product grew
a mere 4 percent, down from 8.2 percent in the same period from
1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese economic analysts attribute the slackening demand to
a decline in new investment flow and in government and public
spending.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, the country saw a
37-percent fall in foreign investment disbursements from the
year-earlier period, and state investment dropped 13 percent to
less than one-third of the year's target.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government's routine spending this year is
projected to be 3.8 percent lower than the figure last year and,
moreover, increased savings and falling incomes are expected to
further hit public spending.
</P>
<P>
The incomes of farmers, who now account for 80 percent of the
population, are expected to rise an insignificant 1 percent this
year while food prices will likely drop 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will also see plummeting prices for other agricultural
products, such as peanuts, tea, coffee and vegetables. Meanwhile,
prices of industrial goods and services are climbing faster than
agro-products.
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese producers, especially in the cement, steel,
coal, sugar, bicycle, motorcycle and auto sectors, have also seen
falling sales and increasing stockpiles, a sign that prices may
drop further.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Its Foreign Trade Firms to Improve Wood Packaging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese export companies have been
told to improve the quality and standard when using wooden boxes
for packing their export products in a special notice issued by
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
and several other Chinese ministerial departments.
</P>
<P>
An official with MOFTEC told Xinhua Friday that export
companies have been warned to carefully select wooden boxes,
crates and pallets according to new required standards. Below
standard wood must be specially treated before being used as
packaging for exports.
</P>
<P>
Local entry-exit inspection authorities and quarantine
officials should also give instructions to foreign trade companies
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the notice urged research institutes, packaging
production companies and export firms to make more efforts on new
types of packaging so as to cut costs and upgrade packaging
technology.
</P>
<P>
"The joint notice was issued so that we could guarantee exports
and avoid possible economic losses after the European Commission (
EC) announced its intention to inspect packaging, targeting
Chinese wood packaging on June 1," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Since September 1998, the United States, Canada and Britain
have all begun to implement new quarantine standards for Chinese
wooden crates. The EC's announcement which becomes effective after
June 10, is the latest development in the fight against the so
called Chinese long-horned beetle problem.
</P>
<P>
However, MOFTEC spokesman Hu Chusheng expressed China's strong
displeasure at the EC's decision on June 8, saying the EC violated
bilateral trade agreements as it did not notify nor make any
negotiations with the Chinese side prior to its announcement.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hucheng, assistant minister of MOFTEC, met with the
European Union Ambassador to China Endymion Wilkinson last Friday
to make serious representations about the EU's decision, adding
that China reserves the right to take further actions.
</P>
<P>
The EC's decision will affect some seven billion US dollars
worth of Chinese exports to Europe, according to Chinese estimates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's biodiversity is facing
threats from deforestation, exploitation of wetlands, the
shrinking of living space for wild animals and plants and
pollution, says the latest environmental situation report.
</P>
<P>
The annual report issued by the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) says that more than 1,000 species of
angiosperms, 63 species of gymnosperms and 400-plus species of
vertebrates are threatened with extinction.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the fragile ecological system, China built
12 more state-level nature reserves last year, with the total
number now reaching 136.
</P>
<P>
The State Council launched a national campaign for the
protection of the ecological environment last November, setting
objectives for the protection of natural forests, grasslands,
water and soil in the coming five decades.
</P>
<P>
The environmental report says Chinese government has also made
plans to protect white-flag dolphins, turtles and other aquatic
animals in the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
China has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the
world, with 30,000 species of higher plants, or one tenth of the
world's total, 250 species of gymnosperms, or 30 percent of the
world's total, and more than 6,000 species of vertebrates. In
addition, China has the world's widest range of different kinds of
plants and domestic animals.

for its textile industry in the coming century despite mounting
pressure from the international market, an industry official said.
</P>
<P>
"China's textile industry will continue to play a major role in
the global market in the next century," said Du Yuzhou, director
of China's State Administration of Textile Industry, at a forum on
textiles and garments held here recently.
</P>
<P>
According to Du, China has become the world's biggest producer
and exporter of textiles, with its textile exports accounting for
20 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
To maintain its superior status, China has decided to
restructure the industry and upgrade it with advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
Under a national plan, the country is to eliminate 10 million
outdated spindles and lay off 1.2 million workers, bringing all
loss-making state-owned textile enterprises out of the red by the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country dismantled 5.12 million spindles, and
laid off 660,000 textile workers, exceeding the target of cutting
redundant capacity by 4.8 million spindles and streamlining
textile employment by 600,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Musician to Organize Grand Concert in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Young Chinese musician Kong
Xiangdong plans to organize a grand concert on the world's highest
plateau this summer.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who usually lives in the United States, is now back in
China preparing for the August concert in Lhasa in the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"It will certainly not be parpular or traditional, but
extraordinary," Kong said in an interview with Xinhua, explaining
that the concert will employ high technologies.
</P>
<P>
Kong will also invite local Tibetan musicians to join the
concert. Giorgio Moroder, who enjoyed much popularity after
composing "Hand In Hand" for the 1988 Olympics, has agreed to
write the theme music for the concert.
</P>
<P>
A well known 32-year-old pianist, Kong has taken part in
several concerts popularizing Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he organized a tour of China in 1994 for the
Chinese Virtuoso Orchestra, consisting of some best overseas
Chinese musicians.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Kong took part in an evening gala of "Bravo, China!"
which was transmitted live across China through satellite reaching
more than one billion television viewers.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming concert called "Tibet Dream" is also scheduled
to be broadcast live throughout China and the rest of the world
which Kong hopes that will make people worldwide find out more
about China.
</P>
<P>
Kong became the youngest prize winner in both Moscow's 1986
Tchaikovsky International Competition and Spain's 1987 Santander
International Competition.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Conservatory of Music and the Curtis Institute in
Philadelphia trained the pianist to become winner of the grand
prize of the Gina Bachauer International Competition in 1988. In
1992, Kong scored an extraordinary triumph at the Sydney
International Competition in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Kong has established two music schools in Shanghai and Suzhou,
which are training more than 300 teenage musicians.

JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Five men accompanying Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi to South Africa for Wednesday's
presidential inauguration were denied entry into the country
Tuesday over passports, Beeld newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The five men were intercepted at Johannesburg International

The sensitive incident was being handled with great secrecy by

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Development of Western Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China should seize the opportunity
and step up efforts to develop its central and western areas,
especially the latter, President Jiang Zemin said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our major overall development strategy, which
is of great significance in promoting the nationwide reform and
construction as well as maintaining long-term national stability,"
Jiang said at a forum on the reform of state-owned enterprises in
Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"The time is ripe to accelerate the development of the central
and western areas, and from now on higher priority must be given
to that major strategic task," Jiang told the forum, which was
attended by Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo and provincial officials from
five northwest provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
It is the essence of socialism to finally achieve the goal of
common wealth by narrowing the development gap between different
parts of the country, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It is also a major issue concerning the trans-century overall
development of the country," Jiang said, adding that the central
government has put the narrowing of the east-west development gap
high on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also elaborated on the late Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping'
s strategic conception for the coordinated economic development of
the country, which gives priority to developing the eastern
coastal areas first, which then support and push the development
of the central and western areas to eventually achieve common
prosperity and wealth throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that this strategy is absolutely correct,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Western areas have wide, rolling landscapes, rich resources and
great development potential and constitute a huge potential market.
</P>
<P>
"To accelerate the development of these areas not only will
enable the rational allocation and circulation of resources but
also engender a motivational force for the development of the
national economy," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the ecological environment in western areas, Jiang
said that the deteriorating natural environment has had an
unfavorable influence on the economic and social development of
not only western areas but other areas as well.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major issue that must be tackled first of all, and
if measures are not taken immediately to improve the ecological
environment substantially, the strategy of materializing a
sustained development in western areas will achieve nothing,"
Jiang stressed.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Development of Western Areas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Most of China's minority ethnic groups live in the western and
frontier areas, so promoting economic development there is of
great significance to maintaining local political and social
stability, strengthening national unity, and securing the security
of border areas," Jiang said, adding that to achieve the purpose
will involve consistently speeding up economic growth and social
progress, which, along with common prosperity, will further
consolidate and develop the relationships between different ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
"New ideas are needed to quicken the region's development under
the socialist market economy," he suggested, adding that new
market demand changes both at home and abroad must be taken into
account in establishing the socialist market economic system and
opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts should be made to intensify macro-economic
control and work out policies that tally with the reality, he
stressed, urging relevant departments to list further development
of the western areas as a major part of the next five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
"The general principle in developing the western area is to
combine local economic and social progress with political and
social stability as well as national unity," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the central government will increase
financial support to the western areas step by step by way of
special subsidies and grants, so long as state revenues are on a
steady rise, in an attempt to persuade domestic and foreign
capital, technology and professionals to focus on the area.
</P>
<P>
Close attention should be paid to the tapping of water
resources and their efficient utilization in developing the
western areas, the Chinese leader stressed, highlighting
infrastructure projects, technical upgrading, improvement of
product mix, enterprises' performance, the problem of the layoffs
and social security systems.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the western areas is a systematic project
that needs arduous efforts to complete," Jiang concluded, calling
on local leading officials and people to make the most of their
advantages and build the western areas that enjoy economic
prosperity, social progress, a stable life, national unity, and a
beautiful environment; all within a dozen or so years into the
next century.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Boom Results in Lack of Guides in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Travel to China is so welcome that
it has resulted in a lack of professional guides and interpreters
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the National Tourism Administration said that
China has opened 909 colleges and vocational secondary schools to
train such persons since the late 1970s when the education
remained as a vacuum, but it is still not enough.
</P>
<P>
There are 233,000 students in these schools, however, more than
63 million overseas people traveled in China last year, 35 times
the figure of 1978. And more than 8.4 million Chinese traveled
overseas and more than half of Chinese traveled out of their
hometowns.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Qianhui, an official with the administration, said that
China will become the No.1 destination for international tourists
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at an international meeting on world tourism
and hotel management held here recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that to embrace the boom, China has stepped up training
more professional guides and introduced mechanisms to examine
their qualification. The country is ready to set up a special fund
for tourism education, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has established ties with 20 countries and international
organizations to jointly train professionals in the field,
according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Thai Fishermen Take Protest to FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific has
received an appeal from small-boat fishermen in southern Thailand,
protesting against nocturnal anchovy fishing by trawlers using
lights.
</P>
<P>
The FAO confirmed in a news release Friday that the Federation
of Small Scale Fisherfolk in Southern Thailand said the trawlers
using luring lights in night fishing will destroy inshore fish
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The small-boat fishermen have blocked the Songkhla Bay and
Songkhla deep-sea port for five days and they have vowed to
intensify their protest unless the government revokes the 1996
regulation allowing the luring lights practice.
</P>
<P>
The FAO regional office said luring lights attract and gear
with fine mesh sizes harvest all forms of marine organisms,
including juveniles and small fish of other economically important
species that other small-scale fisheries depend on.
</P>
<P>
The FAO agreed to cooperate with the Thai Department of
Fisheries to find solutions for the proper management of the
country's anchovy fisheries.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, a workshop will be organized to review and
describe the current knowledge on anchovy stocks in the Gulf of
Thailand, fishing practices, the current state of fisheries and
resources as well as current management practices in this aspect.

<HEADLINE> French General Optimistic About U.S.-Russia Agreement on KFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A top French army general Friday
expressed optimism that U.S. and Russia will reach an agreement on
setting up a separate zone for Russian peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of General Staff of the French Armed Forces, General
Jean-Pierre Kelche said in an interview with LCI television
channel that the key of the dispute is that Russia must accept an
unified command of the Kosovo Peacekeeping Force (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
A third day of talks between top Washington and Moscow
officials over Russia's role in KFOR opened in Helsinki Friday. U.
S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, his Russian counterpart Igor
Sergeyev, and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Kelche said that the mission of KFOR is to advance into Kosovo
at the same time as Serb forces are pulling out, in order to "
avoid a vacuum of security in which the people will suffer".
</P>
<P>
He said that the massive return of Kosovar refugees is
complicating the task of the KFOR, but NATO force does not intend
to block this ``movement of return.''
</P>
<P>
The general said that the common meeting of foreign ministers
and defense ministers of the 19 NATO countries to be held on
Friday in Brussels will decide on a clearer "rule of behavior" of
NATO troops toward the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
At present, NATO commanders ask their troops not to intervene
with the KLA unless it becomes "aggressive", said the general.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO is about to sign an agreement with KLA on its
"demilitarization", including handing over all heavy weapons,
disbanding KLA military organization so that KLA members will not
make group actions, and forbidding KLA members bear arms in
certain areas.
</P>
<P>
Kelche also said that the Serb forces are "obviously respecting
" their agreement with NATO on pulling out of Kosovo until the end.
</P>
<P>
As for the massive exodus of Serb civilians from Kosovo, he
said that it was out of question that NATO would stop them from
doing so by setting up roadblocks.

Shuping, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"These enterprises contribute especially to increasing
employment, meeting a diversified consumer demand and training
entrepreneurs," said Jing, also chairman of All-China Federation
of Industry and Commerce, at an international forum on promoting
the development of small and medium-sized enterprises which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than 10 million registered
such enterprises, accounting for 90 percent of the country's total.
They contribute 60 percent of the nation's industrial output and
40 percent of its pretax profits.
</P>
<P>
Of the 150 billion U.S. dollars or so of exports each year, 60
percent is accomplished by small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also indicated that these enterprises have
employed the majority of the more than 200 million redundant
people from the agricultural sector over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
According to Jing, as the strategic restructuring of the
economy progresses, large enterprises will become fewer but better
while small and medium-sized ones will be more vigorous and their
number will be bigger.
</P>
<P>
However, Jing pointed out, the restructuring will be a
difficult process and small and medium-sized enterprises are
facing greater challenges from an increasingly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
"They are sometimes treated unfairly by those who prefer large
enterprises," said Wu Jinglian, a senior Chinese economist, at the
forum.
</P>
<P>
To create a favorable business environment for these
enterprises, the Chinese government has taken a series of measures
since last year, such as the establishment of an innovation fund
and special bank loans but Wu has called for even further steps to
be taken.

GUANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's prospering Guangdong Province, will work together with the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest to develop the
Central Asia market.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, Guangzhou will open a shopping center of

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Thursday vowed that he would carry out a major reshuffle in his
government to get rid of corrupt officials who had let down the
country.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport
on arrival from his three-day visit to South Africa on Thursday,
where he witnessed the inauguration of Thabo Mbeki as the second
democratically- elected president of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president said he was disturbed by the level of
corruption perpetuated by people who had been entrusted with high
positions in the government, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed his concern and anger over the rampant corruption
involved in the tendering of road repairs and construction in the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Moi cited cases in the Ministry of Public Works where engineers
had approved the expenditures of 14 million shillings (around
200,000 U.S. dollars) to re-carpet a kilometer of road.
</P>
<P>
"If they can accept 14 million shillings to be spent on
re-carpeting one kilometer of road, how much shall the government
spend on construction work? " he asked.

He announced that "I will soon carry out a major reshuffle in
the government to get rid of these people who have let me down."
</P>

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan Performing Arts
Troupe of China with Vice-Chairman Qun Pei of the People's
Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region as its head concluded
its performance tour in New Zealand and left here for Australia
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During its stay in New Zealand, the troupe, composed of 40
top-notch professional artists from "the roof of the world," gave
two performances in New Zealand's biggest city of Auckland and its
capital city of Wellington and received warm welcome from New
Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
They played religious instruments used in Tibetan monasteries
and performed colorful folk songs and dances, showing the unique
culture of the beautiful snow land in China and reflecting the
life of modern Tibetan people. The performances enriched New
Zealand's understanding of the life, traditions and art of the
Tibetan people and helped enhance mutual understanding and
friendship between the Chinese and New Zealand peoples.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people watched the performance in Auckland. Many of
 them said one performance in the city was far from enough and
they asked for more shows.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the performance in Wellington, the warm applause
from the audience lasted about three minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great show. It's really fantastic and marvelous,"
Vincent Grey, who watched the show, said.
</P>
<P>
Grey and his wife made a three-week trip to Tibet last month.
He told Xinhua that the Tibetan people, as a member of the Chinese
family, are beneficiaries. During the trip, he said, he saw
clearly that the Chinese government had spent a lot of money to
help Tibet develop its economy and modernize the life of the
local people. "In Tibet, I also saw a lot of temples and many
monks (lamas). The Tibetan people are enjoying religious
freedom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Grey criticized some people in New Zealand for slandering the
Chinese government over Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"The wonderful performance of the troupe shows the Tibetan
religion and culture is well preserved and developed and their
blame is an absolute nonsense," he said.
</P>
<P>
The performances coincided with a photo and oil painting
exhibition on Tibet's past and present.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand Chen Wenzhao and Chinese
Consul-General in Auckland Wu Zuqiu gave receptions respectively
to welcome the troupe.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's current account
deficit of 894 million NZ dollars (483 million U.S. dollars) for
the
first quarter of this year was worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand, the official statistical organ of the
New
Zealand government, released figures Friday showing that the
deficit
for the year to March stood at 6.37 billion NZ dollars (3.44
billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures exceeded the expected quarterly deficit of 774
million
NZ dollars and the expected annual deficit of 6.12 billion NZ
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account measures how much New Zealand earns
overseas
compared with how much it spends.
</P>
<P>
The trend in the current account balance has been deteriorating

steadily since the second quarter of 1993, Statistics NZ said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the deterioration resulted from a worsening in
the
"invisibles" balance, which measures what New Zealand spends and
earns overseas on services such as tourism and insurance. It also
resulted from a fall in the trade surplus, which measures earnings

from exports against spending on imports.
</P>
<P>
The released figures show that the one positive in the
quarterly
result is that the inflow into the capital account is half a
billion
NZ dollars compared with 79 million NZ dollars in the first
quarter
of the previous year.

<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's giant steel corporations
are carrying out a massive drive to curb steel production in a bid
to fulfill the target of reducing the annual steel output by 10
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Capital Iron and Steel Company (CISC) and the
Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Group (SBISG), two of China's top
ten largest iron and steel producers, have achieved remarkable
success in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Administration for Metallurgical
Industry (SAMI) reveal that from January to April, CISC's actual
steel output was over 2.4 million tons, down 10.27 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
SBISG reduced steel production by 243,000 tons, or five percent,
from 1998's corresponding figure.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, stressed recently that curbing steel production is the
key for the country's economic development and is in accordance
with the current performance of the metallurgical industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important step to increase the efficiency and quality
of the sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's authorities projected that they would attempt to
control steel output to within 104 million tons this year, a
decrease of 10 percent from last year's figure.

The 46 largest steel producers, whose total steel output
accounts for more than 85 percent of the country's total, have
been urged to take the lead in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
Luo Bingsheng, CISC's general manager, said that his company
has a target to control steel output to within 7.22 million tons
this year, 800,000 tons less than last year. "We are strictly
adhering to the timetable and that target while trying to reduce
costs" he added.

<P>
SBISG is China's most advanced iron and steel corporation. It
plans to produce 16.12 million tons this year, which represents a
reduction of 9.4 percent from a year earlier, according to Xie
Qihua, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company has stepped up efforts this year in
phasing out outdated equipment and improving efficiency. "Steel
exports registered 28.8 tons in growth in the first four months
despite continuing low prices for steel products in the global
market," he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Stop White Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai is busy drafting a regulation on
stopping white pollution, a big headache caused by discarded
plastic packing materials.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Shanghai Municipal
Environmental Protection Bureau, the regulation to be promulgated
soon will contain articles banning the production and use of
plastic-foam food containers and encouraging the development of
environment-friendly substitutes.
</P>
<P>
A special organization will soon be established to coordinate
the control of white pollution.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that Shanghai, with a population of about 13
million, turns out more than 290,000 tons of waste plastic packing
materials each year.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the country produces more than six million tons of
plastic products and discards one million tons as waste every year.
</P>
<P>
Facing a serious pollution problem, China's large cities, such
as Dalian, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, have all announced a
ban on the use of plastic bags or plastic-foam food containers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Jailed for Trading Counterfeit U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese men have been given
life imprisonment by the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court
for trading counterfeit U.S. dollars and their accomplices given
heavy jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
Ren Hongxi, a Beijinger, and Zhou Rucai, a farmer from Anhui
Province, bought 19,600 U.S. dollars and 9,100 HK dollars in
counterfeit currency in August 1997 and used them to buy
commodities or in exchange for renminbi (RMB), the court revealed.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, they again bought 120,000 counterfeit U.S.
dollars in Guongdong Province but Ren was arrested in January 1998
when he was buying goods with the fake money.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Ren and Zhou be given life imprisonment
and deprived of their political rights and all their properties
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
It also ruled that Zhu Chuanxiang, Lu Liang, Wang Laisheng and
Chen Guozhong, who sold the fake money to Ren and Zhou or helped
them conceal the counterfeit notes, be jailed for 15 years, 12
years and seven years respectively, plus fines from 140,000 to 300,
000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, four farmers from Henan Province in central
China were sentenced to five years imprisonment and were fined 500,
000 yuan for selling counterfeit RMB notes.
</P>
<P>
The People's Court of Fengtai District of Beijing also
sentenced another four people to imprisonment because they traded
fake RMB.
</P>
<P>
Court sources said that between January and June this year,
courts at various levels in Beijing handled 102 cases involving
the trading, trafficking and using of fake currency. A total of
159 suspects were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Barak On Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak
has promised that he will push the Middle East peace process
forward through peaceful negotiations with all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
In an interview carried by the local newspaper Ha'aretz on
Friday, Barak said that a solution to the Israeli-Arab feud has to
encompass all the neighboring countries of Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-palestinian peace talks, he said it will not be
easy for the two sides to settle the remaining issues such as
Jerusalem, borders and settlements, which will be the hard part of
a few subjects that will come out at the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But, the two sides have to work out solutions for those issues
at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"I have told Arafat (Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority) that we will have disagreements, sometimes serious
ones, but the two of us will be on the same side of the table in
order to solve the problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he has also told Arafat the he intended to pursue
heritage of Yitzhak Rabin who signed the Oslo Accords with Arafat,
but he has no intention of carrying out a peace process in the
shadow of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism can stop the process. No one must be under any
illusion. But in my view, there is a historic opportunity here to
end a 100-year conflict. And I intend to do everything I can to
make that happen, in order to strengthen the country's security,"
Barak said.
</P>
<P>
He said he will start the "easy part in building relations with
the Palestinians" by building in the near future a road-bridge
between the Gaza Strip and Hebron, a palestinian-controlled city
in southern West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The road-bridge will be a kind of highway on pillars for 47
kilometers, with four lanes, a railway line, a water pipe and a
communication cable, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said for Israel's security, the Palestinians pose no
military threat to Israel, but the Syrians are different.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrians have 700 warplanes, 4,000 tanks, 2,500 artillery
pieces and surface-to-surface missiles that are neatly organized
and can cover the whole country (Israel) with nerve gas," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But all those problems, including the Golan Heights, can be
solved too through peace talks if the two sides realize peace is
important for them.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights was occupied by Israel in the 1967
war.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Journalist Freed in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Gunmen who kidnapped two Belgians
last Sunday released one of the victims, journalist Erick Bracke,
in Basilan Province, Mindanao, Friday, and the other victim is
expected to be freed within this week.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Mindanao said the other Belgian, Engineer Lieven
De La Marche, is being kept by another kidnap group, in Tungawan,
Zamboanga del Sur, and could be released anytime this week.
</P>
<P>
Military Spokesman Ricardo Morales told a press conference in
Zamboanga City that as of noon Friday, the released Belgian is in
the hands of authorities.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms earlier reports that the two foreigners were
separated from each other," Morales said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the kidnappers had handed over Bracke to
Moro Islamic Front (MILF) rebels, who later turned him over to
government representatives.
</P>
<P>
The released Belgian is expected to be brought to Isabela,
capital of Basilan Province, and to meet the family of De La
Marche in Zamboanga City, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
De La Marche, 39 and Bracke, 37, were abducted by three gunmen
Sunday on their way from Lantaka Hotel toward Sta. Cruz Island in
Zamboanga by boat.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government had tapped the help of the governor
of Basilan Province and the MILF in the negotiations with the
kidnappers.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Savings Bank Cuts Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Government Savings Bank of
Thailand Friday jumped on the bandwagon of cutting interest rates,
lowering deposit rates by 0.25-0.5 percentage points and lending
rates by 0.5-1 points.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said the cuts reflected the bank's tens of
billions of baht in excess deposits.
</P>
<P>
For deposits under 1 million baht (27,027 U.S. dollars),
interest rates range from 4-5 percent, with deposits above 1
million at 4-4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, for every deposit of 100 baht (2.7 dollars), the
bank is obligated to pay an annual interest of 5 baht (13.5 U.S.
cents).
</P>
<P>
If the bank is not able to extend the money to anybody, it has
to lend it in the inter-bank market which gives a yield of between
1 and 2 baht (2.7-5.4 cents).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the bank would immediately suffer a loss of 3 to 4
baht (8.1-10.8 cents) annually on each deposit of 100 baht.
</P>
<P>
It was necessary for the bank to cut its deposit rates now,
bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the cuts in the lending rates would encourage
more borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The bank intended to make additional loans totaling more than
30 billion baht (810 million dollars) this year and invest another
40 billion baht (1.08 billion dollars) in government bonds,
long-term private debentures and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in May, Banthoon Lamsam, chairman of the Thai Bankers'
Association, promised that five major banks would keep the deposit
rate at 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, two weeks later, Bangkok Bank, the country's largest
commercial bank, announced to cut its savings deposit rate to 4
percent starting from June 14. Bangkok Bank's move was followed by
other commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Thai banks are under great pressure: While they continue to pay
for depositors' funds, they cannot make any money as long as they
remain reluctant to make new loans.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Raise Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will raise fuel prices to
deal with the hiking cost of transportation of imported refined
petroleum, Energy and Water Development Minister Ben Mwila said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"New prices of fuel will be announced within the coming two
weeks or so because most of the consignments are coming by road
which is more expensive than railway transport," the Times of
Zambia newspaper Friday quoted Mwila as saying.
</P>
<P>
Due to high cost of transport, fuel prices may go up in Zambia,
the paper said, adding that some of the fuel is brought into the
country by railway but it is unreliable.
</P>
<P>
A consignment of diesel imported from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
was at the weekend held up due to a derailment in Ndola, northern
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is convinced that oil marketing
companies are hoarding diesel anticipating the impending price
hike and the Zambia National Oil Company (ZNOC) has been directed
to start inspecting the dealers, said Mwila.
</P>
<P>
"They want to make extra money once the new prices are
announced and so they are not off-loading until the day of
announcement," he said. "But branches of the ZNCO are going
through checking their operations."
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that dealers found to be hoarding the fuel
will be severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the Indeni Petroleum Refinery, which was
gutted last month, will take at least 10 months, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Indeni Petroleum Refinery is the sole refinery in the
southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Barak Confidant to Build Broad-based Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Following tense meetings with
several political parties, Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak
said on Friday morning that he will build a broad-based and strong
government.
</P>
<P>
Barak noted that he will present his government plan to the
Knesset (parliament) on time.
</P>
<P>
The One Israel party leader intensified the negotiations on
cabinet formulation in the wake of the resignation of Shas Party
leader Aryeh Deri early this week.
</P>
<P>
Since Deri was sentenced to four years in jail last month on
conviction of bribery and fraud, Barak has said he could not bring
Shas into the government if Deri continued to be the party leader.
</P>
<P>
Deri's resignation paved the way for building a broad-based
government, which Barak has pledged after his victory in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
The intensified meetings between Barak and the leaders of the
parties which are expected to join the new government began on
Thursday night and lasted until Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Barak discussed separately with Shas
ministers Eli Yishai and Eli Suissa, Meretz leader Yossi Sarid,
Yisrael Ba'aliya leader Natan Sharansky and National Religious
Party leader Yitzhak Levy over the forming of the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Following the meetings, it appeared that the major obstacles to
the building of a majority government would be solved within days.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz party, which got 10 seats in the
120-member Knesset, had warned that it would not sit in a
coalition government with Shas if Deri remains to be its leader.
</P>
<P>
It also had asked for a cooling-period of months to see if Deri
really quitted from his political role in the party.
</P>
<P>
But Sarid told reporters Friday morning that it will become
clear in the coming days whether Deri has really quitted the party
leadership, a signal that Meretz relaxed its stance over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dispute arose over which party should control the
Interior Ministry as it became likely that Shas, whose Eli Suissa
was the outgoing Interior Minister, would join the government.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which became the third-largest party in the Knesset by
winning 17 seats, said it should remain in control of this
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
But Sharansky, whose party represents the interests of Russian
immigrants, has accused Shas of blocking the immigration from
Russia and wanted to be the new interior minister himself.
</P>
<P>
He threatened to walk out of the coalition should Shas be
offered the ministry again.
</P>
<P>
Senior sources in the Labor-led One Israel coalition believe
that a compromise could be reached between Shas and Yisrael
Ba'aliya over the issue.
</P>
<P>
They said that as long as Shas does not hold on to the Interior
Ministry, Sharansky will agree to give it up and take the Housing
Ministry instead.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Barak will continue the coalition talks
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
But they added Barak does not intend to present his government
to the Knesset in the coming week. Rather, he plans to complete
its formulation in the week between June 27 and July 1, one week
before his legal deadline.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The forestry and water
conservancy bureau in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, has given a reward of 10,000 yuan to a local farmer who
reported unlawful and shoddy construction work on a river project
to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The award has been made to encourage such good behavior and
increase people's awareness of a correct sense of justice.
</P>
<P>
Shen Bohu worked on building embankments on the local
Qiantangjiang River and discovered that the contractors were using
clay instead of concrete for the work, resulting in as much as 174,
000 yuan of economic losses to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Shen wrote letters to relevant local government organizations
and news media outlining the scam and his accusations proved to be
true after investigation.
</P>
<P>
The case involving 10 suspects has been put on file for further
inquiries and eventual prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
Since November last year remedial work has been carried out on
the project, which is now up to the standards required.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Adopts Cotton Cultivation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cotton Development Board (CDB)
of Bangladesh has worked out a program to put 61,600 hectares of
land under cotton the country during the current season with a
production target of 141,850 bales of cotton.
</P>
<P>
The land suitable for cotton cultivation in this South Asian
country has been divided into nine zones and detailed tasks have
already been assigned to the respective zones, The Bangladesh
Observer newspaper Friday quoted CDB sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998-99 fiscal year, a total of 62,000 hectares of
land was under cotton in the country, with a production of 140,000
bales, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, they added that due to devastating flood and
unfavorable weather the target was not achieved as cotton
cultivation in the country mostly depended on the climatic
condition.
</P>
<P>
At present, cotton is one of the chief cash crops in
southwestern districts where more than 70 percent of cotton
growers face no problem to sell their products at a fare price,
they stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the CDB has also taken up a program to set up five
certified seed plots to produce improved seeds.
</P>
<P>
Cotton cultivation is gaining popularity in these areas as
cotton ensures good returns for the farmers because the
cultivation cost of cotton per hectare of land is between 7,500
taka (155 U.S. dollars) and 8,000 taka (about 165 dollars). The
production of one hectare can fetch between 37,000 taka (about 763
dollars) and 38,000 taka (about 784 dollars), the CDB sources
added.

SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Maritime Safety
Administration, the first of its kind in China's coastal areas,

It will supervise the management of navigation marks, the

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Seeks for Help to Put Off Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan ruling group,
Taliban, Friday renewed appeal for immediate international
assistance to extinguish a forest fire in northeastern Afghanistan
which has been raging for the last five days.
</P>
<P>
The fire in the mountainous Kunar province, which broke out
last Sunday, has engulfed trees over hundreds of hectares and 10
villages and is rapidly approaching towards Pakistan's border town
of Chitral, Taliban's chief representative to Islamabad Maulvi
Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We have no resources to deal with the fire and make urgent
appeal to the world community for help," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban have no planes to use them for
extinguishing the fire and offered Afghanistan's all air bases for
foreign planes to help.
</P>
<P>
"The fire fighters have failed to deal with the huge fire," he
said, noting that 500 to 600 people have been fighting the fire
for five days but in vain.
</P>
<P>
According to Haqqani, he contacted the United Nations, the
Organization of Islamic Conference and Pakistan for help, however,
so far there was no response.
</P>
<P>
Letters have also been sent to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan for urgent assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fire is advancing rapidly through Dara Pech valley, some 30
kilometers south of the provincial capital Asadabad.
</P>
<P>
Local people have been asked to try to contain the fire by
felling trees and digging trenches around the burning trees.

<HEADLINE> World's Auto Giants Targeting Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Leading automobile manufacturers
the world over have rushed to the ongoing six-day Shanghai
International Automotive Industry Show, which opened on June 15,
with their newest models to tap the potential of the huge Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 automotive and part manufacturers from 22
countries and regions, including General Motors, Ford, Daimler
Chrysler, Citroen, Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen, can be found at
the show.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany, Italy and the United States have sent official
exhibition teams to the exposition.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen is showing off a diesel sedan that costs no more
than three liters of diesel per hundred kilometers, the first of
its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Citroen is giving show-goers a preview of a new sedan model
with one of the most advanced intelligentized gearboxes, that has
not been used on any other Citroen models.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai subsidiary of Volkswagen, one of the largest car
makers in China, is displaying the Passat B5 model which has won
top ratings from some leading auto magazines and is due to go into
production early next year.
</P>
<P>
Show organizers say this auto show is the biggest ever held in
China and it represents surging interest of auto and part
manufacturers worldwide in potential Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
China's auto manufacturers produce more than 1.62 million
vehicles a year, but the industry only makes up one percent of the
country's gross domestic product, leaving huge room for growth.

JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's beach volleyball
players will set out on a European tour with their eyes firmly
fixed on Sydney Olympics, The Indonesian Observer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Comprising two pairs, the Indonesia's team will compete in
eight series starting in Moscow on June 25.
</P>
<P>
Team coach Denis Taroreh said the preparations have been under
way from a few months ago and the athletes were said to be in good
form for this world series.
</P>
<P>
"We will be attempting to take points in each of the eight
series in order that we are able to reach one of the 32 places at
the Olympic Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hosting countries for the world series include Russia,
Norway, Italy, France, Austria, Portugal, Belgium and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian team comprises Agus Salim/Irilkhun Sofana and
Iwan Sumoyo/Anjas Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has decided against sending a female team because
they failed at the Bangkok Asian Games last year. Their male
compatriots managed to reach the finals.

<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military confirmed
Friday that one of the two Belgian nationals was released by
Muslim kidnappers in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Local SNN television quoted military officials as reporting
that Eric Bracke, a Belgian journalist, was freed Friday morning

<HEADLINE> Beijing Ready to Combat Possible Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials in the Chinese capital
said that they have got everything ready to stand up to possible
floods this year.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said that although located in a dry area in
north China, Beijing is expected to witness extremely heavy rains
this summer. They have predicted floods in the Yongding River
which runs through Beijing and landslides in suburb mountainous
areas.
</P>
<P>
Before 1949, the Yongding River, one of the four major rivers
in a state anti-flood list, had flooded Beijing five times.
</P>
<P>
China has reported possible big floods along the Yellow River
this year following devastating floods in the Yangtze last year
that killed 4,100 people.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has set up 94 anti-flood
offices in downtown and suburbs, and sent officials to inspect
dykes and water control facilities in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Satellite ground stations have been added near two major
reservoirs to receive meteorological information, government
sources said, adding that the city has also prepared four million
sandbags, 5,000 emergency vehicles, 245 boats and 7,500 life vests,
among other rescue materials.
</P>
<P>
Police, telecommunications, railway and highway departments
have all finished their preparatory work, sources said.

JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak met with the
resentatives of the religious Shas Party on Thursday night as part
of his effort to form a broad-based coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was made possible by Tuesday's resignation of Aryeh
Deri as Shas political leader. Shas reportedly wants to remain in
the control of the Interior Ministry if it joins the government.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Ehud Barak announced in an interview with Haaretz this week
that he intends to build in the near future a road-bridge between
Beit Hanoun, on the border of the Gaza Strip, and Dura, in the
Hebron area.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to affirm that this would strengthen a putative
Palestinian state, or even officially link its two main regions,
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The military wing of Hamas, the radical Palestinian
resistence force, had allegedly planned to kill Israelis by
putting poisons in drinking water. The plan was thwarted after the
military wing leader Adal Avadalla was killed last September by
Israeli security forces.

SAN JOSE -- Latin American countries will meet with the
European Union (EU) in July to discuss issues related to the
banana market, Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Samuel Guzowski
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Latin American banana exporting countries
will analyze and discuss with European commissioner Leon Brittan,
who is in charge of agriculture, the new European import rules,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States are Costa Rica's main banana
importers. Latin American fruit exports, however, were seriously
affected in the aftermath of formidable flood disasters and
hurricane "Mitch" that struck the region last year. The EU's
restriction on Latin America's banana exports did little to help
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The price rules imposed by the EU on bananas from Latin
American countries were questioned by the United States and
received a favorable ruling from the World Trade Organization (WTO)

BANGKOK -- The Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, Thailand's largest

exclude farm products from sweeping reductions in import tariffs
to take effect in January next year, the group said in a report

</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry decided on the exclusion to give local
farmers more time to prepare for greater competition from abroad,
as well as to avert farmer protests on the politically-sensitive

costs for local manufacturers using imported materials, delaying
the cuts will not only protect Thai farmers from competition, but
also the country's agri-business.

LOS ANGELES -- PC shipments in the Asia- Pacific region,
excluding Japan, has recorded the highest quarterly shipment ever,
a U.S. market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They totaled 2.95 million units in the first quarter of this
year, or a 25 percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Market gains were supported by the continuing growth in key
countries and regions such as China, Australia, India as well as
Taiwan, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, IDC added, the market turned strong in the first
quarter for the facts that currency values have remained stable in
the region for the past two quarters, and regional stock markets
have been producing strong gains since the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It now appears certain that the regional market's recovery is
well underway," said IDC, which increased its regional forecast in
1999 to 12.9 million unit shipments for more than 23 percent
annual growth.
</P>
<P>
IBM, Compaq, Legend, Samsung and Hewlett-Packard were the top
five PC makers in the regional market in the first quarter. (

<HEADLINE> Experts: Asia Must Improve Social Protection Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The social impact of the two-year
old Asian financial crisis is likely to persist for some time, and
Asian economies must improve social protection systems to reduce
poverty, experts said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting reports to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) meeting
on social impact of the crisis, experts said that the social
impact is very grave and will persist for some time although the
crisis-hit economies are starting to show signs of revival.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, which broke out in July 1997, rapidly led to marked
contractions in gross domestic product (GDP) in the affected
economies like Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and
South Korea, said James Knowles and Mary Racelis, both
international consultants, in their overview paper at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said that GDP shrinkages in 1998 ranged from nearly 14
percent in Indonesia to 0.5 percent in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"In turn, these economic recessions have had numerous
unfortunate social consequences," the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the massive currency devaluation, inflation was up
by 58 percent in 1998 in Indonesia and 90 percent in Laos, they
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that unemployment rates increased in all crisis-hit
economies, with the largest increase recorded in South Korea from
2.3 percent to 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Decreases in real earnings, mostly due to inflation rather than
to declines in nominal wages, have also occurred in all these
economies, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Although there are increasing signs that the worst of the
financial crisis is over and the crisis-hit economies are getting
on the road to recovery, the social impacts continue to unfold,
they said.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial crisis provided a unique opportunity to
learn how existing social systems function under duress," the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the crisis has revealed that considerable
efforts need to be directed to the further development of social
safety nets throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Amara Pongsapich and Peter Brimble, experts from Thailand, said
that although the Thai government has made great efforts to
improve social safety nets, access to social services remains
critical at lower levels of the population.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that local communities and institutions be
involved in implementing policies to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Emphasis should be placed initially on maintaining access, and
then increasingly on improving quality once universal access to
basic health, education and social service is achieved," the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Other delegates also put forward proposals for strengthening
social protection systems in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also discussed the social impact of the crisis in
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea and
Laos.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference focused on devising policy responses to
the crisis and identifying measures that would improve social
safety nets in the region.
</P>
<P>
Policymakers from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the
Philippines, South Korea and Laos and other delegates from
non-governmental organizations as well as international
organizations attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Names Caretaker Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has appointed Ismudjoko as a caretaker attorney general, replacing
Andi M. Ghalib who has been under an investigation following an
allegation that he received bribes from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Ismudjoko was deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree which appoints Ismudjoko was conveyed
by State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi to Ismudjoko at the
Attorney General Office here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Habibie said Feisal Tanjung, coordinating minister
for political and security affairs and a retired Army general,
would take over as attorney general after Ghalib temporarily
stepped down on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habibie's choice of Feisal to fill the post of attorney general
prompted sharp criticism, particularly from lawyers who said
Feisal's appointment ran contrary to the spirit of the law and the
professionalism of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Habibie suspended Ghalib after the independent Indonesian
Corruption Watch (ICW) alleged Ghalib had some 13 billion rupiah
(1.7 million U.S. dollars) in Lippo Bank's branch in South
Jakarta. ICW also alleged some of the money was deposited by
businessmen who were being investigated by the attorney general
for violating banking laws.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib, a lieutenant general in the Army, has returned to his
military duties since being suspended. He faces an investigation
by the military police over the bribery allegations.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Trade with Iraq Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's trade with Iraq rose
by over 600 million Rupees (8.6 million U.S. dollars) from 1997 to
1998 due to tea exports under a United Nations approved
oil-for-food program, the official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Trade Minister Kingsley T. Wickremeratne was quoted
as saying that Sri Lankan tea exports will be the main subject of
discussion with Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Medhi Saleh and his
delegation who are currently in Sri Lanka to discuss ways to boost
trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government trade delegation arrived here Wednesday
for a five-day visit to promote bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Among other matters that will be discussed are joint ventures
and the establishment of scientific and technical cooperation, the
minister told the paper Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is one of the leading tea consuming nations and prior to
the UN sanctions Iraq used to buy about 40 million kilograms of
tea annually, of which 60-70 percent came from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is keen on increasing tea exports to Iraq as the tea
industry was affected by the Russian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Coir Exporters Hard Hit By Shipping Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's coir exporters have
been hard hit by shipping lines which have more than doubled
freight charges to the United States, industry sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Coir exporters which were enjoying a rate of 1700 U.S. dollars
per forty-foot equivalent units (FEU) last year have been called
upon to pay between 3500 and 4000 dollars per FEU, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They said the rate offered is exclusive of various other
charges such as the Suez Canal surcharge and the peak-season
surcharge.
</P>
<P>
At discussions earlier this year the Coir Fiber Exporters
Association, which had sought a preferential freight rate, was
prepared for a reasonable increase by the shipping lines. They
expected around a 200 dollar increase.
</P>
<P>
However, the current offer suggests an increase of about 2000
dollars which the exporters find impossible to agree with.
</P>
<P>
These high rates had virtually driven Sri Lanka out of the
United States coir market as the Sri Lankan exports are now
uncompetitive, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market accounts for about 40 percent of Sri Lanka's
coir fiber exports.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Sri Lanka's raw fiber exports amounted to about 80,000
tons with the bulk of the exports being mattress fiber and fiber
dust, earning 600 million rupees (8.6 million dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
Until last year Sri Lanka had been a strong and competitive
supplier but exporters now say that the freight rates are forcing
them out of contention.

<HEADLINE> Farm Products Excluded From Thailand's Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group,
Thailand's largest agro-industry conglomerate, welcomed the
government's decision to exclude farm products from sweeping
reductions in import tariffs to take effect in January next year,
the group said in a report available Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry decided on the exclusion to give local
farmers more time to prepare for greater competition from abroad,
as well as to avert farmer protests on the politically-sensitive
issue of tariff reform.
</P>
<P>
CP Group said although tariff reform will reduce production
costs for local manufacturers using imported materials, delaying
the cuts will not only protect Thai farmers from competition, but
also the country's agri-business.
</P>
<P>
The last major tariff restructuring in 1995 also excluded farm
products. The Finance Ministry earlier this year considered
including agricultural products in the coming round, but backed
off in the face of protests from farming groups and producers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new structure, tariffs on industrial raw materials
will be cut to 0-3 percent, primary goods 5 percent, intermediate
goods 7 percent and finished goods 15 percent. Industrial tariffs
currently range up to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on farm products are high by comparison, with livestock
on 35 percent, raw meat 45 percent, processed meat 50 percent and
eggs 28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lowering import tariffs to cut production costs is one of
several new measures planned by the government to stimulate the
economy.

<HEADLINE> Peru Uses Sterile Flies to Combat Plague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Peru's health authorities released
some 600 million sterile flies in the past seven months in an
attempt to end an on-going plague of fruit flies, which are also
known as blue flies or Mediterranean flies.
</P>
<P>
These fruit flies are a threat and harmful to the growth of
fruit trees in Tacua province, which is an important base for
fruit production in Peru.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, technicians from the National Service of
Agrarian Health (Senasa) have been using the new method to
annihilate the pest. The method involves using beta radiation to
irradiate millions of male flies, and then releasing them from a
light aircraft into the air over the fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
Senasa's technicians say that although these irradiated male
flies can mate with female flies, the females will not lay eggs.
The number of flies has since been greatly reduced in the region.
The technicians believe all the flies will be eliminated
completely by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Asian PC Shipments Set Record in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- PC shipments in the Asia-
Pacific region, excluding Japan, has recorded the highest
quarterly shipment ever, a U.S. market research firm International
Data Corporation (IDC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They totaled 2.95 million units in the first quarter of this
year, or a 25 percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Market gains were supported by the continuing growth in key
countries and regions such as China, Australia, India as well as
Taiwan, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, IDC added, the market turned strong in the first
quarter for the facts that currency values have remained stable in
the region for the past two quarters, and regional stock markets
have been producing strong gains since the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It now appears certain that the regional market's recovery is
well underway," said IDC, which increased its regional forecast in
1999 to 12.9 million unit shipments for more than 23 percent
annual growth.
</P>
<P>
IBM, Compaq, Legend, Samsung and Hewlett-Packard were the top
five PC makers in the regional market in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, IDC said that despite positive growth rates in markets
that endured harsh economic conditions in 1998, most of these
markets are still not back up to pre-crisis shipment levels.
</P>
<P>
"China played an integral role in supporting the region's
growth as its market expanded," IDC said. Amounting to more than 1
million PC shipments in the first quarter, or a 22 percent
increase over the same period of last year, China's PC market is
now representing 35 percent of the total, and is more than twice
the size of that of Australia's.

<HEADLINE> Internet Users in North America Continue to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of Internet users
in North America has now reached 92 million, and the commercial
growth of the Web is emerging as a dominant trend in the
development of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to an April 1999 study released Thursday by two U.S.
organizations that have conducted demographic and e-commerce
studies of the Internet since 1995, the number of Internet users
aged 16 and older in the United States and Canada increased 16
percent in just nine months, and the number of on-line consumers
jumped 40 percent to 28 million during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the adoption of the Internet by consumers is,
for the first time, being driven by women, as the number of female
consumers on-line jumped 80 percent in nine months, and passed the
10-million mark.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on interviews with 7,200 people, was conducted
by CommerceNet, a Silicon Valley-based grouping of e-commerce, and
Nielsen Media Research, the leading provider of television
audience measurement and related services in the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"More than two of every five people in North America are now
Internet users, and the Web is becoming an integral part of daily
life," said a report based on the study. "With more than 30
percent of users being Internet consumers, we're seeing a tidal
wave of e-commerce in North America."
</P>
<P>
The study found that the proportion of women among on-line
buyers increased nine percentage points, from 29 percent to 38
percent since last summer. Now women are active buyers in all the
major product categories, such as books, CDs/videos, computer
hardware and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Of today's 92 million Internet users in North America, 46
percent are women, and 41 percent of today's 55 million Internet
shoppers are women. Of the 28 million people who have made
purchases via the web, 9 million people made purchases once a
month, and 1 million people made purchases at least once a week.

JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Rowing Association(
PODSI) hopes to make a clean sweep of eight golds at the 20th
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam in August, The
Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
PODSI chairman Achmad Sucipto said that the rowers held a great
chance to win at the Games after they earned three golds and one
silver in the pre-Olympics qualifying round in Singapore last week.
</P>
<P>
PODSI also sent its 50 traditional boat racers to compete in
the international dragon boat championships in Taipei on the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Achmad said the competition would allow Indonesia to observe
other SEA Games participating countries. He named Myanmar,
Thailand and the Philippines as tough contenders in the biennial
event.
</P>
<P>
"Our rowers must supervise their contenders' strength during
the championships. They also must be able to evaluate their skills
because the Jatiluhur dam (in West Java) is not a proper place to
train for the traditional boat race," Achmad said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, National Sports Council (KONI) training director
Imron Z.S. said that KONI would held its second physical test in
the third and fourth week this month to examine the progress of
the athletes' condition.
</P>
<P>
He said the physical test results, the lab test results and
training program reports would be used to evaluate athletes
performance before the Games.

JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Three top men's tennis players
have declined to join the Indonesia national selection, which is
part of the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games preparation, The
Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles Andrian Raturandang and men's doubles specialists
Bonit Wiryawan and Sulistyo Wibowo turned down offers from the
Indonesian Tennis Association (Pelti) to compete in the selection
from June 23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the three athletes are not allowed to join
the national squad for the biennial event, which will take place
in Brunei Darussalam, from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Pelti spokesman Benny Mailili said Andrian was too busy with
tight international competition schedules including the 15,000 U.S.
dollars satellite tournament in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bonit and Sulistyo did not give a reason for withdrawal in the
singles event tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they feel incapable to compete in the four-day singles
events. We have no problem on their refusal because tennis is an
individual sport and we don't want to force them," Benny said.
</P>
<P>
Benny, who is also Pelti's deputy secretary-general, said the
trio were among 10 players invited to the selection. Seven other
players had confirmed joining the selection process.
</P>
<P>
They will be divided into two groups and will compete in the
round-robin system. Winners and runners-up of both groups will
team up for the Games.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Benny said the same selection will take
place from July 1 to 3.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Gyaincain Norbu was confirmed the
11th Panchen Erdeni on November 29, 1995, during a lot-drawing
ceremony held in front of statue of the Buddha Sakyamuni in Lhasa'
s Jokhang Monastery.
</P>
<P>
The State Council approved the selection and the ceremony was
conducted in strict accordance with religious rules and historic
practices.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu, which means "sacred victorious banner" in the
Tibetan language, was born into an ordinary Tibetan family in
Lhari County in the Tibet Autonomous Region on February 13, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu's parents, both of whom completed primary
school, held firm to their belief in their son's future fate.
</P>
<P>
According to one story, a teacher of the young Panchen's mother
once discovered the first letter of the Tibetan alphabet on his
tongue. Many Tibetans have since held to the belief that the boy
is a reincarnation of the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
A group of Buddhist lamas conducted an extensive investigation
and concluded that Gyaincain Norbu was indeed a candidate to
become the reincarnated soul boy of the 10th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
The group visited the young boy's home and quickly recognized
his fondness for religious articles. Members of the group were
quite surprised when the young boy said he knew who they were.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls For World Action Against Infectious Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Infectious diseases are still
big killers for the human being, the World Health Organization (
WHO) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One in every two deaths in developing countries is caused by an
infectious disease, WHO said in a report entitled Removing
Obstacles To Healthy Development.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that in 1998, the six diseases of AIDS, malaria,
tuberculosis(TB), measles, diarrhoeal diseases and acute
respiratory infections such as pneumonia accounted for nearly 90
percent of all deaths among those under 44 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The WHO calls for the world's governments, decision makers and
the private sector to take action against infectious diseases
before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
The action includes increased financial support for control,
surveillance and research activities; adoption of WHO-recommended
health policies by all countries; and the involvement of other
government sectors -- besides the health sector-- in the
prevention and control of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The organization said the control of theses diseases have
become increasingly difficult because of the drug-resistance, the
emergence of new diseases and increased international travel.
</P>
<P>
"If these trends continue and our level of response remains the
same, our ability to stop their international spread might soon
disappear," said David Heymann, WHO executive Director in charge
of communicable diseases, in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges NATO to Ensure Safety of All Ethnic Groups in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government Thursday
urged NATO peace-keeping forces (KFOR) in Kosovo to implement the
U.N. Security Council resolution regarding the safety of all
Kosovo residents, the official news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
It also asked Serbs and Montenegrins there not to leave their
homeland where they have lived for generations.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government noted that it has thoroughly carried
out the U.N. resolution on Kosovo, Tanjug added.
</P>
<P>
The government urged NATO forces in Kosovo to shoulder the
responsibility of protecting all ethnic communities, especially
Serbs and Montenegrins whose security is threatened by the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
On the same day, NATO peace mission spokesman Robin Clifford
announced that his forces have disarmed 160 KLA members, affirming
that "we view any action by the KLA or any paramilitary groups as
entirely unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
He urged all ethnic groups in Kosovo not to leave their
homeland, asking them to report by telephone to the KFOR any
illegal actions.

<HEADLINE> Novel Program Helps Chinese Youngsters Avoid AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- An instructor encourages a shy
college student to blow up a condom like balloon to get familiar
with this common contraceptive device.
</P>
<P>
The game, as part of a teaching program on campuses of Beijing
and Shanghai to help university students learn knowledge about
AIDS, is novel and effective for stimulating the interest of
students, even though it is sometimes embarrassing, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the traditional methods of conducting sex education
programs through lectures and leaflets, the new approach involves
greater interaction between students and instructors, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Junior medical students are employed to educate their
university peers, most of whom are freshmen having no clear ideas
about sex, about AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases and
safe sex.
</P>
<P>
Around 400,000 Chinese are estimated to carry the HIV virus,
which causes AIDS, and the figure will climb to 10 million by 2010
around the country if no effective measures are taken. Those aged
between 16 and 29 account for 65.5 percent of China's HIV carriers.
</P>
<P>
The program was jointly conducted last year by Australia's
Royal Women's Hospital, Beijing Medical University and Shanghai
Second Medical University, involving 17,000 students at eight
universities and 4,000 other residents in Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Instead of simply giving lectures and handing out written
materials, instructors play games, do exercises and tell stories
to groups of 20 to 30 students.
</P>
<P>
The program will be carried out this year at another eight
universities in the two cities, the report said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Leader to Meet Indonesian Major Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stanley Fischer is expected to
arrive here on Friday afternoon for talks with the Indonesian
government as well as with leaders of major political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency on Friday, Fischer will pay a
call on President B.J. Habibie and hold a meeting with
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita.
</P>
<P>
Fischer will hold marathon talks with leaders of the five
political parties that collected most of the votes in the tally of
provisional returns of the recent general election.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted a source at the IMF representative office in
Jakarta as saying that Megawati Soekarnoputri of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) will be the first political
party leader to meet Fischer. His talks with Megawati has been
scheduled for Saturday morning, the source said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Fischer will meet Secretary General of the
National Mandate Party (PAN) Faisal Basri representing PAN general
chairman Amien Rais who is in Saudi Arabia to conduct "umroh"
(minor haj pilgrimage).
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, the IMF official will separately meet with
Abdurrahman Wahid, one of the founders of the National Awakening
Party, ruling Golkar Party general chairman Akbar Tanjung and
general chairman of the United Development Party Hamzah Haz.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an economic forum in Hong Kong recently, Fischer
said the IMF is ready to work with whoever wins Indonesia's
election to help nurse the country's crippled economy back to
health.
</P>
<P>
He said that the likely winners of Indonesia's election were
all committed to adhering to the IMF tutelage.
</P>
<P>
"We work with policies and not people and we'll work with any
Indonesian government that is willing to continue the program," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IMF's director for the Asia and Pacific region
Hubert Neiss said here Thursday that IMF was not opposed to a
fixed rate for the rupiah but thought it could be considered
later.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reported intention of the PDI-P to have a
fixed rate of exchange for the rupiah if it governed the country,
Neiss said: "We do not reject it but would be willing to discuss
it as a measure to be considered later."
</P>
<P>
At present, the priority is economic recovery, namely improving
the banking sector, debt restructuring and implementing social
safety net programs, Neiss added.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, Neiss is scheduled to hold a series of
meetings with leaders of several major parties, including
Megawati, during his visit here.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Parliament Okays Sending Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Affairs Committee of
the Finnish Parliament approved in the form of memorandum on
Thursday a government report on sending Finnish troops to Kosovo,
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The government must seek advice from the parliament before it
proceeds to deploy forces in Kosovo to keep peace there, the
memorandum pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Finland's relevant law stipulates that the country could
participate in peacekeeping missions only under authorization by
the United Nations and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, all the political parties in the parliament
discussed and debated the report.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Center Party held that to carry out tasks such
as forcing the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) to lay down arms did
not conform with the spirit of the country's peacekeeping law.
</P>
<P>
But all the parties ultimately agreed on Finland's
participation in the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said that monitoring the
implementation of the agreement on solving the Kosovo crisis and
limited use of force in Kosovo did not go against Finnish law,
because the mission had been authorized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Jan-Erik Enestam told the legislators that
Finland would send 800 troops, which had received special training
for international peacekeeping operations and would be deployed in
five to six weeks after the Finnish president makes his final
decision on the basis of the governmental report.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also stipulates that the troops can resort to
limited use of force for self-defense.

CHENGDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the

agencies in southwest China's Sichuan Province to increase their
support for the province's small and medium-sized enterprises,
according to a senior bank official.

Small and medium-sized enterprises play an important role in
the economy of the inland province, and therefore the World Bank
and the IFC will establish special agencies that provide financing

</P>
<P>
The IFC is considering providing investment capital for a
Sichuan financial intermediary agency which will extend loans to
small and medium-sized enterprises, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Latin America to Meet EU Over Banana Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries will
meet with the European Union (EU) in July to discuss issues
related to the banana market, Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister
Samuel Guzowski said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Latin American banana exporting countries
will analyze and discuss with European commissioner Leon Brittan,
who is in charge of agriculture, the new European import rules,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States are Costa Rica's main banana
importers. Latin American fruit exports, however, were seriously
affected in the aftermath of formidable flood disasters and
hurricane "Mitch" that struck the region last year. The EU's
restriction on Latin America's banana exports did little to help
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The price rules imposed by the EU on bananas from Latin
American countries were questioned by the United States and
received a favorable ruling from the World Trade Organization (WTO)
.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruled in April that the EU's banana import program,
which provided preferential policies to former British and French
colonies, including those in the Caribbean, violated trade laws
and would have to change.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has forced the EU to check its banana rules and
propose alternatives to the producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the EU have been engaged in the banana
dispute for at least a decade. The U.S. claims EU rules
discriminate against Central America, where U.S. corporate giants
such as Chiquita Brands International Inc. operate.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean accounts for 10 percent of the world's banana
trade. Much of the remaining 90 percent is dominated by Latin
America's so-called "dollar banana" producers. Under the mechanism
in effect so far, Costa Rica provides about one quarter of the
bananas on the EU market.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Starts to Devalue Currency to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay's Central Bank (BCP)
acquired some five million U.S. dollars on Thursday, leading to a
quick slide of the country's currency, guarani, against the dollar,
said reports from Asuncion, capital of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Financial sources there said the dollar rose from 3,000 to
settle at 3,050 guaranis in retail purchase on the local exchange
market as the BCP decided on a gradual devaluation of the guarani
and proposed a halt of imports from Brazil to cushion the impact
from the devaluation of Brazil's currency, real.
</P>
<P>
Since the devaluation of the real in January, Paraguay's
exports, largely destined to Brazil, have fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay and Brazil are both member countries of the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur), together with Argentina and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Following a Mercosur summit that closed in Asuncion on Tuesday,
Paraguayan Minister of Industry and Trade Guillermo Caballero
Vargas said the government would strive to minimize the damage to

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of people over 16 in
the United States and Canada using the Internet has climbed to 92
million, according to a new survey released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study by Nielsen Media Research and CommerceNet also shows
dramatic increases in the number of women who made at least a
single purchase using the Internet, rising 80 percent over nine
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The most popular items for women to buy on the Web were books,
CDs and videos with 9.6 million purchases of those items taken
together. But in a twist, the number of women buying computers
over the Internet climbed fastest at 160 percent to 1.3 million
during the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
Men also bought mostly books, CDs and videos but also bought
far more computers -- 4.1 million -- than women.
</P>
<P>
Among both men and women, online purchases of software remained
flat.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on interviews with more than 7,200 people in
North America, said 54 percent of people on the Internet are men
-- although men still represent a slightly higher proportion, 62
percent, of all online buyers.
</P>
<P>
The same study last August showed 79 million people over 16 on
the Internet in North America _ with 43 percent of them women. The
study in September 1997 counted 58 million, also with 43 percent
women.
</P>
<P>
The latest study also said 72 million people use the Internet
from home, while 46 million use it from work and 28 million from
school. The rest use it from other locations, such as a library or
a friend's home.
</P>
<P>
Nielsen and CommerceNet said the results of its latest study
were statistically representative of North America's population of
225 million people over the age 16.

<HEADLINE> Tauziat Enters Top Four at Eastbourne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Nathalie Tauziat joined
Anna Kournikova, Amanda Coetzer and Natasha Zvereva in the semi-
finals of the Eastbourne International Challenge women's tennis
grass court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat, Wimbledon runner-up last year, rallied from a poor
start to beat Elena Likhovtseva 0-6, 6-2, 6-1 for a place in the
top four.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova booked her place in the last four with a 6-3, 7-6
win over Nathalie Dechy, Zvereva demolished Anne Kremer 6-0, 6-1
and Coetzer beat compatriot Mariaan De Swardt 7-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova was in irrepressible form as she pounded
groundstrokes past France's Dechy to the delight of her rooftop
fan club which has expanded to an adjacent house overlooking the
gates of Devonshire Park.
</P>
<P>
Dechy visibly relaxed after losing the opening set. She raised
the level of her game but Kournikova stayed a step ahead to reach
the last four.
</P>
<P>
The Russian is yet to lose a match at Eastbourne. She has won
the under-21 tournament twice and last year beat Steffi Graf to
reach the semifinals before withdrawing with an injured thumb-- an
injury which kept her out of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"I came here knowing I could do well," Kournikova said
afterwards. "I really like playing on grass.
</P>

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Use Golden Goal for First Time at Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Women's World Cup Soccer
Championship, opening in New York Saturday, will see the use of
the Golden Goal for the first time in the competition.
</P>
<P>
The regulations state that in the case of a match in the knock-
out rounds ending in a draw after 90 minutes, a period of 30
minutes (15 minutes each way) will be played. However, as soon as
a team scores a goal it will immediately win the match.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Goal was experimented with in FIFA's youth
competitions before being introduced for the first time in a major
senior competition at Euro 96 in England and at the Olympics the
same year.
</P>
<P>
Notable Golden Goals include Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu's dramatic
winner against Brazil in the semifinals of the 1996 Olympic
tournament and Laurent Blanc's close-range volley against Paraguay
that saw hosts France through to the quarter-finals of the World
Cup last year.

<HEADLINE> Australia Prefers No Delay for East Timor's Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia prefers to see a
U.N.-organized vote in East Timor go ahead as scheduled,
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We would very much like to see the ballot go ahead on August
8," Downer told reporters near the end of two days of meetings
with U.S. officials here.
</P>
<P>
Pushing back the vote two or three weeks "would be a big
deal," Downer said. But Australia would be opposed to a more
substantial delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, exiled East Timorese resistance leader
Jose Ramos-Horta said he expected the August 8 vote to be
delayed because of widespread violence in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official in New York also said a short delay appeared
increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming ballot is to determine whether East Timor's
400,000 voters want wide-ranging autonomy under continued
Indonesian rule or would prefer to move toward independence.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations scheduled the August 8 vote in East Timor
after Portugal and Indonesia concluded sixteen years of sporadic
negotiations in early May.

<HEADLINE> Italian Banks Ready For Y2K, Says Bank of Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The Italian banks are sufficiently
prepared to deal with the Millennium bug of computers if it
strikes their software and systems, the Bank of Italy, the
country's central bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Italy's deputy general manager, Antonio
Finocchiaro, said Thursday on the national conference of Y2K that
by next month 90 percent of the Italian banks would have completed
the basic adaptation procedures.
</P>
<P>
"The level of preparation of the financial and banking system
can be deemed satisfactory," he said.
</P>
<P>
By September the 99 percent of preparatory procedures would be
completed, he added, on the basis of 876 questionnaires from
commercial banks collected by the central credit institute.
</P>
<P>
Finocchiaro noted that the last few months of the year should
be used by banks to prepare emergency procedures so as to be ready
if the conversions implemented already should prove inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Of the over 700 billion lire (about 378 million U.S. dollars)
which Italian banks plan to spend averting the risk of a meltdown
on January 1 2000, they have so far paid out 348 billion lire,
with 309 billion lire coming from their own coffers.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 502 Million Dollars to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday a total of 502 million U.S. dollars in loans and credit
for China to finance the construction of the 300-kilometer
Wuhan-Changsha expressway and the protection of environment in
five cities in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The money is composed of a loan amounting to 350 million
dollars for the Fourth National Highway Project, and a loan of 150
million dollars and a credit of 2 million dollars for the Sichuan
Urban Environment Project.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth National Highway Project is the fourth project in a
series of the World Bank funded operations to help China improve
its highway system between Beijing and Guangzhou, providing an
important trade link between some of the country's major cities,
and integrating remote parts of the country with major urban
areas, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan-Changsha expressway is the central portion of a
larger, 2,500 kilometer Beijing-Guangzhou expressway. When
completed, it will connect the capital cities of Hubei and Hunan
and will serve approximately 40 million people in its wider area
of influence.
</P>
<P>
The overall project cost is 952 million dollars of which 602
million dollars will be provided by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The five cities which will benefit from the Sichuan Urban
Environment Project are Chengdu, Deyang, Leshan, Luzhou, and
Zigong.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to halt the deterioration of water quality of
the Min, Tuo, and Yangtze Rivers, so that the rivers could be used
as sources for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
By the completion of the project in 2006, the water quality of
the rivers is expected to improve for both domestic and industrial
use so that they adequately service the area's growing urban
population.
</P>
<P>
The two loans are at the bank's standard interest rate for
LIBOR-based U.S. dollar single-currency loans, with a maturity of
20 years, including a 5-year grace period. The 2-million-dollar
credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the bank's concessionary lending arm, on
standard IDA terms with 35 years' maturity and a 10-year grace
period.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Improve Urban Transport in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday a loan of 150 million U.S. dollars to assist the
Brazilian state of Bahia in improving the quality of public urban
transport in the Salvador metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
The Salvador Urban Transport Project aims to enhance the
development of a fully integrated urban transport system, under
the coordination of a regional transport coordination commission,
the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The project also will transfer the ownership and management of
the Salvador subdivision of the Brazilian Urban Transport Company
system from the federal government to the State of Bahia and
Municipality of Salvador.
</P>
<P>
The project will finance infrastructure and equipment necessary
to build a rail-based system under a Built-Operate-Transfer type
project, fully operated by the private sector, in the justified
corridors, and ensuring its integration with buses, ferryboats,
and non-motorized transport.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 308 million dollars. The
bank's loan is on standard terms for its single currency,
LIBOR-based loans and is payable in 15 years, including a grace
period of 5 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Ships, Planes to Korean Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warships and planes were
on their way into South Korean waters on Thursday after fire
exchange between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
the Republic of Korea in the Yellow Sea this week, the Pentagon
said.
</P>
<P>
Navy Captain Mike Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, told
reporters in Washington that the cruiser Vincennes will move
off Korea with another ship he did not identify.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Davis, a 7th Fleet spokesman, disclosed that the cruiser
Vincennes left its base in Yokosuka, Japan, on Wednesday and is
to be joined on Friday by another guided-missile cruiser, the
USS Mobile Bay.
</P>
<P>
The two ships were dispatched to the waters off the Korean
Peninsula and will stay there until tensions are reduced, Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. nuclear-powered submarines -- the USS Kamehameha and
USS Buffalo -- also arrived at South Korea's main naval base of
Chinhae late on Wednesday, but Davis said it was a routine port
call not related to the clashes between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
A number of EA-6B surveillance and electronic warfare planes
are also heading to the area to monitor events, although
Pentagon spokesman Doubleday stressed that tension had eased
since the exchange of fire on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved
moderately higher Thursday despite more hints of higher interest
rates from the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 56.68 at
10,841.63. The index rose 189.96 points Wednesday in response to
steady consumer prices in May.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 9.49 at 1,339.90 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 26.32 at 2,544.15.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told Congress today that the Federal Reserve would
consider taking pre-emptive action to prevent any threat to
the U.S. economic growth and a modest increase in interest rates
now could eliminate the need for more drastic action at a later
date. Some analyists said investors got a relief from Greenspan's
remarks that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
but the action will not be too drastic.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 3.90 at 636.07 and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.77 at 768.69.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.18 at 443.38.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,845 up, 1,199 down and 520
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 694.65 million shares from 796.85
million in the previous session.
