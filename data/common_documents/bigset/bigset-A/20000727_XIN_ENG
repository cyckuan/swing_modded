<HEADLINE> DPRK, Japan Willing to Establish Good-neighborly, Friendly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and Japan expressed their willingness here
Wednesday to normalize their diplomatic ties and establish good-
neighborly and friendly relationship.
</P>
<P>
During the first ever meeting between the foreign ministers of
the two countries in 52 years, DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun
said DPRK wants to normalize the bilateral relations with Japan as
soon as possible and establish good-neighborly and friendly ties
based on the principles of respect of sovereignty, equality,
mutual benefit and non-interference, according to the Japanese
foreign ministry spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing after the historic meeting between the two
foreign ministers, which lasted more than two hours, the spokesman
said that both sides hoped that the meeting will bring about
positive effects on the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Paek was quoted as saying that it is important to settle the
past issues between DPRK and Japan and is necessary to promote
bilateral exchanges and cooperation for normalizing the relations.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK foreign minister said the improvement of the bilateral
ties is not only important for peace and stability in northeast
Asia but also for Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono agreed that "Japan and
DPRK should build confidence and hold frank talks to normalize
diplomatic relationship."
</P>
<P>
"It's important to improve the atmosphere with understanding of
mutual concerns and national emotions," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers signed a four-point joint statement during
their meeting aimed at improving the relations between the two
countries, including holding of the 10th round talks for
normalization in Tokyo from August 21 to 25.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers are here to attend the 7th ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF) scheduled on Thursday for discussions of

<HEADLINE> Nepali Foreign Minister Refutes Indian Embassy's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Chakra
Prasad Bastola said here Wednesday that the communique issued by
the Indian embassy Tuesday concerning the Laxmanpur Dam has left
the Nepali government dismayed.
</P>
<P>
Talking to RSS, the official Nepali news agency, Bastola said
he wondered why such a statement has come from the Indian
government on the eve of Nepali prime minister's visit to India.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is a serious one," Bastola said.
</P>
<P>
"The embankment is not constructed after consulting Nepal and
Nepal's territory has been inundated," he continued. "It is Nepal
that is in a difficulty, but India insists Nepal has not been
affected in any way. Nepal is not prepared to accept that."
</P>
<P>
The communique by the Indian embassy claimed that India did not
violate any international laws by building the Laxmanpur Dam and
that the main barrage structure along with the guide bunds "has
not resulted in, and is not likely to result in, any inundation or
submergence of villages on the Nepalese side."
</P>
<P>
The communique is in response to a Nepali parliament human
rights committee that said the construction of the dam and the
adjoining afflux bund was an unilateral decision of the Indian
government and a violation of the international law.
</P>
<P>
The committee claimed that the dam is likely to inundate around
33 villages, displacing 1,500 people and affecting thousands of
others in southern Banke district in the mid-western Terai plain
that borders India.
</P>
<P>
According to Nepali officials, the 13.6 km long Laxmanpur Dam
lies at a distance of 4.25 km from the Nepal-India border on the
Indian side. But the communique by the Indian embassy said the
distance is 8 km in line with the requirement of international
practice.
</P>
<P>
Bastola said the dam dispute is to be resolved through
discussions between the two countries and at a technical level.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Nepal will not enter into any agreement
that will compromise Nepal's national interest.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Girija Koirala is scheduled to pay a one-
week official visit to India from July 31.

priority areas of the government.

JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has postponed his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Egypt on the results of the Camp David summit until next week,
Barak's office said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Repairs Dam to Guard Against Overflowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian authorities are
taking precautionary measures to repair dams to prevent flood
disasters which might occur in the current rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Renovation and embankment activities have been launched along
Awash riversides with a 4.5 million birr (about 560,000 U.S.
dollars) budget allocated by the federal government as a safeguard
against any eventuality of overflowing.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the Awash Basin Water Resources
Administration Dawit Tefera said on Thursday that the repair of
the 23-km-long dam as well as clearing of silts have been underway.
</P>
<P>
Dawit said the overflowing of the Awash River, a major river in
central Ethiopia, has been effectively checked in the past due to
the launching of similar dam construction and silt clearing
activities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that cotton and maize crops valued at over 30
million birr (3.74 million U.S. dollars) were destroyed due to the
overflowing of the river last year during which hundreds of
residents were also displaced.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Into Summer Recess With Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, the Netherlands, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers at the
Lockerbie trial reached agreement Thursday when the trial went
into summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said in a statement issued late Thursday that they
now expect to complete their case by the end of September. The
long-awaited trial, which went underway on May 3 after almost 12
years of investigation and preparation, had been expected to last
at least a year.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings of the trial will be shortened as the
prosecution and the defense team reached agreement on a number of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Alan Turnbull told the court that 60 relatives and
friends of the Lockerbie bombing victims would no longer testify
at the Scottish court on Dutch soil.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers had already agreed to shorten the list of witnesses
so as to shorten the trial shortly after the trial had started.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa
Fahima with conspiracy of murder and breach of international
aircraft safety laws. They say that the two Libyans accused,
posing as Libyan Arab Airlines employees at the Luqa airport in
Malta, have put a bomb on a plane bound for Frankfurt where the
bomb was transferred onto Pan Am Flight 103 that was exploded mid-
air over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988,
killing 259 people on board and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers argue that the bomb was placed in the New York-
bound airliner by Palestinian guerrillas in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The trial is now set to resume on August 22 when the
prosecution is expected to bring witnesses to provide evidence
about events that happened at the Luqa, Frankfurt and Heathrow
airports.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, according to the Scots law, has to prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt for the three Scottish judges to give
their verdict.
</P>
<P>
If proved guilty, the two Libyans would have to serve their
life sentence in Scotland; if the prosecution could not establish
its case, the two would have to be set free.

<HEADLINE> Castro Demands Total U.S. Blockade Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, JULY 27 (Xinhua)) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro has
demanded a total lifting of the United States' blockade against
his country.
</P>
<P>
Castro, in statements published Thursday by the press, said
that an eventual end to U.S. sales of medicines and food to Cuba
means making flexible the nearly 40-year embargo against the
island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader pronounced his statements at Conventions
Palace after he was awarded International Prize Benito Juarez (
Mexican leader) for his defense of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities have viewed with reserve the approval by the
U.S. House of Representatives to lift the medicine and food
embargo against the island as a prelude to the economic one.
</P>
<P>
The daily "Granma," organ of the Cuban Communist Party, said
Tuesday in an editorial that the blockade has caused Cuba damages
that go over 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Castro assured the island won't stop half-way and will reach
the end of the political battle against the U.S. anti-Cuban
rulings such as the Cuban Adjustment Act, Torricelli and Helms-
Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives last week voted to stop
enforcing provisions that ban American food exports and limit
sales of U.S. medicine to Cuba and four other nations -- Iran,
Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Sudan. The U.
S. Senate passed a bill on the same day to permit food and medical
sales to the five countries
</P>
<P>
While Cuba welcomed the moves, it said they do not go far
enough and continued to demand a total lifting of the sanctions
</P>
<P>
Cuba has been under a total trade embargo since February 1962,
longer than any other country except the DPRK. The sanctions were
tightened in July 1963, and most travels by Americans to the
island then were made illegal.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 296 Million Dollars in U.N. Oil-for-Oil Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq earned some 296
million U.S. dollars last week from exporting over 13 million
barrels of oil, the U.N. reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Office of the Iraq Program, which
administers the U.N. humanitarian oil-for-food program, said that
since the program's current six-month period, known as "phase VIII,
" began on June 9, Iraq has earned an estimated 1.732 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United Nations Security Council's sanctions
monitoring panel approved 12 new contracts for the sale of Iraqi
oil under phase VIII, bringing the total of approved contracts
within the phase to 80 with a volume of nearly 344.4 million
barrels, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, since the program began in December 1996, Iraq has
exported more than 1.904 billion barrels of oil valued at more
than 30.7 billion dollars, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, humanitarian supplies and equipment for the oil
industry continued to arrive normally last week, it added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food program began to implement in
late 1996, which was aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in the country caused by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannon be lifted until Iraq has destroyed all
its weapons of mass destruction.

committee that monitors sanctions against the Sierra Leonean
rebels will hold a public hearing from July 31 to August 1 to

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 111 people, among whom 27
were children, have died of mushroom poisoning since the beginning
of this year, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted the Health
Ministry as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that by Thursday, 1,094 cases of mushroom
poisoning have been registered in the country. The worst situation
was observed in the eastern Lugansk region, with 274 cases
reported, while in Donetsk 177 people were poisoned due to eating
wild mushroom.
</P>
<P>
With increasing mushroom poisoning and rising death toll, the
authorities are taking various measures to prevent similar
accidents. In Lugansk, police don't let residents enter forests to
go mushrooming. In Donetsk, selling mushroom is forbidden on the
markets if there is no sanitary inspection.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 200 mushroom poisoning cases were reported with only
one death.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Angola's Rebel Still Violating Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday that
Angola's UNITA rebels were still violating United Nations
sanctions by selling diamonds to fund their war effort.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office minister Peter Hain said in a written statement
to the parliament that sales of UNITA diamonds had been taking
place in the Gabonese capital Libreville.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard that another private sale may be held in
Libreville within the next month," Hain added.
</P>
<P>
"We will be raising these reports urgently with the Gabonese
authorities, and urging them to do everything in their power to
prevent this illicit trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has repeatedly campaigned for measures to combat the
trade in "conflict diamonds" which fuel some of Africa's most
bloody wars.
</P>
<P>
Hain said Britain would pass information about the sales to the
U.N. Angola sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms and fuel ban on UNITA
in an effort to end a civil war in the former Portuguese colony
that has killed at least one million people.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 it added an embargo on the rebel diamond trade.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Ability to Attract and Retain Talented Staff Critical for U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Thursday that the "quiet revolution" he had launched
three years ago to make the United Nations a leaner and more
effective organization was bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. chief warned that restoring competitiveness in
conditions of service at the U.N. must be viewed as an integral
part of any reform process.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to International Civil Service Commission, which
is holding its twenty-fifth anniversary session at U.N.
Headquarters in New York, Annan said "yet, in an era when
corporations conduct global searches for talented professionals,
and international and regional organizations complete with the U.N.
for qualified staff, we cannot afford to be complacent."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General noted that since the reform process had
been launched in 1997, the U.N. had streamlined management
procedures, shifted resources from administration to development
work, introduced cabinet-style management and greatly improved
coordination among the far-flung members of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. was also making progress in the direction of
a results-based budgeting system, one focused on outcomes rather
than inputs and processes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Annan stressed that the ability to provide
appropriate remuneration packages for all staff was critical for
the U.N. efforts to restore competitiveness in conditions of
service.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the Commission would provide
recommendations for human resources policy that was flexible and
innovative enough to turn the various U.N. organizations and
specialized agencies into"competitive employers and allow them to
attract and retain the most capable personnel.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Hold Arab, International Contacts Soon: PNA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat will hold a series of contacts with Arab,
European and other countries over the coming days to assess the
Middle East peace process after the failure of the Camp David
summit.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rudainah
in an interview with Voice of Arabs radio on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab support is essential and very important for the
Palestinian negotiators," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He held Israel responsible for the failure of the Camp David
summit, which was held on July 11-25 at the U.S. presidential
retreat near Washington, and accused Israel of attempting to "
retain its occupation of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
"Arafat's position was very clear and meant that there would be
neither peace nor reconciliation without the return of Jerusalem
and the Islamic and Christian holy sites to full Palestinian
control," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem was the basis and axis of the talks with Israel," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak during the talks that the Holy City was a "red
line" and that it was "not only a Palestinian issue but also an
Arab, Islamic and Christian one."
</P>
<P>
"No one can yield an inch of Jerusalem," Rudainah quoted Arafat
as saying to the U.S. and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is calling for holding an all-round or a
small Arab summit to discuss the issue of Jerusalem, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are for Arab coordination and solidarity as we are on the
threshold of a fateful stage in the peace process," the PNA
official added.
</P>
<P>
He further blamed the Israeli side for evading its commitments
to the principles of the peace process, including the references of
the 1993 Madrid peace conference and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the necessity to find a fair and satisfactory
solution to the question of Palestinian refugees, as well as other
final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the United States to continue its support
for Arafat, adding "We seek an effective U.S. role to force Israel
to comply with the principles of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
As for the Palestinian statehood, he said that the Central
Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PCC) would decide
on it in the coming session.
</P>
<P>
"The decision will be an independent Arab Palestinian one," he
noted, adding that "Arafat asserted repeatedly that 2,000 would be
the year of the declaration of the Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital."
</P>
<P>
Early July the PCC said the Palestinian independent state would
be declared on September 13 as the interim stage of the peace talks
would come to an end.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Briefs Jordan on Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua ) -- Palestinian Minister of Culture and
Information Yasser Abed Rabou paid a brief visit to Jordan on
Thursday to brief the kingdom on the outcome of a two-week
trilateral summit between U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-
Khatib, Rabou conveyed a message to King Abdullah Bin Hussein from
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the outcomes of the U.S.-
sponsored Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at Camp David near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Rabou told Khatib that the peace process on the Palestinian-
Israeli track will continue, and the Palestinians valued and
appreciated Jordan's support for their negotiators during the final
status talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
He also said Arafat is keen to continue coordination with King
Abdullah over the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rabou is the first senior Palestinian official to visit Jordan
after the Camp David summit ended earlier this week without any
agreement on the future of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders
and security arrangements between Israel and a future Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
The marathon summit, held on July 11-25, was attended by U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel and the Palestinians have agreed to resume their
final status talks at lower levels by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The talks are closely followed by Jordan, which said it has its
own interests to be protected, particularly on the issue of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is currently hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian
refugees displaced during successive Arab-Israeli wars since the
creation of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees have been granted Jordanian citizenship,
but the government said it did not mean they have given up their
rights to return home or stay in Jordan while being compensated in
accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions.

Prosecution on Thursday renewed detention of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a
social developments activist, for 15 more days pending
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, director of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Social
Developments, was arrested on June 30 on charges of collaborating
with foreign parties to undermine Egypt's social stability and the
center has also been closed temporarily, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of receiving funds from foreign sources,
including the European Union, without prior permission of the

which the authorities said tarnished Egypt's image.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim continues to be held in Torah prison outside Cairo
without trial. He could be sentenced to 15 years in jail if found
guilty.
</P>

Under Egypt's emergency laws, those suspected of threatening
state security can be detained without formal charges for 15 days,
a period which can be renewed indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Mediators Optimistic on Burundi Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Mediators said here Thursday
that they remained optimistic about the signing of a peace
agreement on August 28 despite the rejection by a main rebel group.
</P>
<P>
They vowed to push for an end to the seven-year conflict in the
tiny central African country, saying everything was still on
course for the signing of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"The scheduled signing of the draft peace agreement will go on
as planned," the leader of the Burundi peace talks mediation team
Judge Marke Bomani said, adding that the agreement was an all-
inclusive, comprehensive document.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Burundi's key Hutu rebel group, the National
Council for the Defense of Democracy Forces for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD-FDD), rejected the draft agreement as a "violation
of the 1992 Burundi constitution".
</P>
<P>
CNDD-FDD joined for the first time 19 Burundian political
parties in the peace talks in northern Tanzanian town of Arusha
last week.
</P>
<P>
Though no agreement was reached, the facilitator, former South
African president Nelson Mandela set August 28 as a new deadline
for signing.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation said that peace remained elusive in
Burundi despite some progress was made in the latest round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
They added that the signing of a peace agreement may have to be
postponed once again because several key issues are yet to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the mediation team said that the question of
who will lead the transitional government in Burundi is the most
intractable issue facing the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi conflict between Hutu rebels and minority Tutsi
dominated government and army has claimed 200,000 lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Burundi President Pierre Buyoya recently warned of a premature
signing of a peace agreement, saying a cease-fire must come into
effect before any accord is signed.

<P>
However some parliament members attending the meeting observed
that retroviral drugs were inaccessible to many Zambians because
they were too expensive and demanded the government intervention
so as to make the drugs cheaper and affordable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Health Minister, David Mpamba, informed that the
government was engaged in finding ways of providing the retroviral
drugs cheaply at a regional level where consultations were

<HEADLINE> China Calls for No Arms Supply for UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday voiced a
strong appeal to the parties concerned to honor relevant U.N.
Security Council resolutions by stopping supplying the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) with
any weapons and other materials which can be used by the rebels to
drag on the 25-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council meeting on the latest report by U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"As known to all, UNITA bears the primary responsibility for
the current situation in Angola, so the international community
has all the reasons to condemn it and impose sanctions on it,"
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Shen stressed, "The sanctions against UNITA are not the end,
but the necessary means to achieve the political settlement to the
Angolan problem."
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the international community can make
concerted efforts, and coordinate their actions, so as to force
UNITA by strengthening the sanctions to lay down their arms, stop
hostilities and begin the national reconciliation at an early date,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shen voiced his satisfaction that the Security
Council has strengthened the sanctions against UNITA by setting up
a monitoring mechanism to oversee the U.N. sanctions of illicit
diamond trade and weapons against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 peace accord, known as the Lusaka Protocol, broke down
in December 1998 after the government and UNITA resumed the civil
war that began after the freedom from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> 2 Engines Could Have Failed in Concorde Crash: Investigators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of Investigation of Accident (BEA) said in its first
communique since the accident took place that the crew of the
plane also told the control tower that the undercarriage of the
plane could not retract.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have found the remains of tires near the runway
of the airport, indicating that a tire broke out when the plane
took off.
</P>
<P>
While it is certain that the number two engine which is nearest
the fuselage broke down, the other engine on the wing -- number
one engine -- could also have broken down just before the plane
crashed, said the BEA.
</P>
<P>
"During the take-off, while the plane surpassed V1 (speed of
decision), the control tower signaled to the crew the fire in the
back part of the plane. We noted in the phone recorder (black box)
that after the rotating movement, the crew announced a failure of
the number two engine and a little bit later that the
undercarriage did not retract," said the BEA.
</P>
<P>
The black box registering technical data showed that the power
of number two engine broke down until it stopped completely and
that of number one engine also broke down twice in less than one
minute just before the plane inclined to the left and crashed.
</P>
<P>
The failure of both engines explained the loss of balance of
the plane during its turning.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the fire of number two could have spread to
the number one engine.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia and
Kyrgyzstan signed here Thursday a declaration on friendship,
cooperation and partnership between the two former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kyrgyz President Askar
Akayev also signed a treaty of economic cooperation for 2000-2009,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Putin emphasized that the
Russian administration has a high regard for the level of
relations between the two countries and the prospects for their
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides "have similar or close views on many key
issues of international relations" and that this similarity is to
a great extent based on the fundamental principles of
international communication.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin said, the relations between Russia and
Kyrgyzstan "have a special nature" as Kyrgyzstan is "the most
active participant in the integration processes in the CIS (
Commonwealth of Independent States)."
</P>
<P>
Akayev, who arrived here Wednesday on an official visit, will
meet with chiefs of the Russian defense and security agencies to
discuss security in Central Asia Friday, Interfax said, noting
that Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will brief Akayev on the
potential for supplying Russian defense hardware to Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Putin Thursday, Akayev said his summit
with Putin confirmed the two countries' strategic partnership and
Russia's new foreign policy respect for the independence of
Kyrgyzstan and other newly formed countries.
</P>
<P>
He said there is absolutely no reason to speak of any Russian
expansion against the newly independent states.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has always been a guarantor of stability in Central
Asia and the world," Akayev said.

and in particular to proceed with a significant deployment of the
Lebanese armed forces as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomed the establishment by the Lebanese
government of checkpoints in the vacated area and encouraged it to
ensure a calm environment throughout the south, including through
the control of all checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
The council said it would review the situation by early
November and consider any steps it deems appropriate regarding the
UNIFIL on the basis of a report to be submitted by the U.N. chief
on October 31.
</P>
<P>
This is the first renewal of the mandate of the UNIFIL since
Israel announced the complete withdrawal of its troops from
southern Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council endorsed earlier this week to deploy the
UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. But there is still one remaining
border violation by Israel in the process of being rectified.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL and Lebanese troops are not ready to deploy in
southern Lebanon until all Israeli violations of the border are
cleared up.

<HEADLINE> Russian Minister Sees 5.5 Percent Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's gross domestic product
could rise by 5.5 percent this year if the current positive trend
continues, Economic Development and Trade Minister German Gref
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary data, during the first half of the
year, GDP grew by 7.3 percent as compared with that of the
previous year, the Interfax news agency quoted Gref as saying.
</P>
<P>
The final figures will not be known until September when the
State Statistics Committee publishes the official results for the
first six months.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production continued to grow strongly in the six
months, rising 9.8 percent in June and 10.6 percent in May, Gref
said.
</P>
<P>
Capital investment rose more rapidly in the first half,
increasing by 14.3 percent year on year, including by 15.4 percent
in June alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gref predicted that the country's industrial output would rise
by about 7.5 percent for the whole 2000, some way above the 6
percent forecasted earlier.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Russians' real income will go up by some 6.5
percent in 2000 rather than by 6 percent as expected earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
Under pressure from their constituents about this summer's high
gasoline prices, U.S. lawmakers have blamed OPEC's collusive
practices for the soaring fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
"Indisputably, the biggest contributor to high gas and fuel
prices is the unacceptably high price of imported crude oil, a
price set by anti-competitive agreements among the OPEC nations,"
said Ohio Republican Senator Mike DeWine, who chairs the Senate
antitrust subcommittee and co-sponsored the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would put pressure on OPEC not to restrict oil
supplies by giving the U.S. government the legal authority to
bring an antitrust enforcement action against foreign states
engaging in anti-competitive conduct with regard to oil and other
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The bill will also give U.S. federal district courts the
jurisdiction and authority to consider such cases brought by the

<HEADLINE> 19 Russian Servicemen Killed in Chechnya in Past Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen Russian federal servicemen
were killed and 94 wounded in the week to Thursday in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, a ranking officer said.
</P>
<P>
During this period, five Defense Ministry servicemen were
killed and 34 wounded, and 14 Interior Ministry servicemen were
killed and 60 wounded, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting
Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy head of the General
Staff.
</P>
<P>
The figures brought to 2,537 the number of federal servicemen
killed in the North Caucasus since last August. The total number
of the wounded stood at 8,050.
</P>
<P>
Russia's military campaign against separatist rebels came after
two waves of armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Dagestan
and a series of apartment explosions that left over 300 people
dead and numerous wounded in Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
During the military operations in Chechnya, 2,259 servicemen of
the federal forces have been killed and 6,366 wounded since
October 1 of last year, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
On the separatists' side, Manilov said, more than 60 rebels,
including "several prominent fighters and mercenaries" were
eliminated by federal forces over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Federal units discovered and eliminated some 30 rebel camps, 25
dugouts and "a dozen caches" in the course of search and
reconnaissance operations in the period, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of rebels "on the whole territory of Chechnya
amounts to about 2,000," Manilov said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved Thursday the disbursement of 13.2 million U.S.
dollars to Zambia to help the east African nation combat poverty
and complete the privatization of its economy.
</P>
<P>
The funds, part of an overall three-year IMF Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility credit for Zambia worth 336.3 million dollars,
followed a review by the fund of the country's recent economic
performance. Zambia to date has drawn about 26.4 million dollars
of the credit.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities' firm commitment to poverty reduction, as
outlined in their Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, is
welcome," IMF Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
He cited in particular the government's willingness to "
establish a legal framework that sustains private sector-led
economic growth, promotes stable macroeconomic conditions
conducive to private investment and targets poverty reduction
programs."
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the success of the effort depends on the
government's commitment to budget discipline ahead of elections
next year.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will resume peace talks on Sunday to move the Israeli-
Palestinian track forward.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiator Gilead Sher and chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said separately on Thursday that they hoped an
agreement could be reached soon, despite the collapse of the

</P>
<P>
"I would say that definitely yes, it is possible to finish the

long as there is talk between the sides," Sher told the Israel

</P>
<P>
Sher said Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran will head the

delegation to be led by Erekat.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the negotiations in good faith in the hope of

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Interests Must be Protected in Final Status Talks: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
al-Khatib stressed on Thursday that Jordan's interests must be
safeguarded in the ongoing final status talks between Israel and
the Palestinians, particularly on the issue of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Khatib said Jordan has been playing a
pivotal role in the Middle East peace process due to the
significance of its outcomes on the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"All parties concerned in the process are well-aware of the
Jordanian stance regarding the country's interests, and Jordan has
extensively and meticulously acquainted them of its stand in regard
to the issue of (Palestinian)refugees," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is sheltering some 1.5 million Palestinian refugees who
had
fled their homes in successive wars in the region since the
creation of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government said the refugees should return home
under relevant U.N. resolutions or stay in Jordan while asking for
compensations from all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Khatib said most of the refugees have been granted Jordanian
citizenship, but it does not mean they have given up their rights
to return home or be compensated.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Arab nations to join hands with Jordan in
supporting an independent Palestinian state upon their own soil.
</P>
<P>
He announced that King Abdullah Bin Hussein will visit Egypt
next
Monday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the peace
process after a two-week-long trilateral summit at Camp David near
Washington failed to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
The summit meetings, attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, mainly focused on thorny issues such as the status of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders of a future Palestinian
state and security arrangements between Israel and the future
Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
Khatib denied Jordan was excluded from the Camp David summit,
saying "the kingdom has supported the peace process and will do so
to help restore Palestinian legitimate rights and to achieve a just
and comprehensive peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that negotiations between Palestinians and
Israelis will build on what has been achieved at Camp David to make
real and tangible progress and then to pave the way for signing an
agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Jordanian stand in supporting Palestinians and the peace
process is crystal clear and needs nobody's testimony. It stems
from our commitment to the peace process and our support to Arab
brothers," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Shas Party Signals Willingness to Rejoin Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The leadership of Israel's ultra-
Orthodox Shas party Thursday expressed willingness to return to the
coalition government provided that the party be equally treated.
</P>
<P>
Shas's decision-making body, the Council of Torah Sages, met
Thursday to discuss the party's current status as an opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
Shas's Knesset (Parliament) member Yitzhak Vaknin told reporters
that the party's spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef is more
concerned about protecting human life than symbols important to the
Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
In Rabbi Yosef's opinion, Vaknin said, a peace deal that
protects human life takes precedence over things that are only of
symbolic value. As long as it is possible to save a Jewish life,
everything possible must be done.
</P>
<P>
Shas will return to the coalition as a partner in the peace
process if the party is treated as equal, the party's mentor said.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest party in Israel with 17 seats in the
120-member Knesset, bolted the coalition on the eve of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's departure for the Camp David summit to shirk
the responsibility for a possible bad deal that Barak might bring
back from the summit.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks earlier, Shas, the largest ruling partner in Barak's
coalition, plunged the government into an unprecedented political
crisis by voting in favor of an early-election bill in protest
against the government's failure to meet its demands for funding
its school network.
</P>
<P>
Barak caved in to Shas's increasing demands to keep the powerful
party in the coalition and save his shaky government from collapse.
But only when the three ministers from the pro-peace Meretz party,
also Shas's arch rival, tendered in their resignation did Shas
decide to stay.
</P>
<P>
The government crisis that Barak managed to tide over only re-
emerged when he badly needed the backing of his ruling partners
prior to the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Ba'aliya headed by the former Interior Minister Natan
Sharasky, the National Religious Party and Shas quit the government
in succession, leaving the government with a minority 42 seats in
the Knesset. Barak himself held nine vacated portfolios in addition
to his own defense portfolio.
</P>
<P>
As political figures here put it, the country was run almost by
no government while Barak was at Camp David trying to hammer out a
peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Thus, to reshuffle his government is one of the top priorities
facing Barak after his return from the summit talks.
</P>
<P>
A much discussed option is to form a joint national coalition
with the opposition Likud, as Sharansky has been calling for.
Barak, however, may not take this into consideration as many
analysts believe because the inclusion of Likud in the coalition
might mean the end of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In response to Barak's call for a meeting with Likud party
leader Ariel Sharon on Thursday evening, a Likud spokesman quickly
poured cold water on speculations that they would forge a unity
government. The two former generals were due to meet late in the
day at the defense ministry in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other Likud Knesset members also aired calls for an
early election, saying that Likud has no common grounds for forming
a joint coalition with Barak's One Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak is going to face two no-confidence votes next Monday, one
submitted by Likud in protest against Barak's handling of the
negotiations, and the other by the United Arab List over the
government's negligence of the Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who has pledged continued efforts to pursue
a peace accord with the Palestinians, is likely to have his former
ruling partners back. Meretz on Thursday also expressed conditional
willingness to return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Politicians do widely agree that in the event of an eruption of
violent clashes with the Palestinians, there would definitely be a
need to form an emergency national unity government. Barak himself
also pondered this possibility while at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
However, during the meeting on Thursday night with Sharon, Barak
is expected to only brief him on the just-concluded summit and not
to raise the issue of forming the joint coalition.

<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- One Copt was killed and three others
were wounded in an attack perpetrated by an assailant in the south
of the Egyptian capital of Cairo, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Fakhri Ayyad Mussaad and three employees were unloading eggs at
Mussaad's chicken farm in Sul village, 60 kilometers south of
Cairo, when a gunman opened fire on them, killing Mussaad
instantly, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The three others were taken to a hospital. It is not immediately
known how seriously they were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The four victims were all Coptic Christians, but the ministry
has ruled out an attack by Islamic militants, saying investigations
have revealed the incident was prompted by a land dispute between
the deceased and others in his village.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a population of 64 million, of whom over nine percent
are Christians. It witnessed the worst sectarian violence in 20
years, in which 22 people died, most of them Coptic Christians, in
clashes that broke out due to business disputes last January in the
town of Kosheh in Suhag Governorate, 400 kilometers south of Cairo.

the problem," he said.
</P>

On Wednesday, spokesman of the ruling Zanu-pf party Nathan
Shamuyarira also pleaded with the farmers to remain on their

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean War Veterans Threaten to Take Over White Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean war veterans' leader
Chenjerai Hunzvi said Thursday if white commercial farmers go
ahead with a nationwide strike, the war veterans will take over
the farms including the tractors and all other farming implements
and machinery to show that blacks can also farm.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency that
there were thousands of graduates from local agricultural colleges
who were willing to farm but had no land.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-member Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) has warned of a
nationwide demonstration on Monday to force the government and the
police to guarantee them security on their farms.
</P>
<P>
The CFU said its members are now living in constant fear of the
war veterans who continued to harass, intimidate and kill its
members, seriously disrupting farming operations.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,500 white-owned farms
since February to force the government to speed up the land
redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has targeted 804 white farms for
compulsory acquisition to resettle landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi told the news agency that the strike by white commercial
farmers was aimed at economic sabotage and derailing the
government's land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
"They are reactionaries who want to destabilize economy. As war
veterans we will not allow them to hold the nation at ransom," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Mixed Court to Try Sierra Leonean War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
morning presented a draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council
in a bid to get the 15-nation council's approval to set up a mixed
Sierra Leonean-international tribunal to try Foday Sankoh, rebel
leader of Sierra Leone whose fighters have taken U.N. peacekeepers
hostage in early May, and his henchmen for accused war crimes.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Richard Holbrooke, U.S. permanent
representative to the United Nations, after he stepped out of the
Security Council Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposed a mixed Sierra Leonean-international court
to try people accused of war crimes in the war-torn West African
country, he said. In other words, the proposed tribunal will
comprise Sierra Leonean and international prosecutors and judges
and it will be paid by voluntary contributions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said that the draft was "endorsed in its
general framework by all the other" council members during closed-
door consultations and he hoped it would be voted on next week.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that Foday Sankoh and his henchmen who
have committed these war crimes be brought to justice," Holbrooke
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed court would be different from existing purely U.N.
tribunals set up to try alleged war criminals from the former
Yugoslavia and those accused of responsibility for the 1994
genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Sierra Leone, which broke out some nine years
ago and flared a new this year despite a peace accord signed in
July 1999 in Togo, has been marked by unusual brutality, with
rebels reportedly killing or mutilating thousands of civilians,
often chopping off their limbs.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF),
took up arms in 1991, signed the 1999 peace accord and is now in
government custody in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Lott Moves to Proceed to China Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott made a motion Wednesday, requesting the Senate to
proceed to the debate on the legislation granting permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that while the measure was purely procedural, he
wanted to show his commitment to move the bill quickly when
Congress reconvenes in September.
</P>
<P>
"When we come back in September, this will be an issue that we
can go to soon rather than later in the month," he said.
</P>
<P>
A vote on the motion is expected Friday, the last day before
Congress recesses for the month of August.
</P>
<P>
Lott's motion, which is made under pressure of the White House
and the business community supporting the PNTR bill, will remove a
key hurdle to passage of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to see the process move forward," U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said. "Prompt action is
essential if the U.S. is to benefit from China's accession to the
WTO."

<HEADLINE> French Investigators Study Wreckage of Concorde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- French investigators are studying
piece by piece the wreckage of the Concorde plane which crashed
Tuesday in order to figure out the exact conditions of the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
While the two black boxes -- one registering the conversation
between the crew and the control tower and the other containing
the technical data of the flight -- have been analyzed,
investigators are prudent about the definite cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The analysis of the black boxes showed that the left engine
number two of the Concorde broke down and caught fire as the plane
took off on the runway of the Roissy airport.
</P>
<P>
The rear side of the plane caught fire when the plane was
gaining speed on the runway, according to the control tower of the
airport.
</P>
<P>
It was on flame when rising into the sky and half of it was
engulfed by fire before the crash, according to a video tape shot
by a woman who was riding in her husband's truck near the site of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The experts are bringing more than 100,000 pieces of the
wreckage to the factory of Concorde while leaving signs of their
positions on the site of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
They will reconstruct the plane as much as possible with the
pieces of the wreckage to study each piece and compare it with the
norms and specifications when the plane was constructed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 200 gendarmerie policemen are having
hearings with the air controllers and mechanics who joined the
technical reparation of the failed engine soon before the plane
took off.
</P>
<P>
The engine number two underwent a technical reparation shortly
before the plane took off.
</P>
<P>
But an official of Air France told the daily Le Monde that the
reparation could not be the cause of the fire which broke out from
the engine.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.N. Leader Calls for World Efforts to Bring Peace to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. leader
Thursday called on the Angolan government and the international
community to demonstrate their political will to take concrete
actions to bring peace to the war-torn Angola so that the
resources-rich southern African country can be prosperous again.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in a speech by Ibrahim Gambari, U.
N. under-secretary-general on African affairs, when he was
introducing a report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan at an
open U.N. Security Council meeting. The report was circulated
Thursday here.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible to make Angola a prosperous country again if
there is the political will to take concrete actions to bring this
about," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If peace is given a chance, Angola's endowment in mineral and
human resources provides the country with a great potential to
eradicate poverty in a relatively short period and promote the
well-being for all Angolans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Angola is an important oil-exporting country, and it is also
one of the world's richest countries in diamonds and, at one point,
one of the world's largest coffee producers.
</P>
<P>
However, Angola, due to the 25-year civil war, has been long
plunged into armed conflicts, thus making the humanitarian
situation on the ground very serious.
</P>
<P>
"On November 11, Angola will be celebrating its 25th
anniversary of independence, but in the last 25 years, Angolans
have not witnessed a single year of peace," he said. "On the
contrary, for a quarter of a century, they have seen destruction
after destruction, countless deaths and loss of youths, waste of
talents and atrocity after atrocity."
</P>
<P>
"The world has also seen several thousands of refugees and
hundreds of internally displaced persons in Angola," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gambari, the former Nigerian permanent
representative to the United Nations, called on the Angolan
government to take "the primary responsibility for addressing the
plight" of the internally displaced persons in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has a critical supporting role,"
he said. "In this regard, some of the work conducted by U.N.
agencies, some national and international NGOs (non-governmental
organizations) in supporting internally displaced people are
encouraging."
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said, "I remain
deeply concerned by the continuing fighting and its devastating
effects on the population. As disturbing is the absence of any
meaningful attempt to reach a political settlement of the conflict.
"
</P>
<P>
The rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) "bears the primary responsibility for the return to war in
Angola," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA has been repeatedly blamed for its refusal to comply
with key provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, in particular its
failure to demilitarize its forces and to allow state
administration to be extended throughout the country, precipitated
the resumption of widespread hostilities.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 peace deal, called the Lusaka Protocol, broke down in
December 1998 after the government and the UNITA resumed civil war
that began after the nation's 1975 independence.
</P>
<P>
About 1 million people have died and many more have been
displaced in the 25-year civil war since Angola's independence
from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Working Party Chairman Sees Good Progress in China's WTO Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Working Party on the Accession
of China to the World Trade Organization (WTO) has made good
progress in its consideration of a revised draft protocol,
Chairman Pierre-Louis Girard said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Positions were narrowed significantly on a number of points,
with emerging consensus developing in some important areas,"
Girard said in his summing up at the end of the week-long meeting
of the working party.
</P>
<P>
"With certain additional clarifications, it should be possible
to table a further draft of the protocol for consideration in the
next round of working party discussions," the Swiss ambassador
said. He described the current session of the working party as "
productive and business-like."
</P>
<P>
In his statement at Thursday's meeting, China's Vice Minister
for Foreign Trade Long Yongtu said that China's WTO accession
negotiations are making steady progress in both bilateral and
multilateral aspects.
</P>
<P>
In respect of bilateral negotiations, China has signed
bilateral agreements with Ecuador and Guatemala this week and has
concluded negotiations with Costa Rica, shortening the long list
of its negotiating partners to only two WTO members, namely Mexico
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Long expressed the hope that all bilateral WTO negotiations
would be concluded in the near future through concerted efforts of
the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
During the current session, another step forward has been made
in China's multilateral negotiations on the drafting of the
multilateral legal documents for China's accession on the basis of
the progress of the recent sessions and the 10th session in
particular.
</P>
<P>
"China and working party members have reached consensus on many
provisions of the protocol and the drafting of the working party
report has also entered into the stage of substantive discussions,
" said Long.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Chinese delegation said that his delegation is
looking forward to more progress in the next session of the
working party, which is scheduled in mid-September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Move to Resume Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that it welcomes plans by Israel and the Palestinian Authority to
resume Middle East peace talks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We made progress at Camp David and there's still a lot of hard
work ahead of us, and frankly the sooner they start back, the
better," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart reiterated U.S. opposition to any unilateral action by
the Palestinian side after a 15-day Middle East peace summit at
Camp David, Maryland, ended without a deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Arafat knows full well what the U.S. position is that
we oppose any unilateral actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Appearing on ABC's "Nightline" program late Wednesday,
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat confirmed that he would
resume negotiations with his Israeli counterpart Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinians and Israelis have completed more than 80
percent of what is needed for a formal peace deal at the Camp
David talks.
</P>
<P>
After Camp David, he said, "I'm confident that we can make a
deal before September 13."
</P>
<P>
The date of September 13 is the deadline agreed by both Israel
and Palestinians for a final settlement to their 52-year-old
conflict.

<HEADLINE> BT Profits Continue Fall On Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Stiff competition and the huge
costs of securing next generation mobile phone licenses have led
to a 27 percent slump in British Telecom (BT) profits.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax profits for the quarter to June 30 fell to 561 million
pounds (370 million U.S. dollars) from 772 million pounds (510
million dollars) the time before, although turnover is up, to 6.8
billion pounds (4.5 billion dollars) from 5 billion pounds (3.3
billion dollars) last time.
</P>
<P>
BT also blames the fall in earnings on the cost of investing in
the Japanese and Irish telecoms markets and the expense last year
of taking complete control of BT Cellnet, when it bought a 40
percent stake from Securicor.
</P>
<P>
Robert Brace, BT group finance director, described the cost of
acquiring the UK third generation mobile phone license as "not the
best bargain of all time."
</P>
<P>
"The government has taxed the industry up front," he added.
Brace predicted the tough UK market conditions would continue,
with prices continuing their downwards trend.
</P>
<P>
However, the result was not as bad as had been feared by
analysts, and BT shares rose 10p to 878p in early trading Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Halifax Group Enjoys Profits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Halifax Group has reported a 21
percent increase in profits during the first half of the year
despite increased competition.
</P>
<P>
Net lending in the mortgage business has doubled to 2.4 billion
pounds (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) compared to the same period last
year, giving Halifax, the largest building society in Britain, a
market share of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gross lending, before mortgage redemptions and repayments, was
also strong, at 10 billion pounds (6.6 billion dollars), giving a
market share of 17 percent, slightly up on 16 percent the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the glowing figures, Halifax warned that the
competition was fierce and that growth in demand was slowing.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Jame Crosby said there was increasing pressure
on margins as the group fought to compete with existing rivals and
new entrants such as e-banks offering lower rates to attract
customers.
</P>
<P>
Halifax was doing well at watching costs and had beaten its
zero cost-growth target, Crosby added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Lanka's Constitutional Reforms Run Into Obstruction By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's constitutional reforms
ran into obstruction from the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) on Thursday as the party decided to withdraw its
support in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, which holds the balance of power to make or break the
reforms, decided unanimously at its executive committee not to
deliver the promised votes in the parliament if the government
tries to rush President Chandrika Kumaratunga's controversial
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional reforms aim at politically ending the 17-
year civil war between government troops and Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels by devolving powers to provinces,
including one administered by minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance (PA) of President Kumaratunga
needs the UNP's support in the parliament as it does not have the
two-thirds majority required to pass the reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, UNP spokesman Karunasena Kodituwakku said the
opposition is insisting that the government hold extensive talks
with all concerned parties before presenting the draft in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The UNP's widely expected decision could complicate problems
for the government which is already facing opposition from the
influential Buddhist clergy and Tamil parties.
</P>
<P>
The influential Buddhist clergy in this predominantly Buddhist
country and nationalist Sinhala organizations have said the
reforms are a sell-out to the minority and would lead to the
country's division.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream Muslim and Tamils parties, on their part, said the
reforms do not meet the political aspirations of the minority.
</P>
<P>
The UNP's leader Wickremesinghe last Friday quitted the
bipartisan talks with President Kumaratunga, saying he could not
take part as the government tried desperately to link him to the
LTTE rebels who have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNP has reiterated that it will remain in talks
with the PA of Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The two main parties, which have held a series of meetings
since March, have yet to agree on the transitional provisions in
the draft constitution that will abolish the executive presidency
and return Sri Lanka to a Westminister-style parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has said she would present the draft
constitution before the parliament in early August and have it
adopted before the present parliament is dissolved automatically
on August 24 at the end of its six-year term.
</P>
<P>
Despite obstruction from the UNP, the Buddhist clergy and Tamil
parties, the government seems to be confident about the prospect
of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The discordant notes sounded by the opposition UNP, the
powerful Buddhist clergy and minority Muslim and Tamil parties
will soon die down and they will all come around, which could be
as early as August 4," Minister for Internal and International
Commerce and Food Kingsly Wicramaratne was quoted by press reports
as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition has always been buying time. With or without
their support, the president will make peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Moldova's GDP to Drop by 7 Percent in 2000: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product GDP)
of Moldova will drop by 7 percent in 2000 as a result of the
drought and the annual inflation rate will be 17-18 percent, the
Moldovan Basa-press news agency Wednesday quoted International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Regional Director Richard Haas as saying.
</P>
<P>
In early 2000, the National Bank of Moldova and the Finance
Ministry forecasted a 2-percent rise in the GDP and a 26-percent
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the IMF two-week
mission to Chisinau, Richard Haas said that in 2001 the GDP of
Moldova will rise by 5 percent and the annual inflation will drop
by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Based on these parameters, the IMF mission signed with the
Chisinau government an agreement on the 2000 budget that,
according to Haas, will be "financed from interior resources."
</P>
<P>
Moldovan Premier Dumitru Braghis told the same press conference
that the government will present rectifications to the 2000 budget
in late September. According to him, the main figures -- revenues,
expenses and deficit -- will not experience any changes.
</P>
<P>
Braghis said that 43.7 percent of the annual revenues were
collected in the first half of 2000. He said the Moldovan budget
has a seasonable character and two-thirds of the budget are
collected in the second half of the year. Braghis said he is
optimist and believes that the 2000 budget will be implemented
integrally. He added that in the opinion of IMF experts, the
cabinet will be forced, however, to take a 100-million-leu (an
about 8 million U.S. dollar) credit from the National Bank to
cover the budgetary deficit.

<HEADLINE> Former Diplomat Sentenced to 11 Years in Jail for Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Moscow City Court has sentenced
Platon Obukhov, a former Russian Foreign Ministry employee accused
of spying for Britain, to 11 years in jail for high treason.
</P>
<P>
The court has also ruled that Obukhov's property be confiscated,
the Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Obukhov's lawyer Galina Krylova said the defense
intends to appeal to the Russian Supreme Court against Thursday's
court ruling. The lawyer believes that the evidence presented in
court was obtained with violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
Obukhov, the son of Alexei Obukhov, a former Russian deputy
foreign minister and Russian ambassador to Denmark, was arrested
by the Federal Security Service (FSB) in April 1996 on suspicion
of collaborating with British intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The former diplomat was earlier deemed as psychologically
irresponsible and on July 30, 1997, the Moscow City Court decided
to impose forced psychiatric treatment on him.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow City Court was to resume the hearing of his case in
February 2000 at the end of the forced treatment, but the court
postponed the hearing until now after an April 28 evaluation by
expert-psychiatrist Yevgeny Krylov that deemed Obukhov sane,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Data Shows U.S. Economic Growth Remains Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket durable goods surged by 10 percent in June while
Americans' wages and benefits rose by 4.4 percent for the 12
months ending in June, the U.S. government reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both the rise in factory orders and the increase in wages and
salaries were the biggest in nine years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the surge in manufacturing, led by a record
increase in demand for aircraft, called into question the widely
held view that the economy was beginning to slow.
</P>
<P>
Such strong demand for manufactured goods, economists said,
will raise concerns at the Federal Reserve that the economy is
still growing too rapidly and will need to be slowed further with
more increases in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that the surprisingly strong 10
percent increase in orders for durable goods, items expected to
last at least three years, followed a revised 7 percent increase
in May.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the 12-month increase in its
Employment Cost Index, a closely watched gauge of inflation
pressures, was up from a 4.3 percent increase for the 12 months
ending in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
While only a slight upward tick, the 4.4 percent increase was
the biggest gain in wages and salaries since a 4.6 percent rise in
June 1991.
</P>
<P>
For the three months ending in June, the increase in wages and
benefits was 1 percent, down slightly from a 1.4 percent advance
in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Department reported that the
number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits
declined by 40,000 last week to 272,000, the lowest level since
the week ending April 15, suggesting that the job market remains
exceptionally tight.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over
the past 13 months in an effort to slow consumer spending, the
main engine of economic growth, and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress this week
that it was unclear whether the slowdown in the overall economy in
the spring was a permanent trend or would be followed by a rebound
in growth this summer.
</P>
<P>
He said Fed policy-makers would be watching upcoming economic
statistics closely to determine whether to boost rates for a
seventh time when they next meet on August 22.

<HEADLINE> Russia Witnesses 10 Contract Killings Each Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Interior Ministry said
Thursday that 249 contract killings were registered in the first
half of this year, and the rate amounts to 10.3 contract killings
every week during the period.
</P>
<P>
General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, chief of the ministry's Criminal
Investigation Department, said 49 contract murders were solved in
the first six months of this year, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said many of the contract killings were related to the
victims' business activities and in 37 percent of the cases, the
contractors were related to the victim. They are mainly the
cofounders of companies, debtors or deputies of the killed.
</P>
<P>
Contract killings for domestic reasons are mainly ordered by
close relatives -- wives, husbands or children. Such cases account
for about one quarter of all those registered, Trubnikov said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Over 70 fires burned across parts of 10 Western states in the
United States Wednesday, racing through timber, grass and brush.
</P>
<P>
About half of the smaller fires had no crews on hand at all. In
some cases, calls for help with wildfires have been delayed or
unfilled for days because resources have been devoted to major
fires.
</P>
<P>
The wildfire season, which began when a prescribed brush-
clearing fire near Los Alamos, New Mexico State, raged out of
control and destroyed more than 200 homes in May, has become the
worst since 1996.
</P>
<P>
In hopes of gaining ground on the fires, Army soldiers will
attend crash courses in firefighting techniques organized by the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
Center spokeswoman Lorraine Buck said the soldiers should be
ready to join fire lines next week, but he did not say how many
soldiers would end up on lines.
</P>
<P>
The last time the fire center mobilized military units was in
the summer of 1996, using 1,160 soldiers. Fires that year had
burned 1.2 million hectares by July 25. So far this year, fires
have burned 1.05 million hectares.

<P>
ASTANA, Kazakhstan, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President
Hu Jintao arrived here Thursday evening, starting his four-day
official visit to Kazakhstan, the largest country in Central Asia
and a good neighbor of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president was warmly welcomed at the airport
by Prime Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev and other Kazakh high-
ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Hu said in a written statement issued at the airport upon his
arrival that China and Kazakhstan are close neighbors. The two
peoples have built century-old profound friendship and conducted
friendly exchanges which could be found in the historic record of
the well-known "Silk Road", he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic relations eight years ago, Hu
went on to say, unfolded a new chapter for bilateral friendly ties.
Since then bilateral relations have been growing well and yielded
satisfying results through ever-expanding cooperation in various
fields. He noted that the complete settlement of Sino-Kazakh
borders also laid a solid foundation for a long stable and healthy
development of the good-neighborly and friendly ties and
cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president expressed hope that his meetings and
talks with Kazakh leaders will "explore new methods and ways of
further deepening mutually beneficial cooperation, in a bid to
work out a beautiful blueprint for the bilateral ties in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
In Kazakhstan, Hu is scheduled to hold talks with Kazakh Prime
Minister Tokayev and meet President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to exchange views on bilateral
relations and regional or international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is the last leg of Hu's current five-nation tour,
which also includes Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia and Byelorussia.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Anti-Drug Police Seize 89.5 Kilograms of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-drug security forces
Thursday seized 89.5 kilograms of heroin in Baskale town, eastern
Van province bordering Iran.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, the police raided several houses in Guroluk
village of the town and confiscated the drugs, one Kalashnikov
rifle and a hand gun, Anatolia News Agency reported. They also
arrested four suspects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police seized 2,328 roots of Indian hemp in the
Kayabogazi Yapili hamlet, another village under the Catak township
of Van province.
</P>
<P>
The hemps were set ablaze and investigations into the drugs are
underway, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Turkish chief police authority said the anti-
narcotics police had launched "determined and successful" struggle
against drugs trafficking via the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued amid some newspapers criticism that the
police carried out inefficient anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
The police authority summed up its latest operations and
dismissed the reports as "unrealistic and baseless."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 6,121 people were arrested in 2,587 separate
incidents while anti-drug forces impounded 2,249 kilograms of
heroin, 5,458 kilograms of hashish, 288 kilograms of base morphine,
13 kilograms of cocaine, 26.2 tons of acid anhydride and 1,749,305
captogan pills, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the forces captured 3,219 suspects in 1,458
operations and seized 2,850 kilograms of heroin, 22.6 tons of
hashish, 976 kilograms of base morphine, 56 kilograms of opium, 6

Romanian, Belgian, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Greek anti-
narcotics units, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Nearly 70 percent of
illicit drugs produced in the rest of the world are smuggled to
European countries via Turkey.

BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The home-buying of residents in
Beijing continues to rise, with 2.2 million square meters of
housing sold during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Municipal Development Planning

dollars) to buy housing in the six-month period, 2.4 times that of
the same period last year.

at the local real estate market prices at an appropriate level in
the second half of this year, and renovation of dilapidated
housing will be stepped up to ensure the completion of eight

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Want Talks to Be Held on Neutral Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF) has brushed aside the Philippine government's decision that
the resumption of peace talks with the government be held in the
country, the rebel group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MILF chief negotiator Aleem Abdulaziz Mimbantas made the group'
s stance clear in a written letter to his government counterpart
insisting that peace talks be held in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
But Egardo Batenga, government panel head, reiterated the
government's position that the talks be held in Philippine
territory as the problem being resolved by both panels is "
internal and needs no intervention from foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bajunaid said that they are very much
willing to return to the negotiating table so long as there are no
preconditions set by the government, adding that the talks should
be pursued in accordance with the general framework of agreement
signed by both panels in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the MILF insistence to hold the talks outside the country,
Bajunaid stressed that the threat issued by Police Director
General Panfilo Lacson to arrest MILF leaders with pending
criminal cases, is "vexing."
</P>
<P>
Meantime, he confirmed that Al Haj Murad, the MILF vice
chairman for military affairs, is much alive and kicking, but he
refused to reveal Murad's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Murad was killed when his office in
Maguindanao province was bombarded by government troops in May.
</P>
<P>
Bajunaid said that "in fact the order to mount massive counter
offensive against military establishments even came from Murad."
</P>
<P>
He said that Ghadzali Jaafar and Mohaqher Iqbal, MILF vice
chair for political affairs and chief propagandist, respectively,
are out of the country while MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat has gone
to Cairo, Egypt.

DHAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government Thursday
denied that dengue fever has assumed epidemic proportions and
urged the people not to be panicked as the disease can be
prevented and managed.
</P>
<P>
"The death of 11 people, out of 239 attacked by dengue fever,

patients," Health and Family Welfare Minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim
Selim told a press conference at his office.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest figures obtained from different public
hospitals of the city, Selim said a total of 11 dengue patients
had so far died and 101 were released after treatment out of the
total 239 admitted.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for creating public awareness to combat the
disease, the health minister said the disease can be prevented
through increased awareness and by cleaning the breeding places of
Aedes mosquitoes and killing their adults.
</P>
<P>
Selim said the government has taken various measures to create
public awareness, and to prevent and manage dengue fever. A nine-
member high-powered surveillance team led by the Director General
of Health has been formed for round-the-clock monitoring of dengue
fever and patients as well in the country, he said.

dollars, a decrease by 170 million U.S. dollars compared with the
same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>

for encouragement and the reserves are expected to reach 2.5
billion U.S. dollars by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Clothing Chain Shuts Down Shops in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Dutch clothing chain Kreymborg is
shutting its 12 Belgian shops after losing money in business,
local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A group of more than 30 years, Kreymborg sells clothes for men
and women in its outlets in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Its mother company now is closing down and is shutting all its
49 Dutch and 12 Belgian shops. Kreymborg has been faced with major
losses for years, especially due to strong competition in the
clothing sector.
</P>
<P>
The management board of the chain said that none of their
employees will lose their jobs. So far, all Belgian Kreymborg
outlets but one will be taken over, five by the French clothing
chain Etam, one by Spanish group Zara and five by the Dutch
drugstore Kruidvat. They will also take over the staff of the
shops.
</P>
<P>
Only the shop in Belgium's west Flemish city of Kortrijk will
be closed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, French retailer chain Carrefour took over Belgian
retailer chain GB as part of a merger wave in 15 nations of the
European Union. Belgium, a traditionally welfare state, is
witnessing fierce competition from market economy.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- When the women begin their
competition today at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships, five
members of the 1996 Olympic champion team are trying to beat a new
generation of more athletic breed.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1996 Olympians, only Amy Chow, 22, kept competing until
this year, and Shannon Miller, 23, was the biggest surprise since
she has already become the most successful U.S. gymnast winning
the most Olympic medals in history with two golds, two silvers and
three bronzes.
</P>
<P>
The other returnees were Jaycie Phelps, 20, Dominique Moceanu,
18, and Dominique Dawes, 23.
</P>
<P>
Challenging these veterans are two-time U.S. national all-
around champion Kristen Maloney, 19, Elise Ray, 18, the highest-
ranked U.S. gymnast at the 1999 World Championship, Vanessa Atler,
18, the vault champion and all-around runner-up at the 1999 U.S.
Championships, and 1999 U.S. World Championships team members of
Alyssa Beckerman, Jeanette Antolin, Jamie Dantzscher and Morgan
White.
</P>
<P>
At stake was the 12 top spots as they will advance to the
Olympic trials next month in Boston where the Olympic team will be
selected.
</P>
<P>
And it will be the first time for Bela Karolyi, who was
recalled to the national team last November as coordinator, to
inspect the women gymnasts in the pressure-packed competitions.
</P>
<P>
The United States finished a miserable sixth place at the World
Championships in China last October, an unacceptable fall for a
country that had taken the Olympic gold medal just three years ago.

<HEADLINE> No Compromise on Jerusalem, No Peace Agreement: Israeli Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- It is impossible to reach an
Israeli-Palestinian agreement without painful Israeli compromise on
the Jerusalem issue, Israel's left-wing Meretz party said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The secular Meretz maintained that any solution to the issue
should be based on "joint sovereignty," in which Israel controls
Jewish neighborhoods and the Palestinians control Arab villages in
East Jerusalem, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were published following the failure of the Camp
David summit near Washington. The summit was designed to find
solutions to the final status issues to pave the way for a
permanent peace deal by September between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides failed to bridge their differences over core
issues, especially the fate of Jerusalem, during the 15 days of
rough talks.
</P>
<P>
The issue is intractable as Israel regards the holy city as
its "eternal and undivided" capital, while the Palestinians want to
secure at least the eastern part of the city, which Israel captured
during the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of their own future
state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side rejected all the proposals short of giving
the Palestinians full sovereignty over the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meretz, which quitted Barak's government last month but has
vowed continued support for Barak's peace policy, is the most
dovish Israeli party regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, scores of Meretz supporters
demonstrated near Israeli Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv Thursday
morning, urging Barak, who also holds the Defense portfolio, to
continue peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Most of the demonstrators were youngsters under the age of
enlistment, who said they did not want to die in the next war --
referring to a possible violence between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that he would unilaterally declare an
independent Palestinian state if an agreement cannot be reached by
September 13 with Israel. It is feared that such a move might lead
to widespread violence, even a limited war, in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's domestic firms are projected to produce 1.3
million color TV sets in the current Iranian year starting March
20, an increase of 35.8 percent compared with the previous Iranian
year.
</P>
<P>
The glut of TV sets in Iran necessitate promotion of export, a
local official was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Iran-made TV sets enjoy a desirable level
of quality and are quite able to compete with foreign products.
</P>
<P>
Domestic production of various kinds of color television sets
saves the country some 80 million U.S. dollars annually, he added.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey imports are likely to exceed 48 billion U.S.
dollars in 2000, 2 billion higher than an earlier projection in the
government program, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government set an export target at 28.3 billion dollars and
a huge foreign trade deficit is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Five-month imports, according to figures released by the State
Statistics Organization Wednesday, totaled 20.4 billion dollars, up
37.6 percent from the same period in 1999 while exports over the
same period rose by a mere 4.8 percent to 11.2 billion. The deficit
reached 9.2 billion, up 122 percent compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
The State Minister responsible for the economy Tunca Toskay said
that Turkey would resort to effective trade policies such as quota,
supervision, anti-dumping and standardization to curb the sharp
deficit increase.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq's first computer center opened here on Thursday,
which would allow ordinary Iraqis to surf the Internet for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmad Murtadha
Ahmad Khalil cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has lagged far behind in information technology, with
people having had no access to the Internet, mainly due to the
sweeping sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1990 after its
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Eradicate Polio in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has vowed to
eradicate polio in three years, newspapers here reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, vaccination against polio will be
deliberately focused on districts sharing borders with Tanzania's
neighbors, said Caroline Akim of the Expanded Program on
Immunization at a seminar here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No polio cases had been traced in the country in the last two
years, the manager was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are now convinced that by the year 2003, Tanzania will be a
polio-free area," Akim said.
</P>
<P>
According to Akim, before the formal declaration of polio
eradication, a team of local experts will conduct a national
survey to satisfy themselves that the disease has been wiped off
from Tanzania's face. Then, an international team will come to see
for themselves whether polio has been wiped out in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Ministry of Health of Tanzania had announced to
spend around 1.5 million U.S. dollars on conducting immunization
of polio and measles in 19 regions in the country this year.
</P>
<P>
Polio vaccines will be given to children between one day and
five years old.
</P>
<P>
Polio is a crippling disease, caused by wild polio virus. The
disease can be prevented if the sanitary and hygiene conditions
are improved and especially if the children are vaccinated during
the first year of life.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Costs Belgian Farmers' Incomes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This has been estimated by the country's largest farmer union,
de Boerenbond. Other experts estimate the damages to be even
higher.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, there were too much rains in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, most of the wheat in the country will
have to be used for animal fodder since the quality of wheat is
too poor for bakers to use. Furthermore, the farmers will have to
fork out more money to let the wheat dry.
</P>
<P>
Other grains are also suffering from the constantly wet weather.
Grains are growing more slowly than they normally do.
</P>
<P>
The union is asking Belgian Agriculture Minister Jaak Gabriels
to look into ways of helping the hard-hit farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department has pointed out that
farmers' damages can be included in tax claims.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Federal Minister of
Transportation Isabelle Durant will revise the takeoff and landing
procedures of the planes in Belgian airports, local media said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister's announcement came after the Concorde crash near
Paris which killed 109 people on board and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most plane crashes happen just after taking
off or before landing. A study group of experts has been set up in
the transportation ministry to propose measures to improve safety
and to curb noise pollution around the airports, he said, adding
that the experts have two months to do their research.
</P>
<P>
The minister will then negotiate under results of the research
with people mainly living near the Brussels international airport,
the pilots and the airline companies about the revision of plane
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Durant also said that Belgium will not impose a ban on Concorde
planes because the supersonic aircraft rarely calls on Belgian
airports.

30 June 2000 was 127 million HK dollars (16.3 million U.S. dollars)
, a reduction of 26.4 million HK dollars (3.39 million U.S.
dollars), or 17.2 percent, compared with the same period last year,
said the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The HKMC said the annualized return on averaged shareholder's
equity was 10.4 percent (14.1 percent in 1999).
</P>
<P>
In the report of the half-year financial results, the HKMC said
the total assets increased by 18.5 percent, from 10.6 billion HK
dollars (1.36 billion U.S. dollars) to 12.5 billion HK dollars (1.
6 billion U.S. dollars), compared with the corresponding period
last year. There was a 1.5 million HK dollars (192,555 U.S.
dollars) write-back of provisions due to a reduction in the size
of the mortgage portfolio and the maintenance of good asset
quality. The capital-to-assets ratio remained strong at 11.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficult market environment, the HKMC has made
good progress in mortgage purchase and the Mortgage Insurance
Program (MIP) has gained wider acceptance by homebuyers as
evidenced by the rising trend in the number of applications.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Directors of the HKMC approved today the framework
for expanding the Mortgage Insurance Program (MIP) to cover
mortgage loans with loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of up to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The MIP was launched by the HKMC in March 1999 with the aim of
promoting home ownership in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the launch of the Program, the HKMC will conduct
a series of briefing and training sessions for the Approved
Sellers to help them familiarize with the new product. The HKMC
plans to launch the new product before the end of August 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China has ensured good quality of water supply to Hong Kong,
according a meeting on protecting the Dongjiang-Shenzhen water
supply system here today.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong pipes 1.1 billion cu m of water from the Dongjiang, a
tributary of the Pearl River to Hong Kong every year. The river is
also the major drinking water source for Shenzhen, a commercial
center in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
To keep the water from contamination, cities along the river
invested 430 million yuan (51.8 million US dollars) from 1993 to
1999 and the provincial government injected another 290 million
yuan (34.9 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
There are 51 monitoring centers along the river. They reported
that the river water is up to the state's standard for first- and
second-class water quality since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Heyuan City seated on the bank of Dongjiang adds more than 34,
000 ha of afforestation area every year along the river.
</P>
<P>
The economic zone of Shenzhen located at the lower reaches of
the river plans to spend 42 million yuan (5 million US dollars)
combating soil erosion along the river annually in the next five
years.

Chinese insurers are developing a range of new products. Ping
An Insurance and Xinhua Life both introduced Unit-linked policies,
Taikang Life and China Life introduced participating policies,
while Pacific Insurance now underwrites cash and jewelry, which
used to be rejected by all insurers.
</P>
<P>
The new products have been well-received by the market, as they
meet the changed needs of society and customers.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Ping An Insurance said the company earned several
million yuan in premium income on the first day when its unit-
linked policies were sold in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese insurers also moved to improve their management and
services. In June, PICC became the first company to open a
nationwide hotline providing 24-hour services to its customers.
China Life established customer service centers in its 3,400
branches nationwide and reshuffled its branches in provincial
capitals.
</P>
<P>
While speaking of the prospect for Chinese insurers after the
country's accession to WTO, CIRC chairman Ma Yongwei said that
though Chinese insurers are lagging far behind their foreign
counterparts in services and management, "if they work harder,

<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance sector is racing
against time as the country prepares to enter the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Regulators have been busy patching up holes in the legislation
system. They issued a decree on insurance firms early this year,
and are nearly ready to issue decrees on foreign-fund insurance
firms and loss adjusters. An amendment to the Insurance Law is
also on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Another major task before the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) is the establishment of a nationwide regulatory
network.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, CIRC inaugurated its first group of local
offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the most important
local markets in China.
</P>
<P>
According to CIRC chairman Ma Yongwei, similar offices would be
set up in all major cities by the end of the year.

In the past, Chinese insurers could only invest their premiums
in bank deposits and treasury bonds. Consecutive interest rate
cuts by the central bank imposed a serious threat to the solvency
of Chinese insurers who had been depending heavily on policies
with high interest payments.
</P>
<P>
Last October, insurers were allowed to invest up to five
percent of their assets in mutual funds. The ratio were raised to
10 to 15 percent for a few insurers this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said opening the securities market to insurers is
consistent with international practice.
</P>
<P>
An urgent task before the regulators and the insurers is to
make Chinese insurers financially strong as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Regulators will allow insurers to raise their equity capital
including introducing foreign share holders and listings on the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
This is relatively easy for China's young and smaller insurers,
most of which are share holding companies. But for solely-state-
owned giants such as China Life and the People's Insurance Company
of China (PICC) there is a lot more work to do.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzhang, the general manager of China Life, said
recently that his company would start a feasibility study later
this year to transform the company into a share holding firm.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, this would not only improve the firm's
financial strength, but also improve its corporate structure and
lead to better management.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua)-- Heritage experts recently warned
that if there is no environmental protection at the Huangguoshu
scenic spot, which has 18 waterfalls in China's southwest Guizhou
Province, it will disappear within 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Only 10.3 percent of the well-known tourism areas, covering 115
square kilometers, are planted with trees, less than one third of
the provincial average level of afforestation, Shanghai's 'Wenhui
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that water storage in the surrounding areas of
Huangguoshu has worsened. During the outgoing dry period this year,
lots of wells and springs nearby dried up. At the same time,
rubbish accumulated in the past years destroyed the natural beauty,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
A local official considered building a permanent outdoor
theater with 3,000 seats near the largest waterfall. However, the
provincial legislature vetoed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government decided to pour 280 million yuan (33.
7 million U.S. dollars) into a project to beautify Huangguoshu,
including a pollutant treatment system with three sewage plants.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities also plan to raise the forestation coverage
from the 10.3 percent to 48.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
By improving the environment, authorities want to have
Huangguoshu listed on the World Heritage of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israelis Tackle Security Cooperation After Summit Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli officials
Wednesday evening held a meeting here to discuss boosting security
cooperation in order to head off violence in view of the collapse
of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Secretary General Tayeb Abdul Rahim and Minister of
Civil Affairs Jamil Tarifi and Israeli Deputy Defense Minister and
Palestinian territory coordinator Jacob Ar attended the meeting,
according to Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
Both parties are currently eager to appease the situation in the
Palestinian territories, said Rahim after the meeting. The
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) hopes Israel will carry out
the 1993 Oslo accords, abide by its commitments and carry on final
status negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the declaration of Palestinian statehood, he said the
Palestinians wished that it would not be declared unilaterally
without Israel's support.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has repeatedly announced to
declare statehood in September after the interim phase expires,
even without an agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Israeli deputy defense minister said any
potential unilateral step would "lead to nothing and nowhere,"
reiterating that the peace process did not reach a deadlock
notwithstanding the Camp David summit failure.
</P>
<P>
However, both parties agreed that bloodshed was of no use and
that there had to be dialog between them so as to thwart violence.
</P>
<P>
Israel's army chief of general staff Shaul Mofaz emphasized that
Israel did not seek to use its forces and that it would do its
utmost to avoid violence.

<HEADLINE> Stateless Ethnic Chinese to get Indonesian Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- After decades of waiting, some 140,
000 stateless ethnic Chinese will finally get Indonesian
citizenship before the year end, Indonesia's Law and Legal Affairs
Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement issued by the ministry Wednesday,
145,070 out the 208,820 registered stateless ethnic Chinese in
Indonesian in 1993 has sent in applications for citizenship,
Antara News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the applications, 139,788 have been approved and 3,974
returned because they were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the government hoped to speed up the
naturalization process for all the stateless ethnic Chinese so
that their citizenship could be granted by December.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government had already simplified the
bureaucratic procedures to obtain Indonesian citizenship for these
people in line with the 1995 presidential decree.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the stateless ethnic Chinese in Indonesia dates
back to the early 1960s when the government barred Indonesians
from having two nationalities.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Continues Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended above
59 U.S. cents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Australian dollar was at 59.22 U.S. cents
from 58.76 the previous day.
</P>
<P>
There are speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia will
consider lifting official interest rates come September with
growing inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
There is less hope for the currency to go through the level of
60 U.S. cents in the near future because it is too vulnerable to
outside's shocks. Economists realized the real reason for the
weakness of the Australian dollars is the country's high debt.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Canberra continues its efforts to
restore the Chaudhry government in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said Thursday he would continue to push for the
restoration of Mahendra Chaudhry as elected Fijian prime minister
but did not expect Australia to become directly involved in the
restoration of democracy.
</P>
<P>
He denied an accusation from Fiji's latest appointed Prime
Minister Laisena Qarase who reportedly accused Australia and New
Zealand early Thursday of a "threatening and aggressive" stance
towards his country and called for sanctions imposed by the two
nations to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he was not aware of Mr. Qarase's remarks, but that
the accusation was wrong. "The measures we have imposed are not
damaging economic sanctions (but) we have said that there could be
further action taken if there is not a return to democratic rule,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Economy Back More than Eight Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The two month long political
crisis set Fiji's economy back more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, Fijian Minister
for Finance Ratu Jone Kubuabola said in a mini-budget address that
"it takes the economy back to where it was at the end of 1991."
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is forecast at a negative 15 percent this year,
in stark contrast to Fiji's new year projection of a positive four
percent.
</P>
<P>
One of the major industry earners, tourism, has been sharply
affected and arrivals are now projected to fall by more than 50
percent from the record levels seen in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of inflation was now expected to rise to five
percent, compared to a negative rate before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The situation will deteriorate further," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is now proposing tough cost-cutting
measures in line with a destined decline in revenues.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Expects Good Economic Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy is
expected to grow by 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent this year, the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said Thursday in its annual
report.
</P>
<P>
The MAS attributed the projected growth to continued strong
increase in exports, sustained recovery in consumption and a
turnaround in investments.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the growth momentum to be sustained for the rest of
2000 and to moderate only slightly next year," said Koh Yong Guan,
managing director of MAS, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"This is underpinned by the favorable outlook for the external
economic environment. Economic activity will be led by steady
growth in the manufacturing sector and a strong pick-up in the
services sectors, " Koh said.
</P>
<P>
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a robust pace of 9.1
percent in the first quarter of 2000, with growth propelled
largely by the manufacturing sector, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic spending is also expected to remain strong. We expect
the remaining slack in the economy to be taken up within the next
twelve months," Koh added.
</P>
<P>
Growth of the commerce and transport and communications sectors
also strengthened, while the financial services returned to
positive growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the only sector that continued to see
negative growth in the first quarter of 2000 was the construction
sector, which recorded double-digit declines in both private and
public construction activities.
</P>
<P>
As for regions outside Singapore, the report foresees "bright"
economic outlook for 2000 as private consumption is expected to
stay strong and consumer confidence continues to improve.
</P>
<P>
Stronger economies of Europe and Japan should offset any
slowdown in U.S. economic growth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the continuing boom in global electronics
demand also favors Asian exports.

<HEADLINE> ARF Participants See Positive Effects, Repercussions of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the statement, they said while the security outlook for the
Asia-Pacific region remained positive, there were uncertainties
and challenges, posed particularly by globalization.
</P>
<P>
By positive effects and repercussions, they said that included
greater economic interdependence among nations and multiplication
of security issues.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they stressed, it is necessary for nations to
strengthen their individual and collective capacities so as to
gain the capacity to meet the challenges affecting their common
security which comprises among other the economic, social and
human components.
</P>
<P>
As a step in the direction, they said they further agreed on
the need for the countries in the region to continue efforts, "
through dialogue and cooperation, at national and international
levels" to address the economic, social and political impact
bought about by globalization.
</P>
<P>
Only by so doing, they stressed, could the sustained economic
and social development be ensured and Asia-Pacific peace enhanced
within its frameworks.
</P>

DALIAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Frontier police in Dalian, a port
city in northeast China, has cracked a human trafficking gang and
caught 75 stowaways.
</P>
<P>
The "snakeheads" or human smugglers had stowaways from

LANZHOU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Since mid July, a heat wave has
hit Lanzhou, the capital of northwest China's Gansu Province,
which is known for its cool summers.
</P>
<P>
The city has experienced the hottest days of the season with
mercury touching 39.8 degrees Celsius, 4.6 degrees above normal,
setting a record high since 1932.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave drove up the sales of electric fans, air
conditioners, sunstroke prevention medicines, drinks and
watermelon.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou, an ideal place for spending a cool summer in the past
has become a furnace this summer. An elderly woman said she never

<P>
Hospitals have treated dozens of people suffering from
sunstroke. Some local residents even booked rooms in air-
conditioned hotels to avoid the heat wave, which is expected to
last two or three more days.
</P>

A tourist from Chongqing said he originally planned to travel
to Lanzhou to spend a cool summer, but it seemed that he "fell

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Peace Talks to Resume on Sunday: Negotiator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite the failure of the Camp
David talks in producing an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, the two
sides could resume their peace talks as early as Sunday, an Israeli
negotiator said Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gilad Sher, one of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
confidants who had participated in the Camp David summit, told
Israel Radio that, as he knew, it was already set that Israeli
chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb
Erekat will meet on Sunday to discuss various issues.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on the exact place where the two
negotiators will meet.
</P>
<P>
Sher was one of the major players in the so-called "back-channel
talks" between Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) in
Stockholm in May, which laid a foundation of the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
He is optimistic about the talks' future, saying it is possible
to finish the conflict and reach a reasonable agreement in "not too
long a time" if the two sides continue their talks.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit, attended by Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Untied States President Bill Clinton, collapsed
on Tuesday after the two sides failed to bridge their gaps on core
final-status issues, especially the fate of Jerusalem and the
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Barak returned to Israel Wednesday afternoon. Speaking at a
state ceremony at the airport, the prime minister said he believes
the negotiation with the Palestinians could resume within the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials also said that despite the summit failure,
it is possible for the three leaders to meet again at Camp David,
probably in August, in order to reach a peace deal ahead of the
September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had repeatedly threatened to declare Palestinian
independence in September, even unilaterally without a peace accord
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Such a scenario, analysts worry, could lead to a large-scale
violence between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, which would
cast clouds over the whole peace process.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Support for Somali Reconciliation Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has
reiterated Egypt's support for the peace and national
reconciliation process in Somalia, the government-run newspaper Al
Gomhuria reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will continue backing an initiative proposed by Djibouti
and its efforts aimed at helping restore peace, stability and unity
in Somalia, Moussa said late Wednesday, in response to a reporter's
question about Cairo's position on the Somali issue.
</P>
<P>
Djiboutian officials have accused Egyptian Ambassador to Somalia
Saleh Amin of disrupting Djibouti's peace efforts by dissuading
Somali faction leaders, including Hussein Aideed, head of a group
of the influential Somali National Alliance, from taking part in a
Somali reconciliation conference currently held in Djibouti, the
paper said in a report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Somali delegations at the conference organized a special meeting
to protest against the alleged activities of Amin and called on the
Egyptian government to recall him. The delegations were astonished
at the intervention by the Egyptian envoy in the Somali peace
process while Cairo has repeatedly expressed keenness on supporting
the peace talks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Amin has denied the accusation, saying that the charges were
baseless, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since Former President Siad Barre
was toppled in 1991. Some 460 Somali representatives, including
university professors, intellectuals, writers and tribal leaders,
opened the reconciliation conference in Djibouti May 2 in a bid to
select 225 members for the proposed Interim National Council, which
is designed to form a central government.

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Gain Access to Internet as First Computer Center Opens EDS-2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's first computer center was
opened here on Thursday, which would allow ordinary Iraqis to surf
the Internet for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmad Murtadha
Ahmad Khalil cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has lagged far behind in information technology, with
people having had no access to the Internet, mainly due to the
sweeping sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1990 after its
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision is to do our best to serve our people and give
them as much as we can. That is why we provide them with this
service," Khalil told the foreign and local media.
</P>
<P>
Khalil said his ministry has been making efforts to open more
computer centers and increase the number of computers to facilitate
the users.
</P>
<P>
The center is located in the Saadoun street in central Baghdad,
and it is expected that another four such centers will be opened in
the Iraqi capital soon.
</P>
<P>
Khalil told Xinhua that the charge for Internet services has not
been decided yet, but it will be known by the end of this week. "I
do not think it costs a lot," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that using the Internet costs about 2,000 Iraqi
dinars (one U.S. dollar) an hour.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the computer center should have been
opened a long time ago. He blamed the delay on "obstacles" placed
by the United States and British delegates at the United Nations
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
For the past seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-food program, only
12 percent of the contracts his ministry signed with foreign
countries were approved, Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, the U.S. and British representatives at the
committee "did not approve one dollar for Iraq's telecommunications
sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell crude to finance
imports of food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies to
alleviate the impacts of the decade-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has often accused the U.S. and Britain of blocking the
implementation of the U.N. program by putting on hold contracts it
signed with foreign countries, worsening the humanitarian crisis in
the country.

<HEADLINE> International Donor Meeting Opens in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight countries and
representatives from more than a dozen regional and international
lending institutions and humanitarian groups attended the
international donor conference that opened Thursday morning in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss and the U.N. Middle East envoy Terje
Roed-Larsen co-chaired the one-day meeting, which is designed to
attract money for the development of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon hopes to raise 260 million U.S. dollars at the
conference for the reconstruction in south Lebanon which saw the
withdrawal of Israeli troops in May after a 22-year occupation. But
the premier has admitted in advance that it is not likely to
produce any immediate financial pledges at the meeting on the
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
He told those participants that the people in south Lebanon are
in dire need of the help from international community so they can
restore their regular life and live with dignity.
</P>
<P>
"We Lebanese do not think the international community has made
full efforts to stop as early as possible Israel's occupation on
Lebanese territory, which is stipulated in several U.N.
resolutions. This delay let Lebanon to bear the disastrous result
of occupation and our economy was suffered by the war," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the plan of aid, he explained that the government
formulated a two-step program. "The first urgent aid program is
aimed for life requirement and the second is to improve people's
life and set economical and social infrastructure there."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will hold another donor meeting in October on the
ministerial level when the donors are scheduled to pledge the
amount of donations. Lebanon hopes to get more than 1.2 billion U.
S. dollars from donors, mainly European and Arab countries.

JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid was strongly urged here Thursday to soon bring former
President Soeharto and those were allegedly involved in the bloody

They asked the president to launch a comprehensive probe into
the bloody incident and try those were allegedly involved,
including former President Soeharto and other military officials.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto has to be brought to justice to account for his deed
in the July riots," a protester screamed, while the others voiced
their demands at the former military officials who were also
allegedly involved in the riots which believed to have killed
dozens of lives at that time.
</P>
<P>
The protesters named incumbent Governor of Jakarta Sutiyoso who
was Jakarta military commander and former Indonesia military (TNI)
chief Feisal Tandjung as the most responsible persons over the
riots.
</P>
<P>
After staging a ceremony at the front yard of the former PDI'
headquarters on Jl. Diponegoro, Central Jakarta, on Thursday
morning, the protesters then marched toward Soeharto's and
Sutiyoso's residences, but no clashes were reported during the
protest which backed by some student movements such as the
National Students League for Democracy (LMND), the Democratic
Peoples Party (PRD) and the Anti-New Order Regime Front.

<TEXT>
<P>
They made this clear in the Chairman's Statement issued after
the closing of the forum here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, they said that they intend to follow an
evolutionary approach towards the development of ARF role that,
they hoped, will proceed from "confidence-building" at first, then
to "preventive diplomacy," and finally to "elaboration of
approaches to conflict."
</P>
<P>
They in particular underscored the significance of confidence-
building, saying that it is a foundation and primary focus of ARF.
Confidence-building, they noted, will ensure the effective
implementation of related agreements or understandings reached by
its members and will meaningfully augment "the comfort level,
trust, confidence and understanding as well as cooperation" among
its members.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that ARF continue to move at a pace comfortable to all
its members, they nevertheless pledged that ARF will play its role
"as driving force" in regional peace and security, and will work
to evolve consensus on vital subjects of Asia-Pacific security.
</P>
<P>
ARF is an organ of ASEAN designed for promotion of confidence,
understanding and cooperation among its participants on the
security issues. It was initiated in 1993 and its members include
foreign minister of ASEAN, its dialogue partners and other
entities. China became its full member in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Contributes to Regional Peace, Stability and Development: Tang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- History has and will continue to
prove that China is a positive factor and major force in
safeguarding peace and promoting development, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Since we last met at this Forum, China has made new
contributions to peace, stability and development in the Asia-
Pacific region, " he said in his speech at the annual gathering of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
China has been vigorously pressing ahead with its reform and
opening-up, and its economy has maintained a fairly rapid growth
while taking a favorable and important turn, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-Strait relations, he said that China has firmly
implemented the fundamental principle of "peaceful reunification
and one country, two systems" and President Jiang Zemin's eight-
point proposal on the question of Taiwan, and worked hard to
advance the cause of peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Working continuously to develop goodneighborly and friendly
relations with its surrounding countries, China has signed or
issued documents on bilateral cooperation oriented towards the
21st century with most of the ASEAN member states, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the process of "Shanghai Five", namely, China,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, is "moving toward
in a sound manner and playing a significant role in promoting
regional and world peace and stability".
</P>
<P>
The active participation in East Asian cooperation and other
regional as well as international cooperation, he stressed, has
further strengthened the mutually beneficial cooperation between
China and other countries in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"We have always been supportive of the ARF dialogue and
cooperation, and actively participated in and successfully
implemented a number of Confidence-Building Measures (CBM)
Projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council
and a country in the Asia-pacific region, China will continue to
perform its duty in promoting peace and stability in the region
and the world at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China became a full member of ARF, which serves as a
multilateral consultative forum aimed at promoting preventive
diplomacy and confidence building among the nations in the Asia-
Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Belarus, China Set to Boost Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MINSK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Belarus and China will push their
bilateral relations to a new high in the new century, said a joint
statement signed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed at the end of a three-day official visit
to Belarus by Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao who arrived here
Tuesday night, deemed that it is in the fundamental interests of
the peoples of the two countries to enlarge and deepen across-the-
board cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reaffirmed the principles set in previous
documents and highly valued the achievements made in bilateral
cooperation in the political, economic and trade, scientific and
technological, and education fields.
</P>
<P>
China and Belarus expressed their willingness to expand and
deepen economic and trade cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit, pledging to uplift it to the level compatible with
their current friendly ties and economic potentials.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, both parties will enhance the role of the Sino-
Belarussian committee on cooperation in economy, trade, science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the two countries will create necessary
conditions for each other's enterprises to conduct economic
activities in each other's territory in accordance with their
respective laws, and help them establish direct contact.
</P>
<P>
It was of great significance to expand exchanges in culture,
education, press, tourism, social security and sports, as well as
the exchange of visits of youth associations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
China reiterated respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Republic of Belarus and the road of development
pursued by its people, supporting it in its efforts to vindicate
state sovereignty and national dignity and to enhance social and
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
China strongly opposes any interference in the internal affairs
of Belarus by any other country under any pretext and by exerting
political and economic pressure.
</P>
<P>
In return, Belarus reaffirmed that there is only one China in
the world, the government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legitimate one representing the whole China, and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
It expressed support for China's principled stance on
opposition to any attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Belarus vowed that it will never establish official ties with
Taiwan in any forms.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Hu held talks with Belarussian leaders
including President Alexander Lukashenko and Prime Minister
Vladimir Yermoshin.

<HEADLINE> China, Belarus to Strengthen Bilateral Cooperation, Says Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The joint declaration was signed here during the visit of
Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao with Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hold that the international relationship of the
21 century should be built on the basis of the U.N. Charter and
established norms of international law, the U.N.'s dominant
position in world affairs should be preserved and strengthened,
and international disputes should be settled by peaceful means,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Relations among nations should be "developed on the basis of
the U.N. Charter and the Five principles of Peaceful Co-existence,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the world is diversified and that "each
country has the right independently to choose the social system,
road of development and the value concept that fit in with its
national conditions."
</P>
<P>
"The two countries support the development of a multipolar
world and oppose the use of any pretexts to interfere with the
internal affairs of a sovereign state," the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
China and Belarus are dedicated, together with other countries,
to the establishment of a just and reasonable new international
political and economic order, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides said that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
(ABM) remains the cornerstone for global strategic stability and
should be fully and strictly observed. The Resolution on
Preservation of and Compliance with the ABM Treaty adopted at the
54th United Nations General Assembly is of great importance in
maintaining peace in the 21st century. Amending the treaty will
bring about most grave adverse consequences," it said.
</P>
<P>
"China firmly opposes any foreign country to incorporate
China's Taiwan into the so-called Theater Missile Defense system
while Belarus supports the principled stand of China," it said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will continue political dialogues and
exchanges at all levels including the highest level to consolidate
international security, deepen bilateral cooperation and enhance
mutual understanding and trust, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed his appreciation to the Belarussian side for their
cordial reception, and conveyed President Jiang Zemin's invitation
for Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko to visit China.
Lukashenko accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Hu arrived here Tuesday night for a three-day official visit at
the invitation of Belarussian President Lukashenko.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Welcome U.S. Court Ruling on Holocaust Settlement Sum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government, bankers and
representatives of Jewish organizations have welcomed Wednesday's
approval by a U.S. judge of the terms of a 1.25-billion-dollar
settlement between the Swiss banks and Holocaust victims for funds
blocked in Switzerland since the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Judge Edward Korman gave the banks and claimants
a week to resolve the remaining outstanding points of the
agreement, but said it would then take effect.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government greeted Korman's decision by saying the
ruling "represents a decisive step toward formal closure of the
relevant judicial proceedings against the two Swiss banks in the U.
S."
</P>
<P>
The government also said that the settlement "provides for a
complete legal and material resolution of Second World War related
issues for the Swiss economy as well as Swiss public entities."
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Switzerland's two main banks, UBS and
Credit Suisse, said, "the verdict reached by the U.S. district
judge, Korman, has cleared the way for the settlement to be made."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that those Holocaust survivors or their heirs with an
entitlement to the money from the fund will receive the amounts
they are due as soon as possible," said the two banks, which
agreed to the terms with the lawyers for plaintiffs in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The settlement means that the money could soon be disbursed
among about 600,000 claimants. But it is not clear when the
distribution plan will be finalized.
</P>
<P>
"The chapter seems to be closed," said Sigi Feigel, honorary
president of Federatong, Switzerland's main Jewish organization.
</P>
<P>
The claimants said they or their relatives deposited the funds
in Swiss banks as a safe haven during the wartime era, but were
unable to retrieve the money and other goods after the war.
</P>
<P>
The Volcker commission, investigating the issue of dormant
accounts, concluded last year that up to 54,000 may have been
opened in Swiss banks by Holocaust victims. It cleared the banks
of systematically destroying the records of victims' accounts, but
said there was evidence of "deceitful actions by some banks".

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Hails Japan-DPRK Foreign Ministers Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
on Thursday lauded Wednesday's meeting between the foreign
ministers of Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK), describing the first-ever meeting as "very significant."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the foreign ministers met is very significant,"
Mori told reporters at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and his DPRK counterpart,
Paek Nam Sun, held talks in Bangkok, Thailand, on the sidelines of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum on
security issues.
</P>
<P>
Kono and Paek agreed at the meeting to hold a postponed second
round of talks on normalizing ties between the two countries in
Tokyo on August 21-25, and pledged joint efforts to improve
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hidenao Nakagawa said Wednesday's meeting yielded
significant results.
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting between Japan and the DPRK at the
foreign minister's level, so it was significant in itself, the top
government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Although there was a limitation in time and the ministers
could not go into individual matters, the meeting mapped out a
direction for two major issues, reducing tension on the Korean
Peninsula and improving relations" between Japan and the DPRK,
Nakagawa said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from Japan and the DPRK met in April in Pyongyang
to resume normalization talks which collapsed in 1992, but the
second round, set for late May, was postponed.

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Marcelo Rios, angered
when his opponent served before he was ready, and was defaulted in
the first round for swearing at the chair umpire on Wednesday at
the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Third-seed Rios trailed 5-3 behind in the first set against

TOKYO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China made a clean sweep of all the
seven titles offered at the Asian junior badminton championships
after Sang Yang and Zheng Bo landed the boy's pair gold medal
Thursday in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>

Dwi Kuncoro of Indonesia 15-12, 15-5 to win the boys' singles
title, setting up Sang and Zheng for the chance of the Chinese
sweep.
</P>
<P>
All the other three individual finals were all-Chinese affairs,
but it was not a happy ending for girls' singles top seed Wei Yan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2010 iron and steel
will no longer be the pillar products of the Beijing-based Capital
Iron and Steel Company (CISC), also known as Shougang, when its
sales volume of high and new technological products reaches 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jimin, general manager, said the enterprise will first
lower iron and steel output from today's eight million tons to six
million tons in two years. Non-iron or steel output value will
exceed 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
CISC will use its two million sq m of land in the downtown area
for real estate and service industries. It is also planning to
establish a complete microelectronics production chain from chip
designing and manufacturing to computer production.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to expand its business in Asia, Europe and
America by making use of the Hong Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said their steel and iron company in Peru is progressing
smoothly. The joint venture in Zimbabwe is also running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the company's chips for electronic watches and TV
remote controllers now occupy 50 percent of the domestic market.
Robots, touch-screen computers, and auto air-conditioners also
have a bright future.

with the last close.
</P>
<P>
Total trading value was 14.46 billion yuan, 25.74 percent more
than Wednesday's 11.5 billion yuan, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
After the Shanghai Composite Index hit a new high 2,025, led by
banking stocks and blue chips, the index edged up above the 2000-
point level. This is the second time that the index high was
rewritten this week.
</P>
<P>
Pudong development Bank and Sichuan Changhong were today's
market bellwethers, which had not performed actively in the past
few months. The move stimulated investors' sentiments, and the
turnover greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
Some Special Treatment (ST) stocks also performed actively
today.
</P>
<P>
Bohai Group Co., Ltd. was the top gainer. Its price rose ten
percent to the ceiling of 10.87 yuan per share due to the company'
s restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Harbin Air Conditioning Co., Ltd. was the biggest loser. Its
price shed 7.82 percent to 22.86 yuan per share.

coming off its session high of 62.01 points in early trade.

<P>
Turnover stood at 205 million yuan, which was 29 million yuan
or 16.48 percent more than Wednesday's total, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Low-priced stocks began to attract some bargain hunters, as the
index had been clawing back gains toward the break-even point.
</P>
<P>
Among another batch of earnings reports today, which showed
rather embarrassing results though the majority were still on the
plus side, Jintai reported net earnings of a paltry 0.0013 yuan
per share, little improved from 0.0014 yuan per share in the year-
earlier period.
</P>
<P>
The market failed to go much further as investors' concerns
about continued growth in corporate profits had been weighing on
the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Gainers beat losers by 25 to 14, with 16 unchanged.

BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua)-- China's treasuries stayed stable
today. Of the six current bonds, one slid slightly, two saw tame
rises, while the remaining half closed unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Trading value today was 1.41 billion yuan, up 135 million as
compared to yesterday, according to Homeway, China's leading on-
line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Both 009704 and 010004, the new ten-year floating-rate bond,
picked up by 0.07 percent. However, the former witnessed a thin
trade volume of 33 million yuan, indicating the slack buying
interest.
</P>
<P>
009908 edged down 0.03 percent to 102.13 yuan, accompanied by a
big turnover of 937 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The stock composite indices closed at new record highs today,
so it is difficult for the T-bonds to turn active. However, the
expanding turnover on bonds may suggest that some conservative
investors begin to add treasuries in their assets portfolios amid
concerns for potential correction in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The combined turnover of three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-
day repo transactions amounted to 5.31 billion yuan, four times
the figure for the previous trading day.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that the Information Technology (IT) agreements signed in
the United States during the working visit of President Joseph
Estrada would provide more job opportunities for young Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in press release here
that the agreements witnessed by President Estrada in San
Francisco, the first leg of his working visit, would benefit the
labor force, a large part of which is already IT-oriented.
</P>
<P>
"We might not hear about it, but so many of our fellow
Filipinos are being employed in IT companies. Some of them are
simple, but very well-paying," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government has laid down the foundations for
IT, as shown by the mushrooming of many new technology centers in
the country.
</P>
<P>
These include centers in Clark and Subic in Central Luzon, and
Eastwood, Fort Bonifacio and Filinvest in southern Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Zamora cited America Online (AOL), one of the world's largest
Internet service providers, which employs Filipinos to handle
technical support calls.
</P>
<P>
"AOL employs more than 1,000 people in the Philippines," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zamora, the president has witnessed the signing of
five agreements between Philippine and U.S. firms during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Estrada left here Monday night for his eight-day first official
working visit to the United States in an effort to further cement
bilateral ties and cooperation.

MANILA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada

Central Mindanao, the military said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here, Gen. Angelo Reyes, chief of the

deployed in Mindanao to combat rebels' insurgency and promote
peace efforts in the area, while the remaining 30 percent or 3,000
will be assigned in Luzon and Visayas.
</P>
<P>
"We need the CAFGU so that peace efforts would also be
accelerated," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment will enable us to protect communities from the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) terroristic activities and to
ensure that the rehabilitation efforts will be unhampered," Reys
said.

He noted that over the past six years, the ARF has played a
positive role in enhancing dialogue, understanding and cooperation,
and has gradually formed an operational mechanism of its own.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism has made the ARF attractive as ever, " he said,
"its membership is increasing, and the approach it has initiated
is winning increasing support of the people."
</P>
<P>
He hereby welcomed the formal entry of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) into the forum.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, as the ARF enters its seventh year, issues
such as where it should go and how it should develop are again
placed on the Forum's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China agrees that the ARF should continuously move
forward towards its set objectives, and hopes that it will, in the
light of the region's feature of diversity, further strengthen
dialogue, enhance mutual understanding and trust between its
members, while helping to foster in the region a security
mentality and model that confirms to the trend of the times.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side agrees to the idea that the ARF should
consolidate and deepen the confidence-building measures and, at
the same time, explore and discuss the question of preventive
diplomacy in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 23-member ARF is now the biggest inter-governmental forum
for security dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> China to Start Dredging Pearl River Estuary in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Dredging of the Pearl River estuary
in south China's Guangdong Province will start in September,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The Pearl River is the second busiest inland river in China.
The Pearl River Delta has also grown into one of China's most
developed industrial bases in the past two decades. Coastal ports
on the Pearl River estuary empty an annual average of 70.98
million tons of silt into the sea. The silting has caused the
estuary to become smaller and limited the region's flood combating
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Provincial Headquarters for Dredging of the Pearl
River Estuary, was set up in Zhuhai recently, an important coastal
port city on the western bank of the estuary, to ensure the
success of the work.
</P>
<P>
Information from the organization said that the dredging will
be carried out in several stages and will take ten years to
complete. By then, the Pearl River estuary will be able to
discharge floodwater from a most serious flooding in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the dredging work will cost 50 million yuan
(about 6.02 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Mountainous Area More Environmental Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Kui, 39, has planted much
more hectares of trees than crops over the past three years in
northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang lives in Qidaojiang Village close to Mount Changbai,
which stretches southeast into the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK). Chinese government set up a nature reserve in Mount
Changbai in 1960 to protect the local environment.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has planted more than 10,000 trees since 1997. The forest
he planted is now home to wild rabbits and pheasants.
</P>
<P>
According to his calculation, the five hectares of poplars,
pines, walnut trees, and apple trees would bring him at least 200,
000 yuan (24,100 U.S. dollars) annually in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
More and more farmers in Mount Changbai voluntarily set up
various ecological reserves.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in China's major mountainous areas have come to realize
that they could both protect the environment and make profits by
planting trees. "Wanna become rich, go planting trees" was among
those popular slogans whitewashed on walls along country roads
across China.
</P>
<P>
A bureau chief in charge of forestry in northwest China's
Shaanxi province was removed from the office since local farmers
reported his wrong doing of deforestation to the government.
</P>
<P>
Scientific researchers and technicians in Jilin Province
introduced local farmers a comprehensive way of planting crops,
medicinal herb and fruits in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xianzhong, a professor with Jilin University, noted that
as China is the most populated country in the world, China should
adopt an eco-policy to protect and make better use of its
resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to make the
community service sector a major source of jobs for laid-off
workers in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zuoji, Minister of Labor and Social Security, said here
recently that China will take measures to further develop
community service and help more laid-off workers get re-employed.

<HEADLINE> China's Coal Export Expects to Hit 40 Million Tons This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China expects to export 40 million
tons of coal this year, as the country is expanding coal exports
and world market shares by stepping up construction of export coal
production bases and improving coal quality.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Coal Industry News, China is the
world's largest coal producer, but its coal export accounted for
only 2 percent to 3 percent of the country's total coal output.
</P>
<P>
To expand coal export is of great significance for the
sustainable development of China's coal industry, which can
effectively reduce coal stockpile and achieve balance between coal
supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that China has great potential for coal
export. The pressing problem facing the country's coal export is
to improve coal quality and lower production cost.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has to step up construction of ports and
railways for the purpose of transporting coal.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited experts as saying that China's coal export is
very likely to hit between 200 million to 300 million tons in a
few years if the sector continues to do well.
</P>
<P>
In addition, with China's entry into WTO, China will also
increase coal imports to diversify its coal products and increase
quality coal supply.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After meeting with Shas leader Eli Yishai at the Knesset
(parliament) Wednesday, Israel's Likud presidential candidate Moshe
Katsav told the Jerusalem Post that Shas and the presidency are "in
my pocket."
</P>
<P>
Yishai did not make any promise in advance of Shas spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's decision on whether to endorse a
candidate or give his legislators freedom to vote, but Katsav said
he emerged from the meeting confident that Shas' 17 votes will
bring him victory in the secret ballot in the Knesset on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, back in Israel Wednesday
after the collapse of the Camp David summit, believes that
negotiations with the Palestinians will resume within the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak believes that both Israel and the Palestinians have a
common interest in preventing any deterioration into a violent
conflict over a unilateral Palestinian declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
At a short ceremony at Ben-Gurion Airport, Barak said that "In
your names, in the names of the millions of eyes still looking,
hoping and praying, I promise not to despair, not to tire, not to
stop pursuing peace."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat received a hero's welcome
when he landed at the Gaza Strip International Airport Wednesday,
returning home after two weeks of peace talks at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stopped off in Alexandria for a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak. At the end of the one-hour meeting, Arafat
said "the (Camp David) talks were especially difficult, not just
over Jerusalem, but also over the right of refugees to return to
their homes."
</P>
<P>
"We came with the determination not to cede our rights.
Jerusalem is not only for the Palestinians, it is for the
Palestinians, for the Arab nations, for the Christians, and for
Muslims everywhere," he later told reporters in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak has decided that he must set up a coalition that will
pursue the peace process, and that he will consider a national
unity government only if violence with the Palestinians seems
imminent, a source close to him said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Wednesday night that he would deal with coalition
matters Thursday. The best option right now seems to be to absorb
both Shas and Meretz into the cabinet, without former coalition
partners Yisrael Ba'aliya and the National Religious party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak is also preparing for the possibility of
forming a national unity government with Likud. Barak phoned Likud
Chairman Ariel Sharon Wednesday night to invite him to a meeting
Thursday evening "for an update on the Camp David summit."

<P>
WELLINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark said here Thursday that Fiji is "declining into a
state of anarchy."
</P>
<P>
Clark's comment came after she learned that two New Zealanders
working for Air Fiji had been abducted in Fiji by supporters of
coup leader George Speight.
</P>

"It is unacceptable for New Zealand citizens to be caught up in
Fiji's domestic problems," the Television NZ quoted the prime

</P>
<P>
It is reported that the pilots of Maurice Parsons and James
Henry, both working for Air Fiji, were taken hostage Thursday

<HEADLINE> Promote Positive Factors, Restrict Negative Ones for Regional Security: Tang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said the Asia-Pacific region is now facing the question of
"how to promote positive factors" and "restrict the negative ones"
in the region's security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 7th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) on Thursday here,
he said the evolution of the security situation in the Asia-
Pacific region has not only left us profound lessons, but also
offered us a useful inspiration.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the maintenance of national unity, territorial
integrity, independence and sovereignty, he warned that "any
attempt to cut the bonds of fraternity of a people, or betray and
undermine the unity and territorial integrity of a nation will
only lead to tension in the region, and will therefore be firmly
opposed by the people throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
He noted that mutual understanding and mutual trust, and
healthy and stable relations between states are the political
foundations of the security.
</P>
<P>
Noting the importance of pursuing the most extensive common
interests of countries in the region, he said, "Asia-Pacific peace
cannot and should not be based on the pursuit of just a few
countries' interests or the consolidation of their superiority."
</P>
<P>
Dialogue, cooperation and the approach of seeking common ground
while reserving differences are the best way to realize and
maintain peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
ARF, comprising 10 ASEAN member states, Papua New Guinea (
observer), 10 dialogue partners, Mongolia and Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, is a multilateral consultative mechanism on
peace and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> New Guangzhou Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of New Guangzhou
Baiyun Airport will be finished in 2002 and it will be put into
service the following year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Zhang Chunlin, President of
Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, said advanced foreign expertise would be
introduced to operate the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pledged that they would work harder to ensure the quality
of the new airport.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, construction of the terminal building for
the New Guangzhou Baiyun Airport has started and local residents
have been relocated.
</P>
<P>
Other supporting facilities such as a highway connecting the
construction site, power and water supply facilities are all ready
in service, and the construction of two control towers is underway.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will be built in several stages with designs
provided by Parsons Corp. and URS Greiner Corp, two U.S. firms,
and the Guangdong Provincial Architectural Design Institute.
</P>
<P>
It will be located in the city of Huadu and will cover an area
of 1,456 hectares, about four times the area of the Baiyun Airport.
</P>
<P>
Baiyun airport in the suburbs of Guangzhou is the country's
busiest airport, and has long been overburdened by increasing
passengers and cargo.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is expected to cost a total of 20 billion yuan
(about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars), 49 percent of which will be
covered by the Guangzhou Transport Investment Co. Ltd. The first-
phase construction will cost about 10 billion yuan (about 1.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
By 2010, when the airport is fully completed, it will be able
to handle 80 million arrivals and departures and one million tons
of cargo annually.

<HEADLINE> Ten thousand Officials Demoted for Incompetence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Chinese officials
at or above the county level have been demoted or removed from
their posts for incompetence over the past five years, according
to sources from the Ministry of Personnel.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the central authorities and local governments
have paid much emphasis to deepening the reforms of the personnel
system, in which the capable are promoted and the incompetent
demoted.
</P>
<P>
This has fundamentally changed the previous cadre management
system in which only those who made mistakes are demoted or
removed.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces, including North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, have established new ways of cadre assessment.
From 1996 to 1999, over 260 officials in the region stepped down
for poor performances.
</P>
<P>
In the Central China provinces of Hunan and Hubei, a probation
system for officials has been widely adopted. Those who prove
incompetent after working for a certain time on trial basis, are
removed from posts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM: China Opposes NMD, TMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here Thursday that China opposes National Missile
Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 7th Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum (ARF), Tang pointed out that the development of NMD
and TMD will surely disrupt the global strategic balance and lead
to a new round of arms race.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, will produce wide-spread and deep-going negative
influence on the efforts for international peace, security,
international disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the new changes in the political and security
situation in the Asia-Pacific region, Tang stressed that the
region is continuously moving towards peace and development, "but
some negative factors have also grown, posing challenges to its
security."
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he pointed out that the economy of East Asia
is recovering rapidly and promising a good prospect.
</P>
<P>
East Asia's cooperation has made notable progress and is
playing a significant role in promoting the regional growth and
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
While noting the friendly ties between Asian countries are
growing closer and stronger, he said, China and relevant ASEAN
members have made positive progress in their efforts to increase
trust, dissolve suspicion and settle disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the historic summit between the north and
south of the Korean Peninsula and the signing of the Joint
Declaration "have reinforced the momentum of relaxation of the
situation on the Peninsula, and contributed to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
But he said, on the other hand, the Cold-War mentality is still
affecting the way some countries perceive world politics and
international relations. Bilateral military alliances are
consolidating.
</P>
<P>
Such developments, he noted, are compromising the regional
confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the
regional security.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, globalization and the Asian financial
crisis repercussions have also adversely affected the Asia-Pacific
security.
</P>
<P>
"Separatist forces are asserting themselves more aggressively.
The rich-poor gap is widening. Ethnic and religious conflicts are
cropping up one after another. The traditional and non-traditional
security of some countries is now under increasing pressures," he
said.
</P>
<P>
ARF is a consultative organ of ASEAN focusing on security,
political and military issues in the Asia-Pacific region. In 1996,
China became its full dialogue partner.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- While the rate of youth suicide
has decreased slightly for the third year in a row in New Zealand,
too many young New Zealanders are still taking their lives.
</P>
<P>
Suicide is the second leading cause of death in the 15 to 24
year age group in the country, following motor vehicle crashes,
according to a Thursday's press release of the New Zealand
government.
</P>
<P>
Provisional statistics for 1998 show there were 138 young
people aged between 15 and 24 years of age who died by suicide in
New Zealand with a population of around 3.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
It compared with 142 in 1997, 143 in 1996, and 156 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Maria Cotter, a senior analyst with the New Zealand Ministry of
Youth Affairs, said the reasons behind youth suicide are extremely
complex.
</P>
<P>
"This means there are no easy answers. There is no one cause
and no one way to address it. The community as a whole, as well as
the ministry and other agencies involved in young people's welfare,
have to take ownership of the problem and work together to reduce
suicide," she said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil ended Argentina's
winning record by beating its arch-rivals 3-1 in a World Cup
qualifier on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil made six changes to the team which went down by 1-2 to
Paraguay last week. One of the newcomers, striker Alex, scored
the first goal for the four-times world champions.
</P>
<P>
Brazil went into the match under tremendous pressure for
gaining only eight points from five games, yet got the perfect
start with a sixth minute goal by Alex.
</P>
<P>
Argentina took 20 minutes to find their rhythm, with Ariel
Ortega giving the Brazil defense plenty of problems.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil increased the lead in first half injury time when
Vampeta scored an excellent goal.
</P>
<P>
Brazil were still celebrating when Argentina pulled a goal back.
Substitute Almeida, who had replaced the injured Javier Zanetti,
scored with a powerful left-foot drive.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes into the second half, Vampeta scored his second
goal in the match, helping Brazil regain its two-goal advantage.
</P>
<P>
Argentina remained top of the South American qualifying group
with 15 points from six games while Brazil moved into second place
with 11, ahead of Uruguay on goals scored.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Wells Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists have discovered some
rare wells dating back to 2,000 years ago in this northern port
city.
</P>
<P>
They reported that there are seven wells belonging to the
Warring States period (475-221 BC) and 11 to the Han Dynasty (202
BC- 260 AD). Most of them are shallow, only one to two meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The finding shows that ancient people used soil, bricks and
wood to construct the wells.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists have also discovered several pottery pots for
fetching water and some spindles, shovels and grindstones.
</P>
<P>
The most rare relic is a wooden slip on which some Taoist words
were inscribed.
</P>
<P>
The wells were found in a village in Ji county in the suburbs
of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The finding is expected to provide clues to the study of
ancient people's living conditions around Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Development Zone to Become Cyber-culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin Economic and Technological
Development Zone, the most rapidly growing development zone in
China, has initiated a digitalization project recently.
</P>
<P>
The project is in essence a "e-community" established to be
home to several thousand of businesses in the Development Zone
aiming at supporting e-business by building an information
platform.
</P>
<P>
The cyber-project also offers on-line education and all other
information services in addition to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that the Tianjin Development Zone has
been leading all the other development zones in China by
accomplishing 11.96 billion yuan (over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars)
of GDP during the first half of this year, an increase of 21
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative businesses and
exclusively foreign-owned enterprises in the development zone
reported 2.85 billion yuan of profits during the first five months
of this year, an increase of 15 percent over the same period last
year. And all indicators in the economic performances of these
enterprises during the period were the best in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Motorola and Samsung contributed more than half of the total
output value of the development zone during the January-May period.
</P>
<P>
The development zone has also approved 63 foreign investment
projects involving 503.6 million U.S. dollars of overseas capital
in the January-June period.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Chinese FM's Speech at the 7th ARF Meeting (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan made a speech at the 7th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
Foreign Minister Meeting here Thursday. The following is the full
text of the speech:
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the political and security
situation in the Asia-Pacific region is undergoing new changes. On
the whole, the Asia-Pacific region is continuously moving towards
peace and development, and gaining a positive and encouraging
momentum. However, some negative factors have also grown, posing
challenges to the Asia-Pacific security.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the economy of East Asia is recovering rapidly
and promising a good prospect. East Asia's cooperation has made
notable progress and is playing a significant role in promoting
the regional growth and stability. The friendly ties between Asian
countries are growing closer and stronger. The relations between
some big countries, having suffered from serious setbacks, are
beginning to improve. Dialogue and cooperation have now become a
dominant characteristic of the relations between Asian nations.
China and relevant ASEAN members have made positive progress in
their efforts to increase trust, dissolve suspicion and settle
disputes by peaceful means. China and Vietnam have successfully
concluded a treaty on their land border. The historic summit
between the north and south of the Korean Peninsula and the
signing of the Joint Declaration have reinforced the momentum of
relaxation of the situation on the Peninsula, and contributed to
peace and stability in Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Cold-War mentality is still affecting
the way some countries perceive world politics and international
relations. Bilateral military alliances are consolidating.
Multinational military exercises are increasing. Some people are
hawking the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) Program against the tide
of our times. Such developments are compromising the regional
confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the
regional security. In the meantime, globalization and the Asian
financial crisis repercussions have also adversely affected the
Asia-Pacific security. Separatist forces are asserting themselves
more aggressively. The rich-poor gap is widening. Ethnic and
religious conflicts are cropping up one after another. The
traditional and non-traditional security of some countries is now
under increasing pressures.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific security situation and its evolution have
drawn the attention of the international community. The question
before all of us in this region now is how to promote positive
factors for the Asian-Pacific security and restrict the negative
ones, and how to foster in this region, a security order and model
that can help secure an enduring peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
History is a mirror. The evolution of the security situation in
the Asia-Pacific region has not only left us profound lessons, but
also offered us a useful inspiration.
</P>
<P>
First, a long-lasting peace in the Asia-Pacific region hinges
on the stability and development of each and every country of the
region. The maintenance of national unity, territorial integrity,
independence and sovereignty is essential to the security and
tranquillity of Asian nations and the region at large. Any attempt
to cut the bonds of fraternity of a people, or betray and
undermine the unity and territorial integrity of a nation will
only lead to tension in the region, and will therefore be firmly
opposed by the people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Second, Asia's security also depends on the development of
normal, healthy and stable relations between Asian nations. What
matters to the Asia-Pacific security is not the change in the
balance of strength between countries, but what attitude or
policies that countries would adopt to handle their relations with
others. Facts have proved time and again that only mutual respect
and mutual trust can lead to peaceful coexistence and, hopefully,
security in the Asia-Pacific region. Without mutual respect and
mutual trust, harmony between countries will be disrupted, and
regional stability can hardly be secured. Mutual understanding and
mutual trust, and healthy and stable relations between states
constitute the political foundation of the Asia-Pacific security
and are what we should work to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Third, the pursuit of most extensive common interests is an
important way to maintain the Asia-Pacific security. Countries in
the Asia-Pacific vary from one another in terms of national
conditions or interests. However, as globalization accelerates,
their common interests will increase. For example, they all wish
to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation so as to promote
economic development, and narrow the North-South gap. They all
wish to avoid risks brought about by globalization and reap
tangible benefits from the process. Asia-Pacific peace depends on
the common progress and prosperity of all countries in the region.
Asia-Pacific peace cannot and should not be based on the pursuit
of just a few countries' interests or the consolidation of their
superiority. Asian nations, having gone through the financial
crisis, are deeply aware of this and feel strongly about it.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, dialogue, cooperation and the approach of seeking
common ground while reserving differences are the best way to
realize and maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region. There are two different voices or propositions as to how
we should maintain the Asia-Pacific peace. One is for military
build-up and strengthening military alliances. Such policy is far
from leaving the historical stage. The other is for promoting
dialogue and cooperation, and enhancing understanding and trust.
This approach is increasingly popular and striking roots in the
hearts of the people. Numerous facts have shown more and more
clearly that the former will only reduce trust and cause tensions
while the latter can help bridge differences and eliminate
obstacles.

<HEADLINE> Global E-Commerce Penetration Stands at 10 Percent, Study Reveals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A worldwide study of e-
commerce released Wednesday found that among Internet users around
the globe, about 10 percent shop online during a month.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 15 percent of Internet users say they have
considered shopping online, but have not yet done so, according to
the study conducted by Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Interactive, a U.
S.-based Internet research business. The findings are based on
more than 30,000 interviews in 27 countries and regions on four
continents.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the United States has the highest
proportion of Internet users, with 58 percent of the population,
and also the highest proportion of shoppers online, 27 percent. In
contrast, only 1 percent of users currently shop online in both
Thailand and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The potential for online shopping among existing Internet
users worldwide may realistically double in a relatively short
time if those users who say they have considered shopping online,
but have not yet done so, can be turned into actual shoppers,"
said the TNS.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, there are clearly a number of barriers
to overcome before online shopping can really take off globally.
The Internet is still a relatively new channel for most users and
many are still skeptical about it. E-commerce businesses need to
give more thought to how they present the online shopping
experience to potential customers. Local governments and tax laws
also stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
The study found interesting local differences among Internet-
related shopping behaviors in different countries and regions. In
India, for example, 83 percent of users have never shopped online
and have no plans to do so, compared with 36 percent in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The largest purchase of food and grocery products online is in
Hong Kong (32 percent of users), the largest online business of
leisure travel is in France (44 percent). Toiletries and
cosmetics online business catches the most shoppers in Japan (12
percent), compared with virtually none in the U.K.
</P>
<P>
Internet users in France buy the most stock and mutual funds
online -- 17 percent, compared with 2 percent in the U.K. More
than one in five of online shopping in the United States relates
with clothing items compared with 10 percent in the U.K.

<P>
"It is an alarming situation as 15 percent of those tested are
shown to be affected by the disease," lab chief at the hospital
Amar Thakur told the press.
</P>
<P>
"If treatment is not done in time, thousands of people may die
of Kala-azar," he added.
</P>
<P>
The administration in the four affected districts -- Parsa,
Bara, Rautahat and Sarlahi -- have not yet taken any measures to
combat the disease, a local report said.

<HEADLINE> Barcelona Ready to Sell Six Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's new coach Llorenc Serra
Ferrer has decided to sell six international players who are
surplus to the club's requirements, according to reports by
Spanish state television on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spanish state television said on Wednesday, Serra Ferrer has
told goalkeepers Vitor Baia and Ruud Hesp, defenders Frederic Dehu,
Winston Bogarde and Samuel Okunowo and midfielder Jari Litmanen
they can all start looking for new clubs for the new season.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese international Baia is the big surprise on the list.
He has just returned from a loan spell at Porto and was widely
expected to be staying on after the departure of Van Gaal.
</P>
<P>
Okunowo also spent last season on loan at Benfica and the
Nigerian defender was not expected to be invited back into the
first team.
</P>
<P>
Dutch international goalkeeper Hesp has been at the Nou Camp
for the last three seasons but lost his place last term after a
poor spell.
</P>
<P>
Dutch international defender Winston Bogarde may head for
England's premier league.
</P>
<P>
Finnish midfielder Litmanen and French centre-back Dehu both
arrived on free transfers last summer but failed to win a post in
the starting lineup as they struggled for form and fitness.
</P>
<P>
Dutch winger Boudewijn Zenden, who had an excellent performance
at Euro 2000, is also expected to leave the club, with Lazio

<HEADLINE> Tennis Indoor Stadium Not Appropriate for ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) secretary-general Leo Chandra Wiranata considers
the Senayan Tennis Indoor Stadium here inappropriate to host the
JVC Asian Badminton Championships (ABC) in November.
</P>
<P>
"You saw how crowded the venue was during the final (of the
recent Indonesia Open), especially during the men's singles when
Taufik Hidayat faced Ong Ewe Hock of Malaysia. Can you imagine
what would have happened if Taufik lost?" Wiranata was quoted as
saying by the Jakarta Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The spectators were too close to the courts and it could have
endangered the safety of the players," he added.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 people thronged the stadium on Sunday, exceeding
the maximum capacity of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
Ong complained that some spectators threw mineral water bottles
at him when he defeated local opponent Johan Hadikusuma in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Wiranata said the most appropriate venue was either the Senayan
Indoor Stadium or the Jakarta Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
"We can set up the stadium as we did for the Thomas Cup final
championships in 1990 but it will cost a lot, especially nowadays
with sponsors being hard to get. The most ideal place is the
convention center which has an underground tunnel to the nearby
Hilton Hotel. But definitely, it will cost a fortune as the rent
fee is much higher than the stadium," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ABC's venue was decided in the Asian Badminton
Confederation executive council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wiranata said if the event was staged outside Jakarta, only
three cities -- Surabaya, Semarang and Surakarta -- had the
facilities to do so.
</P>
<P>
He said PBSI and IMG, who hold the event rights, must consider
Indonesia's reputation as host.
</P>
<P>
"We should take care in our image, especially if Chinese
players are competing in the event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will not only stage the championships but also host
the annual general meeting and the referees certification.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Enterprises Seek Business Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen enterprises in north
China's largest port city Tianjin invested some 14 million U.S.
dollars abroad in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This has added the total number of enterprises investing
overseas to 340 in the municipality, involving a total investment
of 216 million U.S. dollars in 72 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Of the 340 enterprises, 187 are trade related. 24 are engaged
in service industry and 53 are production firms.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Tianjin-funded production enterprises are based in
Africa, some East European countries, and Cuba. Their projects
involve pharmaceuticals, ice creams, bicycles, plastic articles
and textile.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Tianjin Municipal Foreign Trade and
Economic Commission said though flowing-in investment still
surpasses flowing-out funds, there has been a rapid growth in the
latter.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is planning to introduce more
preferential policies to encourage companies in light industry,
textiles, household electric appliances, machinery and electronics
and clothing to set up joint ventures overseas, particularly in
East Europe, Africa and Middle Asia.

China has launched projects to tackle the environment-damaged
Tarim River, the longest inland river in the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the project is to divert water from the Bosten Lake,
which is 580 kilometers away, into the river in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, northwest China. The project can at least water
100 kilometers of the dry lower reaches of the Tarim River,
according to engineers of the project.
</P>
<P>
Other projects, involving 200 million yuan (20.09 million U.S.
dollars), will include building a 800-kilometer-long dyke and more
than 60 water gates along the middle reaches of the Tarim River.
</P>
<P>
The regional government is also drafting a program on
harnessing the river. The plan, to be completed within three years,
covers ecological protection, development of agriculture, animal
husbandry and aquatic production, flood-proof project, water and

<HEADLINE> China Issues Licenses to Survey Agents of Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The National Bureau of Statistics
(NBS) issued licenses to 29 Chinese and foreign-funded survey
agents to allow them to carry out market investigations for
overseas companies today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first group of survey agents that have received
such licenses in China. Ten of them are foreign-funded.
</P>
<P>
Upon today's approval, they will be able to conduct market
surveys of products and services for companies and organizations
from outside China.
</P>
<P>
NBS deputy director Zhai Ligong told a press conference held
here today that survey agents that are not granted with the
license will not be allowed to conduct surveys for overseas
clients from October.
</P>
<P>
NBS official Xiong Zhennan said that NBS will issue licenses to
more agents in the next few months and that there will be no limit
on the number of licenses to be issued.
</P>
<P>
According to new regulations that China adopted on the survey
industry last August, only the licensed agents are allowed to
conduct surveys for overseas clients in the country. Foreign
persons and companies are not allowed to conduct surveys directly
in the country. On the other hand, local agents are allowed to
conduct surveys for Chinese companies without obtaining a license.
</P>
<P>
Xiong said that the new regulations is designed to safeguard
national security. He also said that the Chinese government has
adopted an encouraging approach toward the development of the
fledging survey industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations require the licensed agents to report the
surveys that they conduct for overseas clients to NBS or its
provincial offices. At present, survey agents that are yet to
obtain a license must have every survey project for overseas
clients approved by NBS.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiong, NBS has approved several thousand survey
projects for overseas companies since last August. He said that
only a handful applications have been denied by NBS, including a
proposed market survey of a product that the Chinese government
prohibits from using foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Simon Yun, executive director of Hong Kong-based ACNielsen,
said that the license-granting system has helped improve the rate
of response to the company's questionnaires because the Chinese
people are inclined to trust survey activities approved by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, our concerns and worries about the new
regulations did not become true," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NBS has been very efficient in approving survey
projects that his company conducted for overseas clients. Normally,
it took only 2-3 days for application and approval. In emergency
cases, the whole process can be completed in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
NBS Deputy Director Zhai Ligong said that China is encouraging
the development of the survey industry and will open up the
industry to overseas investment in a proper and steady way.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's AGO Finalizes Soeharto's Dossier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's Attorney General
Office said it would charge the country's former President
Soeharto with corruption, and is now finalizing the dossier
detailing the charges expected to be filed against him next month,
local leading newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman Wednesday said, "Hopefully we
can hand it over today. We are optimistic that the case will be
filed before August 10."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the AGO announced the former strong man
would be charged with graft, the Indonesian Observer daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that state prosecutors are ready to file
charges against the former president for misusing 1.4 trillion
rupiah (155 million U.S. dollars) of state funds that have gone to
his seven tax-free charity foundations.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said that Soeharto will be tried in his capacity as
the owner of the foundations, thus dismissing previous speculation
that the former ruler would be accused of abusing power to amass
wealth through the foundations.
</P>
<P>
"As the president at that time, Soeharto had the right to issue
decrees and regulations to raise the funds," Darusman was quoted
by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, the AGO is expected to file Soeharto's case with
the South Jakarta District Court, where most of the evidences and
witnesses in the case are situated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of Investigation at the AGO Ris Pandapotan
Sihombing said that Soeharto is primarily charged with violating
article 1 (a) of Law No 3./1971 on Corruption Crimes for
deliberately enriching himself at the state's expense. Then, he is
also subject to secondary charges as stipulated in the corruption
law article 1 (b), under which some one may be convicted for
abusing power so as to cause losses to the state.
</P>
<P>
"The crime carries a maximum life sentence and a minimum 20
years of imprisonment, plus a maximum fine of 30 million rupiah (
around four thousand U.S. dollars)," Sihombing said.
</P>
<P>
While the preparation to file the dossier is under way, as many
as 76 witnesses will be presented at the trial out of the 140
witnesses who have been questioned so far.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto himself now has been put under house arrest and was
banned from leaving the country. He has denied any wrongdoing and
said has no single cent of account abroad.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down from his office on May 21,1998
following the worst economic and political crisis and chaos in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian National Awakening Party Reappoints Matori  as Its Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The congress of Indonesia's
National Awakening Party (PKB) Wednesday night reappointed Matori
Abdul Djalil as chairman of the party for the period 2000-2005.
</P>
<P>
Matori retained his post after President Abdurrahman Wahid was
unanimously elected as chairman of the party's Board of Patrons by
a plenary session of the congress in Surabaya, capital of East
Java, earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the party's organizational rules, the party's chief
patron would have the power to appoint the new party chairman.
</P>
<P>
During his speech on Wednesday night, Wahid unveiled his
support for Matori's chairmanship bid, saying other candidates
were not available.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that he still needs Matori's closest rival Alwi
Shihab to serve as the minister of foreign affairs. The only other
candidate Mustofa Bisri refused to run for the post.
</P>
<P>
"So Matori is the only one. But he should fulfill two
requirements," said Wahid, who flew to Surabaya from Jakarta after
presiding over a Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
First, Matori, now a deputy chairman of the People's
Consultative Assembly, must not include his supporters in the PKB'
s executive board and secondly, he must differentiate between
personal funds and funds belonging to the party, Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
The PKB was founded on July 23, 1998 by Wahid and others. The
party's establishment was announced at Wahid's residence in
Ciganjur, South Jakarta. At that time, Wahid was chairman of the
Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country's largest Muslim organization.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he wished to see PKB emerge as a modern party which
could solve its internal problems through its own strengths, even
though the party is promoted by NU.
</P>
<P>
"The PKB does not belong to the NU alone. The PKB and the NU
should be separated," Wahid was quoted by national newspapers
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The six-day PKB congress is scheduled to close in Surabaya on
Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese zoologists have found a
group of 20 wild takins in a forest region in Zhen'an county,
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The sighting of the rare beasts, which are under State
protection, is believed to be the first in almost 40 years, local
experts said.
</P>
<P>
There were many reports of traces of wild takins in the region
before the 1960s, but the animals seemed to have disappeared in
the area as a result of the exceeding logging in 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the forest area is increasing thanks to the
ban on logging and efficient afforestation drive in the region.
</P>
<P>
The sighting on the wild takins indicates that the ecological
environment has been greatly improved, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Canberra Embarrassed on U.S. NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States has embarrassed
Australia by announcing the latter's support to the proposed U.S.
National Missile Defense Plan.
</P>
<P>
It was the lead of a report by The Age daily Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
told a U.S. Senate committee Wednesday that while other Western
nations were skeptical about the NMD system, Australia had backed
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
"I was just in Australia. The Australian government said that
if the United States were to go forward, they would be supportive,
" he was quoted.
</P>
<P>
Cohen emphasized at the Senate hearing that the use of allied
radars to detect missiles was critical for the shield to be
workable.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the United States, Canberra prefer a low profile.
Prime Minister John Howard keeps silence up to now, while Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer, in Bangkok now for regional security
talks, reportedly said Wednesday that the U.S. had not yet decided
whether to proceed with the system and, in any event, it would not
impact on the strategic balance involving the missile system of
Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Defense Minister John Moore said Wednesday that
Australia had promised to consider a formal proposal from the
United States but had not committed outright support.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, The Age daily revealed that Australia in
fact has begun its cooperation with the United States in testing
both of the NMD and TMD. The Pine Gap electronic spy base in the
center of the continent has been enlarged last year in order to
relay the early warning data.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Veteran forward Danny Manning
met with the Utah Jazz on Wednesday after reaching an agreement to
buy out the final year of his contract with the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
Next season, the 34-year-old backup forward would have entered
the final year of a six-year, 38 million US dollars deal
originally negotiated with the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
Agent Mark Bartlestein said Manning will be available to sign
with other teams from August 1, adding that "Danny is a great
player and he's going to be a great contributor for whatever team
he goes to. Certainly, the Jazz are among those possibilities."
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the Bucks will pay Manning $7.833 million - the
guaranteed amount for next season - over several seasons.
</P>
<P>
Manning played in 72 regular-season games for Milwaukee,
averaging 4.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in 16.9 minutes. In a first-
round playoff series against Indiana, he played in only one game.
</P>
<P>
Manning played on the bronze-medal U.S. Olympic team in 1988
when the Los Angeles Clippers made him the top overall pick in the
NBA draft.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Ewing said he wants to
play three more NBA seasons, even if the New York Knicks don't
want him back after his contract expires next June.
</P>
<P>
"I'd probably like to play two more years after next year. If
it's New York, it's New York. If not, it's somewhere else," Ewing
said for the first time over his plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Ewing signed a four-year 60 million US dollars
contract extension with the Knicks and he was still eligible for
another extension. However, general manager Scott Layden refuses
to discuss anything relating to contracts.
</P>
<P>
Ewing has spent his entire 15-year career with the Knicks,
reaching the NBA
finals twice but never having won a championship. His 15.0 scoring
average last season was the lowest of his career.
</P>
<P>
In the last two seasons, many wondered whether the Knicks were
better off with Ewing or without him as his role in the team
became increasingly less important.

<HEADLINE> Water Controls Keep Yellow River Flowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Although the water-shed of North
China's Yellow River has suffered a severe drought this year, the
river is still flowing in Shandong on the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River has not dried out thanks to the rational
controls that the State has imposed on its water resources, today'
s "China Daily" quoted sources from the Shandong Provincial Yellow
River Resources Committee as saying.
</P>
<P>
These controls have ensured that water usage on the river's
lower reaches has been reduced to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
This year Shandong has experienced its worst drought since 1916.
The province's rainfall in March and April was 84 percent less
than the same period of previous years. Nevertheless, those
sections that flow through Shandong's Heze, Jinan, Dezhou, Binzhou
and Dongying have not dried up.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has succeeded with a big river
water management project.
</P>
<P>
The whole of the Yellow River is now under a unified management,
the Yellow River Control Bureau, which is a significant step in
the reduction of water loss.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianzhong, head of the bureau, said the Ningxia Hui and
Inner Mongolia autonomous regions as well as Henan and Shandong
provinces along the river have carried out plans to conserve water
for use.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the bureau issued more than
60 orders concerning water management.
</P>
<P>
The head waters of the Yellow River are in Qinghai Province,
and the river flows through Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia,
Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan, passing finally through Shandong before
it flows into the Bohai Sea.

economically-backward western region will go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The ministry recently issued a circular urging local public
security departments to come up with ways to meet the new policing
demands that will most likely arise, especially transnational
crime and misuse of funds.
</P>
<P>
It also asks all police departments to concentrate on combating
pornography, drug-related crimes, gambling, and activities
detrimental to the local infrastructure and environment.
</P>
<P>
The residential registration system in these areas should be
reformed comprehensively, which will help attract people to work
in the underdeveloped areas, it says.
</P>
<P>
The circular also urges to enhance the management of customs
entry and exit to better facilitate overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The traffic administration and fire control departments should
also play their part in ensuring safety of the local people, the
circular says.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 26 (Xinhua) -- AC Milan have agreed to cancel the
contract of Liberian striker George Weah allowing him to leave the
club on a free transfer.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Milan said the player and the club talked over
the issue and made the decision mutually on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Weah had one year remaining on his contract but the decision
will not come as a huge shock to Milan supporters.
</P>
<P>
After a disagreement with Milan coach Alberto Zaccheroni last
season, Weah was loaned to English premier league club Chelsea but
he was not offered a permanent deal by the London team.
</P>
<P>
Weah joined Milan from Paris Saint Germain in 1995 and helped
them to Serie A titles in 1996 and 1999. In 1995 he became the
first African to be voted European Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Liberian international made 114 Serie A
appearances for Milan.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Gingko Trees Discovered in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A pair of gingko trees believed
to be at least 600 years old have been discovered in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The two trees, one male and the other female, stand eight
meters apart and their 18-meter-long crowning limbs are
intertwined.
</P>
<P>
Local records said that the gingkoes were planted by Taoist
monks in the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
The male is 21.7 meters tall and has a perimeter of 3.2 meters.
The female, 20.7 meters high with a perimeter of three meters, is
loaded with green grape-like fruit.
</P>
<P>
According to local villagers, the female tree produces more
than 500 kilograms of fruit each year.
</P>
<P>
The gingko is a dioecious plant species -- comes in both sexes -
- which survived the glacial period over two million years ago in
China. The tree is also known as the "longevity tree" because it
can live up to 1,000 years. Gingkoes are highly valued for their
medicinal properties.

<HEADLINE> China's Cinemas Join Efforts Against Pirated VCDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China's cinemas, which have
suffered from the constant stream of illegal VCDs pouring into the
country, have joined in the national effort to boycott pirated
discs.
</P>
<P>
Guotai Cinema in Chongqing Municipality of southwest China
issued a notice recently which said that everyone who turns in a
pirated VCD will get a free ticket to the popular martial arts
movie "Shanghai Noon" now showing at the cinema.
</P>
<P>
The cinema is the first in Chongqing to make the trade-in offer.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai Noon," an instant box office hit in the United States,
stars international martial arts star Jackie Chan.
</P>
<P>
An official with Guotai Cinema said it's necessary to crack
down on activities involving pirated VCDs, because such cases not
only damage the interest of filmmakers but also prevent more
moviegoers from going to cinemas.
</P>
<P>
The cinema authorities emphasized that they will destroy all
the pirated VCDs they collect.
</P>
<P>
Though only 50 people exchanged pirated VCDs for tickets in 15
days, cinema sources said that they will continue to offer the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the pirated audiovisual products on China'
s mainland come from overseas, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has launched anti-pirating campaigns
every year since 1989. Statistics from 28 provinces show that a
total of 1.72 million pirated audiovisual products had been
confiscated over the past three months, including 65,000 pirated
DVDs.

<HEADLINE> Record 361 Italian Athletes For Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy will send a record 361 athletes
- 244 men and 117 women - to the Sydney Olympics, the Italian
Olympic committee announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian athletes will compete in 24 out of the 28 sports
including taekwondo and the triathlon. The sports off the Italian
list are badminton, hockey, handball and table tennis.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Olympic organizers are expecting a total of about 10,
200 athletes, about the same as in Atlanta four years ago, when
Italy sent 347.
</P>
<P>
The final lists for the team sports have to be finalized by
September 20. The only major absentees seem to be Jury Chechi, the
gymnast whose injury will prevent competing, and probably winning
gold in his fourth Olympics; marathon runner Franca Fiacconi; and
Daniele Scarpa, who won medals in Atlanta, but failed to qualify
for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Athletics will send 400 meters runner Fabrizio Mori, provided
he gets a recent injury behind him, British-born, but Italian-
married long-jumper Fiona May, triple jump Italian record holder
Fabrizio Donato and walking aces such as Giovanni De Benedictis
and Annarita Sidoti.
</P>
<P>
The soccer team, consisting for the most part of Under-21
players who won the European title in that age category a few
weeks ago, are also strong favorites for some kind of medal.
</P>
<P>
In canoeing, Antonio Rossi and long-serving Iosefa Idem are
expected to continue a long Italian tradition, and the rowers are
also flying down under with high medal hopes.
</P>
<P>
In the recent World Cup final in Zurich, Italian teams got into
seven out of eight finals, winning three golds, a silver and
bronze.
</P>
<P>
The team for the cycling road race is expected to field five
top riders, probably including the great returnee, Marco Pantani.
He still has to announce his intentions, but the rather flat
Olympic course is in no way his cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
Italian track cyclists are expected to make their usual haul of
medals and, on her mountain bike, Paola Pezzi will remain a
cynosure for a host of reasons.
</P>
<P>
After an explosion of talent at the European swimming
championships, Italy's swimmers will have to see how they measure
up to the giants from the United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Italian sports administrators, whose prestige rests on how many
medals they can bring home, are laying strong hopes in the water-
polo team, and also the champion volleyball players, who have won
all kinds of gold in recent years, but never Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
The officials will be expecting further good news from other
traditional Italian strongpoints such as fencing and shooting.
</P>
<P>
There is less optimism about gymnastics, tennis and sailing.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Appeal FIFA Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African Football
Association (SAFA) is to appeal against FIFA's decision to grant
Germany the 2006 World Cup on the grounds that there were
irregularities in the soccer world governing body's voting process.
</P>
<P>
Danny Jordaan, who heads the South Africa bid committee, said
on Wednesday that SAFA would invoke article 59 in the FIFA statute,
which allowed any bidding country the right to call for an
application for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said although SAFA could have taken the case to court,
it had decided to keep the matter within the confines of FIFA as a
token of South Africa's respect for the governing body.
</P>
<P>
Former Oceania president Charles Dempsey, whose abstention from
voting could have cost South Africa the bid to host the 206 World
Cup, was named as a co-defendant in the arbitration process.
</P>
<P>
SAFA has sent its application for arbitration to FIFA's
headquarters in Zurich and will wait for an answer before deciding
what move to take if the application is turned down.
</P>
<P>
Acting SAFA director Irvin Khoza was reluctant to delve into
the merits of the case, stating only that the bid committee's
legal team had discovered a violation of FIFA's and the Oceania
federation's respective statutes.
</P>
<P>
"We are supremely confident that the statute of FIFA has been
compromised," Khoza said.
</P>
<P>
Khoza also stated the difficulties of taking the matter to
civil court, explaining that FIFA acted within the canton of Swiss
law.
</P>
<P>
Media reports also suggested that South Africa could be kicked
out of FIFA if it pursued the matter in the courts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the fear of expulsion that led us to take the
arbitration process, but rather to be compliant with the
regulations of FIFA," Jordaan said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral and legal obligation to our people, our
supporters and to the African continent to proceed with this
matter," Jordaan added.
</P>
<P>
FIFA is expected to reply to SAFA by August 3, and if the
application is successful, arbitration will proceed.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Expects Golden Age for Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Coming July 30 elections will be
the most important in Venezuela's history, because from them the
first president of the fifth Bolivian Republic will come and will
lead Venezuela on a totally new path.
</P>
<P>
Under the motto of "give Venezuela hard push" at midnight
Thursday, the election campaign will come to an end. It is the
third election in little over a year.
</P>
<P>
According to the new Constitution of the Republic approved in
December 1999, the President may be reelected for another 6 year
period.
</P>
<P>
Among the 3 candidates, President Hugo Chavez heads election
preferences, with support from 5th Republican Movement, the
governing party.
</P>
<P>
In order to fulfill election promises, following his triumph in
December 1998 elections with 56.2 of votes, Chavez placed emphasis
on political reform during the 15 months of his term and decreed a
new Magna Charta.
</P>
<P>
In his governmental plan, the President and Presidential
Candidate assured that if he's elected he'll head again Venezuela'
s economic reactivation, as plenty has been done in the political
field, and it's time to hold the rudder in the economic one.
</P>
<P>
In economy, the President will look to stimulate the formation
of national private capital, absorbing more foreign investment.
He considers that outside capital will have a complementary role
to that of the State.
</P>
<P>
President Chavez plans to give priority to private national
fields, specifically that of petroleum and will orient outside
capital toward natural gas, petrochemistry, orimulsion and coal.
</P>
<P>
 Orimulsion, a coal substitute fuel, is a mixture of water and
heavy based crude product found in the Orinoco River of Venezuel
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that Venezuela will strengthen the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in defense of crude's prices.
In Venezuela, Chavez' government will diversify exports and
develop clear anti-inflation and anti-devaluation policies.
</P>
<P>
Chavez cast the idea, an immense desire, to "leave the age of
steel in order to  march Venezuela into the golden age".
</P>
<P>
In social issues, Chavez promised to generate employment,
eradicate poverty, achieve social justice, improve the quality of
life and security's situation.
</P>
<P>
Although up to now nobody casts doubt on Chavez' success, many
consider this will be hard with the participation of his main
rival and ex-colleage of frustrated 1992 coup d'etat, former
Zulia state governor, Francisco Arias Cardenas.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, UK to Jointly Explore Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Argentina and Britain
agreed Thursday to continue the analysis of cooperation to
promote exploration and exploitation of oil in South Atlantic sea
areas near Malvina Islands (Falklands).
</P>
<P>
According to a communique sent out Thursday here by Argentina's
Foreign Ministry, during the 8th meeting of Southwest Atlantic
Hydrocarburate Commission that concluded Thursday in London, both
parties didn't arrive to big decisions, but did coincide on
certain points.
</P>
<P>
Regarding matters related to a legal calling in the area of
special cooperation, both parties agreed "it was necessary to
carry out additional work regarding the system of qualifying firms,
hygene and work security".
</P>
<P>
They also coincided in the need to work to "harmonize
specifications, future environmental work and taxes", specifies
the communique.
</P>
<P>
The commission analyzed, furthermore, questions related to
marine environmental protection and carrying through of joint
scientific investigation projects in the southwest Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Ever since relations with Britain were reestablished after the
Malvina (Falkland) war of 1982, this was the 8th meeting of
Southwest Atlantic Hydrocarburate Commission, and the first
meeting the present government holds with British representatives.
</P>
<P>
The previous meeting was held in Buenos Aires in July, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Britain Announces National Plan for Health Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
unveiled its national plan for the health service, with a 10-year
package of sweeping reforms and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Central to the blueprint was a massive increase in staff
numbers, with an extra 20,000 nurses, 7,500 consultants, 2,000 GPs
and 6,750 other National Health Service (NHS) staff.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair told the House of Commons he planned
to reshape the NHS to match patient need - and recreate a health
service envied by the world.
</P>
<P>
The reaction from patients groups, NHS managers, charities and
doctors has been generally favorable. A spokesman for the Patients
' Association said: "There are some very good ideas in this plan
but now these things have really got to happen and the money has
got to be there. "
</P>
<P>
He added: "The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.It's
all very well the Government saying they are going to tie
consultants into the NHS but unless they give them the financial
incentives the consultants will just go abroad."
</P>
<P>
But doctors' leaders have disputed the claimed workforce boost,
saying thousands of the consultants and GPs were already in the
pipeline before the plan was announced. Doctors also signaled that
they would fight plans to overhaul their contracts and restrict
the amount of private work they can do.
</P>
<P>
The 144-page blueprint for the NHS in England was described by
Health Secretary Alan Milburn as "the most fundamental and far-
reaching reform program".
</P>
<P>
Milburn said: "For the first time, the Government has faced up
to the breadth and depth of problems in the NHS and has addressed
them all in turn. From the state of wards to the doctor's contract,
not one issue has been ducked. "
</P>
<P>
But claims that the plan - drawn up in the last four months by
six committees - will deliver a huge boost in staff numbers have
been disputed.
</P>
<P>
The BMA said an extra 1,000 GPs were already expected in the
health service by 2005, so the national plan pledge of an extra 2,
000 included only 1,000 new posts to add to the current 25,000
family doctors. And an extra 4,500 consultants were already
expected, meaning the claim in the plan to employ an additional 7,
500 was in reality only 3,000 more.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Health Secretary Dr Liam Fox said the plan was full of"
half truths". He said: "This was a wonderful opportunity for Tony
Blair to move from political to clinical priorities.Unforgivably,
he has put his own political survival before the survival of
patients."
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up by five action groups, headed by health
ministers and comprising 100 health professionals.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are made possible by Chancellor Gordon Brown's
announcement of the single-biggest injection of money into the NHS.
</P>
<P>
The government has called on NHS workers to embrace the reforms,
and create a high quality service.
</P>
<P>
In return, doctors and other NHS staff will be rewarded with, in
some cases, extra pay and better career opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Condemns Planned Mass Stayaway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of State for
Information and Publicity Jonathan Moyo described the proposed
strike by farmers and a mass stayaway by workers next week as ill
advised and only designed to derail the land redistribution
process.
</P>
<P>
Moyo issued a statement on Friday evening discouraging workers
and the unemployed from taking part in the action which he said
would bring them nothing but "the now familiar false promises"
with the result of worsening their current condition the
government is trying to improve.
</P>
<P>
"The decision by some white commercial farmers to mobilize
sections of the business community and the political wing of the
trade union movement to go on strike against the land reform
program is most unfortunate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers and the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions will
begin strikes on Monday and Wednesday respectively to protest the
government and police inaction on war veterans occupying about 1,
500 white-owned farms where they are harassing farmers.
</P>
<P>
"The commitment of the government and people of Zimbabwe to an
orderly, transparent and legally defined land reform program is
irreversible," Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fast tracked resettlement of black peasants on 804
compulsorily acquired farms is being done in an open, transparent,
constitutional, legal and administrative manner whose
implementation is known to the white commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to Moyo, a joint committee of farmers and war
veterans, with an open communication line to President Robert
Mugabe, has provided a useful platform for dialogue which is now
being shunned in favor of anarchy and economic deterioration.
</P>
<P>
"Through this committee some isolated incidents of
misunderstanding between war veterans and farmers have been
reported and the government has expeditiously responded through
the police who have also put in place adequate security
arrangements wherever need has been demonstrated," Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
He said the parliamentary elections are over, and the farmers
are expected to help the government come up with policies which
can turn the economy round to improve people's lives.
</P>
<P>
"The stayaway can only be a distraction," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Disobeying Ruling Party Instructions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) Friday said former
liberation war veterans are disobeying party instructions to move
out of white-owned farms occupied since February this year.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans, as members of Zanu-pf, should be loyal to its
leadership and carry out its instructions to leave, the Zimbabwe
News Agency quoted Zanu-pf spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira as saying
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We respect Chenjerai Hunzvi as their chairman (in the 50,000-
member Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association), but
he should lead from the front, not at the back," Shamuyarira said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Hunzvi to "crack down" on his followers who are
refusing to vacate the farms.
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira was commenting on the current chaotic situation on
some of more than 1,500 farms owned by 4,500 white commercial
farmers. Some of these farmers have begun a countrywide strike in
protest to continued harassment by the former freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
The former fighters, whose leadership vowed to continue the
occupations, have now resorted to beating up farmers and their
workers, demanding money, evicting owners or just disrupting
production.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that if the farmer strike goes ahead, there
could be a crippling shortage of fresh foods in the country and
preparations for the next season will be jeopardized -- so will
the economy as agriculture is its mainstay.
</P>
<P>
"Hunzvi should now crack down on elements of the war veterans
not obeying instructions. We expect him to lead his members out of
the farms to new settlements. We really emphasize that because the
next two to three weeks are very crucial in our quest for economic
stability," Shamuyarira said.
</P>
<P>
The white farmers, who have sued the government and the police,
have now called for a countrywide strike on Monday which might be
joined by a civil mass action being planned by the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions and employers also protesting lack of
police protection.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Backs U.S. Proposed Tribunal for Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone Government Friday
voiced its support for a move propelled by the United States to
set up a special court to try some of the country's rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Freetown quoted Sierra Leone's
Information Minister Julius Spencer as saying that the U.S.-
sponsored draft resolution is in line with requests by them for a
process that has an international dimension.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal should be restricted to dealing with rebel leaders
including Foday Sankoh, the detained head of the Revolutionary
United Front, who must be held accountable for the rebels'
atrocities against civilians, Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been accused of using a deliberate policy of
terror such as cutting off people's limbs to gain advantage during
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Richard Holbrooke, U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said
earlier that the U.N. Security Council members generally endorsed
the draft resolution proposed by the United States and he hoped a
vote on it would be taken next week.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution suggests that an independent special court
will operate under both Sierra Leone domestic law and
international humanitarian law, and the hearings will be heard
either in Freetown or in one of Sierra Leone's neighboring
countries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans to Continue Stands Allocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Zimbabwe's war veterans
Friday said the war veterans are aware that it is illegal for them
to allocate residential stands on farms near cities, but they will
not stop.
</P>
<P>
Chenjerai Hunzvi told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the
allocation of the residential stands by the war veterans was meant
to put pressure on city authorities to acquire the farms for
residential purposes.
</P>
<P>
The action would legalize the acquisition of farms through
forcing the city authorities to negotiate with the farm owners, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to put pressure on the city authorities to start
acquiring the farms," he said. "We want to force them to legalize
the acquisition."
</P>
<P>
The war veterans are allocating stands on farms around Harare
to the public and have threatened to sub-divide all the farms they
have occupied since February this year.
</P>
<P>
Kembo Mohadi, Deputy Minister of the Local Government, Public
Works and National Housing, said on Thursday that only city
authorities are empowered by the Urban Councils Act to allocate
stands.
</P>
<P>
City planners have condemned the allocation of the stands which
are done without the necessary infrastructure in place to avoid
outbreak of diseases and environment degradation.
</P>
<P>
According to Harare city authorities, they are not happy with
the developments taking place on the farms, but they have no power
to stop the war veterans.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Trade Unions to Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The General Council of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Friday decided to stage a three-
day mass stayaway from Wednesday next week.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Spokesperson Nicholas Mudzengerere told the Zimbabwe News
Agency after a council emergency meeting that the mass stayaway
was meant to press the government to enforce law and order in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The stayaway will come two days after the first ever strike by
Zimbabwean white commercial farmers next Monday in protest to
police inaction on harassment perpetrated by war veterans on some
of the 4,500 white farmers whose land they have been occupying
since February this year.
</P>
<P>
It could also coincide with a general strike by 8,500 Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation workers whose salaries due on
Thursday are only expected to come on August 7.
</P>
<P>
"We are protesting against the continued inaction of the powers
that should instruct the police to do what we all pay them for,"
said Mudzengerere.
</P>
<P>
He said workers in towns and on the farms are being subjected
to violence and beatings which are not justified.
</P>
<P>
Flyers are being distributed in the city center calling on all
workers to support the call for law and order by closing down
businesses and by not going to work and asking colleagues and
acquaintances to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU has in the past successfully staged nationwide work
stoppages and critics of the government said another one would
cripple the country's tottering economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has instructed provincial governors
to persuade farmers to call off their strike and give dialogue a
chance while the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front has described the move as ill-advised.
</P>
<P>
But the farmers, who have sued the government for not forcing
the war veterans off their land, said previous efforts to talk to
the government did not bear any fruits.

implementation of the ceasefire agreement signed by Ethiopia and
Eritrea following the recent U.N. reconnaissance mission to the

At the meeting held on Wednesday, the two armies agreed to
share information on their operations against the Interahamwe
militias and the Allied Democratic Forces, two rebel groups based
in eastern DRC fighting against the Rwandan and Ugandan armed
forces respectively, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We believe Rwanda and Uganda are different countries. There
could be differences but this should not drag us to forget our
common security concerns," Tolit said.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to hold meetings once every two months and they
should rotate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have their troops stationed in the DRC to
back rival rebel factions fighting against President Laurent
Kabila. The two armies had run into conflicts three times since
June this year in Kisangani of the DRC, which caused heavy
civilian casualties.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Unauthorized to Allocate Stands: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans have no
authority to allocate residential stands on farms around the
country, as this is the function of the respective local
authorities, the Herald quoted a government official as saying
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kembo Mohadi, deputy minister of Local Government, Public Works
and National Housing, said Thursday that the allocation of
residential stands was the business of municipalities and not war
veterans.
</P>
<P>
Mohadi made the remarks at a press conference after a poverty
alleviation workshop organized by the Municipal Development
Program and the City of Harare.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans are allocating stands on farms around the City
of Harare and have indicated that they will subdivide all farms
they have occupied around the city for residential purposes.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,500 white
commercial farms since February this year.
</P>
<P>
The City of Harare has already indicated that it is not happy
with the developments taking place on the farms, but has not been
able to stop the war veterans.

<HEADLINE> Famine-hit Areas in Uganda Get WFP's Relief Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Relief food from the World Food
Program (WFP) has been delivered to famine-stricken areas in the
northeastern region of Uganda, the New Vision daily reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The food has been airlifted or ferried by trucks to Kakingol
and Tapac parishes, the worst-hit areas by the drought which are
located on the Mount Moroto slopes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Speciosa Wandira Kazibwe and Minister of
Disaster Preparedness Tom Butime made an impromptu visit to assess
the famine situation in Moroto and Kotido districts on Wednesday
following press reports that 115 Ugandans died of starvation in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, severe famine has also struck the war-affected
Bundibugyo district bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
leaving most displaced people without sufficient food supplies.
</P>
<P>
The insurgency caused by the rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces and the long dry spells were to blame for the famine, said
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 out of 45 districts in Uganda have reportedly been
affected by drought.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Tanzania Face Worse Nutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The health condition of
refugees in Tanzania is likely to deteriorate as the amount of
food currently being supplied to them is below nutritional
requirement, a U.N. official has said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian newspapers Thursday quoted the World Food Program (
WFP) Country Director Irene Lacy as saying that each of the 455,
000 refugees in camps in western Tanzania receives 360 grams of
food, instead of 600 grams needed per day.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her concern over the future health condition of the
refugees who are currently under-fed, Lacy said this would
certainly affect the nutrition status of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the WFP here last week, the
U.N. organization has decided to reduce the food rations to
refugees in Tanzania by 40 percent due to the lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The huge reduction in the food ration was partly aimed at
ensuring that the available food stocks last longer, Lacy
explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) said Wednesday there is little it can do to help
the slash on food rations to refugees in Tanzanian camps.
</P>
<P>
"It is a severe reduction. On its nutritional side, it takes
several months to feel the effect," said the UNHCR Deputy Country
Representative Kai Nelson.
</P>
<P>
The refugee official said they are afraid that refugees might
start leaving their camps in search for food.

<HEADLINE> Former Zambian Minister to Form New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian Environment Minister
Ben Mwila revealed his plan to form a new party, saying he would
make the formal announcement on the name of the party later, Times
of Zambia reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mwila was quoted as saying at a press conference held here on
Thursday that he had decided to form his own party to continue
with his desire to drag Zambians out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said agriculture which had been neglected by the ruling
Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) would be the core for
economic development by his party. This, he added, would help
reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MMD spokesman Vernon Mwaanga said Mwila's formation
of the party was expected even at the time he was in the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Mwila was expected to form an alliance with
the United Party for National Development (UPND) led by Anderson
Mazoka.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga, who is also MMD information and publicity chairman,
welcomed the formation of the new political party by Mwila, saying
the MMD had been expecting it for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Mwila lost his minister portfolio after he was expelled for the
country's ruling party earlier this month. He was suspended last
month by MMD National Secretary Michael Sata, who charged that in
the past 18 months, Mwila had been involved in anti-party
activities which greatly destabilized the party.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidature for the MMD presidency in May
26 this year in a bid to run for the country's presidency in the
general elections to be held next year.

<HEADLINE> 4 Million Kenyan Kids in Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 4 million Kenyan
children are in child labor, making the country the sixth in
prevalence of the practice in Africa, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Labor Minister Joseph Ngutu on Thursday told a workshop
on child labor that the problem was caused by rising levels of
poverty, population explosion and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the cost-sharing system in primary schools
15 years ago had seen enrollment of children drop from 95 percent
to 75 percent, compounding the problem of child labor.
</P>
<P>
Ngutu noted that current laws relating to labor child were only
remedial rather than preventive and were inadequately enforced.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it was inevitable that children assisted
in farms at certain times, but it was wrong to use them as
substitutes to paid labor.
</P>
<P>
"When a child is kept from school and made to perform heavy
manual work it becomes totally unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngutu revealed that a policy document addressing all forms of
intolerable child labor has been developed and is awaiting the
cabinet's approval.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Navy Ships Begin First-Ever Visit to Africa  by Zhang Dacheng, Pang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A ship group of the People's
Liberation Army Navy of China berthed at the Dar es Salaam harbor
Friday morning, beginning a two-day maiden goodwill visit to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first-ever visit by navy ships of the People's
Republic of China since its founding in 1949 to the African
continent, though whose eastern coast had been visited for several
times in early 1400s by the trade fleet headed by Zheng He, a
great voyager of the Ming Dynasty of China.
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by RADM Huang Jiang, Chief of Staff of the
South Sea Fleet, consists of the Shenzhen DDG167, a guided-missile
destroyer, and Nancang AOG953, an assorted supply ship with a
total of 480 officers and sailors aboard.
</P>
<P>
They were greeted by Tanzanian Navy Commander RADM Sander and
other senior officers along with overseas Chinese in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Leaving its base in Zhanjiang in southern China on July 5, the
Chinese warships first paid a four-day visit to Malaysia from July
11 to 14.
</P>
<P>
They will leave Tanzania on July 30 for Cape Town, South Africa,
for their last leg of the three Asian-African states tour, which
is aimed at further promoting the mutual understanding and
friendship between the armed forces and the peoples.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in the port of Dar es Salaam, the Chinese
officers and sailors will hold a friendly football match with
their counterparts of the Tanzanian People's Defense Forces while
their ships are open to the public both on Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Urges to Boost Ties With Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's efforts to fight terrorism
and improve human rights conditions will help to favor stronger
economic ties with Italy, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told his
Sudanese counterpart Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dini made the statement during a meeting with Sudan's Foreign
Minister Mustafa' Oman Ismail and Rino Serri, the Italian Foreign
undersecretary who is also the special European Union envoy to the
Horn of Africa nations.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after the meeting, the
Sudanese representative outlined initiatives taken by his
government to promote peace, institutional reform, steps towards
democracy and the improvement of Sudan's relations with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Dini urged Mustafa to take urgent steps in those directions,
with an eye to ending Sudan's 15-year-long civil conflict, which
has devastated the south of the country and raised humanitarian
concerns.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in the search for a solution to the conflict,
Italy actively supports mediation in its role as chair of the
Joint Partners Forum of IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority for
Development, which counts Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya,
Sudan and Uganda among its members.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that stabilizing the situation would lead to an
intensification of bilateral economic relations as well as a
revival of regional integration within IGAD.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Partners Forum is scheduled to hold its next meeting
in Rome, possibly by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he was satisfied with dialogue between the European
Union and Khartoum on boosting collaboration on development, which
is conditional on the latter's moves towards democracy.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Sudan for playing a positive role in
encouraging a cease-fire last month between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Thursday with the blue chips rising modestly while the technology
shares falling sharply.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 69.65 at 10,586.13.
The blue chip index bounced back from the fall of 183.49 points
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 145.49 at 3,
842.23, extending its losses of 41.85 points in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index fell 2.80 at 1,449.62.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index rose as the Labor Department reported that the
employment costs remain under control. The report said wages and
benefits rose 1 percent in the second quarter, lower than 1.4
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The employment costs report could prompt the Federal Reserve to
leave interest rates unchanged in the year. The Federal Reserve
has raised rates six times since June, last year in an effort to
cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
Investors rushed into the rate-sensitive retail and financial
sectors and led the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not encourage investors to move into
technology sector. Investors in the tech sector were pessimistic
about prospects of Internet companies after the online retailer
Amazon.com reported losses of 317 million U.S. dollars in the
second quarter later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology stocks were also hit by the disappointing
earning forecasts from the mobile phone maker Nokia. The Finnish
company warned that its third-quarter earnings will likely fall
from the second-quarter levels due to the timing of new product
introduction.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.39 at 647.20. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 2.86 at 912.33 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 12.20 at 501.61.

<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,487 down, 1,388 up and 480
unchanged.

<P>
The trade bill, which was passed in the House in May, enjoys

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government's three-year
economic and financial blueprint, the DPEF, was given the green
light Thursday by both the Lower House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
In presenting the DPEF, Italian Treasury Minister Vincenzo
Visco delivered an extremely upbeat verdict on the Italian economy,
saying that "the economic situation in Italy is excellent at the
moment and appears to be improving day by day."
</P>
<P>
"The DPEF marks the end of a stage of highly energetic
consolidation, which was very risky and strenuous, but crowned
with un-hoped for success, at least in the eyes of many observers,
" Visco said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that, by the end of the year, the Italian economy
would enjoy a boom unseen for years, which would "enable the
acceleration of the process of modernization" of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPEF, the crucial ratio of the public deficit
to GDP is expected to fall to 1.3 percent this year, rather than
the originally forecast 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The DPEF also sees public debt dropping from 112.1 percent of
GDP at the end of this year to 106.6 percent in 2001 and 99.7
percent at the end of 2003.
