HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia and
third-placers China both made it to the second round after their
respective victories in the opening group ties at the 20th Thomas
Cup men's badminton world team championships finals here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia trounced the Netherlands 5-0 in two ours and 17
minutes in Group B and China downed Sweden five matches to none in
their Group A tie, both in the morning.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese team had two of the games lost on the way to the
opening tie triumph. Chinese Yang Ming teamed with Zhang Jun to
beat their Swedish opponens Jens Olsson and Frederik Bergstrom
15-2, 11-15, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
China's former world singles champion Dong Jiong was held to
three games before winning over Daniel Eriksson 15-10, 12-15,
15-10 in 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Our players performed better than I had expected. Some of our
younger players were a bit nervous today and, after we won the
first three matches, they were too relaxed to concentrate," said
Chinese head coach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he wished to let the match last longer so that he could
get more used to the courts for the more important matches ahead,"
the player-turned-coach said when asked about Dong's performance.
</P>
<P>
And in other actions on Saturday, Malaysia defeated South Korea
4-1.
</P>
<P>
The team of Hong Kong, China was overjoyed after 20-year-old
Kwok Wa Liu upset current world singles champion Petre Rasmussen
18-14, 6-15, 15-10 in the final singles match. This was the first
time in history that a Hong Kong player has ever won a match in
the Thomas Cup Finals, not to say a current world champion.
</P>
<P>
The team lost to Sweden 4-1.
</P>
<P>
A foot injury obviously hampered Rasmussen's on-court efforts
especially when he tried to save pressing shots from his opponent.
</P>
<P>
"Although the victory meant nothing important to the team
standings, it is indeed a big boost to the player himself and the
whole team," said Chan Chi Choi, head coach of the Hong Kong,
China team.
</P>
<P>
Tears in eyes, Liu had to calm himself down for a while before
he could be interviewed. "All I could do today was to try my best
and I think the Swede's errors helped me a lot. I tried to take
the initiative step by step and it worked," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I owed my victory to my coaches," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sunday will see further actions in Uber Cup.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parties Flay Government Nuclear Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Four Indian parties on Saturday
criticized the government's nuclear policy for being "reckless and
adventurous", and urged immediate finish to India's talk of
nuclear weaponization.
</P>
<P>
The four parties, the Communist Party of India (Marxism), the
Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party of India
(Marxism-Leninism) and the Forward Block condemned the
government's nuclear policy in a joint statement issued after a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said the declaration by Prime Minister Atal Vajpayee on
his government's decision to develop nuclear weapons was "fraught
with serious consequences".
</P>
<P>
Production of nuclear weaponry was "unwarranted and contrary to
the interests of the country", said the statement. It added:
"There is no direct threat posed by any country against India
which necessitates such a step. "
</P>
<P>
The party leaders urged the government to take steps to restore
relations with its neighbors and to rely upon past policy working
for nuclear disarmament, while safeguarding the nation's security
by not signing treaties like the Non-proliferation Treaty and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Iraq Reach Agreement on Pilgrimage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraq have agreed to
exchange pilgrims to the holy Islamic sites in the two countries,
the evening daily Resalat reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy governor of Iran's Kermanshah Province bordering Iraq
was quoted by the paper as saying that the two sides would
exchange 3,000 pilgrims every week under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The official, whose name was not given in the report, did not
say when and where the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
Expressing welcome to the agreement, the official said the
first group of Iranian pilgrims would visit the Shiite holy sites
in southern Iraq in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced last August to open
the Shiite sites in his country to Iranian pilgrims. In response,
Iran called for talks to reach an agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, former foes which fought for eight years from
1980 to 1988, have stepped up efforts to solve their problems,
including the issues of prisoners of war (POW) and those missing
in actions (MIA).
</P>
<P>
Last month, the two countries swapped 5,584 Iraqi POWs and 319
Iranians, the largest move since 1992, and last week, they started
operations to search MIAs on each other's territories.

<HEADLINE> Indians Demonstrate Against Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- About 500 social activists and
volunteers of different organizations in India held a
demonstration just outside the Delhi police headquarters Saturday
against the government's nuclear policy.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators carried placards and shouted slogans such as
"we want breads not bombs, we need homes not tombs."
</P>
<P>
They demanded total elimination of nuclear weapons from the
world and said it is a matter of great shame that "we should
celebrate India's capability to kill millions of people."
</P>
<P>
The also condemned the imposition of sanctions on India by the
United States and other big powers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, four political parties urged the government
to immediately stop the talk of nuclear weaponization as it would
lead to a harmful nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued here Saturday, they said the public
declaration by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that his
government has decided to go ahead with making and induction of
nuclear weapons was a major policy declaration "fraught with
serious consequences."
</P>
<P>
The statement from the Communist Party of India (Marxism)
(CPI-M), the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party
of India (Marxism-Leninism) (CPI-ML) and the Forward Block
followed a meeting here between their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Making of nuclear bombs and weaponry at this juncture is
"unwarranted and contrary to the interests of the country," the
statement said, adding that "there is no direct threat posed by
any country against India which necessitates such a step."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has rushed into this
adventurist policy with the political motive of arousing feelings
of chauvinism and jingoism to cover up its own political
difficulties of running a rickety coalition and its failure to
address serious problems facing the country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders asked the government to take steps to improve
relations with neighboring countries and rely upon the past policy
of working for nuclear disarmament while safeguarding India's
security interests by not signing treaties like the
non-proliferation treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congress party said Saturday that the nuclear
tests carried out by the BJP-led government earlier this week,
while claimed to be for national security, were also for gaining
political mileage for the BJP with a view to capitalizing on them
in the event of mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
In a background paper prepared for the extended Congress
Working Committee, the Congress said the BJP has demonstrably
started preparing for a possible mid-term polls to come back to
power on its own as it feels that the Vajpayee government might
not last long.
</P>
<P>
The Rashtriya Janata Dal also charged that the BJP-led
government was trying to take political gains out of the nuclear
tests.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Speed Process of Unifying Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Saturday agreed to speed the
process of unifying their customs tariff, Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which form the GCC, discussed the
issue at their one-day meeting held in Saudi capital Riyadh, but
left the final decision to the next GCC summit scheduled in
December.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Finance Minister Sheikh Ali Salem Al-Sabah was quoted
by the news agency as saying that the GCC members have been
proceeding firmly toward "building a customs wall" and there is
no differences among them in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that the GCC commodity classification committee will
finish the discussion of the subject later.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,140 commodities out of 1,289 have been categorized. And
sources close to the meeting said that some members eased their
stances on the classification of the remaining commodities at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Saudi Arabia and the UAE have reservations over the
classification of some commodities, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Current customs tariffs of the GCC states vary from 4 percent
to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The goods will be put in three categories, namely goods
exempted from tariffs, basic goods with a tariff of 4 to 8 percent
or 8 to 12 percent, and other goods.
</P>
<P>
Gaps exist in GCC states over the unification of tariff due to
differences in their economic priorities. The disagreement has
blocked a tariff agreement almost since the alliance was formed in
1981.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- At least three Palestinians were
injured in clashes Saturday in Hebron and five others arrested in
the Old City of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, which is situated in the south of the West Bank,
hundreds of Palestinians took to the street in the center of the
city where Jewish settlers live and clashed with Israeli
troops there, according to the Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians threw stones at the Israeli soldiers, who
returned fire with rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers forced the store keepers to close their
shops in the city and stormed a company near Bab-Ezzawyeh, the
JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
The injured included a child who was taken to hospital after
being shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli security forces
took place Saturday at Salah Eddine Street in East Jerusalem,
where most of the residents are Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians asked the Israeli side to release five
Palestinians who were arrested during Thursday's demonstrations
before the confrontations took place.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians also threw stones at a nearby Israeli police
station and five of them were arrested by the Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians held a "Million people march" on Thursday to mark
the 50th anniversary of Nakba (catastrophe), the Palestinian's
designation of the founding of the State of Israel and subsequent
dispersion of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
At least nine Palestinians were reportedly killed by
Israeli troops Thursday when angry Palestinians clashed with
Israeli forces, leaving another bitter memory of hatred among
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> PNC Members Calls for Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Council
(PNC) members residing in Jordan said in a statement issued
Saturday that the time has come for the Palestinians to see the
Palestinian state that was declared in Tunis in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was broadcast by the Voice of Palestine,
said it is time for millions of the Palestinian refugees who were
forced to flee 50 years ago to return to their homeland now.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared the Palestinian state
in Tunis in 1988 and plans to establish an independent
Palestinian state in May, 1999 on the territories of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip under the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has threatened to take counter actions if Arafat
carries out his plan.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on all Arab leaders to answer the
Palestinian call for an Arab summit to deal with the situation the
peace process is facing.
</P>
<P>
It blamed Israel for pushing the peace process into deadlock,
saying that the Israeli government is challenging the the Arab
world and the international legitimate decisions.
</P>
<P>
The PNC continued to support a just and comprehensive peace,
but affirmed that there can be no peace without the return of the
Palestinian refugees to their land and without Jerusalem as the
capital of an independent Palestinian state, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The PNC is the highest governing body in Palestine, consisting
of all members of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and
leaders of various political factions of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3.2 to 3.6 million Palestinian refugees and
most of them are living in Jordan and Lebanon now.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Speaker Commends China's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Dawit Yohannes, Speaker of
Ethiopia's House of People's Representatives, Saturday commended
China's experience in the field of human rights as most
successful and significant.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with Zeng Jianhui,
Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's National
People's Congress, who arrived here Saturday morning to attend a
five-day International Conference on Human Rights and Ombudsman
to be opened here next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yohannes said, China's conception of human rights is widely
representative in the developing countries, and is worth learning
by developing countries including Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to the speaker, the right to survival is the most
critical. Ethiopia, Yohannes said, while focusing on nation
building and poverty eradication, is fully devoted to the full
realization of the basic of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The western way of approaching human rights issue, with its
emphasis on individuals, is meaningless for developing countries
such as Ethiopia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and China have many similarities in the field of
human rights, Dawit said, adding that China's experience in
economic development, poverty eradication and promotion of
development right is very important to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Zeng noted that both China and Ethiopia are faced with the
task of economic development, tackling poverty, raising people's
living standard and improving rights of survival and development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries can learn from each other and draw lessons
from each other's experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries forged diplomatic relations in 1970,
bilateral cooperation in many fields have been very fruitful, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng expressed China's appreciation with the support extended
by the Ethiopian government on human rights. He also expressed
the hope that the two countries' parliaments will strengthen
contact and cooperation in the future so that the overall
Sino-Ethiopian ties will be further developed.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Israel Pose Threats to Iran: Senior Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Iranian Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Rahim Safavi on Saturday
maintained that the United States and Israel are the major threats
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a geography seminar in Imam Hussein University,
Safavi said that at present none of Iran's neighbors could pose
military threats to it and that Iran regards the U.S. and Israel
as the only threats, the conservative evening newspaper Kayhan
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the allegations of the U.S. and Israel that Iran
damages peace and security in the Middle East is mere propaganda
campaign aimed at terrifying the regional countries and isolating
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country is adopting a foreign policy that
seeks unity of the regional countries and that it has taken
effective steps in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accuses Iran of trying to undermine the Mideast peace
process, seek weapons of mass destruction and support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that Iran can, instead, play a key role
in maintaining peace and security in neighboring areas, including
Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Indian Ocean, Caspian Sea and Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's safety, Safavi expressed confidence that
his country can guarantee national security in the coming years
since it enjoys strong cultural power, influence in the Islamic
world and internal stability.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized the decisions on the country's
administrative divisions, saying they are not successful in view
of national interests and security.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iran decided to divide some big provinces, including
the biggest northeastern province of Khorasan, bringing the number
of the administrative areas from 25 to 28.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Reiterates Rejection of Talks on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri
reiterated on Saturday his country's refusal to negotiate with
Israel over its withdrawal offer from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm our rejection of any negotiations" with Israel,
Berri told a rally held in Shagra town in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese people should know that whatever Israel has proposed,
including the Lebanon First, conditional withdrawal and what it
said on Friday, are all aimed at escaping international efforts
to achieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Israel put forward the Lebanon First proposal, which
suggested that its problems with Lebanon be solved first and then
that with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria rejected the proposal, arguing that Israel
was trying to drive a wedge between the two sides. They insisted
that they will negotiate with Israel simultaneously and not make
peace unilaterally with it.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel adopted the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 425, which demands unilateral Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon. But Israel conditioned its troop pullback on security
arrangements with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate stances on key
issues, have rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal be
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Berri said all the Israeli offers are aimed at separating
Lebanon and Syria in the peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the return of the Golan Heights captured by Israel
in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese resistance forces have been fighting to drive the
Israeli troops out of Lebanon and the ensuing heavy casualties
suffered by the Israeli troops have sparked public pressure in
Israel on the government to withdraw its troops.

<HEADLINE> S. Leoneans Demonstrate to Back Alleged Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- People in Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, Saturday waged a demonstration in the support of
arms supply by a British firm for the restoration of the
country's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the British company, Sandline
International, shipped arms and ammunition early this year to
Sierra Leone which was at that time under a United Nations arms
embargo as a measure to punish the military junta.
</P>
<P>
The then ousted Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
reportedly contacted British High Commissioner (ambassador) to
Sierra Leone Peter Penfold before the controversial arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Some British parliamentarians have been politicalizing the
deal, saying it was a breach of the U.N. arms sanction.
</P>
<P>
However, the people in Sierra Leone think differently and are
getting angry.
</P>
<P>
To Sierra Leoneans who suffered a lot since last May's
military coup, the west African peacekeeping force had already
done the job in a bid to overthrow the junta, before Sandline.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the right thing has been done at the end of the day as
the whole world agreed the junta should be removed and the
democratically elected government brought back.
</P>
<P>
They do not understand why anybody should wish it otherwise,
according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here.
</P>
<P>
So it is not a surprise the people from all sides of Freetown
demand the return of the British ambassador who is now in London
to answer some questions from the Customs and other departments
which are investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
In what the report described as a "quite remarkable" way, the
demonstrators kept chanting "Peter Penfold, We Love You" and
"Come back, Peter Penfold".
</P>
<P>
Some of them even said they don't want anybody else if the
British government tried to replace him.
</P>
<P>
One of the things the people are asking the government to do
is to grant Peter Penfold honorary citizenship of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The angry people also condemned some of the British
parliamentarians, whose names the report said were completely
unbroadcastable.
</P>
<P>
They believed one of the parliamentarians was the enemy of the
Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
In Makeni, Bo and other major towns, people were also been out
on the streets to protest the politicalization of the alleged
arms deal, the report added.

Wednesday will preside over a meeting of about 400 Egyptian and
French companies on the third day of his anticipated visit to
France to cement bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be devoted to pushing up bilateral economic
and trade cooperation through setting up joint ventures, the
Middle East News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Egyptian Businessmen Society Taher Al
Sherif said that the French side will announce, during the
meetings, the start of a number of joint ventures that are of
strategic importance to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
These projects cover the domains of infrastructure, services,
communications and productive sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian businessmen, accompanying Mubarak during his
three-day visit to France that starts on Monday, will pay field
visits to a number of French construction sites, including car
plants and a number of industrial areas that apply modern
environment-friendly technology.
</P>
<P>
The accompanying delegation includes 126 businessmen working in
areas of industry and exportation, with most of them already
having joint investment ventures with their French counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Up to 127 French businessmen representing 127 major French
companies will attend the French-Egyptian talks.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Promote Stamp Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) --The Tanzania Post Corporation
(TPC) has appealed to the public to promote the country's
philatelic business.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Stamp Collector's Association meeting over the
weekend, TPC's Director General Suleiman Msofe said if the hobby
of stamp collection is given much attention, it can be a useful
tool for the promotion of culture and education, local reports
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Stamps can also play a role in attracting foreigners to visit
Tanzania, thus boosting the country's tourism industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a move to promote the philatelic business, the TPC chief
pledged to improve marketing and advertisement of new stamp
issues through mass media both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The TPC director general urged the stamp collectors to form
clubs in their respective areas to develop the philatelic
business in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Jaffer Rawji, a well-known Tanzanian
philatelist, said it is discouraging to note that Tanzania with
less than 300 philatelist kids was doing very little in promoting
stamp collection business.
</P>
<P>
Rawji, who started collecting stamps since early 1970s, said
school children, overpowered by television and computers
nowadays, have grown less interested in stamps.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which was attended by more than 50
philatelists including pupils, David Mdundom was elected as the
first interim chairman of the Stamp Collection Club.
</P>
<P>
TPC also stressed the need to promote stamp designing by
utilizing qualified Tanzanian artists and hold stamp shows at
trade fairs and international conferences.

<P>
CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Technical
Committee charged with preparing a draft treaty to render the
Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction, is slated to
meet on Tuesday at its Cairo headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meetings of the ad-hoc technical committee, which
groups 13 Arab states, will embark on phrasing the treaty text,
setting its period of duration as well as the time span needed for
its revision.
</P>
<P>
The draft is "certainly unique" in the sense that it prohibits
all massively destructing weapons, not a specific type of them, AL
sources told the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is founded on three bases: the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), completion of the draft treaty on
the Middle East, and the Israeli rejection to sign the NPT and to
subject its nuclear establishments to international supervision.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that most of Arab leaders, especially
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, have demanded freeing the Middle
East from nukes without any exceptions.
</P>
<P>
"All Arab countries want to denuclearize the Mideast. Such an
objective necessitates that Israel and the region's other
countries, including Turkey, Iran and Cyprus should also catch
up," said the same sources.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid has asked the U.S. and
Russia to drive Israel toward inclusion in the treaty and
subjection of its nuclear facilities to the comprehensive
monitoring system.

<P>
BAGHDAD,May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly called
on Arabs on Saturday to stand against the United States-Israeli
hegemony.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Iraqi parliament after a session
to mark the 50th anniversary of usurpation of Palestine by Israel,
said the U.S.-Israeli hegemony is threatening the existence and
the future of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
It called on all Arabs to regard May 15 as an incentive to
strengthen their struggles and promote Arab stance on the issue to
the level of a battle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The statement demanded that Arabs put aside differences, unify
stances towards Israel and reject the U.S.-Zionist hegemony, which
it said has torn the world apart.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament contended that the embargoes imposed on
Arab countries, including Iraq, Libya and Sudan, are aimed at
strengthening Israel.
</P>
<P>
Massacres of Arabs committed by Israel during the past 50 years
have been supported by the U.S. and Britain, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"These massacres were aimed to judaize Arab Jerusalem and to
usurp the national and legitimate rights of the Palestinians," it
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Rwandan cabinet minister
Seth Sendashonga, who fled to Kenya in 1995, was shot dead here
Saturday afternoon, local reports quoted police sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
More than two killers, one of them armed with an AK-47 rifle,
attacked Sendashonga during a thunderstorm just after 4 p.m. at a
busy junction near the downtown area which hosts a lot of
foreigners and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Sendashonga died on the spot and his driver, a Kenyan, died on
the way to hospital, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
"There was blood all over the car and on the road," a witness
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The car used by the assassins was recovered on the other side
of Nairobi by the police later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sendashonga, a Hutu, who joined the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan
Patriotic Front (RPF) before it seized power in 1994, was
appointed as interior minister of Rwanda in July that year and
sacked in 1995. He then went into exile in Kenya as a leader of
the Rwandan opposition abroad.
</P>
<P>
He was regarded as a moderate Hutu opposed to the 1994
genocide in which more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were killed.
</P>
<P>
He survived a previous murder attempt on the outskirts of
Nairobi in June 1996 in which his nephew was critically wounded.

LHASA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The regional committee of the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Laid-Off Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Guaranteed basic living standards
and the re-employment of workers laid off from state-owned
enterprises are top-priority matters that have a bearing on the
overall situation of China's reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji here
Saturday, at the closing session of a national conference on the
problems of workers laid off from state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Officials in various departments must attach great importance
to this work, and make intensified and concerted efforts to make
it a success," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference was jointly convened by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State
Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, members of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the
closing session, which was presided over by Hu Jintao,
vice-president and also member of the Politburo Standing Committee
of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Attended by the governors of all provinces and the heads of
central government departments, the conference was aimed at finding
effective ways to ensure the basic living standards of workers
laid off by state enterprises and help them get new jobs as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
After hearing a keynote speech by President Jiang Zemin at the
opening session, the discussion focussed on a circular on the
guarantee of basic living standards and the re-employment of
laidoff workers. The circular is expected to be issued soon by the
central government.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that at present the Party and the state
should focus their attention on workers laid off by state
enterprises, because the workers in state enterprises have made
major contributions to China's economic development, reform and
opening-up, and to the growth of the state sector.
</P>
<P>
A satisfactory solution to this problem will also serve as a
precondition for achieving the Party Central Committee's goal of
completing the reform in most state-owned enterprises within the
next three years, they added.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that the central government tighten its
macro control of layoff workers from state enterprises, to make
sure that they do not add too much pressure to the employment and
social security.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out the importance of holding top Party and
government officers at all levels responsible for the welfare of
workers laid off by the state sector and seeking support from the
whole society in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji said the overall situation for China's
national economy has remained good since the beginning of this
year, and the country's development has been basically normal in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
"Some problems have appeared, but they were not unexpected and
should be mainly attributed to the impact of the financial crisis
in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the needs of economic growth and restructuring, he
said, the central government has taken timely and necessary
measures to expand domestic demand and increase investment.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that an economic growth of eight percent for
this year is absolutely attainable," said the premier.

<P>
HOHHOT, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A serious forest fire which broke
out in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region at 1:00
p.m. (Beijing Time) on May 13 had still not been brought under
control today.
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out at a forest farm in Xing'an League
(county), in the middle part of the Greater Xing'an Range, and
rapidly spread to neighboring Hulun Buir League, to the northwest
of the range.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 people, including forest farm staff, were
mobilized, as well as five planes and 100 vehicles, to fight the
blaze, which has destroyed 8,000 ha of forest land.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the fire is difficult to put out
because of strong winds in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
To ensure the livelihoods of laid-off workers and re-employment
of them is of great importance and urgency to the immediate
interests of workers, to the success of reform in state-owned
enterprises, and to the overall development and stability of the
country, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"The mounting number of people laid off by state enterprises is
a combined result of the in-depth contradictions in our country's
economic growth over the past few years, and is an unavoidable
stage in the course of reform and development," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that reckless investment, project redundancy,
overproduction, lack of capital funds and overstaffing have for a
long time left many enterprises mired in problems, forcing them to
lay off workers or delay payment of their wages.
</P>
<P>
Because China at the moment has an incomplete social security
system, the basic livelihoods of laid-work workers cannot be
ensured, and social problems tend to crop up, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises and sectors suffering heavy losses and big
difficulties are those which employ too many people. But it will
be an inevitable trend that employees will become fewer, along with
technological advance and improved capital structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The solution to the problem of overmanning in state enterprises
can only be attained on the basis of the current realities of the
country. To divert laid-off workers to other jobs and carry out
the re-employment program are crucial policy choices of the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"These are entirely positive policies for relieving the current
economic and social contradictions and promoting reform and
development in the long run, and a necessary link in the process
of building a good social security system," Zhu said.

<P>
Zhu said that ensuring the basic livelihoods of laid-off
workers is essential before finding new jobs for them. In this
sense, the establishment of re-employment service centers is an
effective measure.
</P>
<P>
All enterprises which lay off workers must set up re-employment
service centers or similar organizations, which will be
responsible for providing basic living expenses, paying social
insurance fees for them, organizing vocational training and
helping them obtain new jobs.
</P>
<P>
In principle, one third of social insurance funds should come
from fiscal budgets of central and local governments, one third
from enterprises and the remainder from other sectors of the
society.
</P>
<P>
However, the proportions may vary in different localities. Poor
areas will get financial assistance from the central government,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that retired workers from state enterprises
should be guaranteed comfort in their remaining years, because
they have made great contributions to the country. Pensions must
be paid on time, and any delayed part must be paid retroactively.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, legislation will be stepped up to ensure the
collection of pension funds, which can only be used to buy
treasury bonds. Anyone embezzling, misusing or wasting such funds
will be severely punished. In addition, workers in state-owned
enterprises may not retire before the legal age to do so,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The premier explained that old-age and unemployment insurance,
guarantee of basic livelihoods for laid-off workers and basic living
expenses for urban residents are the three complementary systems
of the Chinese-style social security mechanism under the present
conditions. In the long term, a comprehensive social security system
covering all workers will be set up, he said.

<P>
Zhu pointed out that the new situation demands boosting
re-employment with the reform measures in order to build an
employment mechanism in line with the development of the socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
To boost re-employment, it is essential to break away entirely
from the restraints of the old and decayed concepts of employment,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
People must abandon the concepts that employment only means
working at state- or collectively-owned enterprises, that there
are superior and inferior work posts, and that employees must
depend on the government for their "iron rice bowl," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked the concerned departments to guide laid-off workers
in selecting jobs according to their own will, starting new
careers through hard work and relying on the market to find new
jobs. Also, employers must change their concept of recruiting
staff, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said all walks of life should understand and respect
laid-off workers, and help them solve problems and increase
their confidence in getting new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that governments at all levels and the concerned
departments should offer necessary policy support and a favorable
social environment for those who are seeking jobs by themselves,
either individually or in groups.
</P>
<P>
Those departments should also depend on all social circles and
offer vocational training in various forms and at various levels,
in order to enable laid-off workers to match the demands of the
employment market as soon as possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they should actively develop and regulate the
labor market, establish and improve the employment information network
by modern means, and strengthen the management of the labor market
to protect the legitimate rights and interests of laid-off
workers, Zhu noted.

<P>
Zhu required the Party and government leaders at various levels
to be confident and work hard for the guarantee of the basic
livelihoods and re-employment of laid-off workers, because there
are favorable conditions for doing this work well.
</P>
<P>
First of all, all sides have reached a common understanding about
the central government's decisions on the reform of the state-owned
enterprises and the re-employment program.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the favorable macro conditions and the increasing
national strength have provided the material basis for solving the
re-employment problem.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local governments and enterprises have accumulated
rich experience in this matter, and the country is politically and
socially stable, Zhu said, noting that everyone must grasp the
current favorable opportunity and handle well the re-employment
work to lay a basis for long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also required that this work be done in line with this
year's economic growth target, and that local governments must
firmly carry out each measure stipulated by the central government.
</P>
<P>
He said local governments must attach great importance to grain
production, and carry out the reform of the grain marketing system
to the letter.
</P>
<P>
The policy of purchasing surplus grain at protective prices
must be firmly implemented, Zhu said, while local governments must
make sure that grain is sold at the market price, and that there
are no further management losses.
</P>
<P>
As for financial institutions, more positive measures should be
taken to boost the economic growth in the course of deepening the
financial reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Circulating funds should be guaranteed for profitable products,
support be increased for projects under construction, assessment
of new projects be accelerated, and more measures be taken to help
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the taxation departments must work harder in
collecting and managing taxes, and the foreign trade departments
should strive to expand exports and crack down on smuggling, Zhu
said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Accuses Israeli Troops of Shooting Marchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Sunday accused Israeli troops of firing live
bullets at Palestinian marchers on Thursday and killing at least
nine.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Gaza, Director General of PNA
Ministry of Health Imad Tarawieh said that autopsy has shown that
the nine victims were killed with explosive bullets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops deliberately aimed at the upper body of the
Palestinians taking part in the march, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA and some Palestinian groups organized a "million people
march" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Nakba, or catastrophe in Arabic, in which
millions of Palestinians were forced homeless due to the founding
of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948.
</P>
<P>
"There was a crime committed by Israeli forces while facing the
Palestinian peaceful marchers," PNA Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said in Gaza on Sunday,
referring to the killings.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this issue (killing) is conducted due to orders
from higher levels ..., when they (Israeli troops) receive orders,
they open fire for the purpose of killing," Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
The march has showed the Palestinians are ready to express
their tragedies and rights through actions not only on the
negotiation table, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA minister warned of a dangerous situation in
the Middle East if peace efforts fail.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit S. Africa in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat is to pay a state visit
to South Africa in August, South African president's office
confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela and Arafat would discuss "what heads
of state normally talk about", and Arafat would brief Mandela on
the Middle East peace process, spokesman Parks Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, Arafat's first to South Africa since he attended
Mandela's inauguration in 1994, would last more than 24 hours,
but the exact dates had not been fixed, Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the idea that South Africa's invitation to Arafat
indicated the country's support for the Palestinians in the
Middle East peace process, the spokesman said the South African
government had always supported the whole process rather than any
of the sides.
</P>
<P>
The visit was essentially about bilateral relations and there
was no plan of involving other southern African countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the spiritual leader of the radical
Palestinian movement Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was refused a
visa by the South African government after the Palestinian
National Authority reportedly pressured it to stop the visit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, China Qualify for Semi-Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Both defending champions
Indonesia and runners-up China qualified for the semi-finals after
they took an unassailable lead in their respective groups at the
17th Uber Cup women's badminton world team championships finals
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Joining them in the semi-finals are South Korea and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians of Group B were stretched to five games before
taking the tie against the Netherlands 3-2 and China won over
Japan 4-1 in Group A, both on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In other actions of the day, South Korea beat England 4-1 in
Group B and Denmark of Group A downed Hong Kong, China, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Leading Group B are Indonesia and South Korea, which had each
won two ties so far, with only one remaining. Group A leaders are
now China and Denmark, winning two ties each. They each have one
more match to play, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China's third-ranked Gong Zhichao was upset by Japan's
31st-ranked Yasuki Mizui 11-4, 1-11, 3-11, in the day's biggest
surprise.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Gong has been thought as one of the most
hopeful successors of the current world number one and world
singles champion Ye Zhaoying, who is now 24.
</P>
<P>
"Technically speaking, Gong should not have lost the match. But
she seemed to be under much pressure from herself during the match
which foiled her efforts to play her normal game," said Chinese
coach Li Lingwei.
</P>
<P>
And Gong failed to control the game after the change of ends in
the match as there was a wind over the court, Li said.
</P>
<P>
But this loss would not affect the selection of the singles
players for the team's next tie against Denmark on Wednesday, Li
said. "We'll always field the strongest team," she added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's trial use of a new combination for the doubles
proved to be a failure on Sunday. The eighth-ranked pair of
Indarti Soiliana and Denyana Lomban was split as Isoliana had to
team with Finarshi to take on the Dutch pair of Nicole van Hooren
and Lotte Jonathans. The Indonesians were beaten 15-18, 15-3,
9-15.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also lost the second singles, with 32nd-ranked
Meiluawati losing to Brenda Beenhakker 12-9, 5-11, 7-11.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cup Finals will continue on Monday, when Indonesia will
take on South Korea and Malaysia meet the Netherlands in Group B
while in Group A, China will play Hong Kong, China, and Denmark
face Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Han Xue, Chao Na Win Two Titles for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAODING, North China, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Han Xue and Chao Na,
both from Beijing, split the spotlight on the third day of the
Chinese National Swimming Championships here on Sunday, winning
the 100 meters breaststroke and the 100m freestyle, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Han, 17, women's short-course 50m breaststroke world record
holder, led the field at the 50m turn by a body-length but was
chased closely on the last 15 meters. She finally clinched the
title in a time of one minute 10.37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Li Wei, from Shanghai, surged from the last 50 meters and
finished second in 1:10.86, ahead of Xu Shan in 1:11.10.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to win the gold, though the result is a little bit
slower than that at the Chinese National Games last October," Han
said. "I felt tired after the semi-finals."
</P>
<P>
"I should have swam 200m individual medley and 100m freestyle,
but the two events clashed with my speciality 100m breaststroke,
so I had to give up those two," Han added.
</P>
<P>
Chao Na, 18, who dominated the first 75 meters, held off the
strong challenge from her closest rival Nian Yun of Jiangsu
Privince to grab the 100m freestyle by one hundredth of a second
in 56.14.
</P>
<P>
World 400m individual medley world record holder Chen Yan came
into the third place in 57.00.
</P>
<P>
"Chao's personal best is 55.35, so her performance today
reflects her weakness in endurance, since she had already swam the
100m freestyle for five times, including 4X100m free relay and
preliminaries and semi-finals," Chao's coach Chen Yinghong was not
in a celebration mood.
</P>
<P>
Pan Licong from Heilongjiang Province won the men's 200m
butterfly in 2:02.08, Xie Xufeng won the silver in 2:02.17 and
Zhang Peng took the bronze in 2:02.77.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wei wrapped up his second gold medals in the men's 200m
individual medley in 2:05.52. Wang Xianqiang and Wang Haizhou
shared the second place with an identical time of 2:07.17.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Editorial on China's Re-employment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- An editorial to be published in
tomorrow's "People's Daily" calls the guaranteeing of the basic
livelihoods and re-employment of laid-off workers important tasks
and major issues affecting the overall situation in China.
</P>
<P>
A proper settlement of these matters is not only vital for
state-owned enterprises to fulfill their reform programs and get
out of difficulties over the next three years, but will also have
a significant and far-reaching effect on the sustainable
development of the national economy, it says.
</P>
<P>
At a work conference held by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Council, participants
studied the current economic situation of the country and overall
arrangements made to guarantee the basic livelihoods and
re-employment of laid-off workers, says the editorial, calling on
the whole nation to earnestly study and carry out the guideline
announced at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that it is inevitable that some workers
will be laid off and face re-employment in the course of the
transformation from the planned economy to the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
This is a basic measure to reinvigorate the state-owned
enterprises by means of "encouraging mergers, regulating
bankruptcy, reducing the workforce and increasing efficiency and
carrying out reemployment program," it says.
</P>
<P>
The layoffs and re-employment have caused temporary
difficulties for some workers, the editorial says, but they are
conducive to economic growth and all-round social development, and
will finally create more favorable conditions for all the people
to become well-off.
</P>
<P>
With the support and firm leadership of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council, the Party committees and
governments at each level have worked hard and made certain
achievements in handling the re-employment program, the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
But the resolution of the issues of guaranteeing the basic
livelihoods and re-employment of laid-off workers are still hard
tasks and require further unifying thinking and extra work, it
notes.
</P>
<P>
The editorial emphasizes that the concerned departments must
work out feasible plans to make sure that the work will be
conducted in an organized and planned manner.
</P>
<P>
The Party committees and governments at each level must help
laid-off workers in fostering new employment concept in line with
the socialist market economy and offer them fine employment
services, while all social organizations must give more support
and create a sound social environment for laid-off workers, it
stresses.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China held a series of nationwide
activities to mark today's eighth National Day for Aiding the
Disabled, which takes "poverty-relief" as its theme.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, and leading officials of the All-China Women's
Federation and China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF) visited
two poverty-stricken families of disabled persons in the Xuanwu
district of the capital city this morning.
</P>
<P>
At Wangfujing, a downtown commercial center, a rehabilitation
consultation service for the disabled was held, with the
attendance of experts on medical treatment and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
An inaugural ceremony for a service agency for the disabled was
held in Daxing, a suburban county of Beijing, which will provide
various kinds of assistance for the disabled to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, chairman of the CDPF, went to Yongqing and Haixing

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Pledges Not to Use Nukes for Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee assured the international community Sunday that his
country would never use its nuclear program as a "weapon of
aggression."
</P>
<P>
There would be no change in India's "long and vigorous pursuit
of peace in the region and the world," Vajpayee was quoted by the
Press Trust of India as saying in the port city of Kochi in the
southwestern state of Kerala.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reassure the international community that the
nuclear tests will make no change in India's long and vigorous
pursuit of peace in the region and the world. Ours will never be
the weapons of aggression," said the Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating an institute of medical sciences and research in
Kochi, Vajpayee said the tests would help India emerge as a
nuclear weapon state, asserting that India is surrounded by
countries having nuclear capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be taken by surprise," said Vajpayee, who
first declared India a nuclear weapon state last Friday.
</P>
<P>
When India conducted five nuclear tests last week, thereby
announcing its emergence as a nuclear weapon state, Vajpayee said,
"we did so on the basis of our own sound and careful appraisal of
the regional and global security scenario."
</P>
<P>
He repeated his position that India could not succumb to
pressures to sign what he called discriminatory treaties like the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the non-proliferation treaties
which he said have utterly failed to bring about any progress in
global nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all Indians to further strengthen the sense of
national unity.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) - Two Palestinians were reportedly
injured in the West Bank town of Hebron Sunday as clashes between
the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers entered its fourth day.
</P>
<P>
The Clashes erupted when Palestinians threw firebombs and
stones at Israeli soldiers, who responded with rubber bullets,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>

Meanwhile, Israeli army banned Israelis from entering the West
Bank towns of Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem and
Palestinian-controlled part of Hebron, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers
started with Thursday's "Million-Man March" staged by
Palestinians to mark the 50th anniversary of "al nakba."
</P>
<P>
Al nakba, Arabic for the "catastrophe," refers to the loss of
Palestinian homeland following the creation of Israel in 1948.

<HEADLINE> India Discloses Details of Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- India disclosed on Sunday details
of the nuclear tests it conducted last week which included the
test of a 45-kiloton hydrogen bomb on May 11.
</P>
<P>
The critical data collected from the five tests at Pokhran
Range, the northwest desert state of Rajasthan, have enhanced
India's capability to design new nuclear weapons through computer
simulation, R. Chidambaram, chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC), told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Putting at rest Western speculation that India had tested a
boosted fission device and not a hydrogen bomb, Chidambaram said
they used a fission trigger and a secondary fusion device. A
boosted fission device does not have a secondary stage.
</P>
<P>
He said the yield of the hydrogen bomb, which could have been
designed to be much higher, was deliberately kept low to avoid
damage to the structures in a nearest village.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that fissile material used in all the five tests,
code-named Shakti-98 Nuclear Mission, was completely indigenous
and the tests were the culmination of a weaponization program
started in the country years ago.
</P>
<P>
The AEC chairman declined to disclose either the depths at
which the five devices were placed or the nature of the fuel used,
saying only that the devices were placed in five separate holes.
</P>
<P>
According to Chidambaram, the yields of the three devices
tested on May 11 were 45 kilotons for the thermonuclear device, 15
kilotons for the fission device and 0.2 kilotons for the low-yield
device and those for the two low-yield devices tested on May 13
were 0.5 and 0.3 kilotons respectively.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions about whether India is going to induct
nuclear weapons, scientific adviser to the defense minister P. J.
Abdul Kalam said India is already a nuclear weapon state under
Clause Nine of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
He declared that India's weaponization is complete and the
command and control system, which is already existing in different
forms, now requires consolidation.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent tests have provided critical data for the
validation of India's "capability in the design of nuclear weapons
of different yields for different applications and different
delivery systems."
</P>
<P>
These tests have "significantly enhanced our capability in
computer simulation of new designs and taken us to the stage of
sub-critical experiments in the future if considered necessary,"
Kalam said.
</P>
<P>
He told the crowed press conference that the high-energy
explosive used in all the devices for compressing the core came
from the explosive laboratory of the country's Defense Research
and Development Organization.

ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has firmly denied
reports that it conducted a nuclear test Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
"This is a motivated rumor," said a Foreign Office spokesman in
a one-sentence statement Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after a Western news agency reported earlier
Sunday that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, "quoting reliable
information," said in Birmingham, England, that Pakistan had
carried out a nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
The news agency also quoted Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto as saying, "We have unconfirmed information that
Pakistan conducted a nuclear test."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Disabled Farmer Turns to Raising Rabbits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- When Li Guozheng lost his right arm
in an accident 23 years ago, he thought that he had also lost the
ability to feed the family, as his wife is disabled also.
</P>
<P>
Now Li, 62, earns at least 2,000 yuan (about 240 US dollars) a
month by breeding rabbits, whose soft fur is sought by garment
factories and whose meat is becoming increasingly popular on
Chinese dinner tables.
</P>
<P>
"I'll breed more rabbits this year," he said, ``and earn 4,000
yuan to 5,000 yuan a month."
</P>
<P>
Li's family has benefitted from a special loan project which
grants a handicapped person some 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan to set
up in business.
</P>
<P>
To qualify, the loan applicant must be able to work and
promise to pay the loan back, said Tian Bin, an official with the
China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF), which sponsors the
project.
</P>
<P>
"Out of the 17 million poverty-stricken handicapped people in
China, 14 million have the ability to do some work," Tian
said. "Unfortunately, they tend to be shunned because of their
deformities, and lack financial and technological support."

"Providing loans has proved to be much more effective than
simply allocating relief funds, because the recipients must make
every effort to earn to pay back the loans, and not just live on
government aid," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
The official, who was visiting Li Guozheng's village to check
the use of the loans, told Xinhua today that the CDPF and the
Agricultural Bank of China plan to provide 500 million yuan in
loans to the disabled every year during the 1998-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
"We're pressed for time, because the government has set the
year 2000 as the deadline for helping all the handicapped in the
country to shake off poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Not only Tian but the whole country has no longer than three
years left to fulfill the goal set four years ago to enable
some 80 million people living in poverty to have enough to eat and
wear.
</P>
<P>
At presernt, China has 50 million poor people, of which one
third are handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Those who are disabled and live in areas far from cities may
not be as lucky as the Lis.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we chose 'Helping Poor Disabled People' as the
theme of today's nationwide activities," Tian said, referring to
the eighth National Day for Aiding the Disabled.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the project will cover about 500 counties across
the country.

<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government urged its
nationals again on Sunday to leave Indonesia by Wednesday as
situation there remained unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
"The situation remains unpredictable. The embassy is concerned
about the possibility of further unrest around May 20,
particularly in the major cities," the Foreign Office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The office issued an appeal on Friday to urge the British
citizens to leave the riot-hit country and advised Britons to
delay their trip to Jakarta unless the journey was essential.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 British expatriates flew back to London from
Indonesia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said more commercial flights were planned
out of Jakarta in the coming days to get Britons out of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Those with no pressing reason to remain are now advised to
leave by normal commercial means. Those who do remain should stay
indoors on May 20," it said.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, hundreds of people have died during the riot
in Indonesia with many cars burned and shops looted.

<HEADLINE> Iran Invites Global Bidding for Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran has invited international
bidding for the project of building a pipeline to transfer oil
from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, local daily Iran News
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) said the 392-kilometer
pipeline, linking Neka in the northern province of Mazadaran, and
Rey near the capital Tehran, will be built through exchange
programs with Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
The NIOC estimated the project would cost 300 to 400 million
U.S. dollars in a period of two years, hoping the construction
would begin by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March
21, 1999).
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is to have a daily transferring capacity of
380,000 barrels, and probably make Iran the quickest and cheapest
route for shipping oil from the Caspian Sea region to the outside
world, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced the construction of this pipeline after some
Caspian littoral states decided to lay a pipeline on the Caspian
seabed between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan Republic, a move
rejected by Iran on the ground that it might pose a serious threat
to the sea's environment.

ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Sunday reiterated that his country possesses nuclear
capability and it can go nuclear "within 12 to 26 hours."
</P>
<P>
Briefly speaking at a party workers meeting in Lahore, the
prime minister reaffirmed the solemn pledge not to compromise on
national security at all for any monetary gains, according to a
report by the official Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We are not worried on the nuclear tests carried out by India
recently because Pakistan has the same potential to conduct the
nuclear test," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can prove our nuclear worth within 12 to 26 hours," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken any decision in haste in this regard and we
are monitoring the sharp reaction of the world toward Indian
nuclear explosion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said India, in view of its internal political instability,
conducted nuclear tests to establish supremacy and to gain some
political gains in the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying the international scenario carefully and
taking into account the situation judiciously arising as a result
of Indian nuclear tests," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
left here Sunday morning for London on the first leg of his trip
to three West European nations.
</P>
<P>
Soon after arrival, the Egyptian top diplomat will attend an
annual celebration by the Palestinian community there and address
the gathering on the latest Middle East peace process developments.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will also meet Monday with his British counterpart Robin
Cook over a working breakfast, to discuss European role in the
stalemated peace process.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the holder of the current rotating presidency of the
European Union, has recently taken a prominent profile in the
Mideast peace making. Cook and Prime Minister Tony Blair each paid
a visit to the region in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day stop in London, Moussa will then fly to Paris
to join the official delegation accompanying President Hosni
Mubarak on a visit to France on May 18-20.
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak's visit to France slated for Monday takes
place at a time when the Middle East peace process is facing a
critical situation," Moussa said before leaving here.
</P>
<P>
The president will discuss with his French counterpart the
latest developments of the peace process and means of activating
the European role in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
He cast doubt on Israel's claimed readiness to pursue peace in
the region now that Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu's talks in
Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have
produced no breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu did not budge in rejecting the U.S. proposal calling
for Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he will also visit Bonn on Thursday for talks with
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on ways of salvaging the
peace process, the Euro-Med partnership and bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Output Plunges in N. Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Coffee production in Arusha
Region in north Tanzania plunged to 2,000 tons, compared with
10,000 tons in the past years, Sunday News said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The coffee crop co-ordinator of the region, Zebedayo Swai,
said that the decrease of coffee production in the region was
caused by drought and lack of inputs in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said production of the crop is expected to increase this
year blessed by heavy rains linked to the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Swai said the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives has
started to take special measures to increase the production of
coffee in the region. The measures include supervising nurseries
of coffee seedlings and conducting seminars for concerned
officers and farmers.
</P>
<P>
The co-ordinator said about 615,000 coffee seedlings have been
planted in nurseries and 200,000 seedlings sold to farmers,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Arusha region has 21,000 hectares of coffee, 18,000 hectares
of which are owned by small farmers. The rest are estates.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's coffee is mainly produced in Arusha, Kilimanjaro
and Mbeya regions. Coffee export earnings over the past three
years totaled 120 million U.S. Dollars and accounted for 15
percent of all commodity exports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy to Return to Cyprus in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
said U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke will return to Cyprus in June
to discuss procedural issues relating to the resumption of peace
negotiation between the island's two communities.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation on Sunday quoted Clerides
as saying that Holbrooke is expected to visit Cyprus after the
European Union (EU) summit to be held in Cardiff, Wales, in June.
</P>
<P>
"His visit will focus on procedural issues and not the essence
of the Cyprus problem," Clerides said. He added that all parties
involved in finding a settlement in Cyprus are expecting the
results of the Cardiff summit.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who was appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton as
his emissary for Cyprus last year, was on the island early this
month in a bid to resume negotiations between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
His efforts stumbled on preconditions set by Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, for the recognition of his self-styled
regime in northern Cyprus and the withdrawal of Cyprus'
application to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops on the island and took over the northern third in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only
by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks with the
Greek Cypriot leader Clerides last summer to protest the EU's
decision to open accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
He has since insisted that the peace talks could be resumed
only if they will be held on "state-to-state" basis.
</P>
<P>
So far the negotiations have been carried out by Clerides and
Denktash in their capacity as leaders of their respective
communities, in accordance with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Cardiff summit is expected to tackle EU relations with
Turkey, which failed to be included as one of the first candidates
for EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Ruins Fishery Resource in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The recent oil spill in part of the
Bakassi Peninsula in southeastern Nigeria where the big-name
Mobil is operating has deteriorated fishery resources in the
area.
</P>
<P>
For the past three months, local people, seeing more fish
floating in the sea than ever before, have been complaining of
"Akpa Ifonke", a native saying meaning "the sea is bad", the New
Nigerian reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the persistent poor catch due to the pollution
effect, ignorant fishermen have invited a clergyman to offer
special prayers to God for better fish landing.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is yet to improve despite the effort at
divine intervention, the official daily said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, cases of abdominal pain have been on the rise in
recent times since the people's source of drinking water is the
sea, it said, quoting Lt.-Col. Danladi Kaka, the commanding
officer of the Nigerian army in charge of that area.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a visiting team of Mobil assessment and verification
officials at the weekend, Lt.-Col. Kaka said oil films were
noticed everywhere in the area and four out-board engines
belonging to his command had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
Admitted that the fishermen's claim were not baseless, the
team leader said the team would analyze the specimen collected
and make recommendations to Mobil for payment of compensation,
which he assured would be done soon.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the team is to ensure that Mobil was not
over-taxed and the people not under-paid.

Paraguay 1-1 in the opening game of round-robin Kirin Cup

Paraguay took a 1-0 lead on a corner when the ball was swung in

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Several dozens of Israeli Green
Peace activists Sunday demonstrated outside the Indian Embassy in
Tel-Aviv, to protest against nuclear tests carried out by India
last week.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Israel Radio, the demonstrators
painted themselves red, wore gas masks and lay on the road in
front of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The protest came amid international outrage over India's five
nuclear blasts last Monday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, and other governments have announced
sanctions against India, accusing it of provoking a regional arms
race with neighboring Pakistan and undermining the world's
security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Army said in a statement Thursday that its
Chief of General Staff Amnon Shahak has called off a trip to India
scheduled for the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not elaborate why the trip was canceled. But
local newspaper Maariv reported Friday that the decision was made
to avoid the perception that Israel was carrying out "business as
usual" with India, while other countries condemned it for the
nuclear tests.

<HEADLINE> Dar Vendor Cries over Eggs Eaten by Crows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A Dar es Salaam vendor has
suffered a loss of more than 70 U.S. Dollars after his eggs were
spilled and eaten by Indian crows, according to a report by the
Sunday Observer.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened as Matiku Wambura, the vendor, failed to
negotiate a sharp curve and fell off his bicycle when he was
heading toward the Kariakoo Central Market to deliver eggs to his
clients Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As he stood up, Wambura could not believe his eyes -- the eggs
had become delicious meals of hungry crows flying down from
surrounding trees!
</P>
<P>
Although two women nearby had came to the rescue using clubs,
stones and tree branches to disperse the birds, Wambura salvaged
only 129 eggs in the end.
</P>
<P>
He said the crows had devoured 471 eggs making him lose 47,100
Shillings (about 71 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Indian crows are unwelcome in Dar es Salaam because they not
only steal people's food, valuable items such as gold chains, but
also transmit diseases and make noises.
</P>
<P>
The crows are also aggressive predators to domestic poultry
and other bird species but they themselves have no natural enemy,
said an official with the Wildlife Conservation Society of
Tanzania (WCST).
</P>
<P>
Since last year, residents have trapped and killed more than
9,000 Indian crows in the city with special traps made of wire
mesh and timber with the help of the Canadian Fund for Local
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The crows originated from Asia and were introduced in the
Zanzibar isles one century ago. They were brought to Dar es
Salaam around 1955 by unknown people.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Red Crescent Society Calls for More Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Red Crescent Society Sunday
called on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide more
aid for Iraqi people who are suffering under the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
Sadik Hamed Alwash, chairman of the society, told a press
conference that Iraq was still in urgent need of humanitarian aid
despite the U.N. oil-for-food deal and the work of international
humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
Alwash said over 5,000 children have been registered dead due
to severe shortage of food and medicine. Iraqi official figures
indicated that about 1.5 million people, mainly elderly and
children, have perished since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal adopted in December 1996 allowed Iraq to
sell limited oil worth 2 billion U.S. dollars each six months to
buy food, medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. expanded the deal, which is now in its third phase,
earlier this year by permitting Iraq to boost its oil exports to
5.2 billion dollars in its fourth phase.
</P>
<P>
The third phase expires on June 3.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi side has said its exports in the fourth
phase will be based on the availability of spare parts to upgrade
its oil production facilities, but will not exceed 4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chairman urged international humanitarian organizations to
continue to work for the lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian aid could only alleviate part of Iraqi people's
sufferings, he said.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) certifies that it has rid itself of long-range missiles
and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM last month told the U.N. Security Council reviewing the
sanctions that there was virtually no progress in verifying Iraq's
banned-weapon-free claims, which led to the maintaining of the
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka Makes Progress in Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has scored encouraging
progress in its economic reforms which are aimed at achieving a
sustained high growth rate and significantly reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The progress is mainly the result of the systematic and
coordinate approach to reforms in the country's financial sector,
trade, capital market and privatization, which the present
government has adopted since coming to power in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, the government formulated a comprehensive
restructuring plan to introduce legal and institutional reforms in
the financial sector, with the Bangladesh Bank, the country's
central bank, charged with developing action programs to
strengthen supervision and monitoring of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government's bank borrowing was reduced
remarkably to 3.44 billion taka (about 75 million U.S. dollars)
during the July 1997-January 1997 period from 9.15 billion taka
(about 200 million dollars) in the corresponding period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to deal with the heavy burden of default loans
totaling about 140 billion taka ( 3.04 billion dollars) at
present, a bankruptcy law has been passed by the parliament and a
number of courts set up for trying default loan cases and
expediting loan recovery.
</P>
<P>
And President Shahabuddin Ahmed suggested recently the
establishment of special tribunals to deal with the loan
defaulters.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress made so far, the financial sector is still
beset with problems such as inefficient service delivery, lack of
new services and absent of effective competition, and the central
bank is yet to fully enforce the desired level of discipline,
according to the Finance Ministry's Report on Progress in Reforms
(1996-98) issued recently.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, further work is needed especially in the areas of
loan-recovery and bank management, human resources development,
commercial bank restructuring, privatization of national
commercial banks, and strengthening of the central bank for
improving the intermediation work in the commercial banking
sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the field of trade, the Bangladeshi government has pledged
its commitment to the pursuit of progressive trade liberalization
through further removal of quantitative restrictions and
moderation of protection.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has recently approved an Import Policy Order, which
was formulated for the first time for a term of five years instead
of two years. The government hopes that the policy, which could be
reviewed every year in case of necessity, would further reduce the
quantitative restrictions, and help create a stable long-term
favorable investment climate in the country. ( More )

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Hold First Stockpiled Goods Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Stockpiled industrial goods will
be auctioned in China's largest industrial center of Shanghai for
the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
The auction is to be held on May 26-27 at the Huadong (East
China) Trade Square of Shanghai, said Yang Zezheng, deputy general
manager of the municipal stockpiled industrial goods swap center,
at a press conference held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thirty kinds of stocked products to go on sale will include
mechanical and electrical equipment, auto spare parts, second-hand
motor vehicles, rubber tyre and chemical raw materials, involving
a total value of 150 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some of the products will be sold without any opening bid. As
their list prices are fairly low, there can be possibilities for
appreciations, said Fan Ganping, who will be in charge of the
auction.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 enterprises in the fields of metallurgy,
electricity, textile and light industry will send representatives
to the auction.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's industrial sector has a reserve of 4.6 billion
yuan-worth (554 million US dollars) of manufactured goods by the
end of 1997. To help alleviate the burden of these enterprises,
the municipal government set up a swap center for stockpiled goods
early this year. And 1.8 billion yuan-worth ((217 million US
dollars) of good kept in stock have so far been sold out by the
means of holding sales exhibitions or through other channels.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Public Prosecution Head Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has suspended Director of Public Prosecution Meebelo Kalima from
duty pending investigations by a tribunal of judges to determine
his continued tenure of office.
</P>
<P>
This move was announced in a statement issued here Saturday by
Presidential Press Aide Richard Sakala to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
Sakala also revealed that President Chiluba has since
appointed a three-member tribunal to determine the question of
Kalima's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press aide, however, neither disclosed the
reasons why Kalima has been suspended nor announced who will be
acting in Kalima's absence.
</P>
<P>
Kalima was, in 1996, together with four others appointed as
member of the Electoral Commission. And in 1997, Chiluba
appointed him as Director of Public Prosecution.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that the suspension of Kalima from office
may be relevant to the delayed trial of the 82 treason accused
members who were allegedly involved in last October's foiled
military coup.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd
plans to invest ten billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) to
expand its production capacity from last year through the years to
the year 2001, said an senior official from the firm.
</P>
<P>
By then, the firm's oil refining capacity is expected to reach
10 million tons, double the current level and that of ethylene
increase to 850,000 tons from present 550,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment will be financed through banks, said Lu
Yiping, manager of the firm, recently, adding that an investment
of two billion yuan (241 million US dollars) last year has been
completed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's petrochemical firms still have room for
development, as 30 to 40 percent of the petrochemical goods needed
for domestic use are imported. However, he added, the crucial
factor is to make our products more competitive on the world
market, and the technical upgrading will be given priority in the
expansion process.
</P>
<P>
The firm has also set its plan for the year 2010 in an effort
to quadruple its current total assets and sales volume.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Lower Economic Ties with Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced to lower its
"economic ties" with Buenos Aires, after Argentina recalled all
diplomats here except the charge d'affaires, and reduced
diplomatic relations "to the minimum."
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio on Sunday quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying that Iran made the decision following
the repeated "baseless accusations" that Iran were behind two
blasts in Buenos Aires which killed 114 people.
</P>
<P>
Iran has vehemently denied it was involved in the bombings in
1992 and 1994 which destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires
and the Jewish center respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said "we have warned the Argentine charge
d'affaires in Tehran that Iran will reconsider its ties with
Argentina" if Buenos Aires continues its allegations against
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman failed to mention what measures will be
actually taken to effect the reduction of "economic ties."
</P>
<P>
The Argentine diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
Thursday and warned that the Argentine accusations would have
serious negative impact on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
After the 1994 bomb explosion, an Iranian national Manouchehr
Motamer offered information to the Argentine authorities,
incriminating Iranian diplomats in the bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran claimed that the Iranian citizen was a
"fraud" and his evidence had no judicial value.

<P>
The cabinet has also approved recently an Export Policy Order
for a five-year period, which is designed to effect sustained
increase in export earnings within the quickest possible time by
diversifying export base and increasing export quantity.
</P>
<P>
As a result of conducive policies and a judicious incentive
structure, the country's exports have been growing rapidly. Annual
exports grew nearly 14 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year against
12 percent in previous fiscal year. Export growth in the current
fiscal year up to February 1998 was 16.5 percent compared with the
same period in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The highest rate of customs duty has been brought down from 50
percent to 45 percent in fiscal 1996-97 and then to 42.5 percent
in 1997-98, and to rationalize the tariff structure and enhance
protection to emerging industries in the country, import duties on
certain raw materials and spares have also been reduced.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government is planning steps to remove the
remaining anomalies in the tariff structure and further reduce
dispersion of tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
So far Bangladesh has two stock exchange markets respectively
located in Dhaka and the southeast seaport city of Chittagong,
which have amassed huge amount of capital for the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
To broaden investors' participation and to improve efficiency,
the government is setting up a national stock exchange and will
further relax the restrictions on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, regulations allowing merchant banks' operations were
issued, and to date, the stock exchange commission has issued
merchant bank licenses to 17 companies in a bid to improve
institutional support, heighten the level of their participation
in the securities market and to further activate the capital
market.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's state-owned enterprises (SOEs), most of which have
long suffered losses due to reasons like inefficiency and
mismanagement, are in the process of privatization, an important
component of the government's overall market-oriented development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the privatization process, the government
formulated the Privatization Bill 1998 this year providing the
legal framework for privatizing SOEs, and reconstituted the
country's Board of Privatization (BOP) to include parliament
members, private sectors' representatives and professionals.
</P>
<P>
Privatization cells have been set up in loss-making SOEs under
different ministries for assisting the BOP in identifying,
preparing, processing, implementing and monitoring SOEs for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
To help the affected workers in privatizing the SOEs, the board
is planning to introduce a training program to develop marketable
skills for their re-employment such as by building up viable
micro-enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since the BOP was formed in 1993, 12 industries were privatized
up to 1996. And since June 1996, the privatization process has
been speeded up.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-97 fiscal year, the government finalized the
sale of 18 enterprises to private firms, and the BOP has
identified 54 enterprises for privatization so far in the current
fiscal year (July 1997-June 1998).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as one of the least developed countries in the
world with a weak economic base, Bangladesh still faces arduous
tasks ahead on its way of economic reform. In order to expedite
its economic development and poverty alleviation, the country
needs to make more painstaking efforts in the future.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka Makes Progress in Economic Reforms ( By Hao Fusheng, Pan Yunzhao ) (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has scored encouraging
progress in its economic reforms which are aimed at achieving a
sustained high growth rate and significantly reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
The progress is mainly the result of the systematic and
coordinate approach to reforms in the country's financial sector,
trade, capital market and privatization, which the present
government has adopted since coming to power in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, the government formulated a comprehensive
restructuring plan to introduce legal and institutional reforms in
the financial sector, with the Bangladesh Bank, the country's
central bank, charged with developing action programs to
strengthen supervision and monitoring of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government's bank borrowing was reduced
remarkably to 3.44 billion taka (about 75 million U.S. dollars)
during the July 1997-January 1997 period from 9.15 billion taka
(about 200 million dollars) in the corresponding period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to deal with the heavy burden of default loans
totaling about 140 billion taka ( 3.04 billion dollars) at
present, a bankruptcy law has been passed by the parliament and a
number of courts set up for trying default loan cases and
expediting loan recovery.
</P>
<P>
And President Shahabuddin Ahmed suggested recently the
establishment of special tribunals to deal with the loan
defaulters.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress made so far, the financial sector is still
beset with problems such as inefficient service delivery, lack of
new services and absent of effective competition, and the central
bank is yet to fully enforce the desired level of discipline,
according to the Finance Ministry's Report on Progress in Reforms
(1996-98) issued recently.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, further work is needed especially in the areas of
loan-recovery and bank management, human resources development,
commercial bank restructuring, privatization of national
commercial banks, and strengthening of the central bank for
improving the intermediation work in the commercial banking
sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the field of trade, the Bangladeshi government has pledged
its commitment to the pursuit of progressive trade liberalization
through further removal of quantitative restrictions and
moderation of protection.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has recently approved an Import Policy Order, which
was formulated for the first time for a term of five years instead
of two years. The government hopes that the policy, which could be
reviewed every year in case of necessity, would further reduce the
quantitative restrictions, and help create a stable long-term
favorable investment climate in the country. ( More )

<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines joins the world-wide
condemnation of India's two more nuclear tests on May 13 following
the three tests that were carried out on May 11, said President
Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here Sunday, Ramos said that he is
"deeply disturbed over India's defiance of the strong support of
the international community for nuclear non-proliferation and
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"I am also concerned at the effects of these tests on the peace
and stability in South Asia and at their serious implications for
global security," he added.
</P>
<P>
He strongly urged India to refrain from carrying out any
further tests and not to proceed with its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
"I join the call of the international community in its appeal
for the neighbors of India to exercise the highest degree of
restraint in order to maintain peace and stability in the region,"
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a nuclear arms race and nuclear proliferation
constitute a threat to international peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption Officers Arrested in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Anti-Corruption Commission
(ACC) officers have been arrested for alleged demanding kickbacks
from a Lusaka business woman to save her from prosecution as an
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The two officers had been pressuring the woman to pay three
million Kwacha (about 1,500 U.S. Dollars) for them to close an
old case of alleged bribery which they accused her of being
involved in, Sunday Times of Zambia reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Nora Millies Madden, Director of Seekers Estate
Agents and General Dealer said Saturday that one of the two was
arrested when he went to her office Saturday afternoon to collect
a balance of 100,000 Kwacha, unknowing that other officers had
waylaid him after she tipped them.
</P>
<P>
The other man who had remained outside was also arrested and
they were taken to the commission's headquarters in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
She said she was only saved from the harassment by the two men
after she reported the matter to one of the senior officer at ACC
last week.
</P>
<P>
she said she has given them more than one million Kwacha since
April this year when the problem began, adding that she could not
report the matter at first because she was scared.
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared and did not know where to report
especially that those troubling me were from the ACC until when I
was advised to report to their superiors," Madden said.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- the mayor of Sri Lanka's northern
Jaffna town, Sarojini Yogeswaran, was shot dead by a lone gunman
on Sunday, informed sources here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Yogeswaran, 60, was attacked at her home in
Jaffna city, about 260 kilometers from Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Yogeswaran, a member of the Tamil United Liberation Front
(TULF) was sworn in March this year as the first Mayor of former
Tamil rebel northern strong-hold Jaffna since 1984.
</P>
<P>
During the local elections in January this year, Yogeswaran
said Tamil rebels were responsible for the killing of her husband
who represented Jaffna city in the country's parliament from 1977
to 1983 and was assassinated in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna city in northern Sri Lanka was recaptured by government
troops from the Tamil rebels in December, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate state in the
north and east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government said in 1996 that more than 50,000 people had
been killed in the 14-year-old ethnic war. Since then several
thousand more rebels and government soldiers have been killed or
wounded in fierce fighting in the north and east.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Continues Lead in Philippine Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada maintained a overwhelming lead over his nine rivals in the
presidential race Sunday with 37 percent of the total votes.
</P>
<P>
According to the partial and unofficial results released here,
Estrada, presidential candidate of Laban ng Makabayang Masang
Pilipino (Lammp) (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses), has got
6,839,180 of the 18,447,042 votes counted so far, and his main
rival, Speaker Jose de Venecia, won 2,845,077 votes, or 15 percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia is the standard bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats).
</P>
<P>
The unofficial results were provided by the National Citizens'
Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel), the sole non-government
organization accredited by the Commission on Elections to conduct
quick count operations.
</P>
<P>
As of 11:58 (GMT 03:58) Sunday, Namfrel has counted 67.65
percent of the total votes.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia was followed by Senator Raul Roco, candidate of
Aksyon Demokratiko (Democratic Action), with 2,556,327 votes.
</P>
<P>
After former first lady Imelda Marcos withdrew from the contest
two days before the May 11 elections, 10 candidates are running in
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
But former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, former Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, and businessman Manuel
Morato conceded defeat earlier to Vice President Estrada as the
former movie actor posted a virtually insurmountable lead over
other candidates in the race.
</P>
<P>
In the vice presidential race, Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo
of Lakas-NUCD continued her lead with 8,169,333 votes, heading for
a virtual victory.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's running mate Edgardo Angara was in the second place
with 3,568,887 votes.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Elections' canvassing for senators just
started Friday morning, while the congress' canvassing for the
president and the vice president is not expected to begin until
the end of next week as official counting is still going on at the
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
The final official results for the president and vice president
may take at least another two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Preparing for 1999 Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Malawi is gearing up for its second
free legislative and presidential elections scheduled for May
1999, amid calls to reform the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
The country's Electoral Commission, which is mandated to set
the date for legislative and presidential elections, has worked
hard to have reforms to the electoral law passed by parliament,
according to Zambia Daily Mail published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials say that the legislators will legalize
fraudulent elections if parliament does not pass the
parliamentary and presidential elections amendment bill and the
electoral commission bill.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court judge Anastasia Msosa, who chairs the Electoral
Commission, says the legal reforms will empower the institution
to guarantee a free vote during parliamentary, presidential and
local government elections.
</P>
<P>
Proposed reforms provide for an independent secretariat for
the commission, with a permanent chief elections officer
appointed by the president on recommendation of the public
appointments committee.
</P>
<P>
The officer would take over responsibility from the clerk of
parliament, who doubles for the elections office on a part-time
basis.
</P>
<P>
The amended act will also mandate the courts to impose a
punitive 50,000 Malawian Kwacha (2,000 U.S. Dollars) penalty for
those who "receive, keep or use" another person's voter
certificate. The fine will run concurrently with a mandatory
seven-year goal term.
</P>
<P>
The reforms also propose the use of a single ballot paper and
the setting up of polling stations in military and police bases
-- to enable the security personnel and their families to vote
two days prior to the polling day so that they can effectively
man stations on voting days.
</P>
<P>
While voting in the past was marred by numerous incidents of
vote buying, intimidation, mass defections of party members and
the alleged kidnaping of candidates, the 1999 elections promise
to be even more controversial, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Political parties have already started flouting the existing
electoral law and the electoral committee admits it currently
lacks the mechanism to deal with the issues.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian government, which has completely shut out the
opposition voice on national airwaves, is using the radio as a
way to kick-start its campaign.
</P>
<P>
Party functionaries from President Bakili Muluzi's ruling
United Democratic Front, use public functions where Muluzi
usually addresses the public and which are given full coverage on
national radio, to air heavy criticism of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
An outspoken member of opposition Malawi Congress Party thinks
the Electoral Commission in its present form is irrelevant and
partisan and the members should immediately be replaced by more
credible personalities.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission declares these accusations unfair and
unfounded in the absence of enabling legal machinery.
</P>
<P>
It says it is taking time to slowly, but thoroughly, sort out
the electoral mess "to strengthen Malawi's fragile democracy"
before the 1999 general elections.

<HEADLINE> Album Tells of Japanese Troops' Atrocities against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A photo collection of nearly 1,000
photos depicting atrocities committed by Japanese troops against
China during the second world war has been discovered in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Compiled by the Japanese naval troops in 1940, the photo book
entitled "Album in Commemoration of Incidents in China" depicted
major battles launched by the Japanese ground and air forces and
marine troops in China during 1937-1939.
</P>
<P>
The photos show scenes of reconnaissance by Japanese intruding
forces, houses gutted by fire, bombed bridges, sunken warships,
slain Chinese soldiers and innocent civilians, and battle sketches
of bombed sites and major battle fields.
</P>
<P>
The album was found coincidentally at the time when a Japanese
movie -- "Pride, an Instant in a Lifetime" which whitewashes
Japanese aggressor troops and sings the praises of Hideki Tojo,
the top Japanese war criminal during the World War II -- is being
shown in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The album had been edited mainly for the Japanese army to show
off its military actions in China, but only to leave behind the
irrefutable evidence of its towering crimes, said Xing Anchen, a
professor with Liaoning University.
</P>
<P>
The professor noted that Japan has tightly covered up its
history of aggression against China over the past five decades, so
it was really rare that such an album is available in China today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the album could be confidential materials with an
extremely small number of printing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hongyu, vice-chairman of the Liaoning Provincial
Association for Promotion of Sino-Japan Industrial Economy,
obtained the album from the son of a former Japanese naval
lieutenant general while working in Japan, and he then brought it
back to China.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Health of Foreign-Invested Businesses  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China will take to heart the
conduct of foreign-invested businesses and create a still better
investment climate so as to draw more overseas capital, said Shi
Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation
(MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
China will make full use of the existing laws and policies
concerning the use of capital from overseas to promote the healthy
growth of existing foreign-funded businesses, Shi said during a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
He said this would set an effective example for potential
investment.
</P>
<P>
China will provide credit to ventures in accordance with the
credit principle, and is ready to help in time of need, he said.
</P>
<P>
While joint ventures are increasing capital or expanding stock,
the Chinese side often finds their proportion of stocks
decreased. China will help Chinese investors make effective use of
the capital market for financing in various ways. They may
restructure state-owned capital, issue shares and securities or
establish an investment fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, still greater efforts will be made to further
improve the investment environment, both the hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China will enhance infrastructure construction such
as energy, transportation, communications and other civil works
and, however, the software is more important, he noted.
</P>
<P>
First, all sorts of illegal examinations, charges,
apportionments, or fines should be resolutely stopped, he
said. The current charges should be put in order and, on the basis
of that, the charging units should report their work to

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti National Assembly
Saturday night rejected a government-proposed bill to search for
fire-arms in citizens' houses on grounds that it violates the
sanctity of the home and the Islamic Sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 36 members who were present to vote, 27 were
against, five for and four abstained, according to local
newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The law was in effect for a two-year period from 1992 after
the Gulf War and the government has been trying to reactivate it
since its temporary life expired.
</P>
<P>
It allows Interior Ministry security forces to inspect any
residential area and search houses in its vicinity to look for
illegal arms, with the permission from local public prosecutor to
begin random inspections.
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of fire-arms were left over in the residents'
hands after the Gulf War and many have not been handed over to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members insisted that the bill violates the
Constitution and they doubted the credibility of police officers
conducting such searches.

<P>
A second round and final round of voting on the draft law will
take place next week.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Investment from Multinational Companies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes investment from
multinational companies and will take bold steps to guide their
investment, said Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
China will continue to implement a policy of "market for
technology" and further open the domestic market, Shi said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
By working in cooperation with multinational firms, he said,
China may introduce their advanced technologies, capital,
managerial experience and ways of marketing that are appropriate
for itself, and may enter their international network of
production, sales and service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will increase cooperation between the large
state-run enterprises and multinational companies, and promote the
newly-emerging industries and backbone industries, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages businesses to set up
research-and-development centers with multinational companies,
which will help digest absorbed technologies and create new ones,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China will further promote synchronized cooperation
between domestic businesses and multinational companies, and bring
along the growth of relevant businesses and industries.
</P>
<P>
China will also help large state-owned enterprises become
stronger and more competitive, he added.
</P>
<P>
Unified planning should be the first step for this kind of
cooperation, and appropriate measures should be taken, the trade
minister said. The cooperation should seek profits and refrain
from harms, and the state-owned economy should maintain its
dominant role in major industries and key areas.

China will choose to protect some domestic infant industries

Another way of introducing capital from overseas is through the

Some large-and medium-sized state-run enterprises will be
selected, according to the national policies for industry and
utilization of foreign capital, to go public in the international
securities market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China will continue the experiment on a trial basis
of letting foreign-shared businesses go public abroad, and improve
the issue and exchange of stocks.

China will also seek the circulating means such as convertible

<HEADLINE>   DPRK: No UN Security Council Permanent Seat for Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- An editorial by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea's(DPRK) newspaper Rodong Sinmun on
Saturday opposed Japan's request for a permanent seat in the UN
Security Council saying it is an "overweening" act.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government recently sent to UN representatives of
a number countries a resolution passed by its Diet (parliament),
asking them to back its bid to become a permanent member of the UN
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that Japan, as its donation to the UN comes
only next to that of the United States, should hold a permanent
seat in the council.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the UN seat should not be traded for money,
the editorial said that those to become permanent members should
receive due international support and trust.
</P>
<P>
As it has refused to expose and criticize the crimes it
committed in the past and repeatedly attempted to shirk its
responsibility, Japan has lost the trust of the Asian people and
people throughout the world, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
To let such a Japan become a permanent member of the council
will be a challenge to justice and humiliation to the world
organization, it said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been widely viewed as a potential threat to world
peace, to allow it to become a permanent member of the council
will also give it more freedom to launch wars of aggression
abroad, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
If Japan wants to rebuild its image in the world, its
overwhelming task is to expose and criticize its past crimes, the
editorial noted.

<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China is set to adopt measures to
further optimize the structure of foreign-invested industry and to
attract overseas businesses to make investments in its central and
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC), made the remarks in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The State Council readjusted the tax policy on imported
equipment in December of 1997 and amended a guild list on
foreign-invested industry issued in 1995, he said. It is necessary
to carry out the newly approved guild list on foreign-invested
industry by the State Council in a comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will readjust the guild list when necessary
according to its economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to carry out the notice on tax policy
readjustment on imported equipment issued by the State Council,
and to exempt from Customs duty and import value-added tax on
equipment and technologies used in foreign-invested projects that
China encourages and supports, he said.
</P>

export-oriented enterprises and carries out guaranteed account
system concerning the processing trade imports of raw materials
and parts and components.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, it is necessary to perfect the refund tax
system according to international practice and principle of

</P>
<P>
With regard to the establishment conditions and market openness
concerning restricted projects or projects in which the ratio of
foreign shares are limited, it is necessary to ease restrictions
to some extent.
</P>
<P>
-- The state will arrange a host of projects in agriculture,
irrigation, transportation, energy, raw materials and
environmental protection in central and western areas for foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state will give more support to project set
capital and relevant measures and support enterprises switched
from military to civilian purposes and large state-run enterprises
to use foreign funds for technological renovation.
</P>
<P>
-- It is necessary to encourage foreign-invested companies in
eastern areas to re-invest in central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
The project with foreign investment exceeding 25 percent of the
total can be treated as foreign-invested firms and receive due
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
-- Trial openness areas and projects allowed by the state
should proceed simultaneously in eastern, central and western
areas in principle.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the state, provincial capitals can engage
in openness trials in the areas of domestic businesses, foreign
trade and tour agencies.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Port in Severe Congestion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Severe congestion at Bangladesh's
biggest port, Chittagong, is forcing foreign cargo vessels to
overstay, causing those to incur huge demurrage, The Daily Star
reported Sunday quoting port officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Container ships and foodgrain-carrying vessels are the worst
sufferers, the officials said, adding that "five
foodgrain-carrying ships are now at the port jetties awaiting
unloading while three others are at the outer anchorage."
</P>
<P>
The congestion was caused by space problem at the port sheds to
accommodate containers and slow unloading of foodgrains by
laborers as the laborers were on a go-slow program following a
tussle with stevedores.
</P>
<P>
The ships are now required to overstay for 15 to 20 days
instead of five to six day in the past.
</P>
<P>
Eight container ships were waiting at the outer anchorage for
one week seeking berthing space at the port jetties while five
others were overstaying there.
</P>
<P>
The containers are unloaded very slowly due to space problem,
and over 13,000 containers are now dumped at the port sheds which
have a capacity to accommodate about 10,000 containers, port
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the importers are also slow in taking delivery of
container cargo, causing space problem, they added.
</P>
<P>
The port authorities are contemplating increasing charges to
force importers to take quick delivery of goods from port sheds.

manage foreign loans and strictly censor and clean up the
department which makes foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
The preferential loans from international financial
institutions and foreign governments should be borrowed by
authorized sectors and re-loaned by designated organizations, Shi
said.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to formulate regular measures to re-loan
as quickly as possible, which will clearly define both rights and
responsibilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The financial organizations which have the right to raise
business funds from overseas can do their job according to the
debt index, he said, and that large enterprises which are
qualified can borrow overseas directly with the approval of the
state.
</P>
<P>
He added that foreign-invested enterprises can borrow upon
their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to strictly ban illegal fund-raising and
floating loans under various pretexts overseas, Minister Shi said,
and that it is necessary to clear up hidden debt and invisible
foreign debt, and to severely penalize those violating regulations.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Make Good Use of Foreign Loans: Trade Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shi urged that great efforts should be made to improve the
efficiency of the use of foreign loans. Mid- and long-term foreign
loans should be used in infrastructure and development-oriented
projects, he noted, and preferential loans from international
financial institutions and foreign governments should be centered
on agriculture, irrigation, transportation, energy, environmental
protection and urban infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that it is imperative to raise the ratio of
those loans to the central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mid- and long-term loans to foreign businesses
should focus on basic, pillar and high-tech industries as well as
export-oriented projects in terms of introducing necessary
technologies, equipment and row materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that short-term foreign business loans must not be
used on long-term projects and fixed assets and other unsuitable
areas.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is necessary to improve the
management of foreign loans, make pre-preparation for projects,
better evaluate projects, optimize loan use, attach importance to
efficiency and repayment ability, fulfill domestic set conditions,
and carry out project legal person and capital fund systems.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to set up a mechanism for borrowing, use and
repayment which is unified by responsibilities, rights and
interests, he noted, adding that all departments and enterprises
should improve the awareness of repayments and fulfill repayment
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
All sectors which bear repayment responsibilities should ensure
the repayment at maturity, he said, and that it is necessary to
speed up the formation of a mechanism for repayment and assurance
according to laws and market-economy principles.
</P>
<P>
The financial sectors which borrow foreign funds should have
adequate foreign reserves and ensure the fulfilment of loan
contracts so as to maintain China's reputation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the departments concerned should bear due foreign
debt assurance or repayment responsibilities for preferential
loans from international financial organizations and foreign
governments used in public interest projects, Shi said, and that
local governments should establish a repayment fund according to
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments should also take effective measures to
deal with debt delay and liability, the trade minister said.

<HEADLINE> Outlook for Second WTO Ministerial Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
will hold its second ministerial conference here on May 18-20 and
also celebrate the 50th anniversary of the operation of the
multilateral trading system on May 19.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have been made by the organization since its
first ministerial conference in Singapore in December 1996 after
it succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on
January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero described 1997 as a golden
year, a year of harvest. He said that the agreements on basic
telecommunications, information technology and financial services
reached in 1997 have laid a sound foundation for further
development of world trade in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling its tasks, WTO's major organ, the Dispute Settlement
Body (DSB), has handled more than 100 dispute cases, including the
Kodak-Fuji film dispute between the United States and Japan and
the Shrimp-Turtle dispute brought by India, Malaysia, Pakistan and
Thailand against the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the two cases, the United States has been considered by the
concerned members defeated though it has pledged to appeal and the
final verdicts are still pending. By these examples, WTO officials
want to tell the world that every member, strong or weak, big or
small, is equal in the dispute settlement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
However, one major challenge that the DSB has faced was the
case brought by the European Union (EU) in 1996 against the United
States. The EU insisted that the Cuban Liberty and Democratic
Solidarity Act of the United States, known as the Helms-Burton
act, was inconsistent with the U.S. obligations under the WTO
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both major DSB proponents, the EU and the United States know
clearly that a settlement by the panel will be in no one's
interest. As concessions, the United States has postponed the
enforcement of the Helms-Burton act again and again. The EU, in
return, requested that the panel established on November 20, 1996
suspend its work.
</P>
<P>
Also since the Singapore conference, Congo, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Mongolia, Niger and Panama have become new
WTO members, raising the total to 132.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one countries and regions including China and Russia
have been negotiating their accession to WTO.
</P>
<P>
The coming conference is expected to discuss the implementation
of the existing agreements, built-in agenda, future activities,
and the date and the place of the third ministerial conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and early 1998, the WTO secretariat reviewed EU and
Japan's trade policies and said their tariffs were not at a
satisfactorily low level and there were even "tariff peaks" in
sectors like agriculture.
</P>
<P>
There is no rule for WTO to expel any of its members for their
insufficient implementation of WTO agreements. So, some of them
demand much more from the membership applicants than from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO agenda, members are to negotiate agriculture and
services by the end of 1999 and early 2000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Many members from the developing countries believe that they
are encountering difficulties at home in implementing the existing
agreements and that it is unnecessary to have new negotiations
other than those on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
But members from the industrialized world want to see the
negotiations expanded to other areas. Some members led by the
United States wish to have an agreement on the electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Most members have supported the WTO secretariat proposal for
holding the next ministerial conference in 1999, one year earlier
than scheduled, with the date and place to be decided yet.
</P>
<P>
No major breakthrough are expected at the coming ministerial
conference in Geneva, one seen just as playing a transitional role
to lay bricks for the new rounds of negotiations at the 1999
conference.

transportation and agent services.
</P>
<P>

telecommunications and set up an efficient supervision system,

investment into central and western areas of China, he noted.

fund or tech-intensive industries and export-oriented industries
in the eastern parts of China, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Improving Sentiment Lifts Chinese Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Both Shanghai and Shenzhen markets
registered moderate gains last week as market sentiment improved.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai index finished at 1368.087, 10.492 points up from
the previous week's close. The Shenzhen index gained 25.12 points
to end at 4205.43.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai stock market suffered minor falls on Monday and
Tuesday, but rebounded strongly on Wednesday, pushing the index to
1369.26, the highest in recent months.
</P>
<P>
However, it turned out to be a brief recovery as the market
resumed a downward trend on Thursday, falling 2.135 points. It
gained a minor 0.96 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Weekly turnover was 46.87 billion yuan (5.65 billion US
dollars), up 12.9 percent from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said companies with asset restructuring plans will
continue to be the leading market stars.
</P>
<P>
Last week, six listed companies, including five textile firms,
were approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to
suspend trading for one month for asset restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Investors and brokers hailed the move, regarding it a major
step towards stabilizing the market. In the past, speculation has
sent the prices of listed companies with asset restructuring
extremely high.
</P>
<P>
The hard currency B-share market experienced slack trading and
continuous falls in the first four days of the week, but rebounded
strongly on Friday since most investors expect the government to
take new measures to enliven B-share trading.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index finished at 50.616, 1.12 points up from the
previous week's close.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shenzhen market reported a weekly turnover of
45.363 billion yuan (5.5 billion US dollars), virtually the same
amount as in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The B-share market also rose on expectations of new policies to
boost the hard currency market, with the B-share index finishing
at 720.89, 78.19 points higher than the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Trade Minister on China's Opening-up, Use of Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its opening-up
efforts and further improve the use of foreign capital for its
economic development, said Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
The use of overseas funds -- in the form of direct investment,
foreign loans or capital raised through stock markets -- has
steadily increased in the past two decades, Shi said, adding that
the move played a role in the speedy, sustained and healthy growth
of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said China has accumulated experience in the field and that
some problems still exist. "The Chinese government attaches
importance to these problems and will find solutions to them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shi said China will utilize overseas capital in active and
rational ways to meet the increasing demand of China's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"We will make efforts to keep the current overseas investment
scale to ensure that China stays atop developing countries in
terms of direct investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal, according to Shi, China will further optimize
the industrial structure for foreign investment, make more fields
accessible to overseas investors, improve the geological location
of foreign capital, attract capital through multiple channels,
introduce and direct investment from multinational corporations,
properly manage the existing ventures with overseas capital,
further improve the investment environment and raise capital from
overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Shi cited direct investment still as the focus of China's
efforts. To optimize overall investment structure, China will
continue adopting tariff-free and value-added-tax-free treatments
for the technologies or projects in the categories encouraged or
supported by the state for overseas investors, he said. "China is
to formulate more incentive policies for overseas investors into
its central and western regions."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shi noted, China will appropriately borrow and make
better use of foreign loans. It will thus far strictly control its
foreign debt, improve the management of overseas borrowing,
improve the efficiency of using foreign loans, and set up a
borrow-use-return mechanism for users.
</P>
<P>
To further improve the work, Shi urged a strengthening of the
leadership in the field and enhancing the relevant legal
construction. "We hope to use about three years's time to build up
a comprehensive legal system on the use of overseas investment,"
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, China will step up its pace in promulgating
anti-trust laws, and revising the current law against unfair
competitions, and do a still better job in protecting intellectual
property rights better still, and training a contingent of
qualified staff members.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Continue Improving Investment Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China must step up efforts to
improve its investment climate to prevent a decline in foreign
capital inflow, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A senior researcher is quoted as saying that the nation's
picture of foreign investment will be gloomy if no action is
taken, according to Ma Yu, director of the department of foreign
capital with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and
Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital into China has witnessed an extraordinary surge
over the past two decades, with rapid market expansion and high
returns making up for various restrictions on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign investors have begun to worry about various
elements detrimental to their interests as economic growth
decelerates and investment returns taper off.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuation of macro-control policies, such as the
resumption of tariff on imported capital goods of foreign
investors, has made it hard for foreign investors to calculate
their investment costs and returns.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the present foreign investment administration
system also limits the effectiveness of foreign investment. For
example, when investment in an individual project exceeds US 30
million US dollars, investors have to submit their feasibility
studies and contracts to central governmental bodies for
examination and approval. The approval procedures usually last
several months, which may put the investors at a serious
disadvantage in view of the rapid changes occurring in the market.
</P>
<P>
Ma suggested government agencies only examine and approve
projects in the sectors where foreign investment should be
restricted.
</P>
<P>
This proposal is in line with the country's economic reforms,
which aim to allow market forces to play the leading role in
microeconomic sectors, the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
Ma also said the problem of random fees charged by local
governments might be alleviated by the ongoing governmental
restructuring, though the final solution still lies with less
government interference and a sound legal system.
</P>
<P>
The attraction of China's huge market may lose its appeal as
the market becomes more and more open with the lowering of tariff
and non-tariff barriers, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
China has been the world's second largest recipient of foreign
capital for five years running. However, the rapid momentum of
foreign capital inflow slowed down last year, when actual foreign
investment rose only 8.5 percent over 1996 and contracted amount
plunged 29.3 percent from the figure for the previous year.

<HEADLINE> ICAO to Fully Launch New Air Navigation System by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) has decided that a new air traffic
guiding system would be put into complete use as from 2010.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at ICAO's five-day World Conference,
which ended here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The milestone system -- Communication, Navigation, and
Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) would allow the
control of air navigation via satellite in transoceanic
transportation and in remote areas instead of depending on the
radar signals sent from ground stations presently.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the new system would also permit information to be
sent directly by satellites to computers aboard.
</P>
<P>
ICAO Council President Assad Kotiate said the new system would
make it possible for aircraft to fly in a more straight direction
at the best altitude, which means fuel economy and less air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by 700 representatives from 123
countries and 27 international organizations, also discussed
issues related to air traffic new technologies.

<HEADLINE> Ministry to Tighten Control on Port Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The layout of ports in China has
been basically rational. Port construction should be shifted
towards technical renovation, increase in handling capacity and
enhancement of viability, rather than launching new projects.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, minister of communications, was quoted by
today's China Daily" as saying that the establishment of special
berths by cargo owners must be subject to overall State planning.
</P>
<P>
Massive port construction along China's coastline and major
rivers is creating duplication and waste of resources, despite
warnings to investors from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, uncontrolled port construction has led to
cut-throat competition among the operators and local governments,
who are vying to under-cut each other to grab cargo sources.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province, for instance, had thought to position
Shenzhen as its container shipping center, but Guangzhou,
Zhanjiang, and Zhuhai have all pushed for similar projects.
</P>
<P>
China has 485 deep-water coastal docks with handling capacity
surpassing 780 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications, having survived the government
restructuring, plans to strengthen macro-management of port
building by identifying the functions of existing ports and
tightening control on approval of berth projects.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the move will cut across the vested interests
of ministries, local governments and large State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, in the long run, this will benefit the long-term
sustained development of the ports and better serve economic
growth, Minister Huang said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Preparations for Clinton's Visit in Full Swing (2) by Peng Shujie, Liu Yunfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. dignitaries and ranking officials were accorded courteous
reception during their trips in Beijing, and the two sides have
exchanged views on issues related to Clinton's coming visit.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted that the U.S. is seeking to build "a more
constructive relationship with China through strategic dialogue"
despite differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The opening of a hot line has made it possible for leaders of
the White House and Zhongnanhai to contact each other "rapidly,
directly and candidly" whenever they feel it is necessary, said
Albright after she signed the agreement with Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs
Stanley Roth also said in Washington early this week that Clinton's
China trip is intended to increase strategic dialogue between the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Together with their meeting while attending the fifth informal
leadership meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
in Vancouver, Canada, in November last year, the two presidents
will have met each other three times within eight months. Also,
they have exchanged two letters during this period of time.
</P>
<P>
This itself is a good demonstration of the fact that a sound
China-U.S. relationship and a strategic partnership are in the
fundamental interests of the two countries, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they believe that the two sides are likely to reach
more common understanding with existing mutually beneficial
cooperation bolstered through Clinton's upcoming visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
pay a state visit to China in late June, about five months ahead
of the original schedule. Chinese and U.S. officials are busy
preparing for this one-stop special visit to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's China visit is in return for President
Jiang Zemin's U.S. trip in October and the first one by a
U.S. president in the past nine years. Clinton's visit is expected
to advance the bilateral relationship and add new vitality to a
constructive strategic partnership geared toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
A series of top U.S. officials have visited China in the past
five months to pave the way for the state visit, and to complete
the agreements made between Jiang and Clinton in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The list of recent visitors includes: Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, Acting Under
Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security
Affairs John Holm, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs
Thomas Pickering and Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
Director of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army Wang Ke and Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang
Deguang have also visited the United States.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these visits, an agreement to establish a
consultation mechanism to strengthen maritime military safety was
signed on January 19. Another one on setting up direct and secure
telephone links was signed on April 30. The U.S. government also
declared on March 19 that the United States will start nuclear
cooperation with China for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation between China and the United States has not
only provided continuous input for the bilateral relationship, but
it is also a harmonious prelude to Clinton's upcoming visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The negotiations between Microsoft
Corp., the world's most powerful software maker, and government
lawyers aimed at averting antitrust lawsuits broke up Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sources reaching here indicated that the Justice Department and
at least 20 states would be back to collision with Microsoft,
which is very eager to put its new operating system Windows 98 to
computer makers and retailers in time.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said talks, which broke up at midday,
were not expected to resume. The government and the states were
expected to file two separate but similar federal antitrust
lawsuits Monday morning in U.S. District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Federal lawyers and state attorneys general contend that
Microsoft illegally used its market power to assert pressure on
its competitors, by binding its Internet browser in its operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft accused the government of making "unreasonable
demands" and agreed negotiations were at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
An official with one of the state attorneys general said only
that talks broke down because Microsoft made no "substantial
offers" to keep them moving forward.
</P>
<P>
The company originally planned to ship to computer makers the
latest upgrade to its flagship software Windows 98 Friday. But
when the government and the 20 states threatened to file antitrust
lawsuits against it Thursday, it offered to delay its shipment in
order to have more talks with the government which resumed Friday.

dramatic increase in transnational crime, including drug
trafficking, smuggling of human beings, money laundering and the
abuse of the new technologies.

"Such crimes pose not only a threat to our own citizens and
their communities, but also a global one which can undermine the
economic basis of societies through the investment of illegal
money," the statement said.

The leaders from the United States, Germany, France, Italy,
Canada, Japan, Britain and Russia stressed that international
cooperation is indispensable in fighting such transnational
crimes.

crime."

<HEADLINE> G-8 Reaffirms Initiative on Debt Relief for HIPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- All G-8 leaders reaffirmed here
Saturday that they are all committed to helping heavily indebted
poor countries free themselves from the burden of their
unsustainable debts.
</P>
<P>
It has been two years when the G-7 leaders initiated in Lyon
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) designed to ensure a
sustainable exit from their debt burden for all the most affected
countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, official creditors have forgiven in
favor of the poorest countries 8 billion U.S. dollars with more
than 5 billion U.S. dollars of that relief going to Africa.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the G-8 heads of state and government, British
Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short said,
"We will work with the others concerned to ensure that all
eligible countries get the relief they need to secure a lasting
exit from their debt problems."
</P>
<P>
So far six countries have qualified for debt relief from the
HIPC initiative totaling around 5.7 billion U.S. dollars. Among
those six countries, Uganda has been the first to complete the
process, recently receiving additional debt relief of nearly 650
million U.S. dollars, according to Short.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these countries, Short said, "Two more countries
have already benefited from preliminary positive indications
regarding their possible eligibility under the HIPC initiative."
</P>
<P>
In his conclusion, Short said the G-8 leaders' ambition "is to
ensure the speedy and determined implementation of the initiative
and encourage all eligible countries to take the policy measures
needed to embark on the process as soon as possible, so that all
can be in the process by the year 2000."

<HEADLINE> G-8 Summit Issues Statement on Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Eight (G-8) leaders
Saturday issued a special statement on Northern Ireland, calling
on all parties concerned in the Northern Ireland peace process to
work for a justified solution.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 leaders, who are attending their annual summit in
Birmingham, said in the statement that they "warmly welcome" the
Belfast Agreement on the future of Northern Ireland reached on
April 10.
</P>
<P>
"We commend all those involved in achieving an outcome which
reflects the fundamental aspirations of both parts of the
community in Northern Ireland," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the agreement presents challenges to
all parties, the G-8 leaders voiced their hope that it will
achieve "the widest possible support" not only as a basis for
political stability and peace, but also as an opportunity for
economic development and prosperity for all Northern Ireland
people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the people in Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland are due to hold a referendum on whether to
endorse the Belfast Agreement later this month.
