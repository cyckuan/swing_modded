U.S. Won't Sell Destroyers to Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, backed by his senior advisers, decided
Monday against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but approved a
smaller package including long-range radar designed to detect missile launches,
two senior U.S. officials said. Clinton acted on the recommendation of top
advisers who met earlier in the day at the White House. The Pentagon had
recommended that the administration put off Taiwan's request to buy new weapons,
including the destroyers, submarines and anti-submarine aircraft, in order to
avoid angering China, which views Taiwan as a rebellious province.

High Court Expands Passengers' Rights
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers must
get travelers' consent or a court warrant before squeezing their luggage to see
if drugs might be inside. The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border
Patrol agent who felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment ban on unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to contain
drugs. The ruling expands public transit passengers' privacy rights, but the
National Association of Police Organizations said it was disappointed by the
ruling.

IMF Protesters Disrupt Capital
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demonstrators disrupted the workday in much of the
nation's capital Monday, but they failed to shut down the two days of meetings
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About 600 people were
arrested Monday, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the protests began.
The protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor
nations, destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of other ills. World
Bank spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the meetings felt
''bewilderment and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She said the
officials were talking about ways to relieve poverty.

Cuban Americans Await Elian's Fate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- On the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Cuban
Americans in Miami stood watch at the home where Elian Gonzalez's relatives
waited for a key ruling in the custody fight. Protesters recalled the deadly
attempt on April 17, 1961, in which CIA-trained exiles failed to invade Cuba.
Their criticism was extended to the Clinton administration, which wants the
6-year-old Cuban boy returned to his Cuban father. The boy's Miami relatives say
he will have a better life here. Both sides were awaiting a ruling from the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The government wants the court to lift
an order that bars Elian's removal from the United States and to order Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to release the boy.

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- On the 25th anniversary of the Khmer Rouge
takeover of Cambodia, Prime Minister Hun Sen said Monday an agreement may
finally be at hand to set up a court to prosecute the movement's former leaders
whose reign of terror killed 1.7 million people. Hun Sen said he backed a
U.S.-suggested compromise that appears to resolve the sensitive issue of how to
conduct indictments. The United Nations and Cambodia have been negotiating the
formation of a tribunal for more than a year, but talks have foundered over
which side would control indictments and rulings.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- AltaVista Co., the owner of a widely used Internet
search engine and several other popular Web sites, has postponed plans to raise
$281 million in an initial public offering of its stock. The decision,
attributed to ''market conditions,'' came following last week's tech stock
selloff, which was especially hard on Internet companies. For instance, Yahoo
Inc, which runs the world's most popular Internet search engine, dropped 23
percent last week amid a massive selloff on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Klein This Time Shows True 'Colors'  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- His rude transformation from ''Anonymous'' to
Joe Klein helped the author of ''Primary Colors'' write his next
political novel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The roots of 'The Running Mate' are partly from my own 10 or
15 minutes on the griddle,'' said Klein, whose latest book centers
on a nasty Senate campaign. ''I didn't know how to deal with the
pressure and I regret that I didn't handle it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The new novel comes out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Klein used the pen name ''Anonymous'' when he wrote ''Primary
Colors,'' a scandalous roman a clef about the 1992 presidential
campaign. The central character, a womanizing Southern governor
named Jack Stanton, was widely believed to be based on Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Published in 1996, ''Primary Colors'' sold more than a million
copies as readers wondered who could have written such a racy,
detailed book. With everyone from ''Doonesbury'' creator Garry
Trudeau to White House aide George Stephanopoulos suspected,
President Clinton called the book's authorship ''the only secret
I've seen kept in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, then a columnist for Newsweek, initially ridiculed
allegations he had written the novel but later confessed after a
Washington Post reporter found a manuscript with his handwriting.
Klein took a leave of absence from Newsweek and resigned his
consultant position with CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1996 he joined The New Yorker, where he is a
political correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Running Mate,'' which has a first printing of about
150,000, appears a far less sexy affair. There is no mystery about
the author. The model for the main character isn't Clinton but a
sympathetic composite of several senators who have served in
Vietnam, including Nebraska's Bob Kerrey, Massachusetts' John Kerry
and recent presidential candidate John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The main character, Sen. Charlie Martin, also appeared in
''Primary Colors.'' He's a Democrat and Vietnam War veteran who
briefly opposes Stanton in the presidential primaries and then
endures a vicious campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the Republican convention in 1996 I had a conversation
with John McCain,'' Klein said. ''He was saying that being part of
the Keating Five (savings and loan) scandal was harder than being a
prisoner of war. I wanted to write about how a Vietnam veteran
deals with the atmosphere of scandal in the 1990s.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees 5, Rangers 4, 11 innings  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Tino Martinez tied the game with an RBI
single in the ninth and won it with a run-scoring hit in the 11th
and the New York Yankees held on for a wild 5-4 win over the Texas
Rangers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who were held hitless into the seventh inning, blew
a lead in the 10th and nearly did again in the 11th before getting
a favorable call from home plate umpire Jeff Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and no outs, Luis Alicea appeared to foul
a ball off his foot. The ball rolled in front of the plate and
Kellogg ruled it a fair ball. Catcher Jorge Posada picked it up,
stepped on home and tagged Alicea for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos then got Scott Sheldon to ground out to end the game and
earn his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who swept a two-game series against the Rangers
last week, have won 34 of the last 45 games against the Rangers
since the opening game of their 1996 playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also swept the Rangers out of the AL playoffs the
last two seasons, allowing only two runs in the six games.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's single to right field with one out in the 11th scored
Derek Jeter, who led off the inning with a single off Tim Crabtree
(0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had tied the game in the ninth off John Wetteland, who
blew his second straight save after converting 18 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Posada led off the 10th inning for the Yankees with a solo home
run off Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Texas got the run back in the bottom half against Mariano Rivera
(1-0). Royce Clayton led off with a single, moved to second on a
sacrifice bunt and scored on a single by Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Darren Oliver pitched 6 1-3 no-hit innings
before Paul O'Neill's bloop single to left with one out in the
seventh. Bernie Williams followed with his third homer to tie the
game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver struck out six and walked one in eight innings, but ended
with his third straight no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro's two-out homer off Mike Stanton broke a 2-2 tie
in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter David Cone got his second straight no decision
against the Rangers, leaving after allowing two runs and five hits
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got three of the hits off Cone in the third inning
when they scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Evans, 3-for-19 in his previous seven games, had a one-out
double and scored on a double by former Yankee Chad Curtis. With
the bases loaded, David Segui had an infield hit on a bouncer up
the middle that shortstop Jeter stabbed to prevent any more runs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Williams home run was his 17th against the Rangers, the
most he has against any team. He also has 17 career homers against
Minnesota. ... There has not been a no-hitter thrown against the
Yankees since Baltimore knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm on Sept. 20,
1958, a span of 6,501 games. ... The Rangers wore their ''primary''
home white uniforms with red trim for only the third time. They had
already worn their new blue ''alternate'' jersey for five home
games and four of six road games.

<HEADLINE> Grenada Bank Raises Eyebrows  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) -- It sounds like an investor's dream:
profits of 250 percent, tax-free, from a discreet and distant
offshore bank. And First International Bank of Grenada -- a magnet
for hundreds of Americans willing to part with millions of dollars
-- is extraordinary in other ways too.
</P>
<P>
   Grenadian officials say the bank was capitalized in this former
British Caribbean colony on the strength of a jeweler's $20 million
appraisal of one ruby. They confirm its founder once went broke in
Oregon, bought a Grenada passport and changed his name. And its
reported income -- hotly contested -- would rank it among banking
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders say the bank pays up, and is simply an original-minded
player in a dynamic globalizing economy. Critics suspect pyramid
schemes and money laundering, and see it as a symbol of the dangers
of poorly regulated offshore banking.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, First International Bank has drawn
considerable attention with an unorthodox effort to establish a
sphere of influence in the Congo, whose vast mineral wealth has
drawn forces from five countries into a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ''First International Bank of Grenada makes a mockery of the
island as a legitimate financial center,'' wrote Offshore Alert, a
leading Miami-based industry newsletter being sued by the bank's
owners for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Grenada's offshore industry regulator, Michael Creft, says he
doesn't know whether the bank's claims of $26 billion in gross
income in its first full year of business last year are true. That
would put it roughly on par with Chicago-based Bank One Corp., the
fifth-largest bank in the United States, with 1999 revenue of $26
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The local government is investigating charges of illicit
practices by First International Bank, which has drawn the notice
of U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an ongoing investigation being coordinated with the
FBI through the U.S. Department of Justice,'' said Nancy McGuire,
spokeswoman for Premier Keith Mitchell, who has repeatedly defended
the bank. ''They have already provided us with some information
which has caused us to request information from the bank, and the
investigation is continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Department of Justice did not respond to repeated
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Creft said the investigation included the possibility of money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, licensed in Grenada in October 1998, is owned by Van
A. Brink, who was called Gilbert Allen Ziegler when he lived in
Oregon and declared bankruptcy in 1994, according to Creft.
</P>
<P>
   Brink and the bank did not respond to repeated requests for an
interview. The bank said Brink was in Uganda -- a player in the
Congo war -- where he has bought a mansion that used to belong to
dictator Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse interview last year with Grenada's government-owned
radio, Brink said: ''I can just tell you that First (International)
Bank is doing legitimate business. It is acting lawfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank fired an external auditor last year after a
disagreement over its practices. In a letter made available to The
Associated Press, Lauriston Wilson, the auditor, wrote to the prime
minister saying he had ''suspicions that the bank's assets were
bogus and fictitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Creft said a subsequent, external audit presented by the bank
was conducted by an ''unqualified'' American, who had been ordered
not to practice in some U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
   Creft said he was going to order another audit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bank goes about its business.
</P>
<P>
   Every month, First International Bank pays for hundreds of
Americans to come to the island and woos them at upscale beach
resorts with lectures on the evils of U.S. taxation, Creft said.
Prospects are assured their money is insured by the International
Deposit Indemnity Corp. -- a small private operation that was closed
down by regulators in the tiny island of Nevis a year ago, was
again shut down in Dominica and now operates here.
</P>
<P>
   Creft said First International Bank has made good on promises to
pay up to 250 percent interest, but he didn't know how the bank
does it.
</P>
<P>
   If the bank -- one of the first offshore businesses licensed here
-- were registering now, ''there would be much more due diligence
and we would be much more careful,'' Creft said.
</P>
<P>
   Brink now appears ready to spread his influence to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Brink tried to buy a cooperative bank from the Uganda
government, which turned him down, saying he was not a qualified
banker.
</P>
<P>
   In January, First International Bank signed a deal with a group
of tribal chiefs brought over from the Congo. That agreement gives
Prince Willie Mashiki and his coterie $80 million in exchange for
control over the mineral resources in the areas they claim to
control.
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba, a Congo rebel leader who signed a deal with the
bank in November, dismissed suspicions against Brink as part of an
assault on offshore banking by developed nations trying to retain
control over capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you have a fundamental change in the world economy,
in this case a shift from classical banks to offshore banks, there
are sure to be clashes,'' said the former Harvard University
lecturer, who sold the bank exclusive rights to set up a central
bank should he take power, for $16 million.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and India entered into an
agreement Monday to create a forum to promote economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and India's Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha, who was here to attend the spring meetings of the

which calls for officials from both countries to meet periodically
to discuss, among other things, financial developments and

</P>
<P>
   ''Strengthening our economic and financial relationship through
dialogue is critical to developing a closer, deeper, multifaceted
relationship with India,'' Summers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement grew out of discussions Summers, while visiting
New Dehli in January, had with Sinha. The idea also was discussed
at a March meeting between President Clinton and India's Prime

<HEADLINE> Billionaire Buffett Gains in Market  </HEADLINE>
By MARGERY BECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been
redeemed -- at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who shuns high
technology companies because he says he cannot forecast their
future, came under criticism last year when his holding company's
stock tumbled 20 percent even as technology stocks claimed record
gains.
</P>
<P>
   But technology stocks have been losing favor: Last week, one of
Wall Street's worst ever, Buffett was one of a few billionaires who
made money on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Billionaires like Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and Amazon.com
chairman Jeffrey Bezos lost plenty last week, but Buffett gained
$570 million on his 474,998 Berkshire shares at the end of trading
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett apologized in his company's 1999 annual report for its
low returns that year, but said the company had not lost faith in
its long-term investments in such low-tech businesses as furniture,
candy, shoes, publishing and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our problem -- which we can't solve by studying up -- is that we
have no insights into which participants in the tech field possess
a truly durable competitive advantage,'' Buffett said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway stock -- which has holdings in companies
including Coca Cola, Dairy Queen, auto insurer Geico, and the
Washington Post -- dropped from a high of $78,600 in May to a low of
$40,800 in March, but has since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett made few million dollars more Monday as the market
rebounded, with both the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Nasdaq composite index registering gains of more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares rose $700, or 1 percent, to
finish at $58,700 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Paris Jr. with the Chicago-based investment broker
Barrington Research -- which, like Buffett, prefers to invest in
brick-and-mortar companies -- said that a market drop fueled by
overvalued technology stocks has been a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   Investors like Buffett have been vindicated, Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels good for a change,'' Paris said. ''For so long, the
attitude seems to have been that valuation doesn't matter. Well,
yes, it does matter.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett will no doubt reap an apology or two April 29 at the
annual Berkshire Hathaway stockholders meeting in Omaha, said
Charles Morgan, an analyst with Omaha investment firm
Kirkpatrick-Pettis.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been kind of the Rodney Dangerfield of the stock
market,'' he said. ''But I think he'll get some respect now.''

<HEADLINE> More deals reached, but lawmakers struggle to conclude budget  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislators have agreed to increase
spending on New York public schools by a record $1.2 billion to
about $13.2 billion, the highest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement came as the legislative conference
committee on education became the last of the nine committees
negotiating policy areas of the 2000-01 budget to end its
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, details of a $1.2 billion tax-cut plan over five
years were being released Monday night, but legislative leaders and
Gov. George Pataki have yet to reach a final deal on the budget.
Sources said the governor's Budget Division had raised objections
to the longer-range implications of several spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still awaiting final agreement was the release of details of
specific projects to be funded in a new, ambitious five-year
program for transportation and mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cut plan included the immediate elimination of the
gross-receipts tax on energy for manufacturers to apply
retroactively to Jan. 1. The new budget will also include a
reduction in gross receipts tax for non-manufacturing commercial
customers over five years and for a reduction in the tax charged to
residential taxpayers of $75 million immediately and $50 million
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kuhl Jr. and Assemblyman Steven Sanders, co-chairmen
of the committee on education, said the school aid spending would
be at a record level for the fourth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, funding for the pet program of the state
Assembly called ''LADDER'' was increased by $259 million. Included
in this plan is $225 million for universal pre-kindergarten
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Allocations for districts that are unable to spend the money
next school year will be kept for the district until they can be
used. That settles a dispute between the Legislature and Pataki,
who has proposed returning unspent funds to the state each year.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for LADDER programs will also include increases of $67
million for class-size reduction and $50 million for minor
maintenance and repair.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   --Increase by $370 million on unrestricted operating aid for
public school districts. Included in that would be a new, $35
million spending plan for summer school aid.
</P>
<P>
   --Spend $30 million on fighting school violence.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase school-building aid by $228 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide $67.5 million for Teacher Support Aid.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase state support for instructional materials by $33.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase by $3 million spending for the Limited English
Proficiency program.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide $11 million for bilingual education aid.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the committee did not take into consideration
capital improvement issues such as school construction projects. He
said those issues would be decided by the Legislature's top
leaders, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, and the general conference committee they head.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have been trying to reach an agreement on the state
fiscal year which begun April 1. This is the 16th straight year
budget adoption has been late in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno and Silver have been trying to wrap up negotiations so a
budget can be drafted, debated and passed by the start of the
Jewish Passover holiday, which begins at sunset Wednesday. The
legislators' schedule calls for them to break for the
Passover-Easter holiday starting Wednesday and to not return until
Monday, May 1.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with WROW-AM Monday morning, Silver said he
believed the budget could be finished by Wednesday morning and said
lawmakers would work overnight Tuesday to accomplish that if
necessary. But Bruno said working overnight would be ''a
disgrace.''

<P>
   The comments Monday from the New York Democrats came after the
New York Post reported that both McCall and Cuomo could be up for
high-level administration jobs if Vice President Al Gore wins the
White House. That, said the Post, could set up a run for governor
by Schumer and a possible primary challenge from Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has told some supporters he plans to run for governor
while Cuomo, the eldest son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
has said he is thinking about the race. McCall and the younger
Cuomo have said they won't make public announcements about their
political plans until after this November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Gore might seek to give Cuomo a
leg up on the governor's race by dangling a high-level federal post
in front of McCall. But there has also been speculation that Gore
might want Cuomo as his White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Post report indicated Gore might want both working in
Washington, leaving the field open for others.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Spitzer both began their current jobs in 1998,
unseating, respectively, Republican incumbents Alfonse D'Amato and
Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer told Albany's WROW-AM radio that he laughed when he read
the Post report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just love this job too much,'' the attorney general said.
''This is a job for a lawyer who's dedicated to holding this job
for at least an eight-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said that if McCall and Cuomo were tapped for a Gore
administration and Schumer wanted to run for governor, ''I'll be
all for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer's press secretary said the senator had no intention
of running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's happy being senator,'' Cathie Levine said. ''That's all
he's interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was preparing to run for governor in 1998 before he
changed gears more than a year before the election in the face of
Republican Gov. George Pataki's strong poll numbers and hefty
campaign bank account. Schumer decided D'Amato was more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who won easy re-election over New York City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone, has said he may want to seek a third term in
2002. Pataki beat the elder Cuomo in 1994 to become governor.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes bill requiring 'fire-safe' cigarettes  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki is not saying what he
will do with a bill sent him by the Legislature requiring that only
so-called fire-safe cigarettes be sold in New York state starting
in April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll take a look at it when we get it,'' Pataki spokesman
Michael McKeon said Monday, when the state Senate gave final
legislative approval to the bill 60-0.
</P>
<P>
   By mandating self-extinguishing cigarettes, advocates say the
state would save the lives of careless smokers, of the people
living around them and of firefighters responding to the blazes
they set.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill will help end the carnage here in New York state''
and pressure Congress into adopting similar national standards,
Joseph Bruno, majority leader of the state Senate, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Senate sponsor of the bill, Sen. Frank Padavan,
R-Queens, said the legislation is the first of its kind in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno surprised longtime advocates of self-extinguishing
cigarette legislation last week by announcing his
Republican-controlled house would approve the measure. In previous
years, the measure had passed in the Democrat-controlled Assembly
but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Dollinger, D-Rochester, said the Legislature
should have acted in the late 1980s, when federal studies indicated
a self-extinguishing cigarette was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fewer people would have died,'' Dollinger said. ''Fewer people
would have been scarred. There would have been fewer property
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Three tobacco manufacturers -- Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard and
R.J. Reynolds -- released a joint statement Monday calling the New
York measure ''shortsighted and ill-advised.'' They said research
is unclear whether the self-extinguishing cigarettes produce more
nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide than cigarettes do currently or
whether smokers will actually smoke them.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the problems we have is we have consumer lines that
answer customer calls all the time,'' spokesman Mark Smith of Brown
&AMP; Williamson said. ''One out of 10 has to deal with a product that
goes out while somebody is smoking. ... While someone might mandate
a certain kind of cigarette, if consumers don't smoke it, then
what's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies said programs educating people about the
dangers of careless smoking plus anti-fire programs, such as the
development of flame-retardant furniture and mattresses, have been
successful at curbing smoking-related fire deaths by 50 percent
over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that cigarette-related fires account for about
1,000 deaths and 3,000 injuries a year nationally. Experts say such
fires -- typically igniting mattresses and upholstered furniture
when smokers fall asleep with lighted cigarettes -- are the leading
cause of fire deaths in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's chief lobbyist in Albany
urged senators to approve the measure Monday, blaming 31 of the 112
fire deaths in the city in 1999 on fires ignited by cigarettes. In
1998, three city firemen were killed while searching for elderly
victims of a cigarette-related fire in a Brooklyn building,
lobbyist Anthony Piscitelli noted.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, tobacco companies would be required to make
cigarettes that stop burning if they're not smoked within a certain
time. Standards would also be established about acceptable
fire-starting capabilities of cigarettes when they come into
contact with different fabrics and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Fire Prevention and Control would develop
the self-extinguishing cigarette standards with help from the state
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   If signed into law, the measure would go into effect April 1,
2001. The industry would be required to stop marketing
non-self-extinguishing cigarettes in New York one year after that
date.
</P>
<P>
   Padavan and other advocates for the legislation in New York
insisted that the technology has arrived for the tobacco industry
to make a self-extinguishing cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years, cigarette makers have had the ability to market
products that burn cooler, self-extinguish when they're not being
smoked and are less likely to ignite blazes,'' Padavan said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group
said more than 100 patents have been taken out on
self-extinguishing cigarette technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the techniques to produce a ''cooler'' burn in cigarettes
is to make the paper they are wrapped in less porous or to elongate
the size of the cigarette, Haven said.

<HEADLINE> Tax-cut package takes shape in new budget  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State leaders have agreed to reduce an
unpopular tax which touches upon the lives of most New Yorkers in
the new budget for fiscal 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders made a deal Monday
night to cut New York's gross receipts tax on energy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tax is imposed on all electricity and natural gas
users, business interests say it falls most heavily on the
operators of power-hungry manufacturing plants in New York. The
deal among state leaders, as outlined Monday by people close to the
negotiations, provides for the tax to be eliminated for the big
manufacturers, and for those kinds of companies to get refunds of
the gross receipts taxes they've paid since Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called for such a reduction in his State of the State
address in January, and he and legislative leaders have all been in
favor of some form of gross receipts tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the tax-cut agreement said the new budget will
also include a reduction in the gross receipts tax for
non-manufacturing commercial customers over five years and for a
reduction in the tax charged to residential electric ratepayers of
$75 million immediately and $50 million to be phased in over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The gross receipts tax is among the most unpopular taxes within
the state's business community, with executives long claiming it
puts New York companies at a disadvantage to those in other states
where there is no such tax.
</P>
<P>
   An elimination of the tax would save industrial-grade power
users $4,600 a year, legislative aides estimated.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate reduction for residential ratepayers of about 25
percent, as the agreement calls for, would save New Yorkers about
$1.25 a month on their power bills. There would also be monthly
savings of a little under one dollar for typical residential
natural gas customers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Legislature and Pataki approved a reduction of the
4-cent-per-$1 tax on electricity bills, which became fully
effective in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, legislative leaders and Pataki agreed the state could
afford to institute $1.2 billion in tax cuts in the 2000-01 budget.
That cost is when the taxes are fully phased in over five years.
The price tag in the first fiscal year is expected to be in the
range of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In other tax-related agreements, according to sources Monday
night:
</P>
<P>
   --The state's ''marriage penalty'' will be eliminated by
increasing the standard deduction on state income taxes from
$13,000 to $15,000. That change will save typical married couples
about $140 a year and bring their tax bill into line with what two
unmarried adults living together would pay. Estimated savings when
phased in over five years: $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Regardless of income, residents with children in college will
be able to deduct up to $10,000 of their schooling costs, whether
they attend public or private schools, on state income taxes.
Estimated savings when phased in over five years: $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   --The state's Earned Income Tax Credit for working and
lower-middle-class poor will be increased. Estimated savings: $125
million, with almost all of the costs being picked up by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   --The state's current Enterprise Zone program creating low-tax,
business-friendly enclaves in struggling parts of the state will be
retooled and expanded to tax-free ''Empire Zones.''
</P>
<P>
   If the agreement holds and is enacted in the final budget, there
is something for all the state leaders in the tax package.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno pushed hard for
gross receipts tax reductions. Initially, Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver did not want any cuts to the portion of the tax charged to
residential ratepayers, but sources said he ended up championing
inclusion of home and apartment ratepayers during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was a strong proponent of the college tuition tax credit
and both he and Silver backed Earned Income Tax Credit
improvements. Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor and Silver had
advocated for elimination of the marriage penalty. Silver wanted to
see the ''Empire Zone'' program instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Connor's counterpart in the state Assembly, Assembly Republican
leader John Faso, had agitated for the gross receipts tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders have also agreed to renew the Power for Jobs
program, which provides lower-cost electricity to manufacturers and
other big users like hospitals and commercial businesses, over the
next three years. The plan calls for 300 megawatts of power to be
provided at a cost of $240 million, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Oswego's Safe Haven to be a TV miniseries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) -- One of World War II's best-kept secrets is
about to get some serious exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS television network will air a miniseries next February
about the nearly 1,000 refugees who sought a safe haven at Fort
Ontario in Oswego during the war. The fort was the only place in
America to house Holocaust survivors and other refugees who fled
the war's turmoil and destruction in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a compelling story,'' said Judy Ranan, president
of Citadel Entertainment, a Los Angeles-based television production
company that is producing the four-hour series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to show that Americans learned tolerance and
accepted these people and embraced them,'' Ranan said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-night miniseries is based on ''Haven: The Unknown Story
of 1,000 World War II Refugees.'' It was written by Ruth Gruber, a
government worker who escorted the refugees to the fort.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber, now 88 and living in New York City, planned to return to
Oswego this week to speak at SUNY-Oswego about her experiences and
unveil a documentary about the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Academy Award-winning actors Ann Bancroft and Martin Landau will
play Gruber's parents in the miniseries. Gruber, a central
character, will be played by Natasha Richardson, daughter of
Vanessa Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   ''The screenwriter made our relationship much more physical,''
said Gruber, adding that she didn't mind. ''They changed
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranan explained that the writer ''had to take some liberty to
make it a little more dramatic.'' She added that many of the
refugees in the series are not based on the real people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The characters are compiled,'' Ranan said. ''We don't have a
specific refugee in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Filming will begin in June in Toronto, because, Ranan said,
filming is cheaper there.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century ago, Oswego had factories, carefully-tended
gardens, hemlock sidewalks and brick streets, said Terry Prior,
curator and director of the Oswego County Historical Society. Prior
has been asked to find 40 to 50 photos from the period.
</P>
<P>
   Among the images that producers are interested in: the former
Fitzgibbons Boiler Works, which produced tanks for the Army during
World War II; the inside of the city's old high school, which has
been converted to condominiums; and the streetlights used at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers last month took a tour of the buildings and grounds
at Fort Ontario and looked at World War II-era photographs, said
Paul Lear, the fort's director.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' wood-frame dormitories and many of the red brick
buildings at the fort were taken down in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Ontario is located on a windblown bluff overlooking Lake
Ontario that's packed with history. The site has had an outpost
since the French and Indian Wars of the mid-1700s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our coming to Fort Ontario was very crucial in our lives,''
Paul Bokros told the Associated Press in an interview six years ago
commemorating the 50th anniversary of their arrival at the fort.
''I know it changed my life completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees -- opera singers, lawyers and teachers who were
hand-picked by the government -- were transported from Allied-held
southern Italy to the United States aboard an Army troop ship. The
982 refugees from 17 countries had to dodge a Nazi submarine and
were buzzed by German warplanes on their way across the Atlantic
Ocean, Bokros said.
</P>
<P>
   A train carried them on the final leg of their journey -- from
Hoboken, N.J., to Oswego. Fewer than 200 of the former refugees are
alive today.

<HEADLINE> Counties cancel police pact with Oneida Indians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Catering to public desire, two counties are
ending the nearly 6-year-old agreement that allows the Oneida
Indian Nation tribal police to act as deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Sheriff Dan Middaugh and Madison County Sheriff
Ron Cary denied Monday that the decision was in response to the
collapse of land claim negotiations with the Oneidas or any
specific incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Middaugh said, the sheriffs were responding to area
residents and local lawmakers, who have become increasingly
critical in recent months of the arrangement that has been in
effect since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriffs said the agreement had been under review for
several months but a decision was put on hold at the request of a
federal settlement master while negotiations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ''From public policy, it is obvious the area people want it this
way,'' Middaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cancellation of the agreement, the 40-member tribal
police force remains empowered to enforce tribal law and will
continue to function, said Mark Emery, a nation spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no big deal from our standpoint,'' Emery said. ''It
doesn't really affect us. They will be doing everything they were
doing before except the part that was saving the counties money.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are still going to be police officers. They are still
going to be tribal police. They are still special deputy officers
under the Bureau of Indian Affairs on the federal level,'' Emery
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has happened here is primarily politics over land
claims,'' Emery said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We question the seriousness of the counties willingness to go
back to the negotiating tables when they commit such a hostile
act,'' he said, referring to overtures last week from county
leaders about renewed interest in resuming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The accord began as an experimental arrangement. The nation's
police force's primary responsibility is patrolling the Oneida's
Turning Stone casino complex, which attracts 4 million visitors a
year. However, some residents have accused the Oneida Nation police
of harassing people who do not agree with the Oneidas' leadership,
although those allegations have gone unproven.
</P>
<P>
   The nation police force consists mostly of retired state
troopers and sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the legislatures of both counties passed resolutions
urging termination of the police pact. On Friday, the sheriffs said
they met with a lawyer for the Oneida Nation, district attorneys
from both counties and U.S. Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Both sheriffs acknowledged that canceling the accord will place
a greater burden on their forces. For now, deputy patrols will be
reassigned or put on overtime, they said. State police also
promised to fill some of the coverage gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Emery said nation police handled approximately 300 calls a year
in Madison County and more than 1,200 yearly in Oneida County.
</P>
<P>
   Nation police will still be allowed to respond to calls although
they can no longer investigate state crimes. They no longer have
arrest powers, but they will be able to detain suspects until the
proper authority arrives.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 9, Diamondbacks 1  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Consecutive bunt singles by Larry Walker and Jeff
Cirillo highlighted a five-run first inning Monday night as the
Colorado Rockies pounded Omar Daal and the Arizona Diamondbacks
9-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, who scored 14 runs without a homer in Sunday
night's 14-13 marathon victory over St. Louis, didn't get a home
run Monday, either. But they didn't need one to win for the fifth
time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton knocked in three runs with two singles, and six
other Rockies had two hits apiece, including winning pitcher Masato
Yoshii. Terry Shumpert had a triple and double with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii (1-1) allowed one run and seven hits in seven innings. He
struck out two and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Daal (0-1), who had strong performances but no decisions in his
first two outings, allowed eight runs -- seven earned -- and 13 hits
in 5 1-3 innings. He struck out two, walked two intentionally and
hit Jeff Cirillo to trigger a bench-clearing incident in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansing started the first-inning outburst with a one-out
single, then Walker and Cirillo put down perfect bunts in front of
ex-Rockie Lenny Harris at third base to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Helton followed with a two-run single, then Shumpert's RBI
double put Colorado up 3-0. A sacrifice fly by Neifi Perez made it
4-0. Daal intentionally walked Scott Servais to get to Yoshii,
whose RBI single put the Rockies ahead 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the second, Daal hit Cirillo between the
shoulders with a pitch. An angry Cirillo took a couple of steps
toward the mound, then pushed catcher Kelly Stinnett out of the
way. Both dugouts and bullpens emptied, but no punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored three more in the sixth. Harris' error on
Cirillo's hard grounder allowed one run to score, then Helton had
an RBI single off Erubiel Durazo's glove at first and Shumpert
drove across a run with a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley's RBI single drove in Jay Bell for Arizona's lone
run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona optioned OF David Dellucci to Triple-A Tucson and
activated utility player Andy Fox, who had missed the first 12
games of the season with a hairline fracture in his left wrist. ...
Colorado was the only NL West team to have a winning record against
the Diamondbacks last season. ... Rockies OF Jeffrey Hammonds, who
has been out since injuring a hamstring on opening day, was sent to
the team's extended spring training camp in Tucson for
rehabilitation. ... Arizona SS Tony Womack missed the game to
attend his grandmother's funeral.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Fate in the Hands of Court  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban Americans marked the 39th anniversary of the
Bay of Pigs fiasco Monday as they stood watch at the home where
Elian Gonzalez's relatives waited for a key ruling in the custody
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters recalled the disastrous and deadly attempt on April
17, 1961, in which CIA-trained exiles failed to invade Cuba. Their
criticism was extended to the Clinton administration, which wants
the 6-year-old Cuban boy returned to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the first betrayal. John F. Kennedy betrayed the
Cubans, now Clinton is betraying us. This is the second Bay of Pigs
of the Cuban people,'' said Enrique Leon, 65, a retired physician
from Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 women linked hands and sang at the barricades, a
larger than usual crowd for the morning prayer session. Later,
quiet fell over the crowd, broken by an occasional yell of ''Elian
is staying!''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have cared for him since November, when
he was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast. His
mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat
sank.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has pushed for Elian's return to his
father, saying only he can speak for his son on immigration
matters. The boy's Miami relatives say he will have a better life
here and have gone to court to seek an asylum hearing for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   They have also attempted to portray the father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, as a pawn of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were awaiting a ruling from the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The government wants the court to lift
an order that bars Elian's removal from the United States and to
order Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to release the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives want the court to let them meet with Elian's
father without conditions. In a statement Monday, they said the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has no authority to order
Lazaro Gonzalez to turn over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The agency last week revoked Lazaro Gonzalez's custody over the
boy after the family defied an INS order to make Elian available
for a reunion with his father in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is especially ironic for the INS to insist it has
jurisdiction to dictate the actions of Lazaro Gonzalez when the INS
has severed its relationship with Lazaro concerning the status of
Elian,'' the family said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official rejected that notion late Monday,
saying federal regulations require an adult who loses immigration
parole to show up as ordered -- and when a child loses such parole,
the person with custody of the child is required to bring him in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that somebody does not do that, just disobeys that,
does not excuse them from complying with that,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ''In our view,
the obligation, number one, has already been violated, and number
two, is ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said he planned to fly to
Washington on Tuesday and meet with government officials about the
custody dispute. He refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans had looked toward the anniversary with
apprehension, fearing a Justice Department attempt to take the boy
from Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But the day passed like most others in the 4{-month long custody
fight, with a vigil outside the Gonzalez home and a noon rally with
speeches reaffirming the community's commitment to free Cuba from
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Exiles have long accused President John F. Kennedy of betraying
them by failing to back up the 1961 invasion force with aerial
cover. Cuban exiles trained by the CIA were easily repelled by
Castro's forces at the swampy, mosquito-ridden inlet on the
country's southern coast. Two hundred rebels were killed, and
nearly 1,200 captured.
</P>
<P>
   A 150-page CIA report released in 1998 blamed the failure not on
Kennedy, but on the agency itself.
</P>
<P>
   This month also marks the 20-year anniversary of the start of
the Mariel boat lift, when 125,000 Cubans came over in a brief,
intense wave of immigration that began with President Carter's
welcome but soon went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Along with releasing Cubans seeking to leave the island, Castro
sent over convicted criminals and others he called ''the bums and
scum.'' The bigger-than-expected influx became its own disaster,
spurring prejudice and crime waves.

<HEADLINE> Rains Snarl Southern California  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A record-breaking amount of rain battered
Southern California on Monday, flooding roadways and causing
hundreds of accidents, including a crash that killed two people.
</P>
<P>
   The downpour also triggered a daring helicopter rescue of two
boys from a rain-swollen flood-control channel.
</P>
<P>
   The storm measured 1.24 inches in downtown Los Angeles by Monday
evening, breaking the record of .9 inches for the date set in 1903.
In Pasadena, 1.68 inches fell, four times the record of .4 inches
set in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Similar records were broken throughout the area, said Gary Ryan,
a technician with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. Some
areas saw more than two inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The rain, which began falling after 8 a.m., caught many people
by surprise. It caused hundreds of highway collisions when people
tried to return in the evening, including one involving 25 cars.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clarita, two people died and several others were
injured in a five-vehicle pileup that closed the southbound Golden
State Freeway for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Off the highways, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
rescue helicopter pulled two adolescent boys out of Big Dalton
Wash, a flood control channel in Glendora where rain-swollen waters
were clocked at 30 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue occurred as darkness fell, and the pair were taken to
a hospital for evaluation. They were not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said more showers were possible early Tuesday.
Monday's showers were accompanied by unseasonably cool
temperatures. The high in downtown Los Angeles was 58 degrees,
while the norm for this time of year is 73.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Cardinals Stadium Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The state House rejected a bill Monday night
proposing a new stadium for the Arizona Cardinals, hours after the
Senate approved it.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the $331 million stadium financing package was
33-25. One reconsideration vote is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a close vote,'' Cardinals lobbyist Doug Cole said. ''Our
focus right now is to go back and talk with the people we've been
working with and have a reconsideration vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate gave its final approval earlier Monday with a 20-10
reconsideration vote that reversed a decision last week.
</P>
<P>
   Even if approved by the Legislature, the stadium plan still
needed approval by Gov. Jane Hull and Maricopa County voters before
a stadium could be built.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money in the package would be used to promote
tourism, improve Cactus League spring training baseball stadiums
and build youth sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a good plan for Arizona voters,'' said Rep. Laura
Knaperek, R-Tempe. If the team wants to put such a plan on the
ballot, she said, ''I suggest the Cardinals start an initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Cardinals would pay $85 million and the
Fiesta Bowl $10 million to build a 73,000-seat domed stadium with a
partially retractable roof and a slide-in grass field.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money would come from increased taxes on rental
cars and hotel rooms plus stadium-related sales taxes and income
taxes on pro football players and Cardinals employees.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Cardinals would have access to new money-making
opportunities, starting with naming rights to the stadium and other
advertising. The team also would be able to profit from luxury
seating, parking and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cardinals would still have to negotiate a lease to use
the building, the bill puts the responsibility for maintenance and
operational costs such as utilities and field preparations on the
stadium authority rather than the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals say they need a new stadium and the revenue that
comes with it to remain financially competitive in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely sure if this goes down, and it well may, the
Cardinals will leave,'' said Rep. Richard Kyle, R-Phoenix, who
voted for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to Arizona from St. Louis 12 years ago, the
Cardinals have played at Arizona State University's Sun Devil
Stadium. Last season, they were the only NFL team playing home
games in a college stadium.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 2, Kings 1  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two costly high-sticking penalties proved
devastating to the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Fedorov and Tomas Holmstrom scored power-play goals as
the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Kings 2-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Scotty Bowman behind the bench for his 99th playoff game as
Detroit coach, the Red Wings took a commanding 3-0 lead in the
best-of-7 Western Conference first-round series. Game 4 is
Wednesday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Chris Osgood made 21 saves in front of a sellout crowd
of 18,118 that included numerous fans dressed in the Red Wings' red
and white colors on a night when the Kings urged their fans to
dress in black. Stephane Fiset, peppered for five goals in less
than two periods in an 8-5 loss in Game 2, stopped 22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Since going 0-for-6 on the power play in a 2-0 victory in Game
1, the Red Wings have scored five power-play goals. The Kings
failed on all seven of their power-play opportunities, making them
0-for-15 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings led 1-0 on Fedorov's 40th career playoff goal and
second of the series at 5:21 of the first period when Detroit
skated with a two-man advantage. Jozef Stumpel was penalized for
roughing, then Rob Blake was sent off for high-sticking on
Holmstrom to set up Fedorov's goal that beat Fiset stick side.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which has never rebounded from a 3-0 deficit in the
playoffs, failed to capitalize on a double-minor assessed to Darren
McCarty early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   With McCarty off four minutes for tripping and unsportsmanlike
conduct, the Kings managed just one shot. Ziggy Palffy got ahead of
Nicklas Lidstrom heading to the net, but his shot went straight
into Osgood's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings led 2-0 on Holmstrom's power-play goal at 14:40 of
the second. He redirected a slap shot inside the blue line by
Lidstrom with Bryan Smolinski off for high-sticking. They were
2-for-6 on the power play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made it 2-1 when Luc Robitaille scored his 49th career
playoff goal and second of the series, beating Osgood between his
pads at 2:35 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Chartrand nearly tied it for the Kings 2{ minutes later,
but Osgood collapsed on his left side to stop Chartrand's shot from
close in.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had another excellent chance to tie with 7:23
remaining, but Craig Johnson, in front of Osgood, tipped a shot
wide by teammate Ian Laperriere. Fiset made consecutive saves on
Steve Yzerman with less than five minutes remaining.

<HEADLINE> Lobster conference seeks reasons for dieoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Fishing the New York side of Long Island
Sound on Sept. 14, Joe Finke pulled in 244 pounds of lobster. On
Oct. 8, his catch weighed just 44 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Finke was one of about 250 lobstermen, environmentalists and
scientists who gathered in Stamford on Monday for a two-day
''lobster health symposium'' aimed at finding the cause of the high
lobster mortality.
</P>
<P>
   The lobstermen, who came from both the Connecticut and New York
sides of the sound, told stories of financial despair and
frustration. Although estimates on how many lobsters have been
killed vary, Makowsky said he agreed with one that puts the recent
mortality rate at between 90 percent and 96 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Burt, a lobster dealer in East Norwalk, said the recent
increase in mortality has given Long Island Sound lobsters a a bad
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gotten to the point where I have ... customers who will
not buy Long Island Sound lobsters at any price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dieoff has been concentrated in the western part of the
sound. Lobstermen on the eastern end of the sound said they did not
see a similar mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
   University of Connecticut scientists have found a parasite
called a paramoeba that is infecting the lobsters, but are checking
whether other factors, such as pollution or contamination of the
sound, is contributing to the dieoff.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a New York-based fisheries conservation group, FISH
Unlimited Inc., believe it may have been caused by contaminated
dredge material that was dumped into Western Long Island Sound last
fall from Mamaroneck Harbor, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, officials in New York and Connecticut
were spraying pesticides to prevent the spread of the West Nile
encephalitis outbreak. The group believes that heavy rains from
Hurricane Floyd in September may have washed the pesticides into
the sound.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with five lobstermen's associations, FISH
Unlimited is planning to collect dead lobsters and sediment from
the sound and submit the samples to an independent laboratory for
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both New York and Connecticut have lobbied for
money to help the lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Sound is the No. 3 lobster market behind Maine
and Massachusetts. Connecticut brings in about 3.5 million pounds a
year, while New York brings in about 8.5 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Frate Jr., a lobsterman who fishes in Stamford and Darien,
said whatever has been causing the lobsters to die is still present
in the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not see the problem being over,'' he said. ''They're
still dying.''

<HEADLINE> Judge rejects mistrial for man accused in boy witness killing  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The trial of a man charged in the
murders of an 8-year-old witness and his mother will go on as
scheduled, despite a letter in which the prosecution's star witness
claims she lied.
</P>
<P>
   A judge on Monday rejected a request to grant a mistrial to
Russell Peeler, who is accused of masterminding the killing of
Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke. The mother
and son were gunned down in their Bridgeport home on Jan. 7, 1999,
a few months before B.J. was scheduled to testify against Peeler in
the 1998 killing of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke,
originally told police she acted as a lookout and watched as
Peeler's brother, Adrian, shot and killed B.J. and his mother. But
in a letter to her lawyer written in December, Lee changed her
story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them is lies,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, who are being tried separately, each face a
possible death sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's letter was disclosed to the defense last week during the
final phase of jury selection in Russell Peeler's case.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers immediately filed a stack of motions, including
a request for a mistrial, immediate adjournment of the trial and a
continuance.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing arguments Monday, Judge G. Sarsfield Ford
rejected all of the requests and said jury selection would continue
today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're expected to react (to Lee's letter) and then proceed
without any additional time to prepare, and that's startling to me.
We're trying to save this man's life,'' said John Walkley, one of
Peeler's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict argued against a
mistrial or delay, characterizing Lee's letter as ''something like
a gift'' for the defense. He said Peeler's lawyers could use it to
attack her credibility during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would submit that a high school student could confront the
witness with that on no more than a day's notice,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said the letter amounted to nothing more than ''cold
feet'' on the part of Lee. He said she has a terminal illness and
was hoping to get a shorter sentence so she doesn't have to die in
prison. In a plea bargain struck with prosecutors, Lee agreed to
testify against the Peeler brothers in exchange for a sentence of
no more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In their motions, Peeler's lawyers complained about the late
date of the disclosure of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said Lee had inadvertently included the letter to her
lawyer with several other letters she wrote to Bridgeport police
officers in December. He said when a police officer gave him the
letter, he immediately asked a judge to rule on whether it was
exculpatory -- information that could help prove Peeler's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Ford made the letter available to the defense last week after
Lee agreed to waive her attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also rejected a series of other defense motions based on
Lee's letter, including: a renewed request to obtain Lee's medical
and psychiatric records; a request to withdraw Peeler's earlier
waiver of a probable cause hearing; a renewed request for an
inquiry into Lee's competency; and a request to give the defense
immediate access to Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also denied a request for Lee to be required to give a
new deposition. Lee's deposition was videotaped in November to
prepare for the possibility that she might die before the trial.
Ford denied the request without prejudice, meaning the defense can
renew the request again later.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said it appears that Lee will be well enough to testify
during the trial, which could start as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her health is not a concern, and it's my understanding she's
ready to testify -- truthfully,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford delayed a hearing on a defense request to dismiss the
charges based on Lee's letter until Wednesday because court copies
of the motion were illegible.

<HEADLINE> With BC-CT--ConEd-NU-Open Space  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- Northeast Utilities and Consolidated
Edison's merger proposal faces an uphill battle with the state
Department of Public Utility Control.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Glenn Arthur said Monday he could find no immediate
monetary benefit for consumers, unlike other big utility mergers
around the country that resulted in rate cuts and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur urged ConEd and NU to amend their merger proposal to
offer more to Connecticut customers, saying the current proposal
''is not a dead ringer for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief executives of the companies said the merger will mean
lower rates and better service for customers in the long run, as
the companies find savings and boost efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will pass these savings along to consumers. We will have
benefits for consumers,'' said Michael Morris, chairman and chief
executive of NU.
</P>
<P>
   ConEd chairman Eugene McGrath said the combined company would
invest in the community and its work force. He defended the company
against questions about its handling of worker complaints and
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people do make mistakes from time to time. We try to learn
from them and move on,'' McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   Any job cuts would be accomplished though attrition, McGrath and
Morris said. Each year, about 1,100 employees retire or leave the
company, and ConEd has a training center to help workers learn new
skills, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC plans 10 days of hearings on the $3.5 billion merger,
which would create the country's largest electric and gas
distribution company with more than 6.4 million customers in New
York and New England. A draft ruling is scheduled for June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders approved the merger Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue is how much the merger would cost and how the
combined company would pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price is $1.5 billion over the book value of NU's
stock. To pay that premium, the company does not plan a rate
reduction for Connecticut customers until 2006 or later, Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Any savings should be passed on immediately, or the premium
should be decreased, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris noted that Connecticut consumers are enjoying a 10
percent rate reduction already under the state's electric
deregulation law. The rate cut is in effect until the end of 2003,
at which time the DPUC will hold hearings to set new rates.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Wertheimer questioned ConEd's
record on protecting workers' rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   A fire in a transformer in September 1998 resulted in a release
of hazardous chemicals around firefighters, who later settled with
the company for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 steam manhole explosion, 700 pounds of asbestos
contaminated the Manhattan neighborhood of Gramercy Park. The
company was convicted in 1995 of having deliberately concealed the
asbestos threat.
</P>
<P>
   ConEd agreed to a court order to maintain an environmental law
compliance program and to hire an ombudsman to investigate
suspected violations. Wertheimer said some company employees feared
retaliation for reporting environmental concerns after the
ombudsman left.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer also questioned ConEd's handling of a radiation leak
at the Indian Point II nuclear power plant in February and a
blackout in the Washington Heights section of New York City last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan businesses have sued ConEd for $50 million, accusing
the utility of discrimination and negligence during the blackout,
which left more than 200,000 people without power in the middle of
a heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said the company had little choice but to shut off power
to the area because a large part of the system was out of service
from excessive heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Johnson from the Office of the Consumer Counsel criticized
the $30 million in stock options and bonuses Morris and other top
executives would get if the merger goes through. Morris alone would
be able to cash in $12.7 million in stock options after the merger.

U.S. Won't Sell Destroyers to Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, backed by his senior advisers, decided
Monday against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but approved a
smaller package including long-range radar designed to detect missile launches,
two senior U.S. officials said. Clinton acted on the recommendation of top
advisers who met earlier in the day at the White House. The Pentagon had
recommended that the administration put off Taiwan's request to buy new weapons,
including the destroyers, submarines and anti-submarine aircraft, in order to
avoid angering China, which views Taiwan as a rebellious province.

High Court Expands Passengers' Rights

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers must

if drugs might be inside. The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border
Patrol agent who felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment ban on unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to contain
drugs. The ruling expands public transit passengers' privacy rights, but the
National Association of Police Organizations said it was disappointed by the
ruling.

of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About 600 people were
arrested Monday, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the protests began.
The protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor
nations, destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of other ills. World
Bank spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the meetings felt
''bewilderment and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She said the
officials were talking about ways to relieve poverty.

Cuban Americans Await Elian's Fate

   MIAMI (AP) -- On the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Cuban
Americans in Miami stood watch at the home where Elian Gonzalez's relatives
waited for a key ruling in the custody fight. Protesters recalled the deadly
attempt on April 17, 1961, in which CIA-trained exiles failed to invade Cuba.
Their criticism was extended to the Clinton administration, which wants the
6-year-old Cuban boy returned to his Cuban father. The boy's Miami relatives say
he will have a better life here. Both sides were awaiting a ruling from the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The government wants the court to lift
an order that bars Elian's removal from the United States and to order Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to release the boy.

whose reign of terror killed 1.7 million people. Hun Sen said he backed a
U.S.-suggested compromise that appears to resolve the sensitive issue of how to

attributed to ''market conditions,'' came following last week's tech stock

<HEADLINE> Chicago Janitors Win New Contract  </HEADLINE>
By MARIO FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Thousands of janitors who staged a 24-hour
walkout Monday agreed to return to work after settling on a
three-year deal with pay increases and improved benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The janitors, who work in the city's downtown offices, were due
to return to work on Tuesday. The janitors' contract expired at
midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was negotiated as thousands of members of Local 1
of the Service Employees International Union picketed office
buildings. When the tentative agreement was reached with the
Building Owners and Managers Association, union negotiators read
details to those rallying outside. They roared their approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very good settlement,'' said Ken Munz, spokesman for
the SEIU. ''It's the best we have seen in a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the settlement, their salary of $10.10 an hour in 1992
had only increased to $11.40, $1.10 short of keeping up with the
cost of living during that period, Munz said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for a pay increase of 45 cents in the first
year, with increases of 35 cents and 30 cents in subsequent years.
The contract also requires employees to increase their
contributions to health insurance plans and adds a fifth week of
vacation after 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout affected some 200 buildings and 5,500 workers,
hundreds of whom attended an afternoon rally outside the downtown
building where the contract talks were being held. Then they
marched to other union-serviced buildings in the Loop business
district to bring attention to their cause as office workers headed
for home.
</P>
<P>
   There may still be more labor strife. Janitors in the suburbs
had threatened to walk off their jobs if negotiations with a
mediator fail to make any headway Tuesday. Their contract expired
April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is the latest city to see labor unrest among janitors.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of commercial building janitors are on strike in Los
Angeles, seeking wage increases and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say similar labor unrest could occur in other
cities, including New York, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia,
where union janitor contracts are due to expire this year.

<HEADLINE> New EPA Rules Protect Corn Pest  </HEADLINE>
By ROXANA HEGEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Call it a wildlife refuge for pests.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of protecting some endangered animal, these havens
are designed to protect the dreaded corn borer moth.
</P>
<P>
   Under new Environmental Protection Agency regulations imposed
this spring, farmers can only use 80 percent of their corn acreage
to plant the Bt variety of biotech corn, which contains a bacteria
gene that makes it toxic to pests.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 20 percent must be a non-Bt variety -- so that
enough of the corn borers can survive and reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   If the thought of a refuge for corn borers is not strange
enough, consider this: the new regulations were actually suggested
to the EPA by farmers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking is that enough of the corn borers susceptible to
the Bt corn must survive so they can mate with any resistant moths
which emerge from the biotech cornfields, said Randy Higgins, state
entomologist with Kansas State Research and Extension.
</P>
<P>
   Without the plan, Bt-resistant moths would mate with each other
-- something that ultimately would increase the resistance of the
corn borer population.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strategy, coupled with other recommendations the EPA has
made, are designed to maintain the durability of Bt corn as a
remarkably effective pest control tool for many years,'' Higgins
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially important in south-central and southwest
Kansas -- where corn fields are plagued by heavy concentrations of
both European and southwestern corn borers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who has measured the benefits of the
technology in the field is Larry Buschman, research entomologist at
the Kansas State Research and Extension Center in Garden City.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers pay a technology premium of about $10 per acre to plant
the Bt-modified seed -- which is cheaper than any insecticide
application, he said. The Bt fields not only produce bigger yields
but also higher quality corn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic advantage of planting Bt corn is very
substantial, when you see $150 for every $10 investment,'' Buschman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jere White, executive director of Kansas Corn Growers
Association, said the practice of planting refuge acres for corn
borers when using Bt seed has been an industry practice for at
least a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the practice that had been encouraged by growers and
industry, prior to being a formally adopted regulation by EPA, so
it really was no change to any growers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that farmers are more concerned about is whether
they will be able to find markets for the Bt corn, which became
controversial last year after a university study suggested its
pollen could be killing Monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   A study sponsored by the National Research Council, an arm of
the National Academy of Sciences, said last week that more research
is needed to prevent biotech crops from killing harmless insects
and to stop pest-resistant genes from spreading into weeds.
</P>
<P>
   White said that in the wake of the controversy over altered
foods, a group of northwest Kansas farmers have begun growing and
supplying corn specifically for markets that sell crops free from
genetic modifications.

<HEADLINE> Daughter, Blind Father Save Mother  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Prone to seizures and legally blind, David
Hanna fought panic when a campfire exploded, engulfing his wife in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're my eyes,'' he told his 14-year-old daughter,
Krystallyn, sitting her on his lap behind the steering wheel of the
family car in a race to find help for the critically burned woman.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics say the quick action by the father and daughter saved
the life of Tammyla Hanna, 34, who was reported in critical
condition Monday at University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's nightmare began when Mrs. Hanna poured gasoline on a
fire in a barbecue grill at a remote campsite 25 miles southwest of
Las Vegas. The subsequent explosion set fire to her head and hair.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said he couldn't find his cane and stumbled toward his
wife, drawn by her cries for help and Krystallyn's screams of
''Help, Daddy, Mommy's on fire!''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said he found his wife who was trying to rub her head in
the dirt and rocks as she screamed ''I'm dying! I'm dying!'' He
ripped her jacket from her and smothered the flames, then got her
into the front seat of the car.
</P>
<P>
   He got in the driver's side, slid the seat all the way back,
then told Krystallyn, ''You're my eyes. I can't see. If you see a
car, block the road. We have to get mommy to help. Don't listen to
anyone but me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his home in Pahrump, Nev., 60
miles west of here, Hanna, 35, said he didn't have time to worry
about whether his daughter was up to the task. She had steered a
car only once previously, just briefly on a dirt road during a
California trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked the gas pedal and she steered,'' Hanna said. ''She
did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Krystallyn said she was afraid of the responsibility, but more
afraid of what would happen to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to get my mom some help,'' she recounted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After driving for what Hanna described as ''forever,''
Krystallyn noticed an oncoming vehicle and -- as instructed -- turned
the family car to block the road.
</P>
<P>
   The motorist stopped, then raced the burned woman and her family
to a fire station, where a Flight for Life helicopter from Las
Vegas was dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   David Hanna had a brain tumor removed at age 13 and began losing
his sight 10 years ago. The malady has left him subject to frequent
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ekmark, an American Medical Response paramedic who
responded to Saturday's accident, said he can't recall a similar
incident in 29 years in the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had he not got her out of there, she probably would have shut
down, quit breathing,'' Ekmark said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ekmark was crediting the husband, Hanna said it was his
daughter who was the real hero.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it wasn't for her, she would have died,'' Hanna said.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Donates Kidney to Student  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- For a science teacher who learned
lessons about giving from her parents, donating one of her kidneys
to a student fits in perfectly with her role as an educator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think teachers as a whole give so much to their students,''
Jane Smith, 42, said Monday. ''I think any teacher, when a child
walks through their door, wants to give them a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a teacher at R. Max Abbott Middle School, was discharged
from UNC Hospitals on Monday afternoon, three days after surgeons
removed her left kidney and gave it to 15-year-old Michael Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the surgeons who performed the transplant said at a
hospital news conference that they hope others will be inspired to
become organ donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an incredible gift,'' said David Gerber, an assistant
professor of surgery at UNC.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's mother, Deborah Evans, said Smith was an answer to
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had to teach Michael about faith,'' she said. ''.... Even
in his bad days, he would say, 'Mommy, I'm still praying.' ... I
think Michael has developed a very special relationship with
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Michael, who endured two surgery postponements
because of infections, is happier than she has ever seen him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that everyone has a guardian angel. Some know theirs
and some don't. I always felt that Ms. Smith was our guardian
angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael will remain in the hospital a few more days and must
take drugs to prevent his body from rejecting his new kidney, but
doctors said he is doing well and could return to school within six
months. He did not attend the news conference because doctors want
to limit the infection risk.
</P>
<P>
   Born with renal dysplasia, Michael began dialysis treatments
last summer after a kidney failed.
</P>
<P>
   Last August on the school playground, Smith suggested to
Michael, a homeroom student she had known just two weeks, that he
hike up his baggy pants so he could run better.
</P>
<P>
   Michael told her that he was undergoing dialysis and that he
wore the pants because they were comfortable. He also said he
needed a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'I have two, do you want one?''' Smith recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those moments in your life that you know it was
the right thing, and that it was going to happen,'' said Smith, who
sent Michael home with her phone number and asked him to have his
mother call her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'OK, Michael, yeah, right,''' Evans recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans said her son was insistent, telling her, ''Mom, she
eats fruits and salads every day.... She's the one. God told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith did turn out to be the one, thanks partly to new drugs
that make such ''stranger donations'' of organs increasingly
possible, said Mark Johnson, director of UNC's renal transplant
program and the surgeon who removed Smith's kidney. In the past,
virtually all donor organs came from patients' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Matching kidneys is not so important as it was 20 or 30 years
ago,'' said Johnson, who noted that 45,000 Americans are awaiting
kidney donations but only 12,000 transplants are performed each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only limitation is we don't have enough organs to do all
those transplants,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani paid $3.6 million for direct mail; Clinton video cost$277,000  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Giuliani Senate campaign spent about half
its fund-raising take on direct mail solicitations during the first
three months of this year, while Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign
paid more than a quarter of a million dollars for an 18-minute
biopic on the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to elect Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to the U.S. Senate
spent about $3.6 million on direct mail between Jan. 1 and March
31, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections
Commission and released Monday. Another $300,000 was spent on
postage, fund-raising consultant fees and telemarketing. Giuliani
raised $7.3 million during the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign spent about $1 million on direct mail and
postage and raised $4.7 million during the period.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady's campaign spent $277,000 for the production
of the ''Hillary'' documentary that was shown at the February event
officially launching her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The biopic featured interviews with Clinton's mother and various
admirers, in addition to a clip of the first lady making fun of her
own lack of culinary skills by saying, ''I make a mean tossed
salad.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was made by Clinton supporter Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason.
</P>
<P>
   About $1 million of Giuliani's direct mail bills came from
American Target, the Virginia-based company run by Richard
Viguerie, whose appeals for money for Giuliani have painted Clinton
as an ultra-left-winger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have sent out their own fund-raising letter
condemning Giuliani's association with Viguerie, who is renowned
for his fund-raising on behalf of arch-conservatives like Sen.
Jesse Helms, of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Giuliani spent $1.3 million on direct mail while
Clinton spent $500,000 on it.
</P>
<P>
   Both this period and last year, Giuliani significantly outpaced
Clinton's fund-raising, with the mayor raising nearly $20 million
while the first lady raised nearly $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   The January-through-March expense forms also show that Clinton
paid $230,000 for political consulting and media work to various
firms, including the New York advertising company Devito Verdi and
a company run by Mandy Grunwald, who was a strategist for Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani listed about $60,000 in fees for various consultants
but also made $770,000 in payments for media production and media
placement, most of it apparently for the purchase of television ad
time.
</P>
<P>
   A series of television commercials for Clinton that ran late
last year was paid for by a Democratic party committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates paid hefty sums to pollsters in the first
quarter of this year -- Clinton listing a $56,500 payment and
Giuliani listing $34,000 in polling expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton expenses also include $57,000 paid for White House
air travel plus about $20,000 paid for various train and plane
expenses incurred by campaign staffers. Giuliani listed about
$85,000 worth of travel expenses
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has complained that Clinton should reimburse the
government for a greater share of her travel expenses. She has only
been paying for the equivalent cost of one first-class airfare on
her campaign and fund-raising swings around the state and the
country, even though the actual cost to the government is much
higher because she flies on a White House jet.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign has defended the practice, saying it is a
standard reimbursement formula used by first ladies, presidents and
vice presidents when they campaign for themselves or others.

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Story on Newt Gingrich  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Associated Press erroneously reported
in an April 17 story that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
predicted Hillary Clinton would easily defeat New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in this year's New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said Clinton had ''a very good chance'' of beating
Giuliani and added, ''If I were guessing right now, I would say she
probably has the edge to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The story also erroneously reported that Gingrich said Texas
Gov. George W. Bush needs to bring in more experienced advisers to
run his presidential campaign. Gingrich did say that Bush's team
''still has a little bit of Austin in their style'' and is ''not
quite up to speed yet'' in running a national campaign.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Citizen Decision Raises Storm  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMMEN, Switzerland (AP) -- After 43 years living in Switzerland,
Janos Deak says he has ''long been Swiss in my heart.'' But that
wasn't good enough for his neighbors -- voters in this industrial
Lucerne suburb rejected his application to become a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel humiliated,'' Deak, a retired Hungarian construction
worker, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland has traditionally been stingy in granting
citizenship to foreign residents, but the experiment of a large
town putting the decision into the hands of voters has touched off
national soul-searching even among the referendum-happy Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Many villages in Switzerland's German-speaking heartland have
long held referendums on citizenship applications. But Emmen, with
a population of 27,000, applied the system on a much larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   The burghers of Emmen rejected 86 percent of the applicants in
their March 12 referendum, even though town officials had cited all
of them as good, law-abiding members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   That raised alarm in government circles, stirred debate in the
national media and prompted the Council of Europe to warn that the
system leaves ''room for discriminatory practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This vote is symptomatic -- and I think not just for Emmen but
for many, many places in Switzerland where covert racism exists,''
says Arlette Fischer, the left-wing Social Democrats'
representative in Emmen.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Italians received the red-and-white Swiss passport. The 48
losers were from eastern Europe and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   People from the former Yugoslavia, many of whom arrived in the
1980s or earlier and have Swiss-born children, fared badly. Some
right-wing politicians openly suggest Balkan immigrants have
tendencies to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a bad climate here,'' says Stevica Vukojevic, a
37-year-old Serbian employee at the local steelworks, who along
with his Croatian wife and their two Swiss-born children received
support from only 35 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've given everything I can to become Swiss,'' he adds. ''I've
concentrated my whole life on it, and I've worked in Emmen for 16
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The would-be citizens voted on March 12 were exposed to detailed
scrutiny through a 98-page booklet the town government mailed to
all Emmen households. A page devoted to each family included
photographs and personal details, including income, activities and
work history.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like being treated as a criminal,'' says Deak, 63, who
was backed by 45 percent of voters. ''The only difference is
there's no number on your chest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the uproar following the vote, town officials abandoned the
next citizenship referendum and put 250 applications on hold until
the end of the year to ''somehow improve the whole procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We urgently need to calm things down,'' says Peter
Schnellmann, president of the local council.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying problems remain -- in particular a belief that
Switzerland, which long welcomed workers from less wealthy parts of
Europe, can no longer afford to extend that welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every fourth person is already a foreigner'' in Emmen, says
Kurt Portmann, who heads the newly revived local section of the
right-wing Swiss People's Party. ''You have to recognize that we
just have too many. Far too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Portmann's party made large gains in national elections last
year after campaigning with the slogan ''Stop Asylum Abuse'' --
reflecting the success of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party in
neighboring Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted by the Emmen vote, lawmakers in Geneva and other
western French-speaking towns said they would grant citizenship to
those who were rejected -- an offer generally seen as unrealistic
but which reflects new doubt over a cherished tenet of Swiss direct
democracy: The people are always right.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a local court ordered a review of a 1997 decision by
voters in the northwestern town of Pratteln to throw out
citizenship bids by five Turks, which it ruled an ''arbitrary
demonstration of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of obtaining a passport varies enormously across
this country of four languages and 7 million people, but typically
the decision is made by a local panel.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants must have lived in Switzerland for 12 years. Beyond
that, individual towns place their own hurdles -- ranging from
''good character'' through respectable family life to ''readiness
to serve society.''
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary from negligible to thousands of dollars, depending on
whether the community charges a percentage of income.
</P>
<P>
   Deak and Vukojevic, both of whom submitted their current bids
three years ago, are reluctant to start again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to see right now,'' Vukojevic says. ''I'm so
disappointed.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Coyotes 2  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Adam Deadmarsh scored twice in the third period,
including an empty-netter with 24 seconds to play, and the Colorado
Avalanche pushed the Phoenix Coyotes to the edge of elimination
with a 4-2 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche have a 3-0 lead in the best-of-7 first-round
Western Conference series. The Coyotes must win Game 4 at home
Wednesday night to avoid their ninth consecutive first-round exit
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy was beaten on two of four power plays, but otherwise
had 23 saves for his third straight victory and 112th in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Shjon Podein and Joe Sakic scored earlier for the Avs, and Keith
Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick had the Phoenix goals.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the leadership of the two first-line forwards could
sidetrack Colorado, which showed it didn't need a deluge of power
plays to win. The Avalanche had 16 advantages, in winning the first
game 6-3 and the second 3-1, and scored five times.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they were 1-for-3, with Sakic scoring. He broke a 1-1
tie with a goal that went off two skates.
</P>
<P>
   Sandis Ozolinsh kicked the puck across the crease, and Phoenix
goalie Sean Burke tried to kick it out but only redirected it to
Sakic waiting on his left. Burke was falling and could only watch
as Sakic lifted the puck over him for the goal with 5:12 left in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first goal for Sakic, who has three assists, and the
fifth point of the playoffs for Ozolinsh. Peter Forsberg started
the play with a pass, earning his second assist in as many games
since returning from a shoulder injury. He got another assist,
setting up Deadmarsh's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick tied it 2-2 when Adam Foote tried to flick the puck out
of Colorado's end and Roenick knocked it down and slapped a
wobbling shot into the net 6:17 into the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Deadmarsh took the life out of the Coyotes, redirecting a
shot by Forsberg only 29 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreless first period featured trapping in the neutral
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs, who outshot Phoenix 73-41 in the first two games, had
just one shot in the first 12 minutes. Each team finished the
period with six.
</P>
<P>
   Action heated up quickly in the second, which began with 1:11
left in the Coyotes' second power play.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, scoreless since Jan. 31 after missing 24 of the last 27
games, deflected Jyrki Lumme's slap shot from the blue line, and
the puck slipped past Roy 49 seconds into the middle period.
</P>
<P>
   Podein, who had two goals in the first game, had a chance to
score minutes later on a wraparound, but missed the net when Mika
Alatalo knocked him down.
</P>
<P>
   But he tied it 9:32 into the second as the Avs flashed the speed
and precision that earned them their sixth consecutive division
title in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Deadmarsh got the puck along the boards, skated into the circle
and passed to Chris Drury in the other circle. Drury sent the puck
to Podein in the high slot, and his one-timer went in over Burke's
shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Miami Cuban-Americans Still Alone  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- After years of going it alone, the city's
Cuban-American community is making a display of reaching out to
other ethnic minorities -- without much success.
</P>
<P>
   With the national spotlight squarely on Little Havana and
efforts to keep Elian Gonzalez from being returned to Cuba, the
Cuban-American community's isolation is starkly clear: The crowd is
almost entirely white or Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening in a county with a rich mix of minority
groups. While Cubans are the largest ethnic group, with about
800,000 of the more than 2.1 million people, there are 500,000
whites, 400,000 other Hispanics, and more than 400,000 blacks,
including 150,000 Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those groups resent the Cuban-American power
structure here and aren't rushing to offer support on the Elian
issue. The reluctance is rooted both in the history of Miami's race
relations and what some call preferential treatment for Cuban
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians and Mexicans point to recent cases of immigrants from
both countries being routinely deported while Cubans are guaranteed
residency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely an issue of double standards,'' said Leonie
Hermantin, executive director of Miami's Haitian American
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American political strength intimidates the city's
other factions into silence, said Fred St. Amand, a Haitian funeral
parlor owner. One non-Cuban who lives near the Gonzalez home this
week said he fears physical retribution if he voices his opposition
to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   The home has flown Cuban and American flags for months. Suddenly
this week there are flags of other Latin American nations -- Brazil,
Mexico, four Central American nations, as well as Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the Cuban community claim there is wide support for
efforts to keep 6-year-old Elian in the United States and said they
are simply welcoming participants from other Latin factions.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, the leader of the exile community's
Democracy Movement, said he has extended an invitation to other
ethnic and political groups ''to fight the omnivorous power of the
INS, a power that comes not from Congress, but from xenophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   But many leaders in those communities say the invitation is as
clumsy as it is insincere.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the home this week compared the effort to civil rights
legends -- ''Are Harriet Tubman or Rosa Parks better than Lazaro
Gonzalez? No!!'' -- did little to win supporters in the black
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''That reflects a lack of appreciation of the history of black
people in this country,'' said Marvin Dunn, chairman of the
psychology department at Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   When a rare black face was spotted in the crowd last week, an
announcer at Miami's Spanish-language, pro-exile AM radio station
Radio Unica welcomed the visitor as a ''gentleman from Africa'' and
proof of worldwide support. But the man was Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has a troubled racial history, though there have been no
signs of racial tension over the Elian issue.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1980, as the Mariel boatlift began, rioting that would
kill 18 people erupted in predominantly black Liberty City after an
all-white jury acquitted four former Miami police officers of
fatally beating a black insurance executive.
</P>
<P>
   Riots broke out again in 1982 after a black man was shot by a
Cuban police officer, and in 1989 when an unarmed black speeding
suspect was shot by a Colombian police officer.
</P>
<P>
   And now there is a new issue dominating the headlines for the
city's largest minority group: Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''It concerns me,'' said Arva Moore Parks, a local historian who
was born in Little Havana and has written books about the city.
''This (Elian) seems to have polarized the community more than
anything in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that most Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade County
say the boy should remain in Florida with his relatives. But other
Hispanics are more evenly split, and a majority of the area's white
and black non-Hispanics say the boy should be returned to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Miami Herald poll show most blacks think Elian should
be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have two communities diametrically opposed on this issue,''
Dunn said. Rifts between Cuban Americans and blacks in Miami, which
he said have been made worse by the Elian saga, ''would take time
to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   And Parks said the city would heal: ''Any community that can
survive May 1980 can do anything.''

<HEADLINE> US Won't Allow Taiwan Destroyer Sale  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's decision to shelve
Taiwan's request to buy four billion-dollar U.S. destroyers is
likely to touch off a fight with Congress, where support for the
island is strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican leader, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, is
expected to call for a vote on an arms package for Taiwan, and the
White House already is warning that could lead to a Clinton veto if
Lott gets enough votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how much the United States is willing to do to
protect Taiwan from mainland China and thereby antagonize the
Communist leaders in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful Republican senator, Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
Monday the Pentagon, which had advised Clinton against the sale,
decided ''to sacrifice Taiwan's security in order to appease the
dictators in Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday decided against the sale of four Aegis
destroyers to Taiwan, but approved a smaller package including
long-range radar designed to detect missile launches, two senior
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was in California on a tour of impoverished areas,
acted on the recommendation of top advisers who met earlier in the
day at the White House and also of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who was traveling in Uzbekistan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon recommended that the administration put off
Taiwan's request to buy new weapons, including the destroyers,
submarines and anti-submarine aircraft, in order to avoid angering
China, which views Taiwan as a rebellious province.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing bitterly resents the U.S. military relationship with
Taiwan. Diplomatically, the United States deals with Taiwan
carefully, avoiding any suggestion it is promoting independence for
the island.
</P>
<P>
   In Taipei, Taiwan's military spokesman, Kung Fan-ding, said
Taiwan wants ''to acquire any weapons that would help build up its
anti-missile defense.'' He declined to comment specifically on the
U.S. weapons sale until there was an official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the long-range radar, known as PAVE PAWS, the weapons
package approved by the president will include new missiles,
training and help in integrating $18 billion worth of weapons
already sold to Taiwan, one of the officials told The Associated
Press, insisting on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He called it a robust package and said Clinton had deferred sale
of the destroyers and other items, not permanently canceled the
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Helms reacted angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is, quite simply, no military justification to deny
Taiwan these crucial defensive items. These denials are driven by
knee-jerk appeasement on the part of the White House and State
Department,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A showdown between the White House and Congress could develop
over legislation backed by Taiwan supporters to strengthen
U.S.-Taiwanese military ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The politicized handling of Taiwan's defense request -- and the
utter failure of this administration to consult with Congress -- is
a clear demonstration why the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act is so
urgently needed,'' Helms continued.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said they would recommend a
presidential veto if Congress tries to force the sale of arms to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Lott took steps last week to push the bill to a floor vote by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he issued a terse statement saying ''until more
details are known and a final announcement is made by the
administration I will have no further comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., immediately imposed a ''hold'' on the
measure that under Senate tradition could, in effect, block Lott's
efforts -- at least for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus is a leader in a drive to grant China permanent trade
benefits -- an administration effort that also could be hurt by
Clinton's arms sale decision.
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive Taiwanese lobbying effort sought to persuade the
administration to sell the Aegis warships, with price tags of $1
billion apiece, to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   For years, analysts have said Taiwan's military, with its highly
motivated troops and advanced U.S.-made weapons, could repel or at
least bloody any People's Liberation Army force if China made good
repeated threats to attack the island.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, some military analysts have began doubting the
Taiwanese war readiness.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Win Boston Marathon  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Trying to lose weight? Forget about the Scarsdale
Diet or the ones pitched by Nathan Pritikin, Oprah Winfrey and
Jenny Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's Elijah Lagat has results to put those to shame. He lost
33 pounds and then won the Boston Marathon, just seven years after
his doctor told him to start exercising or maybe die.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not an athlete. I was fat,'' he said Monday in a
testimonial that seemed more appropriate for a Richard Simmons
video than a Boston Marathon winner's news conference. ''One time I
got sick and I went to the doctor. The doctor told me to do some
exercise to cut down my weight.''
</P>
<P>
   It being Kenya, where road racing is a national sport, Lagat
began to run. From a high of 158 pounds at his doctor's appointment
in late 1992, when he was having difficulty breathing and an
erratic pulse, he dropped to 125 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not doing it to be an athlete. In the process of trying
to compete just for fun, I found that I was doing well,'' he said.
''Before the end of the year, I found that I was doing well. ...
Surely, it was the doctor who told me to run.''
</P>
<P>
   No one needed to tell Lagat what to do on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Staying with the lead pack through a race slowed by a 13 mph
headwind, Lagat came into the final stretch locked in a dramatic
duel with training partner Moses Tanui and Ethiopia's Gezahenge
Abera.
</P>
<P>
   The lead went back and forth before Tanui made his surge with
200 yards to go. But Tanui, a two-time Boston winner, tired as
Lagat began his sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody gets to make a mistake, and that was my mistake,''
Tanui said. ''I felt strong at the end, but I was too nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   In the closest finish in the race's 104-year history, Lagat and
Abera clocked the same time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, 47 seconds, with
Tanui three seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   ''After I saw Moses leaving, I was trying to fight for the
second position. But I found that I was moving closer to Moses,''
Lagat said. ''Then I started to sprint to the maximum that I could
make, and that's how I managed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was an unprecedented 10th in a row for Kenya. The
women's race was also the closest in history, with Catherine
Ndereba winning in 2:26:11, three seconds ahead of Kyrgyzstan's
Irina Bogacheva and Ethiopia's Fatuma Roba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good, and I think everyone in my country is feeling the
same way,'' said Ndereba, the first Kenyan woman to win.
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba, sixth in her Boston debut last year and then second in
New York, was not among the leaders early, but caught Roba about
21.7 miles into the race.
</P>
<P>
   They ran together until the final mile before Ndereba bolted
ahead. Roba soon lost her hold on second place, too, as the
38-year-old Bogacheva made a final lunge at the tape to take second
place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trying to make history and concentrating on my lead,''
said Roba, who was thwarted in her attempt to become the first
runner -- male or female -- to win four consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   The winners earned $80,000 each from the total purse of
$525,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Driscoll won the women's wheelchair race, securing an
unprecedented eighth laurel wreath in a time of 2:00:53. Franz
Nietlispach of Switzerland won his fifth wheelchair race and his
fourth in a row, in 1:33:32, with a gap of more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, of Champaign, Ill., surpassed Clarence DeMar, who won
the men's open division seven times from 1911-1930. She won by 23
seconds over Australia's Louise Sauvage, who snapped Driscoll's
seven-race win streak in 1997 and beat her in the next two years,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time coming,'' Driscoll said. ''I dreamed
about No. 8 for so long.''

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Ndereba Wins Close Race  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Catherine Ndereba became a marathon runner because
she had admired the accomplishments of her Kenyan compatriot Tegla
Loroupe, the world record-holder.
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba has not yet matched Loroupe's feats, but she has done
something that Loroupe never has: win the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Ndereba, who trains with a group of Kenyans in
Norristown, Pa., probably earned a berth on the Kenyan women's
Olympic marathon team, alongside Loroupe and Joyce Chepchemba, the
1-3 finishers at Sunday's London Marathon, with her first marathon
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In winning, Ndereba foiled Fatuma Roba's bid to become the first
male or female to win four consecutive titles at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on adding Ndereba to the team will not be made
until next week, but she is confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they will take me,'' she said Monday, after winning at
Boston in 2 hours, 26 minutes, 11 seconds -- 16 seconds ahead of
Irina Bogacheva of Kyrgyzstan and Roba, who had the same time
(2:26:27). ''I ran on a hard course and I won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory over the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, Roba, was
another plus for Ndereba, who before making her marathon debut at
Boston last year was known as ''Catherine The Great,'' for her
achievements in shorter road races.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 1998 and 1999, Ndereba was chosen the women's road
racer of the year and ranked the No. 1 road racer in the world.
Last year, she had the fastest times in the world for 5 kilometers,
12K, 15K and 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Her marathon debut was not spectacular, but she showed great
promise, finishing a respectable sixth in 2:28:27. She improved
rapidly, placing second in the New York City Marathon in November
in 2:27:34.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tegla is very famous in our country,'' Ndereba said. ''I just
wanted to see if I could be like her. Even if I am not exactly like
her now, I am in the process of being like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba admitted she did not think she would win Monday,
especially against an experienced runner like Roba and not after
feeling severe pain in her left ankle. Still, she had hoped to run
2:24.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to beat a thrice champion,'' she said. ''To win
for three years is not a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba said she began feeling the pain when she was warming up
for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought maybe it was tension,'' she said. ''It was hurting a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba said she was in agony throughout the race and in the
worst pain at about the 19-mile mark, where she was going downhill.
She wouldn't stop, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a saying in training that if you have pain, you can't
have fear,'' Ndereba said. ''I said, 'I just want to finish the
race.' It's too hard when you run all those miles and you don't see
the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba caught the frontrunning Roba near the 21.7-mile point
and exchanged the lead with her several times over the next 3{
miles. Then, Ndereba used the speed sharpened from running the
shorter distances to burst ahead. Roba couldn't match her move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not worried, because I always have confidence in my
kick,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she crossed the finish line, Ndereba was hurting and
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I finished, I could not walk without pain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the Kenyan national anthem was played, she broke into
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprisied to win in Boston,'' Ndereba said. ''I was
very happy and I was overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a feeling Loroupe often has experienced.

<HEADLINE> IOC Plans Internet Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The Internet revolution is forcing
the International Olympic Committee to re-examine the way the games
are shown to the world.
</P>
<P>
   After grappling for two years with how to deal with the world
wide web, the IOC announced Monday it plans to organize a summit
meeting in November on the role of the Internet and other new media
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the committee and
other sports bodies must find a way to keep pace with the rapidly
changing world of on-line media technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment, we are lost,'' Samaranch said. ''We are worried
what can happen in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people -- including representatives of the IOC,
international sports federations, news organizations and Internet
companies -- will be invited to the Nov. 16-17 ''New Media and
Sport'' conference in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the conference was finalized at a meeting of IOC
officials Monday and is expected to be formally approved by the IOC
executive board this week.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Dick Pound, who negotiates the organization's
major television and sponsorship deals, said the conference will
help the IOC develop its own long-term Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a business that reinvents itself every six months,''
Pound said. ''You have to be careful before taking the plunge.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has its own Web site, as do the organizing commmittees
of the 2000 Sydney Olympics and other future games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC currently prohibits the showing of moving images from
the games on the Internet. But that might change before long.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is seeking to maximize its potential revenue from the
World Wide Web, including the possible sale of Internet rights,
while protecting its exclusive television partners.
</P>
<P>
   NBC paid $3.5 billion for exclusive U.S. television rights to
five Olympics from 2000 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very interested to see what happens after 2008,''
Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   The November conference will be the second world summit
organized by the IOC in two years. In February 1999, the IOC held a
world anti-doping conference in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern to the IOC are preparations for the
Sydney Games, which begin Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers were to present their latest progress report
to the IOC executive board Tuesday, amid continuing reports of
troubles: from ticketing controversies to labor disputes to budget
problems to threats of violent protests by Aboriginals.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said Sydney's problems have been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reading the local media and listening to local politicians --
assuming you have the stomach or patience for either -- you might be
forgiven for thinking we have serious problems, that sponsors are
pulling out, that the organizing committee is in disarray, that we
are facing serious financial problems,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing could be further from the truth. We are set for one of
the most spectacular Olympic Games we have ever seen. The Sydney
organizers are further ahead, and have a better handle on the
issues than any previous Olympic organizing committee.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues during the three-day board meeting:
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC might consider East Timor's request to participate in
the Sydney Games. The former Indonesian province, which voted for
independence last year and is under United Nations administration,
does not fulfill the criteria for Olympic recognition. But some
officials would like to find a way for East Timor to be
represented, at least symbolically, in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC will review the work of the new World Anti-Doping
Agency, including plans to conduct 2,500 out-of-competition drug
tests before the Sydney Games, and assess the continuing research
into developing a reliable test for the banned hormone EPO.
</P>
<P>
   --Organizers of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City will
report to the IOC board by video conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   --The IOC board will meet with leaders of the Olympic winter and
summer sports federations. The 27 summer sports are expected to
decide how they will split up more than $100 million in television
revenues from the Syndey Games.

<HEADLINE> Tewell Notches First Senior Tour Win  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- Doug Tewell doesn't care that
his first senior tour win -- and his first major -- came at the
rain-shortened PGA Seniors' Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The on-again, off-again event that had seven weather delays and
more than nine inches of rain in four days was the first Seniors'
Championship to be shortened since the tournament expanded to 72
holes in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ''A win's a win,'' Tewell said.
</P>
<P>
   Tewell, playing in his first Seniors' Championship, shot a
5-under-par 67 Monday and finished seven strokes ahead of four
others. He became the 12th golfer to win his first senior event at
a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Tewell finished at 15-under 201, making six
birdies and a bogey during the final round. It was his first win
since the 1987 Pensacola Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd have to rank this as the biggest victory of my career,''
said Tewell, whose win earned him $324,000. ''It just means a great
deal to win. It just feels good to get in that winner's circle and
know you can complete an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Quigley, who started the day one stroke behind Tewell, shot
1 over and finished in a four-way tie for second at 8 under with
Hale Irwin, Tom Kite and Larry Nelson. Vicente Fernandez and Hubert
Green were 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even beyond my 'A' game, I don't know if I would have caught
him today,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   Tewell hit 13 of 14 fairways and 14 of 18 greens in regulation.
He became the seventh wire-to-wire winner at this event since 1958
and first since Jack Nicklaus in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A former club pro at Pinetop Country Club in Arizona who spent
three years as a television commentator for The Golf Channel,
Tewell made his debut on the senior tour last fall. He missed the
first five tournaments with a back injury he sustained the day
after his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He initially feared he had ruptured a disc in his back, but it
turned out to be an acute sciatica attack. The injury came two days
before he was scheduled to leave for his first senior tournament
event, in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering from the injury, Tewell's best finish last year was a
tie for 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't physically prepared. It just hurt to play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was forced to play, trying for a high position on the
money list and exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   A four-time winner on the PGA Tour, he has much higher
expectations for 2000, especially after his first win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to be kind of anxious now to see what this amount of
confidence does for me,'' Tewell said. ''I want to see if this will
get me to that level where I feel like I should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe it will.
</P>
<P>
   ''He plays very well from tee to green,'' Kite said. ''His
bugaboo has been an inconsistent putter. Depending on how well he
can get his putting, he can win a bunch of them.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Irwin, who won three consecutive Seniors' Championships
(1996-98), finished the tournament despite initially saying he
would not have been able to compete on Monday because of a
commitment to a charity event. ... After a quadruple bogey at the
par-4 No. 11 on Sunday, Quigley carded a 4 at the course's toughest
hole Monday. ... Nicklaus said he will not play another senior
event until the U.S. Senior Open. ... Leonard Thompson, even par as
he approached the par-3 No. 15, hit four shots into the water en
route to an 11, the first double-digit score of the tournament. His
fifth shot stopped on the fringe and he two-putted from there.
Thompson started the day at 4 under, but shot a 13-over 85 in the
final round. Said Kite, one of his playing partners: ''It was
painful to watch.'' ... The tournament, one of four majors on the
tour, was sponsored by Advil.

<HEADLINE> Leafs' Goalie Joseph Loses Cool  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph saw the puck
and couldn't get it. Then he lost control.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa forward Rob Zamuner scored what proved to be the winning
goal Monday night in the Senators' 4-3 victory over the Maple
Leafs. Ottawa cut Toronto's lead to 2-1 in the first-round Eastern
Conference playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph claimed interference, saying that Daniel Alfredsson
prevented him from getting to the puck he saw sliding into the net.
Joseph then stormed out of the net and after referee Mick McGeough.
</P>
<P>
   The two tumbled to the ice and Joseph was given a misconduct
with 5:43 remaining in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I was clearly interfered with,'' Joseph said. ''I could
see the puck but I couldn't get my leg over there. I didn't like
the way I reacted but it's an emotional game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I eventually ended up with one leg in the net. There was
contact. That's part of the game, but when it leads to the
game-winning goal, that's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson was checked into the net by defenseman Cory Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened so fast,'' Cross said. ''Alfredsson was going for
the net. I think somehow he interfered with Curtis. I'm not sure
how. It looked like maybe his leg went out. I was making sure he
was outside the crease.''
</P>
<P>
   The goalie was surprised when the possibility that he went after
McGeough was raised. Intentional contact with an official carries
an automatic three-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was going to do anything to the referee, which I would
never do, I wouldn't slide into him and let him fall on me,''
Joseph said. ''I lost an edge and let him land on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson didn't agree with Joseph's assessment of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it was anything unfair,'' Alfredsson said. ''I
got my foot out a bit, but he (Cross) kept pushing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto captain Mats Sundin took the situation in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cujo is one of the best competitors I know. Sure he gets
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph had no problem with his composure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate,'' he said. ''It was frustrating that I could
see the puck but couldn't save it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll get over it. We'll all get over it.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ad Sparks National Pride  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A Canadian everyman stands before a maple leaf
flag and rants about igloos, blubber and hockey -- a formula that
has tapped Canada's patriotism and turned a beer commercial into a
national sensation.
</P>
<P>
   The ad has sparked standing ovations in movie theaters and
hockey arenas, along with front-page newspaper coverage, by pumping
Canadians' pride over what distinguishes them from the rest of the
world -- especially their neighbors to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ''The Rant,'' the ad that began running a month ago
features a tousle-haired young man in a lumberjack shirt and jeans
-- dubbed Joe Canadian by the ad's creators.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with Joe standing on a stage in front of a huge screen
filled with the red maple leaf of the national flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a lumberjack, or fur trader,'' he begins, almost
shyly. ''I don't live in an igloo, eat blubber or own a dog sled.''
</P>
<P>
   With each pronouncement, the backdrop flashes a matching image --
Canadian backwoodsmen, an igloo, a man eating blubber, a dog sled.
Joe's voice rises with conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a prime minister, not a president. I speak English and
French, not American, and I pronounce it 'about,' not 'a-boot,' ''
he says, a picture of a large rubber wading boot behind him. ''I
believe in peacekeeping, not policing; diversity, not assimilation;
and that the beaver is a proud and noble animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe is now shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Canada's the second-largest land mass, the first nation of
hockey and the best part of North America,'' he concludes, arms
raised in triumph. ''My name is Joe and I am Canadian!''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly resuming his quiet demeanor, he offers a humble ''thank
you'' and is gone.
</P>
<P>
   To Canadians, the character touches a national nerve by setting
straight the rest of the world, particularly the bigger and bossy
neighbor to the south -- not 'sooth,' as the stereotype of a
Canadian accent would have it -- about their country and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of an educational thing, telling Americans what we
are and what we aren't,'' said Glen Hunt, the 35-year-old
advertising executive for Bensimon Byrne D'Arcy who wrote the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a little Joe in all of us, who want to stand up and
say Canada's a great place, let's talk about it,'' said Hunt, who
lived in New York for three years and heard his share of jokes
about Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the media hubbub is the product being advertised
-- Molson Canadian beer. Brett Marchand, the Molson Canadian
marketing vice president, said Bensimon Byrne D'Arcy won the
account by encouraging the brewer to return to the ''I am
Canadian'' theme of a previous campaign that ran from 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt got the idea when talking to young beer drinkers -- Molson's
target market -- before pitching for the lucrative account last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they started talking about Canada, they were pretty low
key at first but it was almost like a dormant volcano,'' he said of
the mostly mid-20s males. ''People got very excited and very
patriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   The themes of the spot -- beer, hockey, multiculturalism, the
environment -- are prime elements of what Hunt called Canada's
''patriotic DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   To Marchand, the theme appeals particularly to young Canadians
who have more exposure to the world than previous generations
through the Internet, cable and satellite television, and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's what makes them feel this really is a terrific
place to live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ad first appeared in movie theaters in March, and audience
response was immediate, he said. It began airing on television with
the Academy Awards show on March 26, and now has been performed
live in theaters and hockey arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The success surprised Jeff Douglas, the 28-year-old actor who
portrays Joe Canadian. He received a standing ovation after doing
the commercial live at the Air Canada Center between periods of the
Toronto-Ottawa Stanley Cup playoff game Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing has taken on a life of its own,'' Douglas later
told The Toronto Star. ''I don't think this is anything that a lot
of people haven't already thought or said themselves. It's a very
Canadian thing, the quiet pride we have, but once in a while, it's
nice to wave the flag.''

<HEADLINE> Sharks 2, Blues 1  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Sharks finally turned their
home ice into an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan scored twice and the Sharks broke a four-game home
losing streak in the playoffs, defeating the top-seeded St. Louis
Blues 2-1 Monday night to take a 2-1 lead in their first-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, who did not qualify for the playoffs until the final
week of the season and who went 0-4-1 against St. Louis during the
regular season, have won the last two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 of the best-of-7 series is Wednesday at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, who got their only goal from Scott Young, had the
NHL's best record during the regular season and went a league-best
27-10-4 on the road this season. But St. Louis never led Monday
night, despite outshooting the Sharks 32-22.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan scored the deciding goal 4:40 into the third period. Mike
Rathje's shot from the slot was stopped by goalie Roman Turek, but
Nolan got to the loose puck and skated around the prone Turek
before sliding the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Shields, who made 31 saves for the Sharks, made three
saves in the final minute -- including one of an Al MacInnis slap
shot from just inside the blue line. Earlier in the third, he made
a glove save from close range against Young while the Blues were on
a power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks had not won at home in the playoffs since April 28,
1998. They lost all three of their home games in a first-round loss
to Colorado last year, and dropped their final home game the
previous year in a first-round loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams scored power-play goals in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan opened the scoring 5:39 in when his centering pass
deflected off the leg of St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger and
past Turek while the Sharks skated with a 5-on-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger helped the Blues tie it with 4:46 remaining in the
period. Pronger's shot rebounded to Young, whose drive from a sharp
angle got past Shields.

<HEADLINE> White House Predicts China Passage  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is shaking off House
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt's decision to oppose normalized
trade relations with China, predicting the bill will have the votes
to pass once the administration makes its case to the party's
rank-and-file lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Republicans are expected to support the bill by a
comfortable margin next month, and White House spokesman Jake
Siewart noted Monday night that Gephardt intended to ''let
Democrats in the caucus vote on this up or down on the merits. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that given a chance to explain the merits of this
deal to the Democratic caucus, that we'll secure enough support to
approve the agreement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt is expected to announce his decision formally on
Wednesday in a speech in St. Louis, but Democrats familiar with his
decision said Monday night he already had informed the White House
of his planned opposition. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a politically perilous one for Gephardt and the
Democrats, who are waging a strenuous battle to win back the House
in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is fighting the trade bill, fearing the loss of
jobs. Business groups, eager to open up an enormous new market, are
strongly for it. That sets up a potentially dangerous vote for
Democratic lawmakers from swing districts, who might customarily
rely on backing from the AFL-CIO to win difficult re-election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gephardt's leadership, Democrats also have made a strong
effort to raise campaign donations from business leaders,
particularly the high-tech industry, without weakening their
traditional ties to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has been a critic of other trade bills in the past,
arguing they didn't do enough to protect against the loss of
domestic jobs or prevent environmental damage overseas. As a
result, anything other than opposition by Gephardt to the China
measure would have come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, for
example, although it passed with a coalition of GOP and Democratic
votes. A few years later, he led the opposition to a measure to
strengthen presidential authority in negotiating trade deals
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, Congress has reserved the right to make an
annual decision on whether to extend trading rights to the Chinese
that are currently extended to almost every U.S. trading partner.
The pending legislation would put an end to that practice in favor
of a permanent grant.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader is expected to argue the measure is not
strong enough to justify surrendering the potential for the United
States to influence China's policies on human rights, the
environment and other areas, according to Democrats who are
familiar with his plans.
</P>
<P>
   His decision puts him at odds with President Clinton; the two
major party presidential nominees for the fall election, Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush; and the senior GOP
leadership in the House, including Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the legislation, though, Gephardt would side with
the majority of his own Democratic caucus, as well as virtually the
entire House Democratic leadership and organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that while Gephardt intends to announce his
opposition to the measure, he is not expected to join in a
full-fledged effort to defeat it, a campaign being led in the House
by the Democratic whip, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan. Rather, the
Missouri lawmaker likely will explain his position to fellow
Democrats, and continue to urge the members of the rank-and-file to
come to their own decision, this official added.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, Gephardt emphasized support for several
items on the high-tech industry's agenda, but sidestepped the issue
of trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand your concerns,'' he told a business group late
last month. But he added that any legislation must provide ''the
right incentives for China to move toward the rule of law, to
protect both personal and property rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, R-Ill., recently announced a vote would be held on the
bill the week of May 22. That was widely seen as a concession to
Clinton and an enticement to wavering Democrats, who had feared
that the GOP leadership would maneuver to postpone the roll call
until closer to the fall elections, when the political danger to
Democrats could be greater.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., a supporter of the
bill, recently predicted that as many as 70 or 80 Democrats would
wind up backing the measure.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates as many as 150 Republicans out of 222 in the
House will vote for the measure.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 101, Warriors 96  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Terrell Brandon scored 21 points as the
Minnesota Timberwolves rallied from a 15-point deficit and then
blew a 12-point fourth-quarter lead before beating the Golden State
Warriors 101-96 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Peeler scored all seven of his points in the fourth
quarter, including a crucial three-point play. Joe Smith had 14
points and Malik Sealy and Kevin Garnett added 13 apiece for the
playoff-bound Timberwolves, who won their 50th game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes had 33 points to lead Golden State, which will
match a team record for losses in a season (63) if it drops its
season finale Wednesday night against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis added 13 points and Vonteego Cummings had 12 for the
Warriors, who lost three of their four meetings with Minnesota this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 15 late in the second quarter and down five at
halftime, the Timberwolves surged in front with a 16-4 flurry to
start the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon hit a 12-foot jumper to get Minnesota started and Wally
Szczerbiak made a pair of key baskets to keep the run going,
including a breakaway dunk that gave the Timberwolves a 56-51 lead
with 6:47 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon finished the third with a 3-pointer and driving layup,
giving Minnesota a 78-69 lead, and Smith had consecutive putbacks
that put the Timberwolves up 84-72 with 8:54 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Golden State's turn to rally as Cummings hit three
3-pointers as part of a 13-0 flurry over the next two minutes that
allowed the Warriors to go back in front 85-84 with 5:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler converted a three-point play to tie it at 91-all with
3:01 remaining, and Sealy's 6-foot hook shot with 1:06 left gave
Minnesota a 95-93 edge.
</P>
<P>
   After Hughes made a pair of free throws, another hook shoot by
Sealy put Minnesota back on top. Mookie Blaylock missed a long
jumper with 50 seconds to go and Smith put in a reverse layup for a
four-point cushion with 33 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors' next possession ended in a turnover when Peeler
stripped Cummings of the ball as he drove the lane. Peeler was
fouled and made both free throws to secure the milestone victory.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State led 28-17 after the first quarter and used a 10-2
run to open a 15-point edge late in the second quarter. Hughes
capped the flurry with two baskets in succession, including a dunk
that put the Warriors up 44-29 with 4:06 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   On the brink of getting blown out, the Timberwolves got back in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   William Avery hit consecutive 3-pointers and Minnesota outscored
the Warriors 13-3 to pull within 47-42 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota had never won more than 45 games before this
season. ... The Wolves have overcome double-digit deficits 10 times
this season. ... Minnesota improved to 27-9 against sub.-500 teams.
... The Warriors suited up only nine players because of injuries.
Hughes played the entire game. ... Golden State has lost 12 of its
last 14 meetings with Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stocks Rise and Fall  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares rose early today in line with Wall
Street's gains, but Tokyo prices soon fell again and rallies
elsewhere were subdued by worries that any recovery from the global
sell-off could prove fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average was off by 128.88 points, or
0.7 percent, at 18.879.76 points around midday, giving up gains of
as much as 1.7 percent from early morning dealings. The Nikkei had
lost 7 percent of its value on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The panicky mood that swept Asia a day earlier had eased after
prices rose later Monday in New York. But traders were more
cautious than optimistic after seeing shares take such huge hits in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa sought to calm
investors, saying today that his nation's economic recovery appears
healthy enough that the sharp plunge on the stock market should
have no impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the strength of Japan's recovery is quite strong, I'm
not that worried,'' Miyazawa told reporters. But Miyazawa added he
would be closely watching U.S. shares.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, where the blue chips had fallen 8.6 percent on
Monday, they came back today with a gain of 3.6 percent by midday.
The Hang Seng Index was up 530.16 points at 15,292.53.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong investors gathered around stock-quotation terminals in
local bank offices, anxiously watching the numbers flash.
</P>
<P>
   John Ho, a 50-year-old banker, said his losses came to $3,850 on
Monday -- but only on paper because he wasn't bailing out of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried,'' Ho said. ''The markets and the economies
all over the world are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Property analyst Stephen Cheung, 27, was worried about the
plunging value of high-tech companies he had bought into.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not happy, because I invested a lot in the tech stocks and
the surge in the stock market is not in my stocks,'' Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hardest-hit shares have been Internet companies that
recently soared to astounding heights, only to come crashing down
recently.
</P>
<P>
   And Jones, the economist in Tokyo, warned that the prospect of
higher interest rates could put a further damper on any renewed
stock rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all major central banks thinking about raising rates, or
raising them, that's a difficult environment for equity markets in
general,'' Jones said. ''It's hard to be too optimistic about the
outlook for stock markets around the world as long as central banks
are in this kind of mode.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index started today
with a gain of more than 8 percent but soon drifted lower,
eventually showing a gain of just 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean shares were hit particularly hard Monday with a
loss of 11.6 percent as red ink splashed through Asia's exchanges,
to be followed later by substantial but less painful losses in
major European markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the share price outlook -- at least for the short-term --
appeared brighter after Wall Street opened again Monday and
finished with some sizable gains. European stocks erased many of
their losses after New York prices moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 276.74 points to 10,582.51
on Monday, following its slide of 617.78 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Nasdaq composite index, a major barometer of the
so-called ''new economy'' high-tech companies, gained 217.87 points
to 3,589.16 in Monday's dealings, after a plunge of 355.49 points
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In other Asia-Pacific markets Tuesday, Australian shares were up
2.6 percent, Singaporean shares rose 2 percent and Taiwanese shares
closed with a gain of 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Putin Summit Topics Come Up  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will get a chance to pitch
for missile defense systems and a lighter Russian hand in Chechnya
when he meets at a Moscow summit with President Vladimir Putin in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   Close to three decades of U.S.-Russian cooperation to curb
nuclear weapons could be nearing an end despite last week's
ratification of the START II treaty by the Duma, the lower house of
the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is threatening to jettison all major arms-control accords
with the United States if the administration undercuts a 1972
treaty that bars development of anti-missile technology. Clinton is
nearing a decision to go ahead with a limited system and wants
Putin's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president, a career KGB official largely untested as
a politician, won election March 26 partly on a wave of public
approval of his war against rebels in Chechnya. That has not ended
the rebellion, however, and Clinton is sure to appeal to Putin to
engage in serious negotiations with Chechen leaders and to adopt a
kinder approach to the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Riding on Clinton's appeal is the certainty that Putin wants a
good relationship with the West. The Russian president has scored
some points with his early commitment to economic order and
currently, on his first trip west with a visit to Britain, with his
promise that Russia will not return to isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   The summit will be June 4-5 in Moscow as part of a Clinton trip
to Europe. The White House announced he would travel to Portugal
May 30-June 1 for a summit with leaders of the European Union; to
Aachen and Berlin, Germany, June 1-3; and from Moscow to Kiev,
Ukraine, June 6.
</P>
<P>
   In Aachen, the president will be awarded the Charlemagne Prize
for contributions to European unification and in Berlin will attend
with leaders of a dozen other countries a summit on ''third way''
politics hosted by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The idea is to
consider alternatives to the traditional liberal and conservative
approaches to government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton winds up his European journey in Ukraine with a meeting
with President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-missile question is sure to be an important part of the
Moscow meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Three former American negotiators said Monday the START II
agreement is imperiled by conservative Senate Republicans who want
to overturn the ban on missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also questioned whether the administration has a
strategy to implement the treaty's mutual cutbacks of about 50
percent in nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a game plan,'' ex-negotiator Thomas
Graham said at a news conference held by the private Arms Control
Association. ''They are thinking mostly about domestic politics and
electing the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also said proceeding with a limited defense against
missiles without green lights from Russia, the European allies and
China would amount to ''a recipe for rekindling the nuclear arms
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Keeny, the association's president, said it would be
the United States' advantage if the two countries carry out the
1993 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   While reducing U.S. and Russian stockpiles of long-range nuclear
weapons to 3,000 to 3,500 from current levels of about 6,000 each,
the treaty would ban Russia's land-based multiple-warhead SS-18
missiles, the most powerful weapon in the Russian arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Keeny, who held senior posts in the defunct U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, and Jack Mendelsohn, a former U.S.
negotiator on START II, said the administration must seek Senate
approval of various amendments to the 1993 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But trying for that, they said, would give conservative
Republicans a chance to scuttle the 1972 treaty banning missile
defenses. That landmark pact set the stage for cooperation between
the United States and the then-Soviet Union on reining in nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, U.S. and Russian negotiators began a round of talks
in Geneva to cut nuclear arsenals to 2,000 to 2,500 missiles, or
even fewer if Putin has his way.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Still Far From Peace  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAILAHUN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Former rebel fighters, whose group
indiscriminately killed and maimed tens of thousands during an
eight-year war merely to prove their power, now beg for food and
medicine in the town that was once their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Emaciated residents dressed in rags wander barefoot among
bombed-out buildings. The town's main hospital, looted long ago,
was abandoned until 150 U.N. peacekeepers from India arrived in
March and made it their base. Nearby houses are all destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is too much! Nobody ever comes here to help us. Take us out
of here!'' Alieu Kamara, a wounded former rebel, screamed to
journalists who made a rare visit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kamara writhed in pain on a mattress on the cement floor of
another crumbling, filthy building used as a makeshift hospital.
Worms protruded from his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one more sign of misery and decay in a place that
left the world behind.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers, part of a 6,500-member U.N. force that is
expected to receive 5,000 reinforcements by June, are trying to
safeguard the peace accord signed by Revolutionary United Front
rebels and Sierra Leone government officials last July.
</P>
<P>
   But peace is far from secure. Rebels still rape, rob and kill
defenseless villagers in many parts of the country, human rights
groups say.
</P>
<P>
   And many rebels have refused to disarm. Although the former
rebel fighters don't openly carry guns in Kailahun, U.N.
peacekeepers say their weapons are believed hidden not far away.
</P>
<P>
   Kailahun, a once-sleepy farming town 215 miles east of Freetown
near the eastern border with Liberia, was the nerve center of the
rebel holocaust. Since war began in 1991, the Revolutionary United
Front cruelly maimed civilians as they gained territory. Many
Sierra Leoneans bear the cruel scars of that macabre struggle -- the
rebels cut off lips, arms and legs and carved ''RUF'' in the skins
of their victims.
</P>
<P>
   From here, charismatic and unpredictable leader Foday Sankoh
directed his loosely organized bands of foot soldiers and expanded
a growing illicit trade in diamonds dug from crude mines nearby,
say aid organizations and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Kailahun, the town, returned to the bush.
</P>
<P>
   Contact with the outside world was severed. Outsiders were
killed or forced to become sex slaves or porters. Telephone and
power lines were vandalized for their valuable wire. Buildings were
destroyed from air raids by a West African intervention force
backing Sierra Leone's government.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges collapsed and trees sprouted up on roads that became
trails. The journalists who visited Monday came by U.N. helicopter.
Today, the only access to many neighboring towns and the nearby
Liberian and Guinean borders is by foot.
</P>
<P>
   Two unexploded bombs protrude like signposts from what was once
a main street.
</P>
<P>
   The people have also disappeared. U.N. officials estimated only
one-tenth of Kailahun's 15,000 former residents were in the town in
April, including several hundred rebel fighters and their families
and an equal number of refugees who straggled back since the
peacekeepers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Many who fled still live in the surrounding forests or in
Liberia or Guinea. Rebels routinely fleece returning refugees of
their meager belongings, U.N. officers said.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Kailahun survive by growing tiny plots of cassava,
peanuts, vegetables and maize corn. Basic foods like salt, sugar,
flour and oil have not been seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people are crying for food and good drinking water,'' said
Indian Maj. Sunil Nair. ''Aid groups have come to check out the
situation but so far none have set up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Isata Momoh, a local nursing assistant who remained with the
rebels during the war, said most of the babies suffer from
dysentery and malnourishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are using one needle to inject 10 children with drugs
before we sterilize it. We don't have enough antiseptic or
syringes,'' Momoh said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamara, the wounded former rebel, and his sister, Adama Kargbo,
complained angrily that they had been abandoned by both the
international community and their own rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh and his deputies have taken up positions in Sierra
Leone's government under the peace deal. All other rebels have been
given amnesty for their atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been told the war is over but nobody comes to help
us,'' Kargbo said. ''It is time that Foday Sankoh focuses his
attention on us. We are his people.''

Chicago Janitors Win New Contract
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Thousands of janitors who staged a 24-hour walkout Monday
agreed to return to work after settling on a three-year deal with pay increases
and improved benefits. The janitors, who work in the city's downtown offices,
were due to return to work on Tuesday. The janitors' contract expired at
midnight Sunday. The contract was negotiated as thousands of members of Local 1
of the Service Employees International Union picketed office buildings. When the
tentative agreement was reached with the Building Owners and Managers
Association, union negotiators read details to those rallying outside. They
roared their approval.

U.S. Won't Allow Taiwan Destroyer Sale
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's decision to shelve Taiwan's request to
buy four billion-dollar U.S. destroyers is likely to touch off a fight with
Congress, where support for the island is strong. The Senate Republican leader,
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, is expected to call for a vote on an arms
package for Taiwan, and the White House already is warning that could lead to a
Clinton veto if Lott gets enough votes to pass it. At issue is how much the
United States is willing to do to protect Taiwan from mainland China and thereby
antagonize the Communist leaders in Beijing.

High Court Expands Passengers' Rights

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers must

if drugs might be inside. The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border
Patrol agent who felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment ban on unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to contain
drugs. The ruling expands public transit passengers' privacy rights, but the
National Association of Police Organizations said it was disappointed by the
ruling.

IMF Protesters Disrupt Capital

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demonstrators disrupted the workday in much of the

of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About 600 people were
arrested Monday, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the protests began.
The protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor
nations, destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of other ills. World
Bank spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the meetings felt
''bewilderment and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She said the
officials were talking about ways to relieve poverty.

Cuban Americans Await Elian's Fate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- On the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Cuban
Americans in Miami stood watch at the home where Elian Gonzalez's relatives
waited for a key ruling in the custody fight. Protesters recalled the deadly
attempt on April 17, 1961, in which CIA-trained exiles failed to invade Cuba.
Their criticism was extended to the Clinton administration, which wants the
6-year-old Cuban boy returned to his Cuban father. The boy's Miami relatives say
he will have a better life here. Both sides were awaiting a ruling from the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The government wants the court to lift
an order that bars Elian's removal from the United States and to order Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to release the boy.

attributed to ''market conditions,'' came following last week's tech stock

<HEADLINE> Army To Examine Officer Exodus  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too many young Army officers are leaving the
service and officials want to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   Army Secretary Louis Caldera and Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the
chief of staff, have ordered two study panels to look at why
captains and other officers don't stay and suggest ways to keep
them, the Army said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The panels will include service people of all ranks as well as
academics and corporate experts. It is to begin work next month and
come up with recommendations in August.
</P>
<P>
   Retaining officers, particularly junior officers such as
captains, has been getting more difficult during the last several
years. For example, Lt. Col. Russ Oaks, an Army spokesman, said 6.4
percent of the force's captains left in 1988, while more that 10
percent left in each of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials already have begun collecting data for the study
panels, including some ''very rank, very raw, very
right-between-the eyes comments'' from officers on midcareer
postings at the Command and General Staff College in Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., said Lt. Col. Ben Santos, an installation
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 officers discussed the problem last month in 64
faculty-led discussions at the college. They said officers
mistrusted senior leaders; didn't like the shift to peacekeeping,
humanitarian and other missions; preferred civilian jobs in the
expanding economy; had spouses unhappy with the long absences and
frequent moves of military life.
</P>
<P>
   The groups, mostly majors and some lieutenant colonels, were
asked a range of questions, including what might be making so many
officers leave. The idea for the panel came up in February, the
discussions were held in March and then students were asked to
bring back comments from fellow students as well, Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't unsolicited, a bunch of officers sitting around
and whining about the Army,'' said Santos, but rather were
collected for use by the new panels. However, he added that the
comments amount to raw material until they can be correlated with
other information and surveys the panels might want to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials who declined to be identified said some of the
comments were so negative and startling that 16 of the 64 group
summaries, which were meant only for internal panel use, have made
their way into e-mails that have been bouncing around the military
for about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Students who came up with the comments in March are taking a
7-week course beginning this week in which they will analyze the
comments and forward recommendations to the panel on leadership,
Santos said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Celebrations Canceled  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- As Zimbabwe celebrates 20 years of
independence from Britain today, there will be no military parades,
no tribal dancing, no sports displays.
</P>
<P>
   With the country suffering from its worst economic crisis and
the violent occupations of white-owned farms, those celebrations
have been canceled. Instead, President Robert Mugabe will make a
televised address to the nation, a speech many hope will sort out
the government's confusing messages on national policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mugabe abruptly summoned white farm leaders to his
office and promised to personally intervene to ''to get things back
to normality'' on the white-owned farms, said Tim Henwood, head of
the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The official state news agency confirmed Mugabe's first meeting
with farm union officials since the occupations began two months
ago. But government officials declined to comment on the talks, and
it was unclear whether Mugabe's reported promise marked a reversal
of his support for the thousands of armed black squatters who have
occupied more than 900 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Mugabe has backed the occupations as a justified
protest against unequal distribution of land in a country where
4,000 white farmers own one-third of the productive farmland. On
Sunday, he insisted he would not order supporters to vacate the
farms and urged them to defend themselves from opponents and ''hit
back wildly.''
</P>
<P>
   That speech came hours after the killing of farmer David
Stevens, a supporter of the Movement for Democratic Change, the
main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   The state news agency reported that police were searching for
suspects in Stevens' killing and the beatings of five other white
farmers. The other farmers had been abducted Saturday from a police
station near the Macheke farming district, 75 miles east of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Henwood said the president expressed regret over Stevens' death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps the death of David Stevens has been a final catalyst
to get some activity to restore law and order in our country,''
Henwood said. ''There's been a major change. I have every assurance
from the highest voice in the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence Saturday, including the killing of two black
opposition party officials in a firebomb attack, escalated the
crisis. About 80 farmers and their families evacuated from the
Macheke district said Monday they would not return until their
safety was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The land occupations began Feb. 16, the day after the government
suffered a crushing electoral defeat in a constitutional
referendum. Part of the rejected constitution would have let the
government seize white-owned farms without paying compensation, a
law ruling party legislators passed anyway on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said Mugabe planned the occupations as a
political ploy to rally support for his party ahead of
parliamentary elections expected to be held in May. David Hasluck,
a senior farmers' union official, said the union has evidence that
a top Mugabe aide, Provincial Gov. Border Gezi, toured northern
Zimbabwe arranging for supporters to move onto white-owned land
after the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kay, whose husband, Ian, was one of the farmers bludgeoned
by abductors, said his assailants openly boasted of their
allegiance to the ruling party. Her husband was targeted as an
outspoken opposition supporter, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it canceled the anniversary celebrations to
save money that will instead be used to help victims of recent
floods in southern and eastern Zimbabwe. However, it is widely
believed that Mugabe called off the festivities because of fears of
tiny crowds, political protests or violence.

<HEADLINE> World Finance Protest Large in Scope  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the shared cause was to stop a war or
demand an end to racial segregation, Washington demonstrators of
the past marched in step and in far greater numbers than those who
tried to disrupt the world finance conferences. They shut down part
of the government and part of the Capital, but not the meetings
they tried to stop.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed success anyhow, saying they had focused attention
on the lending practices of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund, and on the globalization they contend is damaging
Third World economies.
</P>
<P>
   While they couldn't block the finance meetings, they did force a
partial, one-day shutdown of federal agencies in a police-declared
protest zone for blocks around the White House. The protests
snarled traffic, shut city streets and shuttered businesses and
restaurants on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There were sporadic clashes between police and protesters,
bursts of pepper spray and one of tear gas. But generally, it was
only a matter of noise and streets, barricaded by police lines near
the World Bank, blocked by protesters across those lines.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were relatively small, hundreds of demonstrators
massed at the standoff line four blocks from the White House, a few
thousand in the streets and parks nearby. About 400 demonstrators
had themselves arrested politely to underline their grievances late
Monday. Police obliged them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have shined the light on these institutions as never before
in this country,'' said Robert Weissman of Essential Action,
calling the protests a total success.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators blame the global lenders for problems from
environmental damage to sweatshop labor. But they came for causes
ranging far beyond those complaints: for animal rights, against
nuclear weapons, for District of Columbia statehood, against
sending Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba, for more AIDS research. At the
blockaded intersection on Monday, what they wanted seemed to depend
on who was chanting loudest.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do we want?'' a young woman called. ''Justice,'' the
crowd replied.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the street crowd was singing the anthem of
the civil rights movement, ''We Shall Overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a debt forgiveness chant.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of messages, and the globalization complaints only
economists could fully explain, contrasted with single-minded
objectives of massive Washington marches over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   These demonstrations drew only a fraction of the numbers that
were drawn to those prior protests.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there were about 10,000 demonstrators on Sunday;
protest organizers claimed many more. But even they conceded that
the numbers melted amid downpours on Monday, to about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The era of massive Washington marches began on Aug. 28, 1963,
when 200,000 to 250,000 people, black and white, paraded peacefully
from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial for the cause
of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a dream,'' the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. told them of
his vision of racial equality, and gave voice to a movement. At the
time, that turnout was a record.
</P>
<P>
   It was orderly. The only four arrests were of violent opponents
of the civil rights cause.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-war demonstrations began later in the 1960s; at least
55,000 protesters besieged the Pentagon in 1967, a police estimate
disputed by organizers, who said there were 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 people marched against the war in Vietnam on
Nov. 15, 1969. That was the crowd estimate at the time. It later
was increased, based on photo counts stirred by the complaints of
organizers, to 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam protesters paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue, past a
White House barricaded by 57 city buses parked bumper to bumper.
Inside, President Nixon let it be known that he was watching a
college football game.
</P>
<P>
   There were violent confrontations and bursts of tear gas near
the South Vietnamese Embassy and outside the Justice Department.
But the march itself was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Those marches were marker events, the one, of the growing
momentum of the civil rights movement -- President John F. Kennedy
met with its leaders at the White House that day in 1963 -- the
other, of the gnawing opposition that divided Americans until the
Vietnam War finally ended with U.S. withdrawal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   They have been outdrawn since. There have been mass marches for
and against abortion rights, for gasoline rights, for organized
labor. After the Park Service estimated that Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March in 1995 drew 400,000 people, he
accused the agency of racism.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Park Service stopped issuing estimates, to stay
out of numbers disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of Washington crowds weren't here to protest. They
have turned out for presidential inaugurations, parades and
celebrations. More than 1 million people came to the bicentennial
fireworks on the Fourth of July in 1976.

<HEADLINE> John Rocker Returns To Braves  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- While the Atlanta Braves might not agree with
John Rocker's views on society, they clearly missed him on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, suspended the first two weeks of the season for
offending foreigners, minorities and gays, rejoins the roster
tonight against the Philadelphia Phillies, hoping to bolster a
bullpen that struggled during his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try not to worry about all the other stuff that's going to
arise from Rock coming back,'' fellow reliever Mike Remlinger said.
''He's going to be a big help to us, because we haven't had the
April we wanted to have yet. He'll be a big part of turning it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' bullpen went 1-4 with a 5.14 ERA and two blown saves
while Rocker was suspended. Former closer Kerry Ligtenberg, coming
back from a serious elbow injury, has two saves, but a 10.13 ERA.
Remlinger has three saves, but is more comfortable in a set-up
role.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox has no qualms about giving Rocker his job back
after splitting 12 games without him. A year ago, the left-hander
had 38 saves -- second most in franchise history -- and struck out
104 in 72 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't avoid using him,'' Cox said. ''He's a talented
pitcher, and that's what this is really all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker drew mostly cheers when he pitched at Turner Field in an
exhibition game April 1, two days before opening day. No organized
protests were scheduled in conjunction with his return, although a
civil rights official once again called on the Braves to trade
Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a blemish on the Braves organization ... and, to a
certain degree, a shame for the city,'' said Michael Bond, deputy
director of the NAACP's Atlanta chapter.
</P>
<P>
   After his exhibition appearance in Atlanta, Rocker returned to
Florida for extended spring training. He was back with the Braves
in Milwaukee last weekend, working out during the games and doing
everything else like a regular team member.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll support him in Atlanta, but it won't be the same when
we hit the road,'' third baseman Chipper Jones said. ''People are
going to be rough on him, and he understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who were off Monday, play their next nine games in
Atlanta, easing the transition for Rocker. The team's next road
trip begins April 28 in laid-back San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker figures to receive his harshest reaction in places like
Philadelphia (May 12-14), Chicago (May 29-31) and definitely New
York, where Atlanta meets the Mets in a four-game series beginning
June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Already, photocopied fliers have been passed out at Shea Stadium
advertising ''John Rocker Battery Day'' for Atlanta's first series
in New York, where fans are still outraged by the pitcher's
infamous interview with Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine having to take the 7 train to (Shea Stadium) looking
like you're (in) Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to
some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who got out of jail
for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four
kids,'' Rocker told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ''The biggest thing I don't like about New York
are the foreigners. I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. You can
walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking
English. .... How the hell did they get into this country?''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is concerned about providing security for Rocker
outside of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't only be New York,'' commissioner Bud Selig said. ''He
got booed (during an exhibition series) in Venezuela -- a lot -- and
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Selig banned Rocker from baseball until May 1 and
imposed a $20,000 fine for his controversial comments. But
arbitrator Shyam Das reduced the suspension to the first two weeks
of the season, cut the fine to $500 and allowed Rocker to report to
spring training on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher apologized to his teammates in a private clubhouse
meeting and issued a statement expressing remorse for his
statements. But he has refused to discuss the issue since that day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've talked about this so much, that now it's just time to go
out and get it over with,'' Cox said. ''We're not making a big deal
about it. That's (the media's) thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are hoping that Rocker will handle the wrath of the
fans differently than he did during last year's playoffs, when he
engaged in a verbal war with New Yorkers even before his magazine
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what will happen,'' Jones said. ''Hopefully the
fans will accept him and we'll go on from there. There's not a
whole lot we can do about it now. It will be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   While no protests were planned Tuesday, Bond said the issue
would likely be brought up again about the time of the All-Star
game if Rocker is still with the team. The midsummer classic will
be held at Turner Field on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as that type of attitude prevails in society, we have
to combat it,'' Bond said Monday. ''He could say he was sorry, but
once the cat is out the bag you can't retract that kind of hateful
statement.''

<HEADLINE> Lewis' Lawyers Want Separate Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A joint trial for NFL linebacker Ray Lewis and
his co-defendants on murder charges will hinder a ''fair
determination of each defendant's guilt or innocence,'' according
to Lewis' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers filed motions in court Monday arguing that the
Baltimore Ravens' All-Pro should have a separate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is charged along with Reginald Oakley of Baltimore and
Joseph Sweeting of Miami in the Jan. 31 stabbing deaths that
occurred during a post-Super Bowl party in the Buckhead
entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   Two men from Decatur, Ga., Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard
Lollar, 24, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' attorneys also asked that Fulton County prosecutors turn
over any additional witness statements that say the football player
did not have a knife during the melee and did not participate in
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting's lawyers also filed motions Monday, asking that
prosecutors turn over information of any prior felony convictions
of the state's witnesses and of any internal affairs investigations
of the police officers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Bruce Harvey, who represents Oakley, filed
motions asking Superior Court Judge Alice Bonner to grant immunity
to Kwame King and Carlos Stafford, two occupants of Lewis' rented
stretch limousine who have not been charged in the case. They would
give testimony that clears Oakley of wrongdoing, the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey also asked Bonner to grant Oakley a separate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Severance motions are rarely allowed, but if a severance is
granted, at least one other judge may have to preside over the
other trial. This would be necessary because the defendants have
filed speedy trial demands, which require the case to be tried by
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled for May 15, and the motions are to be
argued during hearings scheduled May 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis lawyers also made other requests:
</P>
<P>
   --They want the linebacker's initial statements given to police
on Jan. 31 suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   --They want prior assault charges against Lewis filed by three
separate women not be used against him at trial. The charges were
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   --They want prosecutors to turn over witness statements that may
help explain why Marlin Burros, a friend of the victims who fired
on Lewis' limousine as it sped away, has disposed of his gun.
</P>
<P>
   --They are asking the judge to issue a subpoena demanding Chris
Shinholster of Akron, Ohio, a friend of the victims who was at the
scene, testify at trial. Shinholster told police Lewis did not have
a knife and was not fighting.
</P>
<P>
   --And they want the judge to issue a subpoena requiring Keiva
Walls of Houston, who was an occupant in Lewis' limo, to testify at
trial. Walls has given statements to police saying Lewis yelled for
everyone to get back in the limo and never held a knife that night,
the motion said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Volleyball Defeats Korean Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The United States defeated the
Korean national team 25-22, 23-25, 25-22, 25-20 at the World Arena
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the hitting of 6-foot-8 George Roumain and 6-5 John Hyden
off sets from USA co-captain Lloy Ball, the Americans overpowered
the smaller Koreans at the net.
</P>
<P>
   After the Koreans won the second game, the U.S. team, which
qualified for the Sydney Olympics by winning the NORCECA
Championships in September, dominated the final two games of the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a nice mix of veterans and kids,'' coach Doug Beal
said. ''I don't think there is any reason we can't be a very strong
medal contender at Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal would know what it takes to succeed at the Olympics -- he
led the Americans' march to the gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, this what we need most,'' said Ball, who is one of
the six returners from the 1996 Olympic team that finished ninth at
Atlanta. ''We spent four months in the gym, and we're trying to get
our game sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was the third in a four-match tour against the Korean
team that qualified for the 2000 Olympics by winning the Asian Zone
Championships. The U.S. team has a 3-1 advantage with the final
match of the tour scheduled for Wednesday night at Fort Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an awfully good chance we will see them again in
Sydney,'' Beal said. ''They are a very good team that will also
challenge for a medal.''

<HEADLINE> National League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Sure the Colorado Rockies have a new look that
de-emphasizes the home run, but this is taking it to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive night, the Rockies had a big
offensive game without a home run in a 9-1 pounding of Omar Daal
and the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado even had consecutive bunt singles from their No. 3 and
4 hitters, Larry Walker and Jeff Cirillo, in a five-run first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very shocked,'' Arizona third baseman Lenny Harris said.
''I haven't seen anything like that in 11 years in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies also were homerless in their 14-13, four-hour,
19-minute victory over St. Louis on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't really matter how you score them,'' Colorado
manager Buddy Bell said. ''We have more pop than this, but the good
thing about what we've done lately is we haven't got real greedy.
We've cut down on our swing a little bit when we have to. ... We
run the bases very well. We're as energized on the bases as any
team I've been a part of, and that's a contagious thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only other NL game played Monday, Florida beat the
Chicago Cubs 6-5. The Montreal-Philadelphia and Houston-Los Angeles
games were postponed by rain.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's one-sided victory was particularly satisfying because
it came against Daal, one of the Rockies' least favorite pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Daal (0-1) hit Cirillo between the shoulders with a 2-0 pitch
with two outs in the second. An angry Cirillo took a couple of
steps toward the mound, shouting at Daal. Both dugouts and bullpens
emptied, but no punches were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not the first time he's thrown at this team,'' Cirillo
said. ''Larry Walker got hit by him four times last year. He's
thrown at me a lot of times. Going in we know he likes to work
fast, and we're trying to slow up his rhythm. He doesn't like that.
I know that's why he throws at me.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that's very out of character for me to do something
like that, but I know this guy. ... You could say he was just
trying to get me off the plate or whatever, but this is a guy who's
got the best control in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal was noncommittal about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to throw at anybody,'' he said. ''It's part of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton knocked in three runs with two singles, and six
other Rockies had two hits apiece, including winning pitcher Masato
Yoshii. Terry Shumpert had a triple and double with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii (1-1) allowed one run and seven hits in seven innings. He
struck out two and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't particularly sharp tonight, but you've got to take
your hat off to Colorado,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said.
''They came in here after a tough day yesterday and were ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal allowed eight runs -- seven earned -- and 13 hits in 5 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think they hit many balls hard the whole game,'' Daal
said. ''They just hit them in the right spots. It was a bad game,
and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansing started the first-inning outburst with a one-out
single, then Walker and Cirillo put down perfect bunts in front
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo said his decision to bunt was spontaneous, but he had
seen on videotape that Harris, starting in place of injured Matt
Williams, plays extremely deep.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it was like an impulse thing,'' Cirillo said. ''The
umpire goes 'What, are you going to bunt, too?' I thought, 'Yeah,
let's try that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Helton followed with a two-run single, then Shumpert's RBI
double put Colorado up 3-0. A sacrifice fly by Neifi Perez made it
4-0. Daal intentionally walked Scott Servais to get to Yoshii,
whose RBI single put the Rockies ahead 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also had an error that allowed a run to score in
Colorado's three-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
Marlins 6, Cubs 5
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowell and Derrek Lee drove in two runs apiece as Florida
won at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored all of their runs on singles. All but one of
their 12 hits were on singles, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (2-0) gave up five runs -- three earned -- and six
hits in six innings. Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his
fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Farnsworth (1-2) took the loss.

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla.(AP) -- Tears streamed down Darrell Armstrong's
face.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's bid for an NBA playoff berth had just ended, moments
after Armstrong decided against taking a potential go-ahead shot.
Instead, he tried to slip a pass to teammate Chucky Atkins, and
Milwaukee's Sam Cassell wound up with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell passed to Glenn Robinson, who scored the winning basket,
dunking with 21.9 seconds remaining Monday night as the Bucks
grabbed the eighth and final Eastern Conference postseason spot
with an 85-83 victory over the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have just kept going to the basket. I was about to
pull up for a jump shot,'' said Armstrong, who dropped to the floor
and sobbed before being helped off the court by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked so hard. To come up short, it's not a good feeling.
It's going to be a long summer,'' Armstrong said. ''This whole
season, nobody gave us nothing. Nobody respected us. We had to go
out there and gain respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee (41-40), which will finish with its best record since
1990-91, moves on to the playoffs for the second straight season
under second-year coach George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks went into Monday night's game tied with the Magic
(40-41) for the eighth spot. But Orlando had to win to keep its
hopes alive because Milwaukee had swept three previous meetings
between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew we'd still have a chance mathematically (with a loss),
but you don't want to leave it in the hands of fate,'' Bucks
forward Darvin Ham said. ''You want to try and control your own
destiny, and that's what we did out there tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Thomas scored three baskets down the stretch to finish with
21 points for Milwaukee, which also got 19 points and 10 assists
from Cassell. The Bucks blew a 19-point lead, but were able to hold
on in the closing minutes even without leading scorer Ray Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Allen sprained his left knee during a scramble for a loose ball
in the final minute of the third quarter and did not return. The
injury will be evaluated again today, but Allen doesn't expect it
to keep him out of Wednesday's regular season finale against
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fine,'' he said. ''I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In other NBA games Monday night, Indiana edged Philadelphia
92-90, San Antonio rallied past Vancouver 100-93, and Minnesota
beat Golden State 101-96.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who scored 11 points, made only five of 16 shots. But
he also had 11 rebounds and was in the right place at the right
time on the fast break that produced the winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, who led Orlando with 18 points, missed a 3-point attempt
on Orlando's last possession, and Ham batted the rebound into the
backcourt as the final seconds ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   This was expected to be a year in which Orlando struggled after
deciding to almost entirely rebuild its roster. But the team
hustled its way into playoff contention under first-year coach Doc
Rivers and nearly pulled off a big comeback Monday after falling
behind 24-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a lot you can say to them,'' Rivers said, speaking
slowly to control his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I basically told them they were the best team I had ever seen.
Not the greatest team, but the best team. They are an amazing
group. ... This is tough. I played a lot of years in this league
and had a lot of tough losses, but I don't know when I have ever
felt worse for a group of guys.''
</P>
<P>
Pacers 92, 76ers 90
</P>
<P>
   Without its starting backcourt for the first time all season,
Indiana beat host Philadelphia thanks to 21 points from Chris
Mullin and 20 from Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia missed 13 straight shots in the fourth quarter,
going more than 10 minutes without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, already assured home-court advantage throughout the
Eastern Conference playoffs, played without starting guards Reggie
Miller (sore lower back) and Mark Jackson (thigh bruise). Both
started every game prior to Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spurs 100, Grizzlies 93
</P>
<P>
   At San Antonio, David Robinson scored 12 of his 27 points in the
fourth quarter to rally the Spurs, who played their third straight
game without Tim Duncan (left knee injury).
</P>
<P>
   Avery Johnson scored a season-high 24 points as San Antonio
improved to 4-3 this season without Duncan.
</P>
<P>
Timberwolves 101, Warriors 96
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota rallied from a 15-point deficit, then saw a 12-point
lead evaporate in the fourth quarter before pulling out its 50th
win.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon scored 21 points and Anthony Peeler had all
seven of his points in the fourth quarter, including a crucial
three-point play, for the playoff-bound visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes' 33 points led Golden State, which will match a
team record for losses in a season (63) if it drops its final game,
Wednesday against Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Tax procrastinators mob post offices  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE CARROLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As the midnight tax deadline drew closer Monday,
procrastinators crowded into post offices across the country to
file their returns -- or plead for extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Because April 15 fell on a Saturday this year, most Americans
got two extra days to file their taxes. People in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and most
of New York outside the New York City area have until midnight
today because of the Patriot's Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City on Monday night, the 1.4 million-square-foot
James A. Farley Post Office in midtown Manhattan was packed with
taxpayers trying to get their tax forms postmarked before the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Qudsiya Assan, 26, of Brooklyn, couldn't finish her forms on
time, and writing a letter to the Internal Revenue Service for an
extension made her head throb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I caught a headache coming in here today,'' Assan said at the
main post office. ''I pay enough taxes already.''
</P>
<P>
   In north Dallas, some taxpayers faced an unexpected delay in
getting their forms to Uncle Sam: One post office had its doors and
mail slots open but had already made its last pickup.
</P>
<P>
   A postal worker headed for home told the group of about 20
late-filers that the nearest post office still picking up mail was
near downtown Dallas, about 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lytle, a 29-year-old software salesman, was headed to the
downtown post office to mail his tax return when he was asked by
two strangers to drop their returns off as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't mind because I have to go down there anyways,'' Lytle
said. ''I just wish I would have gotten here earlier in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, postal worker Jae Kim stood in a steady rain,
greeting last-minute filers as they pulled up to the city's main
post office just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as many people as I expected,'' he said, greeting the
occasional patron through the slit of a car window. ''Maybe it's
the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   An unofficial count said about 1,200 people showed up to file
just before the midnight deadline. A local Krispy Kreme doughnut
shop handed out free doughnuts, going through 100 dozen from 10
p.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   A few taxpayers missed the deadline and the doughnuts but went
inside anyway because the main post office is open 24 hours a day
all year long.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Barnett, 24, who spent all day filling out 15 pages of tax
forms, wrote a check to the IRS and stuffed it into an envelope
around 12:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I downloaded what I thought were all the forms a couple of
days ago, but I guess I didn't have them all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Terminal Annex post office in downtown Los Angeles, there
were swarms of people filing at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of cars a block long snaked steadily past postal workers
in open-air booths set up to collect tax returns in the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to see the lovely postal workers,'' was Maureen
Tabor's excuse for waiting until the last minute Monday night.
''And I guess I like procrastinating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles woman will procrastinate a bit longer, having
filed an extension form, not her return.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, so many people chose electronic filing that the
usual last-minute rush seemed calmer, one tax preparer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're less swamped than usual,'' said Dan Griffiths, district
manager for H&AMP;R Block's 11 offices in south central Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But in Chicago, pen and paper ruled supreme.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second year in a row that Isaiah Heard, 28, found
himself trying to beat the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't mind waiting to the last day. It's almost like
tradition now,'' he said at the downtown post office, which was
open until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Heard said he had planned to file electronically before he was
informed of the additional charges. So he spent Monday morning
completing the forms.
</P>
<P>
   Eric O'Quinn, another last-minute Chicago filer, said he waited
on purpose.

<HEADLINE> 7 murders of livery drivers have industry concerned  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Livery cab driver Juan Marical slows down to
check out a would-be passenger hailing him in Brooklyn. He knows
he's only supposed to pick up fares called in from his dispatcher,
but like scores of other drivers, he trolls for street fares to
make more money.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent spate of livery cab driver murders has Marical and
many others among the city's more than 41,000 livery drivers
scared. This year, seven livery cab drivers have been murdered --
two in the past week. Last year, 11 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look suspicious, forget it,'' Marical said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The police have made solving the murders a top priority, but
there's been an arrest in only one case. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
expressed his outrage and has pledged $5 million in a grant program
to help equip livery cars with bulletproof partitions or digital
security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Council hearing Monday to address the safety concerns
of livery drivers, police Chief of Patrol John Scanlon said six of
the seven murders resulted from street hails, and he urged drivers
to avoid such passengers. Only yellow cab drivers can pick up
street fares, and although by law they must take passengers in all
five boroughs, they stick to the relatively safe streets of
Manhattan, making the need for livery drivers all the more pressing
in the outer boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the conditions of the job itself -- cash-oriented,
solo-operated, evening hours -- (livery) drivers are especially
vulnerable to criminals who would prey on them,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria Estrella agreed. Her husband, Luis Francisco Perez,
was the sixth cab driver killed this year. He was found in his cab
last Friday with a gunshot wound to his head, two days shy of his
30th birthday. On Saturday, the seventh driver, Jean Scutt, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'It's dangerous for you,''' Estrella said as she held
her 16-month-old son, Liully. '''I'm waiting every night for you.'
But he would never think that anything would happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced Monday that the city will set up a fund to
help the families of the slain drivers. In addition, the police
department has created a special task force, assigning 300 officers
to protect livery drivers. Some cops will act as decoy drivers, and
there will be designated safe zones where drivers in trouble can go
if they need help.
</P>
<P>
   But Scanlon stressed the best protection for the drivers is the
bulletproof partition. Taxi and Limousine Commission rules require
all yellow cabs and livery cars operated and owned by more than one
driver to have the partitions.
</P>
<P>
   Police stress that no yellow cab drivers have been killed since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But cars owned and operated by individual drivers -- which make
up 90 percent of all livery cars -- can have either the partitions
or tiny surveillance cameras installed behind the driver's rearview
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   However, many livery drivers say it's too expensive to equip
their cars with partitions, which cost between $250 to $300, or the
cameras, costing from $600 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the security devices, the job is still pretty
dangerous, said Jose Vinoria, a driver for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been attacked three times -- once, someone put a gun to
the back of my head,'' Vinoria said.
</P>
<P>
   So why do people become livery drivers?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not because it's a very good job,'' Vinoria said. ''You
have a time when you have to pay your bills. And in this job, you
can be your own boss. You can work as much overtime as you need.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of cab driving are not new. Scanlon said the police
department has been battling violence against cab drivers for
years. Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation
of Taxi Drivers, said at least a dozen cab drivers are attacked
each day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most dangerous industry in the city,'' Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a cab was listed as one of the most dangerous jobs
nationwide in a 1996 survey by the National Institute for
Occupational Safety &AMP; Health.

<HEADLINE> Rhode Island man arrested in Internet sting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) -- Authorities conducting an Internet
sting have arrested a child welfare worker from Rhode Island
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Kogut, 31, of Central Falls, is accused of seeking
sexual contact with ''a 13-year-old Rocky Hill girl,'' who actually
was a town police detective.
</P>
<P>
   Kogut is the assistant director of the Professional Parent
Program in Rhode Island. He job involves assessing foster care
applicants to determine if they would make suitable parents,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Kogut was arrested on Friday outside an apartment complex where
he had arraigned to meet the ''girl,'' police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kogut was arraigned Monday in New Britain Superior Court on
charges of criminal attempt to commit sexual assault and injury or
risk of injury to a minor and three counts of criminal attempt to
use a computer to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Kogut had supervised male adolescents at a Rhode Island group
home before being promoted to assistant director of the
Professional Parent Program. The program, contracted by the state
of Rhode Island to run specialized foster care services, placed
Kogut on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of the
investigation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island's Child Protective Services also is investigating
whether any allegations have been made against Kogut in the
programs he was involved with, state agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kogut was released on $150,000 bail and was ordered to have no
contact with anyone younger than 16. He is due back in court May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Det. Henry Dodenhoff, who posed online as the
13-year-old, said he was contacted in a chat room by Kogut, who
said he was 21, from Rhode Island and interested in sex.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation continued over several days, with Kogut, who
went by the screen name RavnosFirst, always bringing up sex, police
said. He told the ''girl'' he would be gentle and not hurt her,
according to the arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
   'I'll teach you everything you want to know and I'll be gentle.
... Just tell me you're 18 and we'll be all set,'' the warrant
quotes him as writing.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Kogut mentioned several times that he would be in
''big trouble'' if anyone found out that he and the 13-year-old
were planning to meet to have sex. At one point, Kogut asked the
''girl'' if she could pretend to be sick and stay home from school
one day. If she could, he would do the same and drive to Rocky Hill
to meet her, the warrant says.
</P>
<P>
   Kogut was arrested about 7:30 p.m. Friday outside Stepney Place,
an apartment complex where he was to meet with the ''girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers recognized Kogut from pictures he had e-mailed. They
also knew his green Chevrolet Blazer because he had described it in
detail. He had asked online for directions and followed them to
where police were waiting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has 'Digital Divide' Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- President Clinton promised better
connections between Indian lands and jobs, investment and
opportunity elsewhere, even as he said the federal government has
failed Native Americans in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though many of your ancestors gave up fighting and gave up
land and water and mineral rights in exchange for peace, security,
health care and education, the federal government did not live up
to its end of the deal,'' Clinton told thousands of cheering
Navajos on Monday
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by tribal leaders in an impoverished Navajo
reservation town, Clinton announced more than $100 million in
pledges from the computer industry for hard-luck communities
nationwide. The money is part of the Clinton administration's
effort to erase the ''digital divide'' that separates poor and
prosperous Americans in their access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was flying to Chicago today for an afternoon speech
before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The president promised $1-a-month telephone service to 300,000
Indian households.
</P>
<P>
   ''In much of America it takes just a modest amount of money and
time to get someone on the Internet,'' Clinton told the Navajos.
''But here an astonishing 37 percent of the households are without
electricity, about 70 percent without phone service, more than half
without work.''
</P>
<P>
   The president paid tribute to Navajo ''code talkers,'' whose
intricate language proved impossible for the Japanese to crack
during World War II. About a dozen elderly men who served as code
talkers held flags and marched slowly past the stage before Clinton
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are few people in America who better embody the power of
communication,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to Shiprock, N.M., -- named for a 1,700 foot
geological monument rising from the surrounding plains -- after a
morning stop in East Palo Alto, Calif. The city is a pocket of
poverty in technology-rich Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   More than 24 percent of youngsters in East Palo Alto live in
poverty and over 80 percent are eligible for the free-lunch
program. Schools have just one computer for every 28 students.
</P>
<P>
   During a stop at an East Palo Alto program to shepherd poor
youngsters toward college, Clinton gave perhaps his most expansive
reply yet to the question that hangs over each day of his dwindling
term.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman at College Track asked Clinton what he plans to do
when he leaves office next year. Clinton will be 54, with decades
of potential working life left to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to build a library and public policy center in my
home state. And I'm going to work on those issues that were really,
really important to me as president,'' Clinton began.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned work to erase racial and ethnic prejudice and to
speed peace in the Middle East, Northern Ireland and Africa, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when a person has been president and is healthy and
alert you have an obligation to give back for the rest of your life
because it's a unique opportunity,'' Clinton said. ''So that's how
I'm going to spend the rest of my life: trying to be a good
citizen. I'm not planning to run for office again.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Boss: Don't Test Gay Issues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig told
an audience at the U.S. Naval Academy that the military should not
be considered a testing ground for gay-rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question about gays in military service, Danzig
said Monday night that American society ''hasn't reached a
consensus'' on gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, the military itself shouldn't be a driver of that,
but a follower of the consensus of society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is really much more an issue for society-at-large as it is
for the military,'' he said. ''The military isn't essentially a
testing ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen last month said he would create
a special committee to investigate anti-gay speech and harassment
after a Pentagon inspector general's survey found that the problems
are commonplace in the American military.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy
permits gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they
keep their sexual orientation to themselves and commanders do not
inquire about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was forced to take a closer look at how the gay
policy is being implemented after the bludgeoning death last July
of a gay Army private at Fort Campbell, Ky. His killer, a fellow
private, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

By The Associated Press	   Audio reviews from The Associated Press:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Ecstasy'' (Reprise) -- Lou Reed
</P>
<P>
   At an age (58) when other rockers are organizing reunion tours
to overcharge their aging audience for the nostalgic exercise of
watching them perform songs they made famous when they still had
hair, Lou Reed is making vital rock 'n' roll, still writing lyrics
that challenge the listener to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Ecstasy,'' Reed shows no sign of joining the dinosaurs. Age
has brought him wisdom and perspective but it has not dulled his
attack. He snaps off jagged guitar lines, produces great squalls of
angry feedback, and sings of love and betrayal, bitterness and
hope.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Tatters,'' he tackles domestic strife: ''You sleep in the
bedroom, While I pace up and down the hall, Our baby stares at both
of us, Wondering which one of us to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the combination of Reed's delivery (hey, you don't
go to him for vocal range) and poetic aspirations makes the album a
bit ponderous. But then he unleashes a blazing rocker such as ''Big
Sky'' or sings a near-perfect ballad, such as ''Baton Rouge'' or
''Turning Time Around'' and the rest doesn't matter.

   ''Blues Masters: The Very Best of Elmore James'' (Rhino) --
Elmore James
</P>
<P>
   ''Blues Masters: The Very Best of Jimmy Reed'' (Rhino) -- Jimmy
Reed
</P>
<P>
   Elmore James kicks off the 1960 single ''I Can't Hold Out'' by
playing two particularly bluesy notes in succession on guitar. When
the entire band jumps in with a punchy chord, James reacts with a
slow, satisfied ''Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   That one word says it all. These compilations are the latest
releases in Rhino's 20-volume Blues Masters series, and they
reaffirm James and Jimmy Reed as giants in their genre -- urban
blues in the '50s and early '60s. Both Mississippians moved to the
big city, plugged in their guitars and began to wail, heavily
influencing white rockers a generation later.
</P>
<P>
   James sang pure blues with a raspy, powerful voice, and he was
the best bottleneck guitarist of his era. His trademark riff, the
first lick taught today in slide-guitar classes, provided a
starting point for such later guitar heroes as Eric Clapton, Jimmy
Page and Jimi Hendrix. ''Dust My Broom,'' ''The Sky Is Crying'' and
''Shake Your Moneymaker'' -- all included here -- are James at his
best.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had a more rudimentary style, but he sang and played guitar
and harp with an engaging ease. He was more successful than most of
his blues contemporaries in crossing over to the R&AMP;B and pop
charts, and his tunes were covered by Elvis Presley, the Grateful
Dead and the Rolling Stones. Among his hits included here are
''Bright Lights Big City,'' ''You've Got Me Dizzy'' and ''Ain't
That Lovin' You Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The only dud in either set is Reed's ''Honest I Do,'' a tune
even Little Richard couldn't save. Otherwise, James' one-word
review will suffice: ''Yeah!''

<HEADLINE> Treasury To Buy Back $2B of Debt  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flush with cash from a booming economy, the
Treasury Department will buy back $2 billion of the national debt
Thursday, the latest in a series of debt repurchases.
</P>
<P>
   That means Treasury will ask investors who hold certain older,
higher-yielding 30-year Treasury bonds to consider selling them
back to the government. No one would be forced to surrender bonds
to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Treasury Department said Tuesday that it wants
to buy back 14 outstanding issues of 30-year bonds that will mature
between February 2020 and August 2025. The bonds carry coupon
interest rates ranging from 6.250 percent to 8.750 percent. Those
rates are higher than the current yield on 30-year Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bonds the Treasury wants to buy back generally pay
higher than current yields, they most likely will draw a premium
for sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, over the long run, the government expects to save money
through its debt-buyback operations because it will save more in
interest payments than its costs of buying the bonds back.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, Treasury bought back $1 billion of the debt, the
first time it has done so in 70 years. That was followed one week
later with another $1 billion repurchase. In the two operations,
Treasury paid sellers around $613 million in premiums to cash in
their bonds early.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bought back thus far is a tiny fraction of the $5.7
trillion national debt. Of that total, $3.6 trillion is held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Treasury said it would like to buy back up to $30
billion of debt this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new era of bulging government surpluses -- helped by a
booming economy that is generating lots of tax revenues -- is making
it possible for the Treasury to repurchase some debt.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury will buy back the debt using a process known as a
''reverse auction,'' in which the government selects offers on a
competitive basis based on the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   Offers, in increments of $100,000, must be submitted by 11 a.m.
EDT Thursday and the winning offers will be announced around
midday.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed in early trading on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up a fraction in the early
going. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a slim

</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 60 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is up more than a point.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may have gotten some more fuel for their blue-chip
shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   Better-than-expected earnings reports have been released from
Coke, Caterpillar and Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   All three stocks reside in the blue-chip sector of the market,
which had the hot hand in Monday's advance.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say it remains to be seen whether investors will
begin to shift new money into some of the mid-level and smaller

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 94; Dow Up 64  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today, extending Monday's
sharp rally as investors once again flocked to blue-chip issues and
sought bargains in the battered technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 64.61 at 10,647.12.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 94.83 at 3,633.99, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 12.04 at 1,413.48.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks extended a rally that picked up steam in the final hour
of trading on Monday, leaving the Dow with a gain of 276.74 points
and the Nasdaq with a 217.87-point advance, its biggest single-day
point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was a dramatic turnaround from crushing losses last
week. Still, most analysts are saying it's too soon to declare a
full recovery from the carnage last week, when the U.S. stock
market lost nearly $2 trillion in value.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports provided a catalyst for buying today. Dow
component Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 2{ to 80\ after reporting
first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government delivered a report that eased some
revived fears about inflation. The Commerce Department said hat
housing construction plummeted 11.2 percent in March, the biggest
plunge in six years, suggesting that rising mortgage rates are
cutting into demand.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, the
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since last
June. The slowdown in housing starts offered some hope that the
rate increases are working, reducing the odds of steep increases
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The market's breadth improved, with more stocks joining in the
effort to rally. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 128.49
million shares, compared with 152.50 million at the same time
Monday. On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 6.65 to 465.91.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.4 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> PAX To Rebroadcast NBC News Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC plans to rebroadcast its early evening news
program on the PAX network owned by Paxson Communications, the
family-friendly broadcaster in which NBC recently bought a 32
percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong rebroadcast test in May of ''NBC Nightly News with
Tom Brokaw'' is likely to further strain relations between NBC and
its affiliated stations by providing a competing outlet for a
popular network show.
</P>
<P>
   The PAX network is carried on smaller stations and cable systems
throughout the country, reaching 77 percent of U.S. households,
often in areas already reached by major TV stations affiliated with
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The PAX network will broadcast Brokaw's news program at 7:30
p.m. nationwide, one hour after airing on network-affiliated
stations. After the one-month test, the rebroadcast is expected to
become a regular part of Pax TV's schedule in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal announced today, PAX will also rebroadcast
some NBC coverage of U.S. Olympic trials beginning in June.
</P>
<P>
   The carriage of NBC programming on PAX was part of an
understanding reached last September when NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co., agreed to acquire a 32 percent stake in the company
for $415 million.
</P>
<P>
   For PAX, which is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., the deal was a
way to bolster its roster of programming, which depends heavily on
wholesome programs like ''Chicken Soup for the Soul.'' PAX already
rebroadcasts NBC's game show ''Twenty One'' on Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Like CBS and ABC, NBC's rapport with its affiliates has been on
the decline as the networks seek to revise decades-old agreements
requiring them to pay station owners to carry their programming.
Fox doesn't pay its affiliates to carry its programming.

<HEADLINE> More deals reached, but lawmakers struggle to conclude budget  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislators have agreed to increase
spending on New York public schools by a record $1.2 billion to
about $13.2 billion, the highest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement came as the legislative conference
committee on education became the last of the nine committees
negotiating policy areas of the 2000-01 budget to end its
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, details of a $1.2 billion tax-cut plan over five
years were being released Monday night, but legislative leaders and
Gov. George Pataki could not reach a final deal on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno both said this morning that the absence of a final
agreement would prevent the Legislature from adopting a budget by
sundown Wednesday. They had set that time, the start of Jewish
Passover holiday, as a deadline for putting a new budget in place.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said they would sent their members home starting
Wednesday for the previously scheduled Easter-Passover holiday and
pick up the budget process on Monday, May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Silver confirmed reports by sources Monday night close to the
budget talks that Pataki's Budget Division had raised objections to
the longer-term implications of some spending programs favored by
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers that came out were different from different
perspectives,'' Silver said this morning on WROW-AM in Albany.
''Right now, the Budget Division doesn't seem to agree with
legislative (fiscal committee) secretaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said talks among the leaders would continue this week and
staffers would work on the budget while lawmakers were on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have been trying to reach an agreement on the state
fiscal year which begun April 1. This is the 16th straight year
budget adoption has been late in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Still awaiting final agreement was the release of details of
specific projects to be funded in a new, ambitious five-year
program for transportation and mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cut plan included the immediate elimination of the
gross-receipts tax on energy for manufacturers to apply
retroactively to Jan. 1. The new budget will also include a
reduction in gross receipts tax for non-manufacturing commercial
customers over five years and for a reduction in the tax charged to
residential taxpayers of $75 million immediately and $50 million
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kuhl Jr. and Assemblyman Steven Sanders, co-chairmen
of the committee on education, said the school aid spending would
be at a record level for the fourth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, funding for the pet program of the state
Assembly called ''LADDER'' was increased by $259 million. Included
in this plan is $225 million for universal pre-kindergarten
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Allocations for districts that are unable to spend the money
next school year will be kept for the district until they can be
used. That settles a dispute between the Legislature and Pataki,
who has proposed returning unspent funds to the state each year.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for LADDER programs will also include increases of $67
million for class-size reduction and $50 million for minor
maintenance and repair.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   --Increase by $370 million on unrestricted operating aid for
public school districts. Included in that would be a new, $35
million spending plan for summer school aid.
</P>
<P>
   --Spend $30 million on fighting school violence.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase school-building aid by $228 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide $67.5 million for Teacher Support Aid.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase state support for instructional materials by $33.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase by $3 million spending for the Limited English
Proficiency program.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide $11 million for bilingual education aid.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the committee did not take into consideration
capital improvement issues such as school construction projects. He
said those issues would be decided by the Legislature's top
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Seventh-grade girls accused of plotting to torch school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERGENFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Two seventh-grade girls hauling
flammable liquids in their shoulder bags told police they planned
to burn down their school, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were pretty forthcoming about what was going on: They
said they didn't like school,'' Deputy Police Chief Ed Carroll told
The Record of Hackensack in today's editions. ''That was their
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls were arrested Saturday after a gift shop manager
accused the girls, age 12 and 13, of stealing calculators, police
said. They were carrying a 32-ounce bottle of charcoal lighter
fluid, a 5-ounce bottle of butane lighter fluid, a 16-ounce bottle
of rubbing alcohol, as well as a can of household disinfectant, a
hammer, matches and a cigarette lighter, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found a handwritten list of the items found in the
shoulder bag, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Police called the girls' parents to police headquarters and
began questioning the students, who had served detention earlier at
Roy W. Brown Middle School before they went to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the girls said they planned to set the blaze
Saturday night in the nurse's office or the gymnasium, both of
which are hidden from street view. The girls had brought the hammer
just in case they had to break a window, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were charged as juveniles with conspiracy to commit
arson, possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose and shoplifting,
authorities said. Besides the calculators, police said they also
found stolen arts and crafts supplies, watches and sunglasses in
the bag.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said the girls were not in school Monday and
did not say whether the girls would be disciplined. Officials
wouldn't say whether other parents or students had been told of the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 91; Nasdaq Up 99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today, extending
Monday's sharp rally as investors once again flocked to blue-chip
issues and sought bargains in the battered technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 91.83 at 10,674.34.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 99.67 at 3,638.83, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 12.13 at 1,413.57.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks extended a rally that picked up steam in the final hour
of trading on Monday, leaving the Dow with a gain of 276.74 points
and the Nasdaq with a 217.87-point advance, its biggest single-day
point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was a dramatic turnaround from crushing losses last
week. Still, most analysts are saying it's too soon to declare a
full recovery from the carnage last week, when the U.S. stock
market lost nearly $2 trillion in value.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports provided a catalyst for buying today. Dow
component Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 1/16 to 80 13/16 after reporting
first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 5 1/16 to 128 1/16. The company, the world's largest
maker of computer chips, was expected to report its first-quarter
earnings after the 4 p.m. close of trading. Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter raised its rating on Intel stock to ''strong buy'' from
''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, investors were favoring large-capitalization,
well-known technology names. Sun Microsystems rose 4 1/16 to 88
15/16 and Microsoft rose 2 7/16 to 78 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government delivered a report that eased some
fears about inflation. The Commerce Department said housing
construction plummeted 11.2 percent in March, the biggest plunge in
six years, suggesting that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, the
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since last
June. The slowdown in housing starts offered some hope that the
rate increases are working, reducing the odds of steep increases
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rates
and inflation, benefited from the report. American Express rose 4|
to 138|.
</P>
<P>
   The market's breadth improved, with more stocks joining in the
effort to rally. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 313.11
million shares, compared with 364.68 million at the same time
Monday. On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 9.38 to 468.64.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs New Antibiotic Type  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved a vital new weapon in
the battle against drug-resistant bacteria today, a drug called
Zyvox described as the first entirely new type of antibiotic in 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox can treat routine pneumonia and skin infections and some
drug-resistant staph infections. But its chief fight will be
against an infamous germ, called ''Enterococcus faecium,'' often
deadly to hospitalized patients and impervious to the antibiotic of
last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more and more germs are developing resistance to that
longtime ''silver bullet'' antibiotic vancomycin, leaving doctors
watching helplessly as their patients die from once-treatable
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox, doctors hope, will help. In clinical trials of 145
patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infections, Zyvox
cured 67 percent, the Food and Drug Administration said today in
approving Pharmacia Corp.'s Zyvox.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox isn't alone in this battle -- the FDA last fall approved
competitor Aventis' Synercid as the nation's first alternative when
vancomycin fails. Experts say both new drugs are important weapons
that should be used sparingly, against the worst infections,
because bacteria eventually will evolve to evade them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Synercid is a combination of two older but little-used types of
antibiotics that deals bacteria a one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox, in contrast, is a chemical designed from scratch to fight
germs at an entirely different point in their life cycle than other
medicines do -- a true surprise attack. Known chemically as
linezolid, it is the first in a long-awaited new class of
antibiotics called oxazolidinones.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a magic bullet. It can't fight all bacteria, only those
known as ''gram-positive'' germs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, gram-positive bacteria cause more than half of all
serious infections treated in hospitals worldwide, the kind often
caught by patients while they're in the hospital for some other
problem. That notorious Enterococcus faecium, for instance,
commonly invades surgery wounds, as well as causing deadly
infections in the abdomen, urinary tract and heart valves.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials of Zyvox against other infections, including
tough-to-treat staph infections, Zyvox proved as effective as
vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
   Primary side effects were nausea and headache in about 5 percent
of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia said Zyvox would be available within a few weeks, but
refused to disclose the price except to say it was expected to be a
little lower than competitor Synercid.

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Second Mexico Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police have arrested a second suspect in the
killing of five farmers this month in the southern state of
Chiapas, the government news agency Notimex reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Aguilar Lopez was arrested during a police raid Sunday
evening in the city of Comitan, near the Guatemalan border, Notimex
reported. Last week, police arrested another suspect, Hector
Velasco Gomez, in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Masked gunmen ambushed a group of peasants delivering government
aid April 7, killing five and wounding two others near the mountain
community of Zaragoza.
</P>
<P>
   The seven peasants were attacked and robbed after picking up
more than $21,000 worth of aid intended for agricultural projects
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mexican authorities asked Guatemala for help in
capturing the gunmen who they believed had fled across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the killings are not related to the region's
Zapatista insurgency.The Zapatistas staged a brief uprising in 1994
in the name of Indian rights and greater democracy. Peace talks
have been stalled for four years.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Courthouse Opened  </HEADLINE>
By PETER DEJONG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Builders added finishing touches
to the roof of an old schoolhouse Tuesday, finishing its
transformation into a Scottish court where the Lockerbie trial is
expected to begin May 3.
</P>
<P>
   A royal crest, the symbol for Scottish justice, hung above the
leather chairs and oak-paneled table where judges will hear the
case against two Libyans accused in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   Television crews and photographers were allowed a glimpse inside
the high-security premises in Camp Zeist, a former U.S. air base 25
miles southeast of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is set to begin more than 10 years after Pan Am
aircraft was blown apart over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988, killing 270 people -- including 189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, former Libyan secret servicemen Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, pleaded innocent to murder
after being brought to the Netherlands a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Security vehicles patrolled the area as police posed for
photographs near a 20-foot concrete wall --topped with an electric
fence -- surrounding the bunker-like detention facility.
</P>
<P>
   The court chamber, a renovated schoolhouse, is lined with blue
carpet and about 150 chairs, and fitted with a bulletproof glass
wall which will separate the defendants from the public gallery.
The accused and their attorneys will be seated in the same area as
the judges and the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold the trial in the Netherlands was taken
after a compromise was reached with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,
whose country had been hit by economic sanctions for nearly a
decade until the suspects were handed over to Dutch justice
officials.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Military Kills 16 Rebels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- The army raided Tamil Tiger hide-outs
in the north and gunned down 16 guerrillas, military officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven attacks Monday in the Jaffna peninsula were aimed at
driving the rebels back into the jungles, said Defense Ministry
spokesman Major Asiri Idunil.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say if the military suffered any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas stepped up their attacks in November to take back
their former stronghold, which fell to the military four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce fighting has raged since March near the Elephant Pass, a
strategic causeway linking Jaffna with the rest of the mainland to
the south. The rebels have seized small pockets near the pass. The
attacks coincided with the military saying it has consolidated
positions near the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers want to carve out Eelam as a homeland for the
nation's 3.2 million Tamils, who are a minority. The rebels say the
Tamils are discriminated against in jobs and education by the
Sinhalese majority. The battle has left more than 62,000 people
dead so far.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, troops have been able to consolidate their positions
after soldiers diverted from other areas reached the pass in recent
days, a senior army official said. The area is 175 miles north of
the capital, Colombo.

<HEADLINE> Census Face Challenge in Rural U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIERRA BLANCA, Texas (AP) -- Nineteen miles north of this tiny
West Texas town, past endless fields of tall yellow grass and
desert shrubs, is the beginning of a hilly dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it's eight miles down the bumpy path, beyond the
signs that read ''No trespassing'' and ''Keep out -- Private
property,'' before you reach Jim Walker's trailer.
</P>
<P>
   It is the task of Census Bureau workers to find Walker and
thousands of other Americans who live way out in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Census-takers must go door-to-door in rural areas because the
agency has a rule against mailing census forms to post office or
rural route boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 80, doubts the headcounters will be able to find
everyone. The census-takers are dropping by known homes and driving
around, looking for other residences, only until May 1 but will
make follow-up visits through early July.
</P>
<P>
   Out here, ''it's pretty hard to get around,'' said Walker, who
has raised cattle for the last 25 years on the Gunsight Ranch in
Hudspeth County, estimated population 3,200. A census worker called
to tell Walker to expect a visit, but five days after the
appointment, no one had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians fear that many rural Americans will go
uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   Val Beard, the county judge, or top elected official, in
Brewster County -- the largest county in Texas and home to Big Bend
National Park -- believes the count would be higher if the Census
Bureau would mail forms to people with P.O. boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Beard contends that census-takers driving around will never be
able to locate everyone in sparsely populated yet vast counties
such as hers, which is bigger than Connecticut and Rhode Island
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's a horrible mistake for all of rural America,''
she said. ''It's going to cut out a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard points out that some people have locked gates several
miles from their homes, that some may not be home when
census-takers arrive and that a good number would be more likely to
respond by mail than to open the door to a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   One census-taker working in Brewster County faced yet another
obstacle: A pet javelina -- a type of wild hog -- sprang out from
under a porch and attacked her. The woman had gashes on both legs
and needed 20 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders say an exact count is vital because the census
is used to determine how to distribute billions of federal dollars
for schools, housing, health care and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau spokesman Frank Newton dismissed Beard's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not correct to say we're going to be missing people out
in rural, remote areas,'' said Newton, spokesman for the district
that includes Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. ''From our
perspective, we're doing even more to make sure those people are
counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say they cannot mail forms to P.O. boxes
because each person has to be linked to a specific residence. They
also say that some people have more than one P.O. box and that they
want census-takers out searching for people who don't get mail.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials have tried to recruit people to go door-to-door
in their own communities, since residents of remote areas not only
know where all of the houses are but won't be considered strangers
when they approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will go up to a cardboard shack,'' said George Bell,
manager of field operations at the agency's El Paso office.

<HEADLINE> Mohawks fire casino managers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) -- The St. Regis Mohawk
Tribal Council has taken control of the tribe's struggling casino
amid allegations of compliance problems and financial questions.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal council on Monday ousted President Riverboat
Casino-St. Regis Management Co., the non-Native American management
firm running its year-old Akwesasne Mohawk Casino, in a midnight
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials seized all records and revoked the managers'
gaming licenses and barred them from the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a number of serious violations,'' tribal council
spokeswoman Rowena General said Tuesday. ''There were issues of
noncompliance with gaming regulations and serious violations of the
tribal compact with the state. There are also questions about the
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75,000-square-foot casino opened last April to great fanfare
but has averaged only half the projected 3,500 daily visitors and
taken in just a fraction of the anticipated annual revenues,
projected eventually to reach $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   An independent audit discovered a discrepancy in casino
revenues, said General, who declined to provide specifics. She said
the audit report would be made public after it is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, management was warned by the commission to install
computer tracking devices on the video lottery terminals by April 9
or face a $25,000 penalty. President R.C. ignored those warnings,
General said.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking devices are required under the nation's gaming
compact with New York state. Each video lottery terminal has a
mechanism for counting money, but there is no central system that
accounts for how much each player spends and whether the person won
or lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The casino operated under a deal with Long Island businessman
Ivan Kaufman who invested $30 million. The deal called for
President R.C., Kaufman's company, to manage the gaming hall for
five years in exchange for 75 percent of the profits. The remaining
25 percent of profits was to go to the tribe. After five years, the
tribe would run the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Horn, fired as vice president, said his company hasn't
been able to come up with enough cash to buy the tracking devices,
which sell for $1,200 per terminal and would have cost President
R.C. about $360,000 total to outfit the entire casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''The casino is not generating sufficient funds to pay for this
system. We've not made a penny on this, and we haven't been paid
back a penny. There's a certain inequity here,'' Horn said. He
estimated the casino was losing about $300,000 a month, even
despite an extra investment of $10 million to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
   Horn disputed the tribe's right to revoke the license and said
President R.C. would fight the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chiefs Alma Ransom, Hilda Smoke and Paul Thompson
formed a board of directors to assume operation and management of
the casino, General said.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming hall will remain open 24 hours a day and no
additional employees will be fired, General said.
</P>
<P>
   The new casino Board of Directors is negotiating a deal to hire
Park Place Entertainment to the advise the tribe on running the
casino. Park Place is the largest gambling company in the world and
the owner of the most profitable casino in Atlantic City.

<HEADLINE> Bush Touts Affordable Housing Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush, courting inner-city
voters, called Tuesday for a $1.7 billion program offering tax
incentives to developers to build homes for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal, the latest in a series aimed at bolstering
affordable housing, includes a five-year program giving developers
a tax credit worth up to 10 percent a year on the cost of building
in low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking of the working poor on the lawn of a rebuilt
home, said, ''The purpose of the program is not just to provide
shelter, but shelter that somebody can say 'this is mine.' When you
own a home, it not only enhances the community, it makes the
schools better because you have a certain sense of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor won his party's presidential nomination by
energizing core Republican voters, but since then he has worked to
moderate his image and court voters not traditionally attracted to
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to rival Al Gore dismissed the new proposal, arguing it
was yet another example of Bush promising something he hasn't
delivered as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''He keeps making promises he can't pay for'' because of Bush's
$483 billion tax-cut proposal, said spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''This
is yet another issue where Bush has done nothing in Texas but
expects us to believe he would do as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Documents furnished by Bush's campaign said competition among
developers for the credits probably would drive the value lower
than the total of 50 percent over five years. Up to 15,000 homes a
year could be developed because of the incentives, the campaign
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his proposal at the home of Oberrion Gibson, a
67-year-old worker at a foster care center for the mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibson lived in the neighborhood for 34 years before her
home was razed in September and replaced with a new home.
Construction was made possible by a 4.5 percent loan from a
nonprofit neighborhood development group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to leave the neighborhood,'' Ms. Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sat at the kitchen table with Ms. Gibson, daughter Carolyn
and granddaughter Whitney, before speaking to a small crowd
gathered on the front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fabulous house,'' Bush said, holding hands and
praying with Ms. Gibson's family.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Bush has called for programs in which the federal
government would match the down payment of a low-income resident
seeking to buy a home, and to allow rent assistance money to be
used to purchase a home.
</P>
<P>
   In total, Bush would spend $3.7 billion over five years on
affordable housing programs, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign said home ownership rates for low-income
individuals and families are barely 50 percent, well below the 67
percent rate for all Americans. In addition, government studies
have found up to 2.2 million families live in housing with
''moderate to severe physical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued there is a barrier to refurbishing those homes
because of a gap between the investment needed and the low market
prices for inner-city homes. The tax credit is a way to bridge that
gap, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After offering his proposal in Battle Creek, Bush headed for a
senior citizen center in Dearborn, pushing for elderly housing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   During this year's primary elections, former rival John McCain
handed Bush a resounding defeat in Michigan, largely by luring
record numbers of independent voters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The November election could turn on the outcomes in such big
industrial states as Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. Both Bush and
rival Gore are likely to devote significant campaign time and
resources to those states.

<HEADLINE> Bush Named Defendant in Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Governor George W. Bush has been named a
defendant in a lawsuit filed by the fired head of the Texas Funeral
Service Commission. He is accused of impeding an investigation of a
company that contributed to his gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Mike Jones called Eliza May's claims ''feeble and
of no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   May alleges she lost her job over an investigation of
Houston-based Service Corporation International. She filed her
wrongful termination lawsuit last year and amended it on Monday to
include Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses the Republican presidential candidate of
conspiring to interfere with the agency's 1998 investigation of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Defendant Bush directed, approved of, ratified, condoned
and/or knowingly permitted his staff to intervene improperly'' in
the investigation, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Service Corporation International, one of the world's largest
funeral home and cemetery operators, is headed by Bush family
friend Robert Waltrip. He contributed $45,000 to Bush's
gubernatorial campaigns, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip also served as a trustee for the George H. W. Bush
Presidential Library in College Station and donated more than
$100,000 through his company toward construction.
</P>
<P>
   May was investigating possible violations of funeral home
regulations, including whether SCI was using unlicensed embalmers.
The funeral home board's complaint review committee voted to assess
more than 20 of SCI's affiliated funeral homes fines totaling
$450,000.
</P>
<P>
   May was fired after Waltrip met with Bush's top aide Joe
Allbaugh, to complain about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, May was twice called to meet with
Allbaugh, who demanded more information about the investigation. At
the end of one session, he said, ''This isn't going anywhere,'' the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorneys sought to question Bush in a deposition last
August, but their subpoena was dismissed by District Judge John
Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our understanding this lawsuit involves the same old
tired, worn out claims that have already been rejected by the
courts when an unjustified deposition was sought of the governor,''
Jones said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   May is a former Texas Democratic Party treasurer. State Attorney
General John Cornyn has said the lawsuit is politically motivated,
a claim denied by her attorney, Charles Herring of Austin.

<HEADLINE> Albright Tours Ancient Uzbekistan  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUKHARA, Uzbekistan (AP) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visited ancient mosques, a synagogue and an artisan
community during a tour today of the city of Bukhara that stressed
Uzbekistan's cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took a break from the more thorny political meetings of
her five-day Central Asia tour to view this 2,500-year-old desert
city under a scorching sun. The overall trip is aimed at promoting
U.S. policy in a region known for its booming drug trade, outbreaks
of extremism and frequent neglect of democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the visit to Bukhara today and the Uzbek city
Samarkand on Monday were intended to ''underline the importance of
cultural traditions to the history of this region and the important
role they play in our understanding of modern day Uzbekistan.''
</P>
<P>
   She also reiterated warnings that the fight against narcotics
and terrorism must not involve human rights abuses, and repeated
her criticism of Uzbekistan's resistance to post-Soviet reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not yet producing what we want in terms of democracy and
market systems,'' she said while visiting the U.S. Embassy in the
Uzbek capital, Tashkent, this morning.
</P>
<P>
   She then traveled to Bukhara, which has been ruled by Greeks,
Arabs and Genghis Khan, and was the capital of the first
independent Central Asian state in the 10th century.
</P>
<P>
   Albright visited a synagogue, once the center of one of Central
Asia's largest Jewish communities. Bukhara Jews once numbered in
the tens of thousands but now there are only 900 left, the rest
having emigrated largely for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She also toured an artisan center which was set up with U.S. aid
money.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met later in Tashkent with President Islam Karimov, who
has ruled his nation with an iron hand, uprooting Islamic movements
and other opposition groups. Karimov says harsh secular rule is
needed to prevent Islamic fundamentalists from taking over.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said she pushed him strongly on the issue of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took on board the issues that I raised, he disagreed with
me and I disagreed with him,'' she said. ''We will continue to make
our case and we will continue to follow the events very
carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Uzbekistan has rich natural resources, but the majority of the
population lives in poverty, struggling to survive on an average
monthly salary that barely reaches $20. The nation's economic
development has been hampered by Soviet-style state controls which
include government regulation of the currency rate -- an obstacle to
regional economic cooperation and work with the International
Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Police Will Probe Music Mogul  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Police will investigate sexual misconduct
allegations against the president of Japan's top talent agency, a
lawmaker said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a parliamentary committee meeting last week, ruling party
legislator Yoshihide Sakaue demanded an inquiry into reported
allegations that talent agent Johnny Kitagawa had sex with several
of the teen-age boys at his talent agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although long rumored, the allegations about Kitagawa -- a
68-year-old music mogul behind dozens of top young male TV stars
over the last 30 years -- had never before surfaced in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Kitagawa and his agency, known as ''Johnny's Jimusho'' --
''Johnny's Office'' -- have repeatedly denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the Shukan Bunshun, one of Japan's most popular
weekly magazines, ran a series of articles alleging the agent had
sex with some of the boys, sometimes threatening to hamper their
careers unless they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Kitagawa is suing the magazine for libel.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the boys nor their families have said anything publicly
about the reported allegations. None of the boys cited in the
articles, nor their parents, have filed complaints with police or
the courts. The families also declined requests for interviews,
which were made through the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sakaue said he will propose this week to devote the next few
committee meetings to the allegations, including summoning Johnny's
officials to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''These children idolize these stars, but their dreams are being
broken unless they give in to the president's desires,'' Sakaue
said in an interview at his parliamentary office.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has only recently begun to recognize child abuse as a
serious problem. Teachers, doctors and neighbors have often turned
the other way despite obvious evidence of child abuse. Up to now,
police have remained passive about such complaints, Sakaue said.
</P>
<P>
   Although still relatively rare, courts are convicting more
people on charges of having sex with children.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet the Anti-Yeltsin  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- After a backslapping seven years dealing with
Boris Yeltsin, President Clinton will face a tougher summit partner
in Vladimir Putin -- but one who's likely to be more pragmatic and
more predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian president, who is to meet Clinton in a June 4-5
summit in Moscow, is an often stern-faced leader who keeps his
emotions in check -- at least in public -- and relaxes by practicing
judo. He is unlikely to engage in the kind of boisterous
camaraderie that Yeltsin lavished on Clinton, calling him ''Bill''
and stressing their personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say U.S.-Russian dealings, at least from the Russian
side, are likely to be more businesslike and formal now. Still,
though he may regard the United States with suspicion as he tries
to rebuild Russia's stature as a great power, Putin wants good
relations with the West, they add.
</P>
<P>
   ''His vision of Russia is a Russia that stands its ground,''
said Margot Light, a Russia scholar at the London School of
Economics. ''He is more of a hard-liner, but he's a man who
realizes he has to deal with the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Both qualities were on display during Putin's visit to London
over the weekend, when he addressed a major business forum. It was
a sign of his need to attract foreign investment, but he also
showed his immovable side, stonily rejecting Western accusations
that Russia has used excessive force in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Moscow was announced at a time when many
analysts say U.S.-Russian relations are at their lowest ebb since
the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have sparred over the U.S.-led bombing of
Yugoslavia and Iraq, Russia's ties to countries such as Iraq and
Iran and U.S. accusations of Russian corruption. And while Yeltsin
stressed relations with the United States, Putin appears ready to
focus more on Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Some say a tougher but more predictable negotiating partner
could be a relief. Yeltsin, enfeebled by age and illness, often
startled Western officials with his erratic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   German officials once watched in consternation as Yeltsin
grabbed a baton and wildly began conducting a military band. Irish
officials once waited in vain for Yeltsin to get off an airplane in
Shannon, Ireland. He later said he was sick.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's bonhomie ''had something unstatesmanlike about it,''
said Light, the Russia expert. ''People didn't always know how to
respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet that Putin will be more staid. It took visible
effort for him to call British Prime Minister Tony Blair by his
first name during a televised phone call. During the recent
presidential campaign, he often looked like he'd rather have been
somewhere else instead of mixing with ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The central topic of the summit will likely be arms control,
with Clinton seeking to overcome vociferous Russian objections to a
proposed U.S. missile defense system. The United States wants
Russia to permit modifications to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty so it can build a defense against ''rogue'' states such as
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia fears that the U.S. plan would undermine the deterrent
value of its own missiles. Putin has said that if the United States
backs out of the ABM treaty, he will tear up the START II arms
agreement ratified April 14 by the Russian parliament -- and all
other arms control agreements with Washington as well.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Clinton may find there is room for negotiation. One
tack could be offering Russia even deeper cuts in U.S. and Russian
nuclear arsenals under a START III treaty in return for ABM
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has less than a year left in office to achieve a legacy
on arms control. To get a deal, he may have to offer Putin a chance
to save face with some significant concession, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Putin needs ''some sort of step forward from Clinton'' to
overcome doubts in the Russian military, said Lilia Shevtsova, an
analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center.
</P>
<P>
   Putin may push for U.S. support in getting European governments
to let Russia stretch out repayment of some of its huge debt to the
West. Russia also hopes the International Monetary Fund, where the
United States has considerable influence, will unfreeze part of a
stalled $4.5 billion in loans.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 216;Dow Up 162  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks continued their dramatic
recovery from last week's selloff today, driving the Nasdaq
composite index more than 200 points higher. Blue-chip stocks also
advanced sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Nasdaq composite index was up 216.14
at 3,755.30, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 162.26 to
10,744.77.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 31.22 at 1,432.66.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks extended a rally that gained momentum in the final hour
of trading on Monday, leaving the Dow with a gain of 276.74 points
and the Nasdaq with a 217.87-point advance, its biggest single-day
point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was a dramatic turnaround from crushing losses last
week. Still, most analysts are saying it's too soon to declare a
full recovery from the carnage last week, when the U.S. stock
market lost nearly $2 trillion in value.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports provided a catalyst for buying today. Dow
component Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 11/16 to 81 7/16 after reporting
first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 7[ to 130[. The company, the world's largest maker of
computer chips, was expected to report its first-quarter earnings
after the 4 p.m. close of trading. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
raised its rating on Intel stock to ''strong buy'' from
''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, investors were favoring large-capitalization,
well-known technology names. Sun Microsystems rose 7 1/16 to 91
15/16 and Microsoft rose 4} to 80|.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government delivered a report that eased some
fears about inflation. The Commerce Department said housing
construction plummeted 11.2 percent in March, the biggest plunge in
six years, suggesting that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, the
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since last
June. The slowdown in housing starts offered some hope that the
rate increases are working, reducing the odds of steep increases
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts continue to expect a series of modest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher interest rates are clearly having an impact,'' said
Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities. ''But that
probably is not enough of a slowing to keep the Fed from pushing
interest rates higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rates
and inflation, benefited from the report. American Express rose 5\
to 139\ and J.P. Morgan rose 5} to 130}.
</P>
<P>
   The market's breadth improved, with more stocks joining in the
effort to rally. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 727.68
million shares, compared with 770.25 million at the same time
Monday. On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 20.35 to 479.61.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tribe Fights Drought, Rivals  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANAM, Kenya (AP) -- The impoverished people in this remote
corner of northwestern Kenya are fighting for their lives on three
fronts: in the north against Sudanese tribesmen, in the west
against Ugandan herdsmen and in the south against a rival Kenyan
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, the nomadic herdsmen are now battling
another dangerous enemy -- an 18-month-old drought that has already
killed 70 people and thousands of cattle, goats and donkeys, local
leaders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been living on the skins of dead animals,'' said
Awesit Dapal in the tiny community of Nanam 430 miles northwest of
the capital, Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s World Food Program estimates that some 2.7 million
Kenyans -- nearly 10 percent of the East African country's
population -- are threatened with food shortages caused by the same
drought that has parched parts of neighboring Ethiopia, Somalia,
Eritrea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Dapal, a tall Turkana tribeswoman with beads covering her neck
and her lower front teeth removed according to tribal custom, said
drought killed her year-old son and the last of her 10 camels last
month. It had already killed hundreds of sheep, she added.
</P>
<P>
   One of four wives of the same man, Dapal said the family's 24
children were now in danger. More than 300 people, including
Dapal's family, gathered Tuesday in dusty, parched Nanam for an aid
handout from the U.N. food agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the agency has twice distributed seven pounds of
maize to anyone who could make their way here. But in an area where
an AK-47 automatic rifle can be brought for seven cows and the
tribal histories are steeped in warrior culture, running an aid
operation is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Selling guns is a way of life,'' said Tom Ochieng, a WFP
official in Kenya, referring to the refugees from Ethiopia, Sudan
and Somalia who crisscross the region.
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of small arms since the 1980s, the price
of an AK-47 has shrunk to a half-dozen cows from as high as 50,
Ochieng said. By contrast, a Turkana man wishing to marry must pay
a bride price of 20 cows.
</P>
<P>
   Besides undermining the work of aid agencies, the insecurity in
the region is also a major cause of hunger.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the Turkana have ranged over vast tracts of land
in search of better grazing and more water for their livestock.
Now, they say it is not safe for them to move.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to migrate to water holes but now when we reach them
they are occupied by our enemies and we have to come back for
security,'' said Amoni Ebei, a community elder, his head decorated
with a hat adorned with ostrich feathers, part of a cow's tail and
orange clay.
</P>
<P>
   There have been light showers in Nanam this month, but according
to World Vision, they have only compounded the Turkana's problems.
The aid group said more than 3,000 cattle had died in Nanam and
neighboring Kakuma since the rain fell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have heard that some livestock died because they grazed too
quickly and got intestinal diseases and others died of pneumonia
because of the sudden drop in temperature,'' said Ton van Zutphen
of World Vision.
</P>
<P>
   While Kenya has enjoyed relative stability since it gained
independence from Britain in 1963, a government official said
President Daniel arap Moi's government was still unable to handle
the food shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government cannot cope on its own,'' said David Ethuro, a
local representative to parliament and the assistant minister for
labor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government had neglected the region and could
improve security by deploying more police and soldiers. He added
that the Turkana should be given guns so they can ''tackle the
problem'' of security.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Bertini, the U.N.'s special envoy to the region and
head of the WFP, has been on a weeklong tour to assess the needs of
some 12.4 million people threatened by drought and food shortages.

<HEADLINE> Reuters Revenues Up 8 Pct. in 1st Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British media and information company Reuters
Group reported an 8 percent increase in first-quarter revenues to
$1.31 billion, led by a strong performance in Instinet, the world's
largest electronic brokerage service.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters said, however, that it hasn't completed plans to sell
Instinet shares to the public, and added that the current
volatility in global stock markets probably will slow its efforts
to list its Internet Greenhouse Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stellar performance by Instinet has been particularly
notable in its non-U.S. business,'' chief executive Peter Job said,
in response to concerns expressed by analysts that Instinet relied
too heavily on trading volumes on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Job
affirmed that Reuters is still considering making an initial public
offering of shares in Instinet. Instinet posted a 58 percent
increase in revenues compared to the same period a year ago.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Wants 'Safe' Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By MEMLI KRASNIQI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The new commander of Kosovo's
international peacekeepers said Tuesday his top priority would be
creating a ''safe environment'' in a province defined by ethnic
hatred and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after NATO entered Kosovo to try to end fighting
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians, violence still claims lives
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Juan Ortuno of Spain on Tuesday took command of the
peacekeeping operation, known as KFOR. His group -- Eurocorps -- is
the first non-NATO unit to lead KFOR. Eurocorps is the new European
military bloc, whose members, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and
Luxembourg are also part of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Ortuno's predecessor, German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, urged
Kosovo's rival ethnic communities to end the rivalries that plunged
the province into ethnic warfare and led to the arrival of the
peacekeeping force after 78 days of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Ortuno, 60, said his main priority was, ''the provision of a
secure environment in Kosovo and to allow the continued return of
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of refugees, ethnic Albanian and Serbs alike, is a
delicate issue. Western countries have begun to send back refugees
and hundreds have returned in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials are concerned that Kosovo's shaky infrastructure
will be unable to cope with an influx of people without jobs and
sometimes without homes.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Serbs in the U.N. interim council, the de facto
government, is seen as a test for the international community's
ability to bring both sides together in a multiethnic society.
Moderate Serb leaders say they will withdraw from the council if
Serb refugees do not begin to return within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Ortuno stressed the importance of cooperation between the KFOR
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO commanders are worried about a newly formed rebel
group of ethnic Albanians who operate just outside Kosovo's eastern
administrative boundary in Serbia, but are believed to move freely
between Kosovo and Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   The group calls itself the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja
and Bujanovac, named after three predominantly ethnic Albanian
towns just outside Kosovo. It is comprised of fighters who say they
are trying to protect villagers in the region from attacks by Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Reinhardt urged both sides to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proper tools for a peaceful coexistence are not the use of
weapons; they are not the use of macho violence; and they are not
the harassment of your political opponents,'' he said. ''Practicing
confrontation, vengeance and ethnic hatred opens the province to
extremists, to chaos and to disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to recent violence against Kosovo's dwindling Serb
minority on the part of ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for the
mass crackdown ended last year by NATO air strikes, Reinhardt said
that the peacekeeping force and the United Nations ''came to Kosovo
to prevent a great injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not come here to see that same injustice inflicted on a
different group of people,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, Gen.
Wesley Clark, called on all of Kosovo's people to ''halt a cycle of
violence'' and work together to create peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be too early to expect ideal harmony, but it is
certainly too late to accept any continuing violence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Letourneau Gets Favorable Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Mary Kay Letourneau, convicted of child rape for
a relationship with a former grade-school student who fathered two
of her children, may earn royalties from books, movies and
interviews, an appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Overturning sentencing conditions imposed by a King County
judge, the state Court of Appeals ruled Monday that Letourneau
could not be barred from profiting by selling her story as part of
her sentence. The appellate court also ruled that Letourneau could
visit with her six children without supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Letourneau, 38, serving a 7{-year prison term for second-degree
child rape, is reportedly working on an autobiography that
describes her relationship with Vili Fualaau that began when he was
12 and she was a married mother of four. The boy earlier had been a
grade-school pupil of hers in a suburban Seattle school district.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did not address Washington state's ''Son of
Sam'' law, which bars convicted criminals from profiting from their
crimes. But Letourneau's attorney said Tuesday it is unlikely that
prosecutors would try to block his client under that law, since the
original Son of Sam law in New York state was struck down by the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prosecutor or the (state) attorney general's office would
have to ask, 'Is there any possible way we can argue with a
straight face that our law is meaningfully different than the Son
of Sam law that was struck down?''' attorney James Lobsenz said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Supreme Court's decision in the New York case, ''there
is no reason for anybody to be motivated enough to try to enforce
the law'' in Washington state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   County prosecutors were considering whether to appeal the
ruling, and no decision had been made on whether to invoke the
state law, spokesman Dan Donohoe said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's law was passed in 1977, after reports that publishers
were offering ''Son of Sam'' serial killer David Berkowitz huge
sums of money for the rights to his story.
</P>
<P>
   The original law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in
1991 on free speech grounds. New York then enacted a revised
version, which remains on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Letourneau's daughters fathered by Fualaau -- one when
Letourneau was free on a suspended sentence under condition that
she have no contact with him -- are in the custody of the Fualaau's
mother. Letourneau's four older children are in the custody of her
former husband.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Fualaau, 16, and his mother filed claims for damages
exceeding $1 million from Des Moines, a suburb south of Seattle,
and the Highline School District, saying police and school
officials failed to protect him from the teacher's sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Fualaau, his mother and Letourneau characterized
the relationship as a love affair. Lawyers have not said whether
there was a falling-out between Letourneau and the family.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted that several mental-health experts had
recommended that Letourneau be prohibited from contacting news
organizations because she was using the publicity to further seduce
and exploit Fualaau.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the prohibition against financial gain did not stop
Letourneau from seeking attention, and ''there is no showing in
this record that Letourneau committed second-degree rape of a child
in order to profit from telling her story,'' the opinion stated.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Gains in European technology, media and telecom
stocks late Tuesday reversed early losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies rose
4.66 points, or 1.3 percent, to 372.81.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, ended up 5.17 points at
419.84. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was up 82.2 points at
5061.9 and the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index up 82.4 points at 4818.0.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan-European technology index Easdaq was up 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among key movers, Vodafone Airtouch was up 6.0 percent, COLT
Telecom was up 5.4 percent, STMicroelectronics rose 3.4 percent,
Siemens up 3.1 percent, and Deutsche Telekom up 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the Ifo index of business sentiment, released
Tuesday, fell unexpectedly, with slightly worse current conditions
and expectations compared with February, apparently because of
European Central Bank rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is worrying is that the German economy is seemingly
already beginning to struggle, since it was only last year that it
began to grow at above-trend after a substantial period of
sub-trend growth,'' said Neil Parker, senior European economist at
Royal Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But other observers said the small drops in both the sentiment
and prospects components of the Ifo index don't signal an early end
to German economic growth, and will reduce pressure on the European
Central Bank to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index ended up 0.1 percent to 7,196.49.
Allianz rose 0.2 percent and Commerzbank was up 2.8 percent.

   The Paris CAC-40 Index was up 1.4 percent to 6,147.44, with
Canal Plus, Equant and France Telecom leading gainers.

   Housing Starts Fall 11.2 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction, dampened by an upswing
in mortgage rates, took its biggest dive in six years last month --
down 11.2 percent from the previous month. Economists said the
plunge won't stop the Federal Reserve from pushing interest rates
higher to slow the speeding economy and keep inflation under
control. Builders began work on new homes at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.60 million in March, the Commerce Department said
today. It marked the sharpest one-month drop since January 1994,
when housing starts fell by 17 percent. Housing starts were up 3.6
percent in February.

   Finance Ministers Hasten Debt Relief

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Echoing a major cause of demonstrators who
failed to shut them down, finance ministers from around the world
acted at their spring meeting to hasten debt relief for poor
countries. While the thousands of protesters failed to stop the
work of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, they drew
public attention to their complaints that the two institutions have
failed to alleviate global poverty and should be abolished. For
their part, IMF, the World Bank and Washington police officials
took satisfaction in the avoidance of violent confrontations and
destruction of property such as occurred in Seattle last fall at
the World Trade Organization meeting.

   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of

program continued to pay off. Caterpillar earned $258 million, or
73 cents a share, in the first three months of the year, up from
$205 million, or 57 cents a share, for the same period in 1999.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected

million, or $1.16 a share, for the January-March period compared
with $160.6 million, or $1.01 a share in the same period a year

   NEW YORK (AP) -- First-quarter earnings at The McGraw-Hill Cos.
nearly doubled on increased advertising in Business Week magazine

division. Not counting a one-time gain from the sale of a business,
McGraw-Hill earned $47.4 million in the first quarter, or 24 cents
a share, easily eclipsing the 14 cents a share forecast by stock
analysts. Revenues rose 12 percent to $802.5 million. McGraw-Hill

expectations and Bank One shares rose on the New York Stock
Exchange. Net profits for the first three months of 2000 were $689
million, or 60 cents a share, down from $1.151 billion, or 96 cents

yesterday after German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp AG failed to raise

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gun Rules Affects Businesses  </HEADLINE>
By TRUDY TYNAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- Vincent DelValle has guns -- lots of
guns. But like other gun dealers in Massachusetts, he just can't
sell all of them.
</P>
<P>
   DelValle, manager of Strictly Defense in West Springfield, has
been forced to alter his business in the two weeks since the
nation's toughest handgun safety regulations took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's killing the small dealers,'' said DelValle. ''We are
stuck with thousands of dollars in guns we can't sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The only new handguns that can be sold here under the consumer
protection regulations announced April 3 are some models made by
Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   That means even the high-end models of Glocks and SIG-Sauers
used by Massachusetts' police would not pass muster if they were
being sold to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules ban cheap handguns and require childproof locks on
any handgun sold in the state. They also require safety warnings
with each handgun, tamper-resistant serial numbers and indicators
on semiautomatic handguns that tell if a bullet is in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Used handguns, police weapons and models made before September
1998 are exempt from the regulations that went into effect after
manufacturers, including Smith &AMP; Wesson, lost a two-year court
fight to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly realizes many gun manufacturers
don't meet the regulations -- yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our hope that all companies will comply,'' said Ann
Donlan, a spokeswoman for Reilly. ''But there is no going back as
far as we are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Some major gunmakers say they've been sidelined by such things
as how many serial numbers are now required on the weapon and the
minimum force needed to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in the details,'' said Gary Mehalik, marketing manager
for Miami-based Taurus, which has been selling pistols equipped
with an internal trigger lock since 1997. ''We are able to comply
in most regards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taurus, and Glock -- which makes the guns that Boston police
carry -- and SIG-Sauer -- which arms the state police -- have all run
afoul of a requirement that it take at least 10 pounds of force to
pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Smith &AMP; Wesson's lighter guns, including its popular
Sigma line, also fail to meet the 10-pound pull test that is aimed
at helping to prevent a child from firing the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In part because more women are buying guns, most guns are now
sold with a trigger pull of 4 to 6 pounds, with target pistols
having pulls as light as 2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Reh, a spokesman for Beretta USA, based in Accokeek, Md.,
said Beretta had been trying to comply with the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, everyone is styling themselves as experts in
gun design and we are on the brink of ending up with a confused mix
of state, local and federal laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Callaghan, of Callaghan's Firearms in Marlboro, is one
of several gun dealers who have pulled all their new handguns off
the shelves in response to the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some room for interpretation of the new
regulations, but Callaghan is taking no chances. ''I am not going
to jeopardize my business and life savings for a fast buck,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Russian, Ukraine Presidents Meet  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The presidents of Ukraine and Russia
pledged Tuesday to deepen cooperation in arms production and
building nuclear reactors, but left other pressing problems between
their neighboring nations unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Ukraine late Monday
on the last leg of his first foreign trip since he was elected last
month, a journey that also took him to Britain and Belarus. He was
accompanied by Russia's foreign and defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will consider everything that has been created so far as a
good base for developing Ukrainian-Russian relations,'' Putin said
after meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma said he was ''deeply satisfied'' with the talks, adding
that Putin's visit had a highly symbolic meaning for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite a series of problems in Russian-Ukrainian relations
... we found a way today to solve them in the future,'' Kuchma
said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks at the ornate Mariyinsky Palace in downtown Kiev
touched on cooperation in arms production. Russia and Ukraine were
major arms producers in the Soviet era and now often compete for
export contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said Russia was willing to help Ukraine complete two
new nuclear reactors meant to compensate for the planned closure of
the Chernobyl power plant, site of the world's worst nuclear
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is Ukraine's main trade partner, but volume has dropped
17 percent since Russia's 1998 financial crisis to about $10.4
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Ukraine and Russia have been troubled since
the 1991 Soviet collapse. A key rift has been over the ex-Soviet
Black Sea Fleet and the mainly ethnic Russian Crimean peninsula.
Many Russian politicians say Sevastopol, the fleet's Crimean home
base, should belong to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements were reached on dividing the fleet in 1997, but
tensions remain.
</P>
<P>
   Putin avoided politically charged remarks and said the city was
a ''sacred place'' for both nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine's huge debt for Russian natural gas supplies featured
prominently in Tuesday's talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine says the debts total at least $1.4 billion, but Russian
gas officials say the figure stands at $2.1 billion. Russia also
accuses Ukraine of stealing gas from export pipelines headed
through Ukraine to European markets.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma blamed gas companies for the thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian officials expect Putin to take a tough stance toward
gas thefts and debt repayment.
</P>
<P>

   LONDON (AP) -- A state-run nuclear company on Tuesday replaced
eight directors and hired a new safety chief following a critical
government report and a series of problems at a reprocessing plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a wakeup call,'' said Norman Askew, the new
chief executive of the state-run company, British Nuclear Fuels
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Askew was appointed in February after a report by the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate complained of a ''lack of safety
culture'' at the Sellafield reprocessing plant.
</P>
<P>
   However, uncertainty remained over whether the northwest England
plant can regain the confidence of foreign customers and resolve a
current dispute with Japan, which bought a consignment of fuel with
falsified records.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the plant was shut down after news that workers
falsified records about the quality of the consignment of uranium
and plutonium mixed oxide fuel delivered to Japan's Kansai Electric
Power Company.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland and Germany have halted fuel shipments to Sellafield
since the revelation about the falsified consignment -- which Japan
wants to send back.
</P>
<P>
   Five employees were fired, and all staff are undergoing
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   In a report called Going Forward Safely, British Nuclear Fuels
announced the shake-up of managers and management style, and the
appointment of 70 extra staff to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   Askew, who said it would take up to two years to implement all
the recommended changes, did not rule out taking back the
consignment from Japan.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Arms Sales Position  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China called on the United States to end all arms
sales to the rival Taiwanese government Tuesday, a day after
Washington went part way in meeting China's demands by deciding not
to sell Taiwan advanced Aegis destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   Word that President Clinton will forgo the Aegis sale
disappointed Taiwanese leaders, but it brought hope for a cooling
of tensions with China. In Washington, it sparked worries of a
fight with Congress over support for the island.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, which has been trying to isolate Taiwan to pressure
it into unifying with the mainland after 51 years of separation,
Clinton's move was seen as insufficient. While denying Taiwan the
Aegis-equipped warships, U.S. officials said they would sell the
island long-range radar to detect missile launches as well as
provide training and technical help.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese government urges the U.S. government ... to stop
all arms sales to Taiwan, including the long-range warning radar
and Aegis, so as not to obstruct the improvement of China-U.S.
relations,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi told
reporters at a briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sun reminded Washington to abide by an 18-year-old agreement on
limiting arms sales to Taiwan. He said Beijing had ''taken note''
of reports on Washington's decision on Aegis.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's decision to withhold Aegis marked the first of two
successes for Chinese diplomatic pressure this week. Rallying
developing nations, Beijing also prevailed Tuesday in blocking the
U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva from discussing a U.S.
motion to censure China for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its pressure campaign against Taiwan, Beijing in
recent months has stepped up threats to attack the island if it
moved toward outright independence. Chinese officials also have
accused Washington of emboldening separatist sentiment through arms
sales -- an argument Sun repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The destroyers had come in for particular criticism. At one
point a senior Chinese official indirectly hinted that China might
attack the warships if they were sold to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are equipped with the Aegis
system, which includes an advanced radar, the SPY-1, able to search
for, track and engage more than 100 targets simultaneously. The
ships also come with Tomahawk cruise missiles like those used
against Iraq and Yugoslavia. China fears the system would undercut
the tactical edge drawn from its rapidly growing arsenal of
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing Taiwan's annual arms shopping list, the Pentagon
recommended that the administration put off Taiwan's request to buy
four of the billion-dollar apiece destroyers, as well as submarines
and anti-submarine aircraft, to avoid angering China.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, Washington's reluctance to sell the warships was seen
as a possible lift to strained relations between China and the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a win-win situation'' for Taiwan and China,
said Andrew Yang, a Taipei-based senior military analyst at the
Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a think tank with close ties to
Taiwan's Defense Ministry. He said Beijing would have been furious
about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Selling Aegis this year would have been particularly
provocative. Beijing is already nervous about Taiwan's newly
elected president, Chen Shui-bian, whose party has previously
backed formal independence. Chen, who will be sworn in May 20, is
under pressure to improve relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's decision also added to the debate over what
Taiwan needs to fend off Beijing. While China is believed to be
years away from having sufficient force to invade the island,
foreign military analysts have criticized Taiwan's military for not
making good use of the advanced weaponry already purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Vocal Taiwan backers in Congress, where support for the island
runs deep, criticized the Clinton administration for compromising
Taiwan's defense. A spokesman for Sen. Jesse Helms, the
conservative North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, suggested Tuesday that the administration may
have violated a U.S. law requiring Washington help Taiwan maintain
an adequate defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Republican leader, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi,
is expected to call for a vote on an arms package for Taiwan. The
Senate is also due to take up a measure, the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act, that would strengthen ties between the U.S. and
Taiwanese militaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has threatened a veto, and China has
warned that approval of the act would harm relations.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks continued their dramatic
recovery from last week's selloff today, driving the Nasdaq
composite index more than 200 points higher. Blue-chip stocks also
advanced sharply.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 204.74 at 3,743.90, while the Dow
Jones industrial average rose 129.37 to 10,711.88.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 28.83 at 1,430.27.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks extended a rally that gained momentum in the final hour
of trading on Monday, leaving the Dow with a gain of 276.74 points
and the Nasdaq with a 217.87-point advance, its biggest single-day
point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was a dramatic turnaround from crushing losses last
week. Still, most analysts are saying it's too soon to declare a
full recovery from the carnage last week, when the U.S. stock
market lost nearly $2 trillion in value.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Investors kept their focus on companies with proven track
records, shunning newer issues and stocks in the more speculative
Internet sector. But in a sign that some investors were dropping
their guard, biotechnology company Amgen returned to life, rising
4{ to 57~.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports provided a catalyst for buying today. Dow
component Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 13/16 to 81 9/16 after reporting
first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 4} to 127}. The company, the world's largest maker of
computer chips, was expected to report its first-quarter earnings
after the 4 p.m. close of trading. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
raised its rating on Intel stock to ''strong buy'' from
''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, investors were favoring large-capitalization,
well-known technology names. Sun Microsystems rose 6| to 91{ and
Microsoft rose 4 5/16 to 80 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government delivered a report that eased some
fears about inflation. The Commerce Department said housing
construction plummeted 11.2 percent in March, the biggest plunge in
six years, suggesting that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, the
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since last
June. The slowdown in housing starts offered some hope that the
rate increases are working, reducing the odds of steep increases
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts continue to expect a series of modest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher interest rates are clearly having an impact,'' said
Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities. ''But that
probably is not enough of a slowing to keep the Fed from pushing
interest rates higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rates
and inflation, benefited from the report. American Express rose 5]
to 139] and J.P. Morgan rose 5[ to 130[.
</P>
<P>
   The market's breadth improved, with more stocks joining in the
effort to rally. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 863.59
million shares, compared with 915.95 million at the same time
Monday. On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 21.79 to 480.55.

<HEADLINE> Area 51 Web Site Not Responding  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA WAGGONER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Many Internet surfers ran into roadblocks
today when they tried to reach a Web site displaying the first
detailed satellite images to be made public of Area 51, the
supersecret Air Force test site that UFO buffs think is a
repository of alien technology.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a combination of too many people trying to log on and
some hackers, as the company said? Or a case for ''The X-Files''?
</P>
<P>
   The photos of the Nevada test site don't show any readily
apparent signs of flying saucers or little green men among the Air
Force base buildings and roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh-based Aerial Images Inc. -- in collaboration with Kodak,
Digital Equipment Corp., Autometric Inc. and the Russian agency
Sovinformsputnik -- posted five images of the hush-hush desert
proving ground on the Web on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first glimpse into the most secret training and
testing facility for the Air Force,'' said John Hoffman, president
of Aerial Images.
</P>
<P>
   However, the partners' Web site, http://www.terraserver.com,
didn't respond much of the time today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The site is being hammered (by people trying to log on), and
hackers are attacking it,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of hackers trying to penetrate the site's
firewall, the software designed to prevent unauthorized outsiders
from tampering with computer files. They couldn't reach the data,
but they were able to slow the system, Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Area 51 photos had attracted an estimated 3
million ''page views'' to the Web site since Monday morning,
compared with the normal usage of 700,000 to 800,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the images is free; downloading them costs $8.95 and up.
Kodak will make prints for $20 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force only recently acknowledged that Area 51 -- the
Groom Dry Lake Air Force Base -- even exists. The 8,000-square-mile
base is 75 miles northwest of Las Vegas, in the rugged Nellis
Range.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s, the base has been
the testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the
SR-71 Blackbird, the F-117A stealth fighter and B-2 stealth bomber.
</P>
<P>
   The site is known as Area 51 among UFO aficionados because that
was the base's designation on old Nevada test site maps. Some
believe alien vehicles, unidentified flying objects, are hidden at
the base and their parts are copied for U.S. prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial Images launched a Russian satellite in 1998 to map the
Earth's surface under an open-skies agreement signed in 1992 by 24
nations, including the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The images have resolution good enough to distinguish a car from
a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Several government agencies are aware of the new images and
haven't responded, said Hoffman, 52. ''I've had no feedback from
anybody that indicates anybody gives a hoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We acknowledge having an operating site there, and the work is
classified,'' Air Force spokeswoman Gloria Cales said. The work
involves ''operations critical to the U.S. military and the
country's security.''
</P>
<P>
   The images show hundreds of buildings including living quarters,
tennis courts, a baseball field, a track and a swimming pool, plus
craters in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Visible roads are not paved and there are no parking lots; buses
are the only visible vehicles. Some of the roads appear to run into
cliffs, suggesting an underground network.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, creator of ''The X-Files,'' apparently was
skeptical when Hoffman told him of the satellite images. Some of
the show's favorite themes are UFOs and secret government
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''He clearly didn't believe me,'' Hoffman said. ''From his tone,
you could tell he didn't believe me that we had Area 51 and we had
the whole area covered.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. OKs New Antibiotic  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors are getting an important new weapon in
the growing battle against drug-resistant infections: The
government on Tuesday approved a long-awaited drug called Zyvox,
described as the world's first entirely new type of antibiotic in
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox seems to cure some infections impervious to all other
antibiotics, even that longtime drug of last resort called
vancomycin. Consequently, Zyvox could help hundreds, perhaps even
thousands, of life-threatening infections every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes at a time when we were literally running out of
antibiotics,'' said Dr. Robert C. Moellering Jr.,
physician-in-chief of Boston's Beth Israel-Deaconness Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it is being made in both oral and intravenous forms --
meaning when hospitals discharge infected patients, they might go
home with pills instead of a troublesome IV unit, said Dr. Dennis
L. Stevens of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zyvox is just a superb drug,'' said Stevens, who helped test
it. ''It's good ... to treat some pretty nasty infections with an
oral drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that doctors should reserve Zyvox for only the
worst infections and those suspected of being antibiotic-resistant,
or bacteria will quickly evolve to make Zyvox useless.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my wish that Zyvox is used primarily in hospitals,'' not
when primary care physicians just hand out a routine antibiotic
prescription, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Zyvox on Tuesday for
use by adults with pneumonia and skin infections, including those
caused by a tough-to-treat form of staph bacteria, and with deadly
infections caused by a supergerm named ''Enterococcus faecium.''
</P>
<P>
   This infamous germ frequently invades surgical wounds and also
causes serious abdominal, urinary tract and heart valve infections.
Worse, enterococcal infections are growing increasingly impervious
to antibiotics. About a quarter of enterococcal infections among
intensive-care patients last year were untreatable by even
vancomycin -- a stunning 43 percent increase from the mid-1990s,
said FDA antibiotic chief Dr. Gary Chikami.
</P>
<P>
   But in a clinical trial of 145 people with vancomycin-resistant
enterococcal infections, Zyvox cured 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In additional studies, Zyvox helped other infections as well as
vancomycin or other standard treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox isn't the only option for untreatable infections: The FDA
last fall approved competitor Aventis' Synercid as the nation's
first alternative when vancomycin fails. Synercid, an intravenous
drug, is a combination of two older European antibiotics that
delivers a one-two punch against bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Zyvox is a synthetic chemical designed from scratch
to fight germs at an entirely different point in their life cycle
than any other medicine -- a true surprise attack. It stops bacteria
from making protein, which in turn stops their growth so the body's
immune system can step in and finish them off, Moellering said.
</P>
<P>
   Known chemically as linezolid, it is the first in a long-awaited
class of antibiotics called oxazolidinones.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a magic bullet. Zyvox has been used experimentally
in only a few thousand people, yet doctors already have counted 15
Zyvox-resistant infections.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it fight all bacteria, only those known as
''gram-positive'' germs.
</P>
<P>
   But gram-positive bacteria are a huge public health threat. They
cause more than half of all serious infections treated in hospitals
worldwide, particularly the kind caught by patients while they're
in the hospital for some other problem.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox's main side effects are headache, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea, afflicting between 3 percent and 11 percent of patients,
the FDA said. The oral version caused more side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Zyvox can cause a decrease in blood platelets, so doctors
must monitor patients' blood, the FDA warned.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox patients should tell their doctors if they take
over-the-counter decongestants such as those containing
pseudoephedrine, or antidepressants such as Prozac, because Zyvox
can interact with such drugs to raise blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia said Zyvox would be available within a few weeks, but
refused to disclose the price except to say it was expected to be a
little lower than competitor Synercid, which costs $85 per
intravenous vial.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Michigan Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN PARK, Mich. (AP) -- A tenant in a senior citizens'
apartment shot two women to death and wounded at least one today
after fellow residents criticized his inappropriate language,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman remained at large early this afternoon as tenants
were told to stay in their apartments. Police cordoned off an area
around the building and continued to search the building hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were killed and one injured, Lincoln Park police Lt.
Thomas Karnes said. The injured person, a woman, was in critical
condition at Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital, said hospital spokesman
John Lewandowski.
</P>
<P>
   One witness told WXYZ that he heard about 15 shots; that could
not be immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment officials had summoned the man for a meeting after
other residents complained of his language, said Phyllis McLenon,
deputy director of the Lincoln Park Housing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very upset, and was very upset with some of the ladies
who were complaining about him,'' she told WDIV-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The man left the meeting and was gone for about 10 minutes --
then the building's maintenance man reported on a two-way radio
that the man was coming back shooting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   He shot one woman in the building office and another in the
doorway, McLenon said. Some people ran to the bathroom or scrambled
under a desk to hide.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting before the shooting, McLenon said, the man
''was very dissatisfied and making threats. ... He kept saying he
wouldn't have this character assassination and that he would take
care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said 114 people live in the 14-story building in this
Detroit suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Bowden, who lives in an apartment complex next to the
building, said someone came to her door around noon and told her to
stay inside and away from her windows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then I heard some shots. I saw a couple of cops hiding behind
trees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police used loudspeakers to get pedestrians out of the area,
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard (an officer) say 'Get out of the line of fire!''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   State and Melvindale police, as well as Wayne County sheriff's
deputies, were assisting at the scene, barricaded off in a
several-block radius around the building.
</P>
<P>
   At Raupp Elementary School roughly a half-mile away from the
shooting scene, principal Bernie Falahee said the shooting happened
as half of the school's 400 students were outside on lunch recess.
</P>
<P>
   They were ordered inside and the school was in a lockdown mode,
with no students being released unless their parents come to
retrieve them, Falahee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting for an all-clear,'' he said. ''We're orderly. We
have doors locked.''

<HEADLINE> UN Reaches Angola Violations Deal  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council reached agreement
Tuesday on a resolution warning it may take action against
countries that have violated sanctions against Angola's UNITA
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The council was expected to adopt the resolution at the
conclusion of an open debate Tuesday during which countries
implicated in a blunt report on the embargo violations were
expected to again defend their records.
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking report, issued last month, enumerated the
widespread violations of the U.N. fuel and arms embargo, and a ban
on rebel diamond exports, which enabled UNITA to restart a
20-year-old war with the government in December 1998, shattering a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended a host of measures to tighten the grip of
sanctions around UNITA, including a three-year arms embargo on
named countries that violated the weapons ban, followed by a
three-year probation.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution being considered Tuesday wouldn't impose any
immediate punishment on sanctions-busters. But the chairman of the
sanctions committee on Angola, Ambassador Robert Fowler of Canada,
said those implicated shouldn't take that omission as any
indication of the council's lack of resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The report by an independent panel alleged two sitting African
presidents, Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso and Gnassingbe Eyadema
of Togo, helped UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi with arms and fuel
shipments in exchange for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   And it accused Belgium of having such lax standards at its
Antwerp diamond market that rogue dealers were able to trade UNITA
gems with virtually no obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The countries implicated have denied the allegations, defended
their records and challenged the report's evidence, noting that it
relied heavily on information provided by rebel defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution would authorize a five-person monitoring
group to continue to gather information about alleged violations
and allow implicated countries to report back on ways they are
upholding the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The council this fall would then consider ''appropriate action''
against nations that violation U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Canada and Namibia, which is battling UNITA forces in Congo, had
wanted a stronger resolution that initially included a call for
countries to issue arrest warrants for people known to be helping
violate sanctions. That element was dropped from the final draft.
</P>
<P>
   But France sought to weaken the call for sanctions on the
sanctions violators, concerned about its former colonies and the
precedent that so-called secondary sanctions would make.
</P>
<P>
   French Ambassador Jean-David Levitte noted that several of the
implicated countries had already taken measures to correct any past
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not by multiplying the pariah states that we will give
incentives to these to return to the straight and narrow,'' Levitte
said.

<HEADLINE> Liberace Piano To Be Auctioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A player piano custom built for Liberace is to be
auctioned May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old, off-white wooden piano was expected to fetch
more than $100,000, said Sloan's Auctions in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The player piano, which is also a fully functioning piano, was
bought at a 1988 California estate sale by a collector who lives in
Coral Springs, Fla. It is one of seven pianos made for Liberace,
who died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   According to the entertainer's sister, this piano was his
favorite, said Albert Parker, vice president in Sloan's Miami
office.
</P>
<P>
   The famed pianist had the instrument built for entertaining
guests at his Las Vegas home. Liberace also recorded his own
arrangements on the piano to create 45 player piano rolls, Parker
said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probing Ill. Gov. Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES WEBB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal prosecutors investigating a
licenses-for-sale scandal that began when Gov. George Ryan was
secretary of state are now also looking into whether Ryan's aides
interfered with a state police probe of his 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1998, state police looked into whether Ryan employees
were improperly campaigning for him on state time. The Ryan
campaign was cleared of wrongdoing about a month before the
election. But during the probe, officials from the secretary of
state's inspector general's office were allowed to sit in on the
state police interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors now want to know whether Ryan aides
interfered with the probe, according to sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   At least five current or former members of the state police
internal investigation division, which conducted the 1998 campaign
probe, have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're looking for interference,'' said a source familiar
with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest offshoot of an investigation into a scandal in
which truckers paid bribes to obtain commercial driver's licenses
from the secretary of state's office, which oversees the motor
vehicle bureau.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 31 people have been charged, ranging from low-level
government employees to driving school operators, and 25 have
pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Ryan's anti-corruption office at that time, former
Inspector General Dean Bauer, was indicted in February on charges
he covered up wrongdoing in the secretary of state's office to save
Ryan from embarrassment. Bauer has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He has said he
knew nothing about the payoffs, even though officials say $170,000
in bribe money ended up in his campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Culloton, a spokesman for Ryan, had no immediate comment
on the latest development.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's involvement in the campaign probe posed
a potential problem because it could have suggested to employees
being questioned that their statements would be relayed to their
superiors in the secretary of state's office. It also provided an
avenue for alerting potential wrongdoers to where the state police
investigation was going.
</P>
<P>
   Police ''felt their investigation was being compromised and I
think that was an accurate feeling,'' said Allan F. Lolie Jr., a
special prosecutor on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The key contact in the inspector general's office during the
state police investigation, Ernest Neumann, said the agreement that
allowed officials from the inspector's general office to be present
was aimed at limiting the probe so the matter could be settled
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sure wasn't going to do anything to hinder'' the
investigation, Neumann said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hard-Liners Seek Paper Curb  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-liners who dominate Iran's outgoing
parliament passed legislation Tuesday to give the judiciary more
teeth in curbing outspoken newspapers, striking back yet again in
their power struggle against reformers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is part of an effort by hard-liners to cling to
power and contain a hugely popular movement for change that began
after President Mohammad Khatami's 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   One bill forbids banned newspapers from publishing under a
different name, a practice pro-reform papers resorted to in the
past after being shut down by the hard-line judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers passed another bill allowing the courts to prosecute
both the director of a publication and the writer for any articles
deemed offensive. Under current law, only directors are held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Movahedi Savoji, a hard-line legislator, told parliament
that ''domestic enemies'' were undermining the revolutionary
principles in the name of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have strong criticism for the president's position and
slogans ... the president should clearly define what he means by a
civil society and freedom,'' he said in a speech broadcast live on
state radio.
</P>
<P>
   The bills must be approved by the Guardians Council to become
law -- considered a formality, since the body is controlled by
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners have also used the council's powers to tamper with
results of the Feb. 18 legislative elections, which the reformists
overwhelmingly won. The new Majlis, or parliament, was supposed to
convene May 27, but that looks increasingly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The elections, in which the reformists won 170 seats of the 290
seats, have yet to be endorsed by the council -- a necessary step
before the new deputies can take their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the council -- which has the constitutional power to
declare election results invalid -- has ordered recounts in several
constituencies, including Tehran, where reformists won 29 of the 30
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The council also annulled the election of 11 reformist
candidates. Two of those seats, in the towns of Khalkhal and
Sarvestan, were given to hard-line candidates. The nine others will
be decided in a run-off, the council said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The council's behavior is an overt ... battle against the
reformists,'' said Mahmoud Sadri, editor of the reformist Hammihan
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that the council's motive is to weaken the
reformist majority in the parliament, and give a boost to the
hard-liners,'' Sadri said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the judiciary upheld the conviction of Mahmoud Shams,
editor-in-chief of the reformist Asr-e-Azadegan daily, giving him a
2{-year jail term on charges of ''insulting religious sanctities.''
Shams has been a leading voice for press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every leading reformist journalist, including Fereydoun
Verdinejad, head of the state news agency, has been summoned for
questioning by the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami wants to ease the political, cultural and social
restrictions imposed by the clergy's rule, but the hard-liners say
that would dilute the ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution. The
reformists have little power to stop the conservative clergy, which
control the judiciary, the military and the broadcast networks.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Parents Sue NYC for $61M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The parents of Amadou Diallo on Tuesday sued the
city and the four policemen involved in their son's shooting death
for $61 million -- including $1 million for each of the 41 bullets
fired.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $20 million was for pain and suffering endured
since the Feb. 4, 1999 killing of their son. Nineteen of the 41
shots struck the unarmed Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, and his father,
Saikou.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a West African immigrant, was shot as he stood in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. The four white officers
in the Street Crime Unit testified at their jury trial they mistook
the wallet Diallo pulled out of his pocket for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers were acquitted of murder charges in February.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that the four ''intentionally, wantonly,
recklessly and maliciously'' opened fired.
</P>
<P>
   It also claimed the shooting resulted from aggressive racial
profiling practices sanctioned by police.
</P>
<P>
   The city's corporation counsel did not immediately return calls
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Trauma Centers Cut Car Crash Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Trauma center networks can save the lives of
car-crash victims, but only after being in place for at least 10
years, which is how long it takes to work out the kinks in the
system, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Trauma center systems are designed to give people with serious
injuries quick access to hospitals with specialized teams of
doctors. An accident victim in an area with a trauma system would
be taken to the closest trauma center -- which would not always be
the closest hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In a study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association, researchers looked at 22 states that set up or had
existing trauma center systems from 1979 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although car-crash deaths fell nationwide throughout the period,
the death rate after 15 years was 8 percent lower in states with
trauma center systems, the researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be no reduction in crash deaths within the
first 10 years of trauma system implementation. Declines were noted
after 10 years and became statistically significant at 13 years,
said the researchers, led by Dr. Avery B. Nathens of the University
of Washington's Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over time, trauma center protocols mature, triage policies are
implemented, referral patterns and transfer policies change, and
ultimately patient outcome improves,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   About 44 states have some sort of trauma system in place, said
Harry Teter, executive director of the American Trauma Society, a
group of trauma centers and health-care professionals.
</P>
<P>
   While the 10 years noted in the study might seem lengthy, it
takes a long time to develop an efficient trauma system, Teter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be organized from communities on up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers noted other factors could have contributed to
the decline in deaths during the study period, including increasing
use of air bags and crackdowns on drunken driving and failure to
use seatbelts.
</P>
<P>
   But even when they took those into account, the benefits seen
with trauma systems remained.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined data involving victims who were
front-seat occupants of a vehicle and ages 15 to 74.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were some 6 million police-reported motor
vehicle crashes nationwide and about 41,300 deaths. Crashes are the
leading cause of trauma deaths in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prevention is obviously the key here,'' Nathens said. ''But
once the crash occurs, you need a system to get the right person to
the right place in the shortest amount of time possible.''

<HEADLINE> Hirshhorn Shows Dali's Serious Side  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Salvador Dali, whom many remember as that clownish
self-promoter with the upturned mustachios, is getting a highly
serious exhibit at the Hirshhorn Museum beginning Wednesday for his
work on art as optical illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Dali's surrealistic signature--soft, floppy pocket watches,
draped over a tree branch--are not to be seen. But there's a floppy
cello, and flexible piano keyboards like ocean waves.
</P>
<P>
   Just as surrealistic is a big, dripping eye, one of five
paintings Dali made for the dream sequences in Alfred Hitchcock's
film ''Spellbound.''
</P>
<P>
   The painter reported in his one-man newspaper, the Dali News,
that his Hollywood agent told him:
</P>
<P>
   ''They adore all that you are doing at the Selznick studios, but
I want to caution you, for the moment they want to use you only in
small drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Egoism and clownishness find a place too, complete with
mustachios, in a picture called ''The Sun and Dali.''
</P>
<P>
   Art as optical illusion, the point of the exhibit, comes across
in such work as ''Skull of Zurbaran,'' a human skull that Dali
makes up with cubes and other geometric forms. Francisco de
Zurbaran was a Spanish painter of the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   A whole room in the show illustrates Dali's experiments with an
early form of three-dimensional illusion. Two identical pictures,
done from slightly different angles, can be viewed to give a 3-D
effect. In the 1900s a favorite parlor pastime was to experience a
primitive kind of virtual reality by viewing pairs of travel
photos, shot from slightly different angles, through a hand-held
stereoscope.
</P>
<P>
   The Hirshhorn has arranged ingenious sets of mirrors for viewing
stereoscopic pairs that Dali painted, including a harbor scene with
a huge female nude.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Zilczer, the Hirshhorn's curator of painting, called him
one of the great painters of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably true that because of the antics that he pulled
during his career and because of some of the incidents later in his
life, his reputation has somewhat declined,'' she said. ''And it is
our hope that an exhibition such as this will force a reappraisal
of the artist and his contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dali had interests in politics and history, too. A powerful
evocation of the Spanish Civil War bears a typical Dali title:
''Soft Construction with Boiled Beans,'' but shows parts of a human
body, strangling itself.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States when World War II broke out and
created a sculpture he called ''Nieuw Amsterdam,'' the name of New
York when it was a Dutch colony. It's a bronze bust, by another
artist, of White Eagle who resisted the confinement of Indians to
reservations. In his eyes Dali put tiny portraits of Dutch
burghers. They are apparently toasting the purchase of Manhattan
from a bottle of Coca Cola painted on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Dali's Optical Illusions'' will be at the Hirshhorn through
June 18. Admission is free, no tickets are required and the museum
has set aside a special entrance in anticipation of large crowds.
It recommends calling (202) 786-2122 for recorded information and
updates.
</P>
<P>
   The show travels to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art
in Edinburgh, July 23-Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Russian Militia Leader Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A pro-Russian Chechen militia leader said
Tuesday he was resigning, while the Kremlin said contacts with the
rebel republic's president were continuing but played down the
possibility of direct talks.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, meanwhile, sent new troops into the southern mountains
where Chechen rebels are concentrated, even as a top military
official said the major military actions of the 8-month-long war
are over.
</P>
<P>
   Bislan Gantamirov, a Chechen tapped by the Kremlin last fall to
lead a pro-Russian police force, said on RTR television that he
resigned because his force had been sidelined by Russian
paramilitary police.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary police have conducted operations that human
rights groups have said are often accompanied by looting, beatings
and arbitrary arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov is detested by the rebels as a traitor, and his
resignation could remove one of the many issues between the
insurgents and the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Gantamirov has played a chameleon role in
Chechnya's chaotic politics. A onetime ally of the late Chechen
separatist leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev, Gantamirov switched to
supporting Russia and formed a paramilitary force in the 1994-96
war.
</P>
<P>
   He became deputy prime minister in the Moscow-backed Chechen
government, but in 1996 was imprisoned for embezzling millions of
dollars Moscow provided for rebuilding Chechnya. Gantamirov was
released from prison in November and a week later, the Kremlin
appointed him head of the pro-Moscow Chechen State Council.
</P>
<P>
   He formed a militia, recruited in part from rebel defectors, and
it fought alongside Russian units in storming Grozny, the Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin's spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, said Tuesday that Moscow is continuing to talk with
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov through intermediaries in
exploring political solutions to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian leadership understands perfectly that exclusive
military means will not solve the Chechen problem,'' Yastrzhembsky
said. ''But without the military phase, it's impossible to use
political means.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia wants to see Maskhadov demonstrate goodwill by
handing over suspected terrorists and surrendering weapons before
talks begin -- conditions that could prove impossible for Maskhadov
because of his weak control over the many rebel bands.
</P>
<P>
   A Maskhadov aide, Felim Bezhayev, said the rebels are ready for
direct talks immediately, because it would accelerate ''the process
of settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The fierce battles of winter have subsided in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The ITAR-Tass news agency, citing the military press center in
Khankala near Grozny, said more than 3,000 paratroopers landed in
the Shatoi region on Tuesday. The area, deep in the southern
mountains, saw intense fighting this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The first deputy chief of the Russian general staff, Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov, denied that thousands of paratroopers were sent in,
but he told the Interfax news agency that troops in the region were
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''The talk is now that the war has finished -- large-scale
actions, the military part of the operation have been finished,''
he said at a news conference. Russia has claimed frequently that
the rebels are on the verge of defeat, but the fighters keep
mounting ambushes and attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After moving into Chechnya in September, Russian troops seized
about two-thirds of the republic in steady advances across the
northern flatlands. The Russians bogged down in the southern
mountains, the last major area still under rebel control.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya after weeks of
airstrikes, following an invasion of neighboring Dagestan by
Chechnya-based rebels. The rebels are also blamed for the apartment
bombings in Russia in September that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Fed: Foreign Banks Treated Fairly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, responding to complaints
from the European Union, said foreign banks are treated fairly
under new U.S. rules that permit banks to expand their services.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Europeans have raised concerns about
rules governing capital requirements for foreign banks that want to
expand beyond their core banking business to sell securities,
insurance and other services in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to be that this is a fair and flexible process, given
the number and wide variety of foreign banks that operate in the
United States,'' Fed Governor Laurence Meyer said in a letter to
John Mogg, director general for financial services with the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, dated Monday, was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The principle of national treatment requires that foreign
banks operating in the United States meet standards that are at
least comparable to those we apply to our own banks,'' the letter
said.

<HEADLINE> China Rips Rights Record Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States failed Tuesday in its latest bid
to have China's human rights record censured by the United Nations,
but Cuba, Iran and Iraq found themselves under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-nation commission voted 22-18 for a ''no action'' motion
proposed by Beijing to block discussion of a U.S. resolution
critical of the human rights situation in China. Twelve nations
abstained and one was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries, many from Africa and Asia, rallied to
Beijing's cause as they did in eight previous years. But the United
States insisted it succeeded in drawing attention to China's record
and said the margin of the vote was the narrowest in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It pokes a hole in the aura of immunity that only China has
enjoyed and conveys a sense that all nations have to look to the
commission before they confront their own people,'' U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Harold Koh said.
</P>
<P>
   China applauded the U.N. decision. Attempts by the United States
to censure it ''can lead nowhere but self-isolation and
self-defeat,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said in
remarks carried by China's official Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The human rights situation in China is the best ever in the
country's history,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after weeks of intense lobbying by both sides. The
U.S. text protested increased restrictions on Tibetans and the
''harsh crackdown'' on political opposition. It noted repression of
the Falun Gong spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, said he
was ''terribly disappointed'' and added that the European Union's
failure to lend strong backing to the U.S. efforts had been a key
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N. panel censured Cuba for the second
consecutive year, voting 21-18 to criticize it for ''the continued
violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.'' Fourteen
members abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba accused Washington of being the driving force behind the
action. Ambassador Carlos Amat said U.S. officials ''once again
wielded the strings of their occasional puppets,'' referring to the
Czech Republic and Poland, which proposed the motion.
</P>
<P>
   In another narrow vote, the commission kept Iran under scrutiny
for human rights abuses, even though it accepted that progress had
been made. The resolution passed 22-20, with 11 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates had less sympathy for neighboring Iraq, which they
condemned for its ''all-pervasive repression and oppression.'' No
nation supported Baghdad, although 21 abstained.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed without a vote to condemn ''the continuing pattern
of gross and systematic violations of human rights in Myanmar,''
also known as Burma, and expressed concern over abuses in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   With opposition only from Russia, the commission attacked
Yugoslavia's repression of the media and the political opposition,
arbitrary administration of justice and discrimination and violence
against ethnic minorities.

<HEADLINE> Texas Sheriff Bans Black Gloves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The sheriff has barred his deputies from
wearing black gloves after people complained that they make the law
officers look like thugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect my deputies to be aggressive against criminals,''
Sheriff Everett Rice said. ''But I don't want them walking around
looking like the Gestapo.''
</P>
<P>
   The black gloves are not part of the standard green and white
uniform. Deputies said they wear them only to protect their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said the ban will continue until someone can come up with a
non-threatening color.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Cal Dennie, a sheriff's spokesman, said he has two black
pairs that he bought himself and wears them when he is going into a
volatile situation where he might scrape his knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're for my own protection,'' Dennie said. ''You know how
it is today, not everybody is as clean as they should be. You have

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Has Record Close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq composite
index to its biggest point gain ever today as investors flocked
back to the names that were devastated by last week's rout.
Blue-chip stocks also advanced sharply.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq composite
index rose 254.08 to close at 3,743.24, while the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 179.94 to 10,762.45.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rally served as an exclamation point to big gains on
Monday, when stocks began recovering from last week's devastating
collapse. In just two sessions, the Nasdaq has regained 471.95
points, or more than one-third, of last week's losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq remains 25 percent below the peak it reached on March
10, but has narrowed its losses for the year to 6.8 percent. At its
low point last week, the Nasdaq had dropped more than 18 percent
from the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq stalwarts like Sun Microsystems, Microsoft and Cisco
Systems all rose sharply, fueling the rally. Yet analysts were
heartened by investors' willingness to branch out from the biggest
technology names and buy shares of smaller companies and stocks in
the more volatile Internet and biotechnology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! and online brokerage ETrade bounded higher; biotechnology
company Amgen also returned to life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's behavior is much more impressive than yesterday,''
said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King
Nussbaum. ''This is the way the market must trade if this rally is
to be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which was nearly as
ravaged as the Nasdaq by last week's selloff, rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most analysts are saying it's too soon to declare a full
recovery from the carnage last week, when the U.S. stock market
lost nearly $2 trillion in value.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo. Volatility remained high, and stock market indexes pulled
back sharply in late afternoon before making one final push in the
last half-hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports provided a catalyst for buying today. Dow
component Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose after reporting first-quarter
profits that beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose. The company, the world's largest maker of computer
chips, was expected to report its first-quarter earnings after the
4 p.m. close of trading. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its
rating on Intel stock to ''strong buy'' from ''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government delivered a report that eased some
fears about inflation. The Commerce Department said housing
construction plummeted 11.2 percent in March, the biggest plunge in
six years, suggesting that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, the
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since last
June. The slowdown in housing starts offered some hope that the
rate increases are working, reducing the odds of steep increases
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts continue to expect a series of modest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher interest rates are clearly having an impact,'' said
Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities. ''But that
probably is not enough of a slowing to keep the Fed from pushing
interest rates higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rates
and inflation, benefited from the report. American Express and J.P.
Morgan rose.
</P>
<P>
   The market's breadth improved, with more stocks joining in the
effort to rally. Yet Hyman said many of the smaller and mid-sized
technology stocks that rose today may never return to the highs
reached prior to last week's washout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I that we don't forget the lessons learned last week,'' he
said. ''Earnings and valuations are important, and when they're
ignored, catastrophic drops can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 40.17 to 1,441.61.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,990 up, 1,016 down and 442
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.09 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.29
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 23.03 to
482.29.

<HEADLINE> NBC To Rebroadcast News on PAX  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC's purchase of a stake in the Pax television
network is paying dividends for Tom Brokaw: the family-friendly
broadcaster has agreed to rerun his evening news broadcast each
night.
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV stations will package ''NBC Nightly News'' with a
rebroadcast of the NBC affiliate's local news for that market in an
hourlong news block that will run from 7 to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement will start in May as a one-month test and,
unless something goes wrong, will begin regularly in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV is carried on smaller stations and cable systems
throughout the country, reaching 77 percent of U.S. households,
often in areas already reached by major TV stations affiliated with
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly news rerun is the latest example of TV repurposing,
an idea that makes major network affiliates nervous. Some
executives at local stations are worried that if viewers can see a
program on another network at another time, it will cut into their
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   ABC last year began allowing weekly episodes of its ''Once and
Again'' drama to run on the Lifetime network. NBC's cable partner,
MSNBC, briefly rebroadcast NBC's ''Today'' show in the afternoons,
but stopped because the ratings were low.
</P>
<P>
   Since NBC owns 13 local stations, the network wouldn't be doing
anything it believed could be harmful to these stations, said NBC
President Randy Falco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have more to lose than they do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Nightly News'' has a better chance of succeeding on Pax TV
because it will be shown only an hour after its original broadcast,
Falco said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal announced Tuesday, Pax will also rebroadcast
some NBC coverage of U.S. Olympic trials beginning in June.
</P>
<P>
   The carriage of NBC programming on Pax was part of an
understanding reached last September when NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co., agreed to acquire a 32 percent stake in the company
for $415 million.
</P>
<P>
   For Pax, which is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., the deal was a
way to bolster its roster of programming, which depends heavily on
wholesome programs like ''Chicken Soup for the Soul.'' Pax already
rebroadcasts NBC's game show ''Twenty One'' on Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see too many opportunities in the short-term for us to
do more of that,'' Falco said, noting that NBC is restricted from
repurposing entertainment programs that it does not own.
</P>
<P>
   Like CBS and ABC, NBC's rapport with its affiliates has been on
the decline as the networks seek to revise decades-old agreements
requiring them to pay station owners to carry their programming.
Fox doesn't pay its affiliates to carry its programming.

<HEADLINE> Scalia Criticizes Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia chastised
Congress on Tuesday for enacting provisions that allow quick court
review of new laws that push ''the edge of the constitutional
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that is disturbing because it indicates that Congress
is increasingly abdicating its independent responsibility to be
sure that it is being faithful to the Constitution,'' the justice
told a telecommunications symposium sponsored by Michigan State
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''My court is fond of saying that acts of Congress come to the
court with the presumption of constitutionality,'' Scalia said.
''But if Congress is going to take the attitude that it will do
anything it can get away with and let the Supreme Court worry about
the Constitution ... then perhaps that presumption is
unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Two laws struck down by the Supreme Court in recent years
provided speeded-up court review of their provisions. In 1997, the
justices threw out a measure that sought to protect children from
sexually explicit material on the Internet, and a year later the
court threw out Congress' effort to enact a presidential line-item
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has in recent years been pushing the edge of the
constitutional envelope so aggressively that it has begun to
include special review provisions in its more dubious offerings,''
Scalia said. ''If you have a legislature that is eager to push the
envelope you should expect a higher percentage of invalidations.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction, dampened by an upswing

down 11.2 percent from the previous month. Economists said the
plunge won't stop the Federal Reserve from pushing interest rates
higher to slow the speeding economy and keep inflation under

annual rate of 1.60 million in March, the Commerce Department said
today.

   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. posted a loss for the first
quarter but its results before onetime items beat analysts'
expectations. The world's biggest soft drink company lost $58
million, or 2 cents per share, in the January-March period after
writing down $405 million in assets for its operations in India and
a $275 million charge from its ongoing corporate realignment. But
excluding one-time items, Coke earned 22 cents a share, thanks in
part to a 3.5 percent increase in worldwide sales. Many analysts
had expected a 41-cent figure. Coca-Cola shares fell 13/16 today to
47 11/16.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Finance ministers from around the world acted
at their spring meeting to hasten debt relief for poor countries.
The action was in line with one of the points thousands of
protesters had stressed as they tried but failed to stop the work
of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank at their spring
meetings. The protesters said the two institutions have failed to
alleviate global poverty and should be abolished. Police staved off
violent confrontations and destruction of property of the kind that
took place last fall at the Seattle meeting of the World Trade

   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of

maker of Marlboro cigarettes, Kraft cheese and Miller Lite beer
were in line with Wall Street estimates. But its shares continue to

expectations and Bank One shares rose on the New York Stock
Exchange. Net profits for the first three months of 2000 were $689
million, or 60 cents a share, down from $1.151 billion, or 96 cents
a share, for the same period a year ago. many analysts, in their

<HEADLINE> White House Predicts China Passage  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert pledged Tuesday
that the Republican-controlled House, ''working with the
president,'' will pass legislation for normal trade relations with
China despite the opposition of the Democratic leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, the House minority leader has chosen partisan
politics over bipartisan progress,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said in a jab
at Gephardt, expected to announce opposition to the legislation
Wednesday in a speech at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, seconded Hastert's
criticism of Gephardt. ''The would-be speaker of the House is too
tied to big labor and trial lawyers to recognize the needs of the
new economy,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   A vote is expected next month on a measure to grant permanent
normal trade relations with China, rather than continue the current
system of having Congress vote on the issue once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials say Gephardt will declare in his speech
that safeguards in the legislation to protect human rights and
address other concerns in China aren't strong enough to justify
surrendering the leverage that accompanies annual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   As comments from Hastert and Armey suggested, the political
maneuvering is intense on China trade. While divisions exist in
both parties, the split is more pronounced among Democrats, who are
also struggling to gain a House majority in this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is fighting the trade bill, fearing it will cost
jobs. Business groups, eager to open an enormous new market, are
strongly for it. That sets up a potentially dangerous vote for
Democratic lawmakers from swing districts, who might customarily
rely on support from the AFL-CIO to win difficult re-election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's decision leaves him at odds with President Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore but in line with other Democratic
leaders in the House and the majority of the party's rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as Armey's comments suggested, it places
Republicans in position to claim credit if the measure passes but
avoid blame if it fails.
</P>
<P>
   ''Representative Gephardt's announcement makes President
Clinton's job more difficult but not impossible,'' said Armey, one
of numerous Republicans who contend the job of lining up Democratic
votes belongs to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was more emphatic about the bill's prospects for
passage: ''Working with the president, we will pass PNTR (the China
trade bill) without Mr. Gephardt.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gephardt's decision ''is based not on sound economic
principles. Rather, it is based on fear, fear of the political
power of Big Labor, fear of the implications of the new economy,
fear of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's imminent decision to oppose the bill was welcomed by
the Democratic whip, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., whose spokesman
called it a ''positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials say Gephardt is not expected to lobby
against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy of opposing the measure, but not too strenuously,
appears part of an effort to minimize antagonizing business groups
being wooed to support Democrats in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, joined his colleagues in criticizing Gephardt, using
official trade figures to say defeat of the bill would cost the
majority leader's home state, Missouri, money and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While a majority of Democrats seem ready to vote against the
bill, Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., a supporter, has said as many as
70 or so Democrats could wind up in favor of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have a 222-211 majority in the House, with two
independents.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Senate OKs Gay Civil Union Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A bill that would create the closest
thing in America to gay marriage won preliminary approval in the
state Senate on Tuesday after a debate watched by people wearing
either white ribbons or pink stickers to show where they stood.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-11 vote came after the Senate defeated two proposed
constitutional amendments designed to outlaw same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will be up for final approval in the Senate on
Wednesday. A similar measure has already passed the House, but that
chamber will have to consider changes made by the Senate.
Democratic Gov. Howard Dean has said he will sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would enable gay couples to form ''civil unions''
that would entitle them to all 300 or so rights and benefits
available under state law to married couples. No other state has
gone as far as Vermont to give gay couples something approximating
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vermont's gay couples would still not be entitled to
the federal benefits available to married couples in such areas as
taxes and Social Security. And unlike marriage, civil unions would
not confer portable rights; other states would probably not
recognize such unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can do something of great weight,'' Sen. Richard McCormack,
a Democrat, said in support of the bill. ''We can do something
very, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the dozens of people sitting in the Senate
galleries, standing along the chamber's walls and milling about the
hallways was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation, wearing white ribbons to signify
their support for traditional marriage, stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with supporters wearing pink stickers favoring civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators who voted against the bill said they were doing
so because their constituents opposed it. Others said they feared
the national and international reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the United States and the world will judge our decision
today,'' warned Republican Sen. Julius Canns, who unsuccessfully
sought to insert into the state Constitution a definition of
marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court set the stage for the legislation with
its unanimous December ruling that same-sex couples were being
unconstitutionally denied the benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would create a status parallel to marriage by
allowing gay and lesbian couples to obtain a license from their
town clerks and then have their unions certified by a judge or
member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex couples then would qualify for the wide array of
benefits available to married couples, from being able to make
medical decisions on behalf of their partners to qualifying for
certain tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   To break up a civil union, couples would have to go through
Family Court to obtain dissolutions, just as when married couples
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure had attempted to derail it Tuesday with
the pair of constitutional amendments. One amendment would have
added to the state Constitution the definition of marriage as a
union between a man and a woman. The second would have overturned
the Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe their sexual orientation runs counter to natural
law,'' Sen. John Crowley said of same-sex couples as he argued for
the marriage definition. ''Their families run counter to natural
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither amendment won a simple majority, let alone the
two-thirds required for constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people listened to debate on the amendments over
speakers in hallways outside the small Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Christian stood with a brightly colored sign that read:
''Friendship does not equal marriage! Get real!''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Kletecka, a social worker who is gay, surveyed the crowd
of white ribbons and said: ''It's always sobering to see how many
people would oppose civil rights.''

<HEADLINE> Problems Spur Brit Nuke Co. Changes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A state-run nuclear company on Tuesday replaced
eight directors and hired a new safety chief following a critical
government report and a series of problems at a reprocessing plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a wakeup call,'' said Norman Askew, the new
chief executive of the state-run company, British Nuclear Fuels
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Askew was appointed in February after a report by the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate complained of a ''lack of safety
culture'' at the Sellafield reprocessing plant.
</P>
<P>
   However, uncertainty remained over whether the northwest England
plant can regain the confidence of foreign customers and resolve a
current dispute with Japan, which bought a consignment of fuel with
falsified records.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the plant was shut down after news that workers
falsified records about the quality of the consignment of uranium
and plutonium mixed oxide fuel delivered to Japan's Kansai Electric
Power Company.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland and Germany have halted fuel shipments to Sellafield
since the revelation about the falsified consignment -- which Japan
wants to send back.
</P>
<P>
   Five employees were fired, and all staff are undergoing
retraining.
</P>
<P>
   In a report called Going Forward Safely, British Nuclear Fuels
announced the shake-up of managers and management style, and the
appointment of 70 extra staff to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   Askew, who said it would take up to two years to implement all
the recommended changes, did not rule out taking back the
consignment from Japan.

<HEADLINE> State lists elementary schools for racial imbalance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP)-- Elementary schools in Hamden and Greenwich
are racially imbalanced and may be in violation of state law, the
state Department of Education has found.
</P>
<P>
   The finding that there are not enough minority students at the
schools is the first such determination in the state in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, a single school's minority population must be
within 25 percentage points of the minority population of the
entire school district.
</P>
<P>
   The law is intended to foster racial diversity and prevent a
school district from putting all or most of its minority students
in the same school.
</P>
<P>
   Unaudited figures from schools led the Department of Education
to put four school districts on notice, said Tom Murphy, spokesman
for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In Hamden, the average elementary school minority population is
40 percent. To stay within the law, no school in Hamden can have
fewer than 15 percent or more than 65 percent of its pupils from
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   According to enrollment figures, only 44 children, or 14.1
percent of the 311 students at Bear Path Elementary School, are
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, the district average is 20.7 percent minority.
Hamilton Avenue School was listed because its minority student
population is 52.6 percent, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The state found that racial balance also was off at an
alternative school in Norwalk and a magnet school in West Hartford,
but these schools are exempt from the state law because they serve
special populations.
</P>
<P>
   The schools in Greenwich and Hamden must report plans to correct
their imbalance to the Department of Education within the next 120
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to take corrective action, but it appears quite
achievable,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamden Superintendent of Schools Alida Begina the Board of
Education will decide whether the town should redistrict, add
classrooms or an all-day kindergarten to Bear Path Elementary
School or take other steps to address the racial imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich school Superintendent Roger Lulow said school leaders
had been discussing whether to make the Hamilton Avenue School an
interdistrict magnet school, before the racial imbalance issue was
brought up.
</P>
<P>
   Lulow said the school is small, and ''four our five kids either
way changes our whole balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The state law that covers racial imbalance in schools was not
enforced for two years, under a directive from the General
Assembly, to give the state time to review how to make the
regulations more fair and to review how imbalance is measured,
Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Sprint Gains 14 Percent in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp. topped Wall Street
forecasts Tuesday with a 14 percent gain in first-quarter operating
profits by the company's regular phone and data business and a
small-than-expected loss by the fast-growing wireless operation.
</P>
<P>
   The company's FON Group, which provides communications services
through traditional wireline connections to customers, earned $907
million or 65 cents a share in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which has agreed to be acquired by MCI WorldCom, said
its net profit totaled $1.12 billion or $1.28 per share due to
one-time factors, especially a gain of $675 million from the sale
of the company's investment in the Global One international
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period in 1999, the wireline operation posted an
operating profit of $795 million or 55 cents a share, and a net
profit of $406 million or 47 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint PCS division posted a net loss of $513 million or 54
cents a share for the first quarter as the company continued to
invest heavily in expanding and upgrading its wireless network,
with $693 million in capital expenditures for the period. In the
first quarter of 1999, Sprint PCS lost $626 million or 71 cents a
share in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The PCS group also reported a net gain of 831,000 customers in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''On both sides of the business -- wireline and wireless -- Sprint
continues to demonstrate its leadership in the marketplace,'' said
William Esrey, Sprint chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's stock trading, Sprint FON shares rose $1 to $57.75,
while Sprint PCS shares rose $6.62{ to $53.37{.

   WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- A former computer analyst who said he was
spanked by his boss in a workplace initiation is entitled to
$143,000 in damages from the company, a state appeals court ruled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Smith, 36, said he was whacked at least twice with a
4-foot carpenter's level by Kurt Getschow, president of Phillips
Getschow Co., in 1995 as other workers watched. Getschow, laughing,
then allegeldy put his arm around Smith and said, ''Now you're one
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Getschow denied spanking Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded Smith and his wife $1 million, but the judge
found that amount excessive and reduced it. Wisconsin's 3rd
District Court of Appeals upheld that decision.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Orders Flood Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX BANDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Swollen by weeks of rain, Hungary's
second-largest river threatened communities along its banks Tuesday
and prompted authorities to evacuate parts of 68 towns and
villages.
</P>
<P>
   More than 23,000 people, including 2,600 soldiers, worked on
reinforcing dikes at 232 settlements on or near the Tisza River,
officials said. Seven million sandbags have been used so far.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen military helicopters ferried sandbags to critical
regions, while army troops used amphibious vehicles to assist in
rescue and evacuation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The partial evacuations of 68 other towns and villages on or
near the river were ordered Tuesday as the government declared a
state of emergency along the lower Tisza River. The number of
evacuees wasn't immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Ministry reported that as of Tuesday 575,510
acres had been flooded.
</P>
<P>
   The water level of the Tisza on Tuesday morning at the major
riverbank city of Szolnok, 50 miles southeast of Budapest, was 34
feet, 9 inches, well over double the normal level for April, and
rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said that such water levels normally occur
only once in 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   The floods in eastern Hungary started early this month, and the
flood alert is expected to last another 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Mihaly Mueller told the state-run MTI news
agency that he was concerned that the $137 million earmarked to
help fight the flooding wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one expected the water to be this high and to last this
long,'' said Mueller in a telephone interview.

<HEADLINE> Accused Treasurer Returns To Work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Three months after her extortion conviction was
thrown out, Miriam Santos reclaimed her job as Chicago city
treasurer and picked up a fat check covering back pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Santos spent four months in federal prison after she was found
guilty last May of trying to extort a $10,000 campaign contribution
from a securities firm and forcing her staff to do campaign work on
city time.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court overturned the conviction in January,
saying the judge had committed ''a veritable avalanche of errors.''
But prosecutors said they are prepared to retry the case and
perhaps add new charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not bitter or angry. You can forget about that stuff,''
Santos, 44, said Monday as she returned to City Hall and collected
her back-pay check, expected to exceed $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Santos is entitled to return to her elective
office, a $118,650-a-year job, with back pay and pension benefits.
Mayor Richard M. Daley, who appointed a successor after her
conviction, acknowledged last month that she has a right to reclaim
her job.
</P>
<P>
   Santos, who was the Democratic candidate for Illinois attorney
general in 1998, had been accused of threatening to cut off Fuji
Securities from lucrative city business unless it made a $10,000
contribution to the Democratic Party of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she is ready to get back to business and that
other than cutting back on her use of foul language, she will not
change much about her style, which she described as aimed at
getting things done fast.
</P>
<P>
   Interim Treasurer Barbara Lumpkin, Daley's appointee, said she
will cooperate fully in the transition. She is expected to get a
new job in city government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw two classy ladies participate in a transfer of power.
It's been a long time since I've seen that at City Hall,'' said
Santos spokesman Alton Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Three staff members testified against Santos at the trial. Two
of them are leaving for other jobs soon, Lumpkin said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Surges; Copper Rebounds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil futures surged Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after a refinery shutdown in Louisiana heightened concerns
about tight U.S. supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, copper rebounded after falling to an
eight-month low and pork bellies soared.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices were slumping until late in the session when Citgo
closed its 350,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Lake Charles, La.,
following a power outage due to a boiler malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery, operated by the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela's
state oil company, processes crude into gasoline as well as
distillate and other fuels.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not believed to be serious but it was enough to
jangle nerves in a market with little cushion against supply
disruptions. Also underpinning the price rise was the strong
showing of equity markets for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery, a contract which
expires Wednesday, settled up 22 cents at $26.11 a barrel -- a
two-week high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rally really shows that any little refinery problem is
going to magnify the tight supply situation we have,'' said Phil
Flynn, energy analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. ''We're
counting on those refineries to produce at a big clip, and if they
don't shortages could develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring unforeseen supply news, the market now may be headed
toward the upper end of the trading range -- $28 to $29 a barrel --
he suggested. ''Probably the bulls are going to be in charge for
the next couple of days,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Before word of the outage, falling crude had been dragging other
energy commodities lower.
</P>
<P>
   May heating oil settled up 1.31 cent at 70.78 cents a gallon;
May unleaded gasoline rose .88 cent to 82.86 cents a gallon; May
natural gas fell 6 cents to $3.098 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose 31 cents to
$23.05 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   After markets closed, weekly data from the American Petroleum
Institute showed that U.S. refineries operated at 92 percent
capacity last week, up slightly from 91.5 percent the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil stocks rose 6.575 million barrels from the previous
week, according to the API. But gasoline and distillate fuel stocks
both were down -- gasoline by 2.842 million barrels and distillate
by 2.676 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   On the Comex division of the New York Merc, rebounding stock
markets also helped copper prices rally after they dipped to an
eight-month low.
</P>
<P>
   A second day of impressive equity gains helped calm fears that
the U.S. economy might be slowing, which would be a hammer blow to
the construction industry that copper depends on heavily.
</P>
<P>
   May copper settled up 2.1 cents, or 3 percent, at 76.45 cents a
pound after sinking as low as 74.10 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The surge reflected bargain-hunting as copper investors ignored
new housing data showing that U.S. housing starts declined by 11
percent in March, a worse fall than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen pork bellies bounced back from an early session slide on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and hit new contract highs. The
buying surge was attributed to ideas that a shortened slaughter
week would combine with strong post-Easter holiday demand to boost
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lean hog futures jumped higher on similar notions.
</P>
<P>
   May pork bellies rose the limit 3 cents to 97.95 cents a pound,
while June lean hogs rose 1.30 cent to 75.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Tax Refund Lost? Don't Panic  </HEADLINE>
By MARIA CODER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What do I do if my federal tax refund check is lost or
stolen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't panic. If your check is lost or stolen, the money is
still rightfully yours.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you should do is call the IRS' automated TeleTax
number, (800) 829-4477, to check the status of your check. You will
be asked for your Social Security number and the amount of the
refund.
</P>
<P>
   If TeleTax doesn't answer your questions, the next step is to
call (800) TAX-1040, where you can explain your situation to a
person.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IRS, sometimes a refund is delayed by past-due
federal debts, such as delinquent student loans or child support.
You can find out if one of those situations applies to you by
calling (800) TAX-1040.
</P>
<P>
   But if your refund hasn't been held up by such a debt, and you
still haven't been able to find out what happened to your check,
there is another alternative, the national taxpayer advocate
hotline at (877) 777-4778.
</P>
<P>
   As far as tracking down lost or stolen state tax returns, you'll
have to check with your local tax department since procedures vary
from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that you'll find in the course of your research
that your federal refund check was cashed by somebody else. If so,
the IRS will trace the check and get a photocopy of it, which will
be sent to you so you can verify that the signature endorsing the
check was not your own.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get IRS Form 3911 -- the Taxpayer Statement Regarding
Refund. If you're married and filing jointly both spouses will be
required to sign the form, which asks you to explain the
circumstances regarding your refund.
</P>
<P>
   It will take about two to three weeks to get the paperwork in
the mail after you've claimed your refund was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to do this in as speedy a manner as possible but on the
other hand we have to be careful someone is not attempting to
defraud the system,'' said Terry Lemons, an IRS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS says tens of thousands of refund checks are returned as
undeliverable each year for several reasons -- such as failure to
provide a forwarding address when relocating, or the expiration of
a forwarding address. If you believe your check wasn't delivered
for one of these reasons, first call the TeleTax number, (800)
829-4477. If that doesn't help, try (800) TAX-1040.
</P>
<P>
   In November, IRS district offices ask local newspapers to print
lists of people with uncollected refunds. If you'd like to find if
you're on the list, call 1-800-TAX-1040.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Digital Divide Close  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton, at a showcase of high
technology, challenged industry leaders Tuesday to share ''this
astonishing new era of enterprise'' by ensuring that all Americans
have access to computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm asking you to do this because you can,'' Clinton said.
''I'm asking you to do this because it's right. And I'm asking you
to do this because America needs it to have a continually growing
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to the Comdex trade show at the close of a two-day
''digital divide'' tour intended to dramatize the gap between
computer haves and have-nots. While government surveys have shown
it to be a ''racial ravine'' between whites and minorities,
academics and industry analysts say Internet access is much more
closely tied to income and education than race.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling through an exhibition hall on the shore of Lake
Michigan, Clinton stopped to try out a warm ergonomic pillow
designed to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. ''This would be good
for me with my crazy lifestyle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another vendor gave the president a user name (Clinton) and
password (Buddy) for a site for online storage of computer files.
Told that he could hide files that would not accessible to anyone
else, Clinton said, ''We've had enough problems'' -- referring to a
controversy over White House e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The president also was intrigued by a voice-recognition system
for Internet access. ''Pretty neat, huh?'' Clinton remarked.
''You've given me hope with my big, awkward hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, he urged high-tech leaders to support his goal of
providing the latest learning tools to every child in every school
and creating ''digital opportunity for every family and every
community.'' More than 400 businesses, schools, community groups
and volunteers have signed up, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked them to help ''give our schools computers and
high-speed connections, to design the educational software our
children need to succeed, to make sure our teachers are as
comfortable in front of a computer as in front of a chalkboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he urged them to expand internships, particularly for
women and minorities, who are underrepresented in most information
technology jobs. Saying there is a limit to what the federal
government can do, the president also encouraged more technology
partnerships with schools, local communities and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the technology boom has accounted for about 30
percent of America's economic growth and ''this astonishing new era
of enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, just on pure ethical grounds, we all sense that the
American values require that everybody be given a fair chance to
participate,'' Clinton said. ''But secondly, I think it's in our
economic interest to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Washington policy-makers spend a lot of time wondering
how to prolong the economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, it's clear to me that if we want it to continue, we have
to do more to find new markets,'' he said. ''New markets mean
creating new businesses and new employees, as well as new
customers. And if you do both, it means you can have growth without
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of town, Clinton stopped at a restaurant to help
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley celebrate his 58th birthday. The
president lamented that Daley is ''four years older than me and he
looks younger.'' Clinton turns 54 in August.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington after five days on the road, the
president heads out again Wednesday to help dedicate a memorial in
Oklahoma City to the 168 people killed five years ago in the
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Earnings Rise in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s profit rose more than
12 percent in the first three months of the year as domestic
tobacco shipments surged despite higher prices and results improved
in its food and beer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The results reported Tuesday by the maker of Marlboro
cigarettes, Kraft cheese and Miller Lite beer were in line with
Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But its shares continue to be weighed down by worries about
legal challenges in Florida and by the U.S. government to its
tobacco business. Its shares fell 56\ cents to $20.68} in trading
at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris earned $2.01 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the
three months ended March 31 compared with $1.79 billion, or 73
cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Its underlying earnings, which include incremental income
related to the arrival of the year 2000 amounted to 89 cents a
share. That matched what analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 2.8 percent to $20.04 billion from $19.5 billion a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're off to a good start in 2000,'' said chairman and chief
executive Geoffrey C. Bible. ''Our first-quarter results clearly
demonstrate that our business fundamentals are robust.''
</P>
<P>
   Its domestic tobacco profits rose 6.5 percent to $1.1 billion
due to higher pricing and increased shipments to wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Its shipments climbed 7.1 percent in the quarter compared with a
4.6 percent increase industrywide. Those increases are the biggest
since tobacco prices were increased sharply in the wake of the
industry's costly settlement with the states in 1998 for their
expenses in treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Morris attributed the big hike in shipments mainly to
decisions by wholesalers to rebuild inventories this year after
reducing them in the same period a year ago, and to an extra
working day in this year's first quarter. It estimated shipments
would have been down 2.5 percent industrywide without those
factors.
</P>
<P>
   David Adelman, who follows tobacco companies for Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, estimated retail sales of cigarettes were down 1.5
percent in the first quarter after falling about 8 percent last
year. ''Consumers have gotten over the shock'' of higher prices, he
said. The sales decline more closely resembles the pattern before
the price hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Burry, who follows tobacco for Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP;
Co., said it will take another quarter of shipment and sales
figures to see if the price hikes of 1998 and 1999 have driven a
significant number of smokers out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris said its share of overall domestic tobacco
shipments rose 1.2 share points to 51.6 percent. It cited retail
sales data that said its share of that market rose 0.4 points to
50.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Its international tobacco business posted a 4.1 increase in
profits despite a 1.1 percent decline in sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   In the food business, profits were up 6.1 percent in North
America due to higher volume, productivity savings and favorable
commodity costs. International food earnings rose 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Profits at Miller Brewing rose 12.5 percent, partially due to an
increase in shipments and higher prices.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Gains Record 254; Dow Up 189  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq composite
index to its biggest one-day point gain Tuesday as investors
flocked back to the shares that were devastated by last week's
rout. Blue-chip stocks also advanced sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rally extended Wall Street's big gains of Monday, when
stocks began recovering from last week's collapse. But the market's
gains were far more widespread on Tuesday, with smaller stocks
joining the rally as investors looked for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts were encouraged by the broadening of the
market, yet continued to warn investors that the market remains
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose 254.41 to close at 3,793.57, while the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 184.91 to 10,767.42.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 40.17 to 1,441.61.
</P>
<P>
   In just two sessions, the Nasdaq has regained 472.28 points, or
more than one-third, of last week's losses, and has wiped out the
355-point drop it suffered on Friday. The Nasdaq remains 25 percent
below the peak it reached on March 10, but has narrowed its losses
for the year to 6.8 percent. At its low point last week, the Nasdaq
had dropped more than 18 percent from the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq stalwarts like Sun Microsystems, Microsoft and Cisco
Systems all rose sharply Tuesday, feeding the rally. Sun rose 7
3/16 to 92 1/16, Microsoft gained 4 11/16 to 80 9/16 and Cisco rose
2} to 69\.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were heartened by investors' willingness to branch out
from the biggest technology names and buy shares of smaller
companies and stocks in the more volatile Internet and
biotechnology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! rose 12 5/16 to 126 11/16 and online brokerage ETrade
rose 3 5/16 to 21{; biotechnology company Amgen also returned to
life, rising 5 to 58].
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's behavior is much more impressive than yesterday,''
said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King
Nussbaum. ''This is the way the market must trade if this rally is
to be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which was nearly as
ravaged as the Nasdaq by last week's selloff, rose 26.81 to 486.09.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most analysts are saying it's too soon to declare a full
recovery from the carnage last week, when the U.S. stock market
lost nearly $2 trillion in value.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo. Volatility remained high, and stock market indexes did pull
back somewhat in late afternoon before making one final push in the
last half-hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings reports provided a catalyst for the buying. Dow
component Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 4 to 81{ after reporting
first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 6 to 129 in advance of its first-quarter earnings
report. After the 4 p.m. close of regular trading, Intel released
earnings that easily topped analysts' estimates. Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter raised its rating on Intel stock to ''strong buy'' from
''outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government delivered a report that eased some
fears about inflation. The Commerce Department said housing
construction plummeted 11.2 percent in March, the biggest plunge in
six years, suggesting that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, the
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since last
June. The slowdown in housing starts offered some hope that the
rate increases are working, reducing the odds of steep increases
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts continue to expect a series of modest
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher interest rates are clearly having an impact,'' said
Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities. ''But that
probably is not enough of a slowing to keep the Fed from pushing
interest rates higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rates
and inflation, benefited from the report. American Express rose 5
15/16 to 139 15/16 and J.P. Morgan rose 5{ to 130{.
</P>
<P>
   The market's breadth improved, with more stocks joining in the
effort to rally. Yet Hyman said many of the smaller and mid-sized
technology stocks that rose Tuesday may never return to the highs
reached prior to last week's washout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that we don't forget the lessons learned last week,''
he said. ''Earnings and valuations are important, and when they're
ignored, catastrophic drops can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, and by a 3-to-1 margin on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.33 billion shares, compared with
1.44 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index edged up 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 1.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Officer Guilty in Motorist Death  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A white former police officer was convicted of
involuntary manslaughter Tuesday in his retrial in the 1992 beating
death of a black motorist.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nevers, whose second-degree murder conviction had been
thrown out, sighed, slumped his head and shook it side to side as
the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   Nevers contended he was trying to defend himself while arresting
Malice Green outside a suspected crack house on Nov. 5, 1992.
Defense attorney Neil Fink said cocaine contributed to Green's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Nevers broke the law when he used unreasonable
force and struck Green's head 14 times with a heavy flashlight.
They also accused Nevers of ''concocted'' testimony in which he
claimed the 35-year-old unemployed steelworker had tried to grab
his gun.
</P>
<P>
   Green's sister, Treise Green, 40, said she was satisfied with
the verdict. She said ''that word 'guilty' was important,'' and
that Nevers ''should just go back to prison, even if it's 15
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary manslaughter is punishable by up to 15 years in
prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for May 16 and allowed
Nevers to remain free on bond. Fink said he would appeal on grounds
that jurors were improperly given the option of convicting Nevers
of involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Nevers and his partner, Walter Budzyn, were convicted
of second-degree murder. Budzyn was sentenced to eight to 18 years,
Nevers to 12 to 25 years. Their convictions were overturned five
months apart in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Budzyn's first conviction was overturned by the Michigan Supreme
Court, which ruled that his jury was unfairly influenced by being
shown ''Malcolm X'' -- a movie containing footage of the beating of
Rodney King by Los Angeles police -- during a break in
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court judge overturned Nevers' conviction in
late 1997, saying he was denied a fair trial. The judge cited the
''Malcolm X'' screening and the jury's exposure to media
speculation there could be rioting in Detroit if the white officers
were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Budzyn was retried and convicted in 1998 of involuntary
manslaughter and was freed after the judge sentenced him to time
already served.

<HEADLINE> Coke Boosts Sales but Posts 1Q Loss  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. posted a loss for the first
quarter but its results before onetime items beat analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest soft drink company lost $58 million, or 2
cents per share, in the January-March period after writing down
$405 million in assets for its operations in India and a $275
million charge from its ongoing corporate realignment.
</P>
<P>
   But excluding one-time items, Coke earned 22 cents a share,
thanks in part to a 3.5 percent increase in worldwide sales. The
consensus forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial was 21 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Coke also said it took a 10-cent-per-share charge on inventory
reduction by its bottlers, resulting in operating earnings of 32
cents per share, though analysts did not incorporate the charge
into their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period last year, Coke earned $747 million, or 30
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter slipped to $4.39 billion from $4.40
billion a year ago but sales volume grew 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's loss for the quarter stems from a number of changes the
company has been implementing.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company expects to cut 5,200 jobs from its
worldwide work force by the end of 2000, and spend $725 million
before taxes to cover costs of the job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Coke began reducing the amount of concentrate it
ships to its bottlers to bring inventories more in line with
demand. Coke said it expects that process will shave 1 to 3 cents
per share from earnings in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Coke said volume growth of 3.5 percent exceeded its projections
of 3 percent because of strong demand for its products during the
last few weeks of the quarter. Sales volume of its core brands rose
2 percent, while products from Schweppes -- which Coke bought last
year -- added 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said those numbers were not particularly
encouraging, given the company's ambitious projections for
long-term sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our opinion, volume remains light for them and we need to
see some pickup there,'' said Ann Gurkin of Davenport &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the company's new chairman and chief
executive, Douglas Daft, told investors that Coke expects 7 percent
to 8 percent annual growth in worldwide sales volume over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been skeptical that Coke can meet those sales
targets, with most predicting average volume growth of 5 percent or
less per year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think they can touch 7 to 8 percent periodically ... but as
an average of an annual growth number, it's not possible,'' said
Roy Burry, a longtime Coke analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the asset writedown in India would be the last
to come from a review of all operations Daft ordered last year. In
January, Coke announced that it would write down $800 million in
assets from its underperforming operations in Russia and the Baltic
states.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coke shares were
down 87{ cents at $47.62{. The company released its quarterly
earnings a day before its annual shareholders meeting in
Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest Coke bottler,
reported a loss of $35 million, or 8 cents per share, for the first
quarter. For the same period a year ago, the company reported a
loss of $62 million, or 15 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises rose 68} cents to $21.93} on the
NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Mission Attack Probed  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District police said Tuesday they have
launched a criminal investigation into allegations that some 15
people from the Cuban diplomatic mission here assaulted
Cuban-American protesters who were demanding that 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters suffered minor injuries in the fracas
just before nightfall last Friday and were treated at local
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came as the State Department summoned a top Cuban
diplomat here to express ''extreme concern'' over the beatings. The
diplomat, asked for an explanation, did not comment on the
allegations but said he hoped to obtain an explanation later, said
a department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Joe Gentile, a Metropolitan Police Department spokesman,
said the incident is being investigated as a simple assault. He
would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   If Cuban diplomats were involved, they would not be subject to
prosecution because of diplomatic immunity. But officials said that
would not prevent an investigation from being carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters, speaking at a midday news conference Tuesday
in front of the Cuban mission, said an all-male group emerged from
the Cuban mission building and started pummeling the demonstrators,
believed to number about 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was punched twice in the face,'' said Mauricio Claver
Carone, a college student. ''I have bruises on my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrella Carie Noda, a U.S. government employee, said she
suffered black and blue marks on her arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Brigida Benitez, a lawyer who was not at the news conference,
said in a telephone interview that she was grabbed by the arms and
thrown into the street. Her husband, Jorge, said that after
suffering a blow to the head, he experienced fogginess and was
diagnosed at a hospital as having a minor head trauma. He also
suffered a contusion on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Others required hospitalization but it was not clear how many.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban mission, would not
comment on the allegations. However, he said people hostile to Cuba
and to Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ''have been performing
provocative actions against the integrity and dignity of our
diplomatic mission, disrupting its normal functions.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters insulted women and children at the mission and
also passed objects through the fence, Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who was among those who spoke to
reporters, said Attorney General Janet Reno told him Monday she
planned to investigate the incident. Later, Reno said she had asked
Carollo to make sure he reported the occurrence to the local police
and said she would follow if the complainants had trouble in
getting the assistance they needed.
</P>
<P>
   News media camera crews had been deployed at the interest
section most of the day Friday but left before the incident took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said two agents from the Secret Service, which has
responsibility for protecting diplomatic missions, struck the
assailants with batons to induce them to stop. When reinforcements
were summoned, the assailants retreated back onto the mission
grounds, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode added yet another bizarre twist to the saga of Elian
Gonzalez, who has been at the center of a custody fight between his
Cuban father and Cuban-American relatives since he was rescued from
the ocean south of Florida last November. His father has been here
since April 6, trying to recover custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference took place under a steady rain across the
street from the three-story sand-colored structure that houses the
Cuban mission. An official with a videocamera could be seen taping
the proceedings from a second story window.

<HEADLINE> McGraw-Hill Earnings Nearly Double  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- First-quarter earnings at The McGraw-Hill Cos.
nearly doubled on increased advertising in Business Week magazine
and higher revenues from its Standard &AMP; Poor's financial services
division.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting a one-time gain from the sale of a business,
McGraw-Hill earned $47.4 million in the first quarter, or 24 cents
a share, easily eclipsing the 14 cents a share forecast by stock
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent McGraw-Hill's stock sharply higher. Company's
shares rose $6.12{, or 14 percent, to $48.87{ in trading at 4:30
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Including the gain from the sale of Tower Group International,
McGraw-Hill reported net earnings of $57.6 million, or 29 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 12 percent to $802.5 million from $716.5 million
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a 32 percent increase in the number of
advertising pages in Business Week magazine, which like other
business publications has been enjoying a surge of new advertising
revenues as young companies spend heavily to establish brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Results at Standard &AMP; Poor's were also strong as the financial
services division expanded in Europe, Asia and Latin America. S&AMP;P,
which is best known in the United States for its bond ratings and
stock indices, has been developing new services overseas such as
rating bank loans and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw-Hill also reported higher revenues in its third main
business area, educational and professional publishing, but the
division still posted a net loss of $36.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Bank One Profits Sink 40 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp. saw first-quarter earnings plummet
by 40 percent as fallout from serious problems with its credit-card
unit continued to erode profits at the nation's fourth-largest
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing, however, met Wall Street's latest lowered
expectations and Bank One shares rose 75 cents to $31 in trading
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Net profits for the first three months of 2000 were $689
million, or 60 cents a share, down from $1.151 billion, or 96 cents
a share, for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial, in their fourth lowered estimate since August, had
forecast 60-cents per-share earnings following the bank company's
warning last month of a weak quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One blamed is weak performance on a falloff in credit-card
business, more bad loans and an operating loss for its
Internet-only bank WingspanBank.com.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card profits sank to $70 million from $303 million, with
credit quality worsening -- nonperforming assets increased by $31
million to $1.19 billion. Card loans declined by 3 percent from the
same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A decline of nearly 8 million credit-card customers was recorded
during the quarter by Bank One's First USA unit -- the nation's
second-largest issuer of credit cards behind Citibank -- although
the company said most resulted from a purge of inactive accounts.
Slightly more than 56 million cardholders remained as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''As expected, credit card earnings continued to be under
pressure due to several factors, including margin compression,
receivables attrition, lower securitization activity and higher
credit costs,'' the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial banking unit enjoyed a 47 percent increase in
profits, however, in a sign the bank's operations aside from credit
cards are largely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Bank One, which has assets of more than $270
billion and branches in 14 states, was formed when Columbus,
Ohio-based Banc One bought First Chicago NBD Co. in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Its problems emerged last August with the disclosure that
skyrocketing growth at First USA had slowed due to a series of
flawed marketing strategies that drove existing customers off and
carved too deeply into profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One stock lost 23 percent of its value immediately and kept
spiraling lower, reaching a 52-week low of $23.13} in late
February. But analysts say the worst may be over and are upbeat
about the March 27 hiring of former Citigroup Inc. president James
Dimon as chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Katrina Blecher of Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. said
the decline in Bank One's credit-card business in the quarter was
worse than she expected, with a decline in loans and still-high
attrition rates.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company can attain its goal of completing the
turnaround in its credit-card unit by year's end only ''if they can
turn the revenue stream around ... and improve credit quality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful,'' Blecher said. ''But management has a monumental
task in front of them. They've got a very big engine they've got to
rev up.''
</P>
<P>
   Net-interest income for the quarter totaled $2.23 billion, down
about 4 percent from $2.31 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Noninterest income was $1.82 billion, down almost 30 percent from
$2.59 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did have lower non-interest expenses in the quarter of
$2.66 billion, down from $2.94 billion.

<HEADLINE> Wells Fargo Reports Profit Increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.'s profits topped $1
billion in the first quarter, the bank said Tuesday, as its 1998
merger with Norwest continued to progress smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bank first-quarter net income totaled $1.01 billion, or 61
cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by a penny,
according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. The profit
represented a 14 percent increase from the first quarter last year
when Wells Fargo earned $884 million, or 53 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Most key measures of the bank's financial performance rose in
the quarter, indicating that the November 1998 marriage between San
Francisco-based Wells and Minneapolis-based Norwest is functioning
better than many recent big bank mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock was priced at $40.81\ at 5:15 p.m. EST on
the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.43} or 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Wells has completed the mergers in several small Western
states, the bank still hasn't converted the customers in
California, the company's stronghold, to the new system being used
by the merged bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wells executives said the bank attracted more customers in most
lines of business. Loans climbed by 15 percent from the first
quarter of 1999 and more than 100,000 new customers signed up for
the Wells' Internet banking service, a trend that could help lower
costs over the long haul. The bank said it now has 1.7 million
Internet banking customers and roughly one in every four of those
use the service to pay their bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Home mortgages, a major part of the bank's business, showed some
sluggishness in the first quarter as rising interest rates
discouraged refinancing activity. The bank's mortgage division
earned $67 million in the quarter, up just 2 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Wells expects to add about 1 million new
customers through the recently announced acquisitions of Michigan
Financial Corp., First Commerce Bancshares of Nebraska, National
Bancorp of Alaska and Salt Lake City-based First Security Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Net-interest income in the first quarter was $2.46 billion, up
almost 7 percent from $2.28 billion in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Noninterest income totaled $1.91 billion, a jump of almost 11
percent from the year-ago results of $1.73 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Those results included $885 million in one-time gains realized
from venture capital investments that Wells has made in other
businesses, primarily near its San Francisco headquarters. Those
gains were largely offset by $602 million in losses on the sales of
securities in the bank's investment portfolio and a $160 million
writedown in its auto leases to reflecting declining used car
values.

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser Earnings Jump in 1st Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Weyerhaeuser, the major paper and
forest products maker, reported sharply higher earnings of $244
million in the first quarter of the year as better market
conditions propelled sales.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings, which were equivalent of $1.04 per share, easily
beat analyst estimates of 92 cents per share as calculated by First
Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues jumped nearly 50 percent to $3.91 billion from $2.67
billion in the same period a year ago, largely due to the company's
acquisitions of MacMillan Bloedel and Trus Joist as well as better
markets for its products.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period a year ago, Weyerhaeuser earned $101 million,
or 51 cents a share, before an extraordinary loss on the sale of
the company's composite products business and an accounting charge
of $149 million.
</P>
<P>
   Including the one-time charges, the company reported a net loss
of $48 million, or 24 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser shares fell $1.50 to $53.50 in trading at 4:30 p.m.

   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of
construction equipment, reported a 12 percent increase in
first-quarter earnings Tuesday as higher sales and a cost-cutting
program continued to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar earned $258 million, or 73 cents a share, in the
first three months of the year, up from $205 million, or 57 cents a

</P>
<P>
   ''They had a great quarter,'' said Joanna Shatney, an analyst

</P>
<P>
   The Peoria-based company said it expects overall sales and

<HEADLINE> Mellon Reports Increase in Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mellon Financial Corp. reported profits in the
first quarter rose almost 10 percent driven by a surge in trust and
investment fees as well as lower costs. The bank also announced an
increase in its dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Net income totaled $253 million, or 50 cents a share, topping
Wall Street's estimate by a penny. Mellon earned $231 million, or
43 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Trust and investment fee revenue rose 17 percent from the first
quarter of last year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon also said it would raise its dividend by 10 percent to 22
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are also pleased to announce that for the first time, our
assets under management have exceeded $500 billion,'' Martin G.
McGuinn, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon's shares were priced at $32.50 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the
New York Stock Exchange, up $1.25 or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fee revenue was $798 million in the first quarter of 2000,
basically flat with the year-ago period because Mellon sold several
businesses, including its credit card, network services and
mortgage banking units. Excluding those divestitures, fee revenue
was up 13 percent in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Net-interest revenue was $351 million in the first quarter, down
5 percent from $371 million in the first quarter of 1999. Excluding
the effect of the divestitures of the credit card and mortgage
businesses, net-interest revenue increased 1 percent compared.
</P>
<P>
   Operating expenses totaled $719 million in the first quarter of
2000, down 6 percent from $760 million. Excluding the effect of
divestitures, expenses grew 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Maloney, Nielsen rematch drawing big donors  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Connecticut's fifth district congressional
race has become a key battleground in the fight for control of the
U.S. House of Representatives where Republicans currently have a
six-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Democrat James Maloney beat Republican Mark
Nielsen by about 2,300 votes, the second closest contest in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating another tight race between the two, both national
parties have begun pumping money into this year's rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission reports available Tuesday show
Maloney with a slightly larger war chest than his opponent, but
political observers say the fundraising has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be an outpouring of money in the district
like nobody in this part of Connecticut has ever seen before,''
said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, which tracks money in campaigns. ''My advice
for everyone who lives there would be, 'buckle your seat belt and
get ready.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney now has $526,422 in his war chest compared to Nielsen's
$437,629. He also has substantially less debt.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Rob Simmons, a Republican trying to unseat U.S.
Rep. Sam Gejdenson in the second district, has less than half of
Nielsen's bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, a five-term state lawmaker running against a 10-term
incumbent, has $154,550 cash on hand. In the period that ended
March 31 he raised $73,919. Gejdenson has about $290,000 on hand,
and raised about $116,000 during the reporting period.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the approximately $227,000 Nielsen raised
between January and March came in the form of donations from
Republican leadership PACs or gifts from the campaigns of
Republican congressmen already in safe seats.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Thomas DeLay, R-Texas, gave Nielsen $5,000 from
his Americans for a Republican Majority PAC and California Reps.
John Doolittle, Buck McKeon and Christopher Cox, each gave Nielsen
$100,000 from their campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ferocity of the battle for the House, Makinson
said this kind of sharing of the wealth will be strongly encouraged
by parties and can be seen in any number of House races.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national Republican party has made it clear that this is
one of their top targets and we are going to stand ready to help
Congressman Maloney in any way he wishes,'' said Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman John Del Cecato.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the National Republican Congressional Committee
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   More unusual is the fact that Nielsen, a former state senator,
raised $58,583 this period from business PACs. Among the most
generous was Philip Morris, which gave the $5,000 limit.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of business PAC money in a given election
year goes to challengers, Makinson said. ''Businesses are not
really in the business of electing members of Congress. They are in
the business of lobbying. They like sure bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen campaign manager Fergus Cullen suggested business had a
clear reason for breaking the mold.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jim Maloney received more money for labor unions than any
other East Coast member and the business community has noticed
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney raised $121,665 this period from PACs including unions,
issue-oriented groups and the campaign funds of fellow Democrats
including Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   Unions contributed heavily to Maloney in 1998 in large part
because his was one of the few competitive races in the northeast
that year, said campaign manager Jason Linde.

<HEADLINE> Smoking study shows preteens, teens still lighting up  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- About a quarter of New Jersey high-school
students smoke, while 10 percent of middle-school students are
lighting up, according to a study released Tuesday by the state
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   That's progress.
</P>
<P>
   A state study released last year showed that 13 percent of
middle school students had used cigarettes in the month prior to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Another state study reported that about two-thirds of high
school students in 1998 said they smoke cigarettes. Half of those
reported only ''occasional use.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that some stores still sell tobacco to
minors, despite state laws outlawing it. More than one-third of
young smokers said they bought their cigarettes at convenience
stores or gas stations, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Most student smokers -- 37 percent -- bought their cigarettes in
convenience stores, while 25 percent bought them in gas stations.
The rest bummed them from someone else or had someone else buy
them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Health Commissioner Christine Grant, appearing before the state
Assembly budget committee Tuesday, outlined a $30 million proposed
program to prevent kids from smoking and help smokers -- young and
old -- kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already funded programs that are reaching more than
20,000 New Jersey students in middle school, and the tobacco
settlement funds that Governor Whitman's providing will allow us to
expand this program dramatically across the state,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is included in the proposed state budget,
includes an anti-smoking media campaign aimed at kids and teens,
smoking treatment programs for young people and adults and other
local efforts to reduce smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The money will also pay for an evaluation to see how well the
programs work, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million is part of the first installment of New Jersey's
$7.6 billion share of a multibillion dollar national settlement
with tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The study on smokers was conducted by the University of Medicine
and Dentistry's School of Public Health. Researchers surveyed
16,000 students in 164 New Jersey middle and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that nearly 19 percent of students in
seventh and eighth grades and 39 percent of high schoolers use some
type of tobacco -- including cigarettes, cigars and chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Black high school students were the least likely to use tobacco
at 34 percent, while white students had the highest rate of tobacco
use -- 43 percent. More than 35 percent of Hispanic high school
students used tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Students whose families or friends are smokers were twice as
likely to use cigarettes, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the young smokers said they'd like to quit,
but 43 percent of those wanting to quit said they didn't think they
could.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Parents Sue NYC for $81M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The parents of Amadou Diallo on Tuesday sued the
city and the four policemen involved in their son's shooting death
for $81 million -- including $1 million for each of the 41 bullets
fired.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $40 million sought is for pain and suffering
endured since the Feb. 4, 1999 killing of their son. Nineteen of
the 41 shots struck the unarmed Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Diallo's mother, Kadiatou, and his father,
Saikou.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a West African immigrant, was shot as he stood in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building. The four white officers
in the Street Crime Unit testified at their jury trial they mistook
the wallet Diallo pulled out of his pocket for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers were acquitted of murder charges in February.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that the four ''intentionally, wantonly,
recklessly and maliciously'' opened fired.
</P>
<P>
   It also claimed the shooting resulted from aggressive racial
profiling practices sanctioned by police.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyers did not immediately return calls for comment.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Death Row Reviews  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court made it harder Tuesday for
federal judges to overturn tainted convictions and sentences in
state courts, in a decision that potentially affects more than
3,600 death row inmates and hundreds of thousands of other
prisoners nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, struggling to clarify their own past rulings and a
1996 law enacted by Congress, left in doubt their ultimate intent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to wait and see how lower courts utilize this
ruling,'' said Texas Tech law professor Timothy Floyd. ''It's now
harder for state defendants to get into federal court but it
remains to be seen how much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the effect of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act, a 1996 law aimed in part at cutting the time
between sentencing and executions in capital punishment cases.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, people convicted in state courts have had the
right to appeal to federal courts, contending in proceedings known
as ''habeas corpus'' that their prosecution violated some federally
protected right.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision makes clear that the writ of habeas corpus is
not be used as a device to go judge-shopping, running the same
marginal claims past multiple sets of judges,'' said Kent
Schedigger of the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Yackle, a Boston University law professor who filed a
friend-of-the-court brief for the American Civil Liberties Union,
said, ''Today's ruling doesn't shut the federal courthouse door.
Some state inmates will win.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of Supreme Court decisions limited federal court access
for state prisoners, and the 1996 law further restricted federal
judges' second-guessing of state court conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   That law barred federal court relief unless a state court ruling
is ''contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,
clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for a 5-4 majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the
law requires a hands-off approach by federal judges unless a state
court clearly is wrong about some Supreme Court precedent or
''unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the
prisoner's case.''
</P>
<P>
   That standard is stringent, but not as restrictive as one the
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals adopted when it upheld the death
sentence of convicted Virginia murderer Terry Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor in setting the new standard were Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The court's four more liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- voted
to allow greater federal court access.
</P>
<P>
   But the court split 6-3 -- with O'Connor and Kennedy joining
their four more liberal colleagues -- in overturning Williams' death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the six, Stevens said Williams is entitled to a new
sentencing trial because he was denied constitutionally adequate
legal help. Williams says he would have received a life prison
term, not a death sentence, if a court-appointed lawyer had done a
minimally adequate job.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said the Virginia Supreme Court's decision
upholding Williams' sentence ''was both contrary to and involved an
unreasonable application of this court's clearly established
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the court never explained just what makes a ruling
unreasonable. ''It is a common term in the legal world and,
accordingly, federal judges are familiar with its meaning,''
O'Connor said in her opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily so, said Evan Lee, a professor at the University
of California's Hastings law school in San Francisco. ''Justice
O'Connor thinks judges will know it when they see it, but will they
really?'' he said. ''The lack of guidance to lower courts is a real
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas voted against giving Williams any
federal court relief.
</P>
<P>
   The mildly retarded Williams was convicted of killing Harris
Stone, who was found dead at his Danville, Va., home in late 1985.
Williams confessed to fatally beating Stone and stealing his
wallet, which contained $3.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing trial, Williams' lawyer never informed the
jury of Williams' low intelligence or his dreadful childhood, which
included savage beatings by his father and both of his parents
being jailed for criminal neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate decision involving a different Virginia death row
inmate, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Kennedy, made
it somewhat easier for state prisoners to raise issues in federal
court that they did not pursue in earlier state court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Michael Wayne Williams -- convicted of killing
Morris Keller Jr. and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, during a 1993
robbery in Cumberland County, Va. -- Kennedy said the 1996 federal
law lets federal courts consider issues inmates failed to raise in
state court if they failed to discover certain information despite
diligent efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling allows Williams a federal court hearing on his claim
of prosecutorial misconduct and juror bias.

<HEADLINE> Blair Seeks Peace Accord Rescue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair met
with Northern Ireland political leaders and the Irish prime
minister on Tuesday in a new effort to salvage the province's
faltering peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not expect any breakthroughs in the complex
issues, but hoped to work out a plan that would lead to restoration
of powers to the Protestant-Catholic Cabinet suspended in February
because of a deadlock over Irish Republican Army weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are possibilities, but I think it is important
that we don't raise people's expectations too highly before we know
what those expectations may be,'' Blair said after a series of
meetings in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a good will to see this thing through,'' he
said. ''There was an attitude by the parties in favor of the (1998
Good Friday peace) agreement that this is the only serious way
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The power-sharing Cabinet -- which included the largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, and members of the IRA's
political ally, Sinn Fein -- was the centerpiece of the accord and
was only 11 weeks old when its powers were lifted. The British
government decided on a suspension to prevent the complete collapse
of the administration should the Ulster Unionists carry out their
threat to withdraw over the IRA's failure to commit to disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the British and Irish governments now have to seriously
consider is what pressure can they bring to bear and how can they
do it,'' Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said after his
meeting with Blair. ''They really do have to rethink their approach
to this and the business of always offering the republicans carrot
after carrot is in itself not going to work.
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's main nationalist party,
the Social Democratic and Labor Party, said he put forward a plan
to break the impasse and that his meeting with Blair was ''very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair met with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, leaders of the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party. Party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said
his party sought a guarantee that, once the Catholic-Protestant
Cabinet was revived, Britain's top official in the province,
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson, would have no power to
suspend it again.
</P>
<P>
   Blair later went to Dublin to brief Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern on his meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Blair's arrival, Ahern said there were no differences of
opinion between the British and the Irish governments on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a question of what we would agree on, but whether we
can get it implemented. The two governments have a clear view, but
it is not much use if we cannot carry everybody else with us. We
are now seeing if we can get agreement from all the other
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's London office later said he had had ''useful and
positive'' talks lasting more than two hours with Ahern and with
Irish government ministers and officials.

<HEADLINE> 1st Columbine Suit Filed Vs. Sheriff  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The parents of a slain Columbine High
School student sued the sheriff and several deputies Tuesday,
alleging they ignored warnings about the teen-age killers that
could have prevented the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Vonda Shoels' lawsuit was the first of several
expected to be filed by Thursday, the one-year anniversary of the
attack that left 15 dead, including the Shoels' son Isaiah and the
two student gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' families have one year to sue under the statute of
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen notices of intent to sue the sheriff's office
were filed in October, most involving two allegations: that
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone's deputies failed to take
action when told of threats one of the gunmen made in March 1998
and that authorities mishandled their response to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sheriff's department, Sheriff Stone, Lt. (Terry) Manwaring
and the deputy sheriffs stood by while innocent children were
shot,'' the Shoelses' lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   County Attorney Frank Hutfless, who represents the sheriff's
department, did not respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hutfless said: ''While we sympathize with the
families of the victims and the community, the fact is that two
people were responsible for the deaths and injuries at Columbine
High School on April 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had planned the attack for months
before opening fire in the suburban high school, killing 12
classmates and a teacher and wounded about two dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   ''The killers had free rein in the library to kill and maim,''
said Dale Todd, whose son, Evan, was wounded. He expects to file a
lawsuit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold's parents, Thomas and Susan Klebold, also have filed a
notice of intent to sue, claiming the sheriff's officials should
have alerted them to Harris' violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Shoelses' lawsuit notes that the parents of another student
told sheriff's deputies Harris operated a Web site that included
threats of terrorism and against individuals. They contended
deputies failed to notify school officials or the parents of Harris
and Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   If the defendants had taken these steps, ''the chain of events
that led directly to the assaul t... would have been interrupted
and this tragedy would not have occurred,'' their lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   The legal developments come as the Columbine community is
bracing for Thursday's anniversary. Some have said they will attend
memorial services, while others plan to leave the area.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have planned a private assembly, followed by a
public remembrance and evening candlelight vigil. There also will
be several separate memorial services.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves New Antibiotic  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors are getting an important new weapon in
the growing battle against drug-resistant infections: The
government on Tuesday approved a long-awaited drug called Zyvox,
described as the world's first entirely new type of antibiotic in
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox seems to cure some infections impervious to all other
antibiotics, even that longtime drug of last resort called
vancomycin. Consequently, Zyvox could help prevent hundreds,
perhaps even thousands, of life-threatening infections every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes at a time when we were literally running out of
antibiotics,'' said Dr. Robert C. Moellering Jr.,
physician-in-chief of Boston's Beth Israel-Deaconness Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it is being made in both oral and intravenous forms --
meaning when hospitals discharge infected patients, they might go
home with pills instead of a troublesome IV unit, said Dr. Dennis
L. Stevens of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zyvox is just a superb drug,'' said Stevens, who helped test
it. ''It's good ... to treat some pretty nasty infections with an
oral drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that doctors should reserve Zyvox for only the
worst infections and those suspected of being antibiotic-resistant,
or bacteria will quickly evolve to make Zyvox useless.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my wish that Zyvox is used primarily in hospitals,'' not
when primary care physicians just hand out a routine antibiotic
prescription, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Zyvox, made by
Pharmacia Corp., on Tuesday for use by adults with pneumonia and
skin infections, including those caused by a tough-to-treat form of
staph bacteria, and with deadly infections caused by a supergerm
named ''Enterococcus faecium.''
</P>
<P>
   This infamous germ frequently invades surgical wounds and also
causes serious abdominal, urinary tract and heart valve infections.
Worse, enterococcal infections are growing increasingly impervious
to antibiotics. About a quarter of enterococcal infections among
intensive-care patients last year were untreatable by even
vancomycin -- a stunning 43 percent increase from the mid-1990s,
said FDA antibiotic chief Dr. Gary Chikami.
</P>
<P>
   But in a clinical trial of 145 people with vancomycin-resistant
enterococcal infections, Zyvox cured 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In additional studies, Zyvox helped other infections as well as
vancomycin or other standard treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox isn't the only option for untreatable infections: The FDA
last fall approved competitor Aventis' Synercid as the nation's
first alternative when vancomycin fails. Synercid, an intravenous
drug, is a combination of two older European antibiotics that
delivers a one-two punch against bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Zyvox is a synthetic chemical designed from scratch
to fight germs at an entirely different point in their life cycle
than any other medicine -- a true surprise attack. It stops bacteria
from making protein, which in turn stops their growth so the body's
immune system can step in and finish them off, Moellering said.
</P>
<P>
   Known chemically as linezolid, it is the first in a long-awaited
class of antibiotics called oxazolidinones.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a magic bullet. Zyvox has been used experimentally
in only a few thousand people, yet doctors already have counted 15
Zyvox-resistant infections.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it fight all bacteria, only those known as
''gram-positive'' germs.
</P>
<P>
   But gram-positive bacteria are a huge public health threat. They
cause more than half of all serious infections treated in hospitals
worldwide, particularly the kind caught by patients while they're
in the hospital for some other problem.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox's main side effects are headache, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea, afflicting between 3 percent and 11 percent of patients,
the FDA said. The oral version caused more side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Zyvox can cause a decrease in blood platelets, so doctors
must monitor patients' blood, the FDA warned.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox patients should tell their doctors if they take
over-the-counter decongestants such as those containing
pseudoephedrine, or antidepressants such as Prozac, because Zyvox
can interact with such drugs to raise blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia said Zyvox would be available within a few weeks, but
refused to disclose the price except to say it was expected to be a
little lower than competitor Synercid, which costs $85 per
intravenous vial.

<HEADLINE> DreamWorks Takes Fund-Raising Break  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The surprising news that Hollywood's most
prominent Democratic fund-raisers plan a break from hosting the
glitzy affairs after November's election may be a sign the industry
is reaching its donor saturation point, political analysts said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Donors are getting tired of it. These are true-blue Democratic
donors. You just cannot keep saying 'yes' forever,'' said Larry
Makinson, director of the watchdog group the Center for Responsive
Politics. ''I think they may be the first, but they're not going to
be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the decision by Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and
Jeffrey Katzenberg, founders of DreamWorks SKG and three of the
Democrats' most reliable donors and party hosts, came as the trio
hosted a $2.8 million benefit for the Democratic National Committee
during the weekend visit of President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Spahn, a spokesman for DreamWorks, downplayed the trio's
decision, saying the group also took a fund-raising break in 1997
after helping Clinton and other Democrats in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   He denied the decision was a sign the group has less support for
Gore than Clinton, pointing to the weekend fund-raiser as proof of
their commitment. Instead, he said the DreamWorks executives are
simply tired of fund-raising, but won't halt their efforts until
after Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every political candidate in the country from city council on
up to White House aspirants is likely to call us, write us, ask for
a meeting looking for support, looking for help,'' he said. ''It is
nonstop, it is year-round every year. It is a system run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Spahn declined to say how long the break might last and whether
the executives will resume their current level of fund-raising. The
DreamWorks trio has helped raise about $15 million for Democratic
committees and candidates during the Clinton-Gore administration,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hollywood money race, Gore, the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee, has outpaced GOP rival George W. Bush. In the
first nine months of last year, Hollywood donors gave Gore $642,865
compared to $488,327 for Bush, who's doing better than previous GOP
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say donor fatigue started to set in for
Hollywood's contributors as campaigns set record fund-raising
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst and senior
associate with the School of Politics and Economics, Claremont
Graduate University, said candidates, in the end, will get the
money they want.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted other donors will fill the void -- perhaps from
Silicon Valley. Gore, not as comfortable at star-studded Hollywood
events as Clinton, raised some $2.6 million from the high-tech
industry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like nature, political money abhors a vacuum. Someone, some
group will step in,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes at a time when Democrats have become financially
competitive with Republicans. During the first three months of
2000, the Democratic National Committee reported raising $26
million while the Republican National Committee said it raised $24
million. Both parties reported having around $18 million in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Democrats reported having more money in the
bank than their GOP counterparts as of March 31. The Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee said it raised $28.6 million on
hand, while the National Republican Congressional Committee said it
had had $18.2 million. During the first three months of the year,
the NRCC reported raising $20 million to $12.3 million for the
DCCC.
</P>
<P>
   Republican donors have indicated that they, too, are suffering
from donor fatigue in some cases, and some corporate executives
have announced their support for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Spahn said the DreamWorks executives don't blame the candidates
for the system that has made heavy fund-raising a necessity for
candidates and noted the trio supports Gore's interest in campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, said he'd like to
see celebrities like Geffen, Katzenberg and Spielberg turn their
energies to campaign finance reform instead of taking a break
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hopeful that this year will -- because of the amounts
involved -- finally will get people to realize the current system is
not good for democracy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Scott Smith files appeal claiming juror misconduct  </HEADLINE>
sdtvpr
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- New Milford police officer Scott Smith,
convicted of manslaughter for killing an unarmed suspect, on
Tuesday asked a judge to overturn that conviction because of
alleged juror misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Smith's attorney, John Kelly, cited nine
instances of alleged juror misconduct during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he said some jurors pressed others not to
rehear Smith's testimony and a juror nicknamed ''Rambo'' improperly
displayed a sheriff's badge and pressed for conviction, urging that
the other jurors follow his lead because he was experienced in law
enforcement matters.
</P>
<P>
   Some jurors have also claimed that another member of the panel
cited his military experience in the Marines and discussed court
martials and soldiers who had been charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   A juror also has reportedly admitted driving by the crime scene
and discussing the case with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Litchfield Superior Court Judge Charles D. Gill could grant
Smith a new trial, or rule that the alleged statements were proper
in the context of heated deliberations. Waterbury State's Attorney
John Connelly, who prosecuted Smith, said he was confident the
conviction would stand.
</P>
<P>
   During his trial, Smith claimed self defense, saying he shot
Franklyn Reid because he thought Reid was going for a weapon.
Witnesses said it appeared that Reid had surrendered and was
offering no resistance when he was shot in the back at point-blank
range.
</P>
<P>
   Smith originally was charged with murder following the December
1998 shooting but was convicted of manslaughter. He is scheduled to
be sentenced on May 5.

<HEADLINE> DC Police Defend Protest Tactics  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia officials are heartened
that bands of protesters were prevented from sabotaging world
finance meetings, but a debate about police tactics erupted in the
wake of nasty street confrontations that led to more than 1,300
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wanted to see another Seattle,'' said Chief Charles H.
Ramsey of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, particularly the
nation's capital -- tourist haven, host to diplomats, presidents,
kings and queens, the nation's showcase.
</P>
<P>
   The department's commanders had a nightmare scenario in mind --
protesters like those in Seattle last fall, rampaging and
destroying property, police reacting and perhaps overreacting with
tear gas -- when they drafted a plan to prevent criminal activity
without muzzling social activism.
</P>
<P>
   ''They really probe to see where your weak points are,'' said
Ramsey. He said demonstrators were organized and often communicated
with two-way radios and cellular telephones. During three difficult
days, Saturday through Monday, they won his grudging admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the protests targeting World Bank and International
Monetary Fund meetings, more than 1,500 police went through crowd
control training. The city bought body armor to protect its
officers from the rocks, bottles, and sticks that injured Seattle
police when demonstrators disrupted a World Trade Organization
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey kept a high profile throughout, wading into crowds of
protesters to engage them in debate and even, on occasion, to laugh
with them. At one point, the chief's deputy, Terry Gainer, gave a
bouquet of flowers to a cluster of protesters. The demonstrations
ended with a negotiated mass arrest that injured no one.
</P>
<P>
   At times, 90 city blocks were closed off and steel barriers set
up to block alleys within the security zone. Cameras on roofs
enabled police to watch protesters and move officers to places
where they could respond to protesters quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their intelligence information and technology, critics
contend police did not always differentiate between peaceful
protesters and those considered capable of violence and they accuse
Ramsey of trying to discredit their movement by distorting their
image.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's said things about the protesters that were inaccurate,''
including allegations that members of Mobilization for Global
Justice manufactured Molotov cocktails and homemade pepper spray,
said Adam Eidinger, a protest organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering resentment by demonstrators in the aftermath of the
protest marches surfaced Tuesday in a clash at the District of
Columbia Superior Court, where a small number of protesters went to
complain about how U.S. marshals treated their fellow demonstrators
when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One young man rushed the courthouse door. He was tackled and
pepper-sprayed, several others were also pepper-sprayed. When order
was restored, the protesters held a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members have threatened to file lawsuits and civil
rights complaints accusing the police of brutality and alleging
that that their constitutional rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ennis, who came from Massachusetts to participate in the
protests, was part of Monday's peaceful mass arrest. She said the
gentle treatment ended there: She saw federal marshals kick
demonstrators and was threatened by them herself when she asked to
make a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt physically endangered the entire time,'' Ennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Other protestors said they were kept handcuffed or chained
overnight and were given no food, water or blankets, although many
were soaked from drenching rains Monday. Some suffered severe
chills and had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the U.S. Marshals Service did not immediately
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Klotz, a security consultant who used to command the
D.C. Metropolitan Police Department's Special Operations Division,
said police in Seattle had to retake ground lost to protesters. But
here, he said, police never let protesters gain a foothold near the
World Bank, IMF or important federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's called seizing the high ground,'' Klotz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey also had active support from other federal and state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia temporarily closed a lane used by commuters between the
Pentagon in Arlington, Va., and Washington so it would be available
to Virginia public safety personnel if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service unbolted 86 mailboxes from 60 locations
within what became the police security zone. The boxes are often
removed during major Washington events to make them unavailable to
protesters looking for a place to hide bombs. Hundreds of newspaper
vending machines were also removed from downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost for the equipment, overtime, and support
services could top $5 million, officials said -- a figure equivalent
to an appropriation Congress provided for Seattle to pay for
security for last fall's WTO meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Police drew praise from business leaders, even though
disruptions left many offices nearly inaccessible from Friday
through Monday and cost nearby restaurants and shops a day's
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very grateful that there wasn't any loss of property or
personal injury,'' said David Rutstein, chairman of the Greater
Washington Board of Trade, representing the region's largest
private employers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People's confidence in this government has increased
markedly,'' Rutstein said.

<HEADLINE> RI Officers Cleared in Cop's Death  </HEADLINE>
By GILLIAN FLYNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Two white policemen who fatally shot an
off-duty black officer they mistook for a suspect were cleared
Tuesday of criminal wrongdoing by a state grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The January shooting death of 29-year-old Sgt. Cornel Young Jr.
sparked protests, accusations that the Providence police were
racist and led to a federal civil rights inquiry that remains
ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury spent about two months reviewing the conduct of
Officers Michael Solitro and Carlos Saraiva and Young's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on all communities in Rhode Island whatever their
opinions about today's announcements to be calm, to be responsible
and to continue to fight in appropriate channels,'' said Attorney
General Sheldon Whitehouse, criticized by some community leaders
for his handling of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Young's mother, Leisa Young, said she was angry she had to learn
of the ruling from reporters. Bill Fischer, a Whitehouse aide, said
the attorney general had left messages at her home and work but
could not reach her before he held a news conference to announce
the grand jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much trust am I supposed to put in the fact that they're
going to do anything else?'' Leisa Young said, as she left a
meeting with ministers at the Allen A.M.E. church.
</P>
<P>
   Solitro, 33, and Saraiva, 30, were responding to a fight outside
a Providence restaurant Jan. 28, when Young, in street clothes, saw
the confrontation, drew his gun and rushed outside to help the
officers. Solitro and Saraiva said they repeatedly told Young to
drop the weapon but he did not comply and they shot him.
</P>
<P>
   The police union insisted Young's shooting was a case of a bad
split-second decision, not prejudice. It issued a statement Tuesday
saying members were saddened that some community leaders were using
the tragedy to further their own agendas ''with disregard of the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joseph Pezza, the attorney for Solitro, who had been on
the patrol for seven nights when he shot Young, said the officer
was relieved and hoped soon to return to work. ''He was very
emotional,'' Pezza said. ''He hoped the truth would come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Joseph F. Penza Jr. said Saraiva was torn over whether
he should return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his own mind, the actions he took were justified,'' Penza
said. ''But only he knows if he can go back and do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Martin Hames, a police spokesman, said both men had been on
leave from the department and administrators would determine when
they could return to active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders held a series of protests, rallies and
prayer meetings, demanding someone with no ties to Rhode Island
enforcement investigate the case. Whitehouse refused, saying it was
his responsibility as the state's top prosecutor to lead the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Theodore Wilson, among those pushing for an independent
prosecutor, said he was not surprised by the grand jury decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the onset this process was tainted and whatever came out,
wasn't worth the piece of paper it was written on,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., asked the Congressional Black
Caucus to examine the case. Kennedy planned to meet with civil
rights leaders Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse said he decided not to pursue a felony murder count
police had filed against Aldrin Diaz, who waved a gun in the
confrontation that ended in Young's death. The state grand jury on
Tuesday indicted Diaz on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's lawyers said their client was a scapegoat for police
misconduct.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Body To OK Gay Civil Union Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A bill that would create the closest
thing in America to gay marriage won preliminary approval in the
state Senate on Tuesday after a debate watched by people wearing
either white ribbons or pink stickers to show where they stood.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-11 vote came after the Senate defeated two proposed
constitutional amendments designed to outlaw same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will be up for final approval in the Senate on
Wednesday. A similar measure has already passed the House, but that
chamber will have to consider changes made by the Senate.
Democratic Gov. Howard Dean has said he will sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would enable gay couples to form ''civil unions''
that would entitle them to all 300 or so rights and benefits
available under state law to married couples. No other state has
gone as far as Vermont to give gay couples something approximating
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vermont's gay couples would still not be entitled to
the federal benefits available to married couples in such areas as
taxes and Social Security. And unlike marriage, civil unions would
not confer portable rights; other states would probably not
recognize such unions.
</P>
<P>
   National groups quickly weighed in after the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vermont is taking care of its gay and lesbian citizens in a
way that other states are not. Vermont is restating its commitment
to fairness by today's action,'' said David Smith of the Human
Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Janet Parshall of the Family Research Council
said: ''It's a tragic day for the state of Vermont, for the Senate
has ignored the will of the people. But it's an even sadder day for
the state of marriage, for the Senate action today was a direct
assault on this sacred institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard McCormack, a Democrat, said in support of the bill,
''We can do something very, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the dozens of people sitting in the Senate
galleries, standing along the chamber's walls and milling about the
hallways was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate debate lacked much of the passion displayed during 17
hours of debate last week in the House, where the Legislature's
only openly gay member spoke several times, drawing tears to the
eyes of many observers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation, wearing white ribbons to signify
their support for traditional marriage, stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with supporters wearing pink stickers favoring civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators who voted against the bill said they were doing
so because their constituents opposed it. Others said they feared
the national and international reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the United States and the world will judge our decision
today,'' warned Republican Sen. Julius Canns.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court set the stage for the legislation with
its unanimous December ruling that same-sex couples were being
unconstitutionally denied the benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would create a status parallel to marriage by
allowing gay and lesbian couples to obtain a license from their
town clerks and then have their unions certified by a judge or
member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex couples then would qualify for the wide array of
benefits available to married couples, from being able to make
medical decisions on behalf of their partners to qualifying for
certain tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   To break up a civil union, couples would have to go through
Family Court to obtain dissolutions, just as when married couples
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure had attempted to derail it Tuesday with
the pair of constitutional amendments. One amendment would have
added to the state Constitution the definition of marriage as a
union between a man and a woman. The second would have overturned
the Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe their sexual orientation runs counter to natural
law,'' Republican Sen. John Crowley said of same-sex couples as he
argued for the marriage definition.
</P>
<P>
   Neither amendment won a simple majority, let alone the
two-thirds required for constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people listened to debate on the amendments over
speakers in hallways outside the small Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Christian stood with a brightly colored sign that read:
''Friendship does not equal marriage! Get real!''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawyers say van driver admits possible error before troopers openedfire  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The driver of a van carrying four
minorities admitted he may have stepped on the accelerator,
prompting two state troopers to open fire in a case that set off a
firestorm over racial profiling in New Jersey, a defense lawyer
contends.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert Galantucci maintains that instead of attempted
murder, the gunshots fired that night on the New Jersey Turnpike
were a justifiable police shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our law doesn't expect people to be perfect. It expects them
to be reasonable,'' Galantucci said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Trooper John Hogan, 29, of Florence, was reasonable when he
and Trooper James Kenna fired on the van, wounding three of the
four young men inside. The troopers acted in self defense, thinking
that the van was backing up to hit them, Galantucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Public outcry after the shooting led to widespread allegations
of racial profiling by state troopers and a severely critical
report by the Attorney General's Office detailing the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key point in this case is the perception of the state
troopers, not the perception of those young men,'' Galantucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Galantucci asked a state Superior Court judge on Monday to
dismiss the attempted murder indictments in part because the
prosecutor acted improperly, he maintains. Jack Arsenault, the
lawyer for Kenna, 28, of Hamilton Square, plans to file a similar
motion.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, driver Keshon Moore, 24, of New
York, admitted that he felt like he started the incident, according
to a lengthy legal brief filed by Galantucci.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't blame anybody but myself. It was a mistake,'' Moore
told the grand jury, according to Galantucci's brief.
</P>
<P>
   Moore also told the panel that he was driving with a suspended
license and he ''probably hit the accelerator'' as he jumped into
the back seat. The driver possibly became nervous as he tried to
hand the wheel over to a passenger, Danny Reyes, the motion
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers pulled the van over on the turnpike the night of
April 23, 1998. Moore's three passengers were wounded when Hogan
and Kenna fired 11 shots into the van. Moore was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers have said they fired in self-defense because the
van began backing up toward them as they approached it on foot
after stopping it for speeding.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers are white; Moore and his passengers are minorities.
Hogan and Kenna, who have pleaded innocent in the shooting, have
been suspended without pay, pending the outcome of their case. They
are charged with attempted murder and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lennon, president of the State Troopers Fraternal Association
of New Jersey, says the information contained in the court papers
vindicates what troopers have been saying since the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a series of mistakes that day and the first one was
made by the driver,'' Lennon said.
</P>
<P>
   If the van headed backward at the troopers, that is a criminal
act and the troopers are required to take action, not shrink away,
Lennon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that at last it shows the troopers were acting in self
defense and in my opinion it basically exonerates them,'' Lennon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Galantucci said this motion was filed first because it requires
the judge to analyze ''thousands of pages'' of grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Special Prosecutor James J. Gerrow is scheduled to file a
response next month and arguments are planned for June 27 before
state Superior Court Judge Andrew J. Smithson. Gerrow said Tuesday
''it would be inappropriate to comment'' and would respond to all
issues in his motion.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion Galantucci alleges that grand jurors were
influenced by reports of racial profiling by police when they
should have considered only the law regarding proper use of deadly
force by law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the nine-month investigation, grand jurors had
been ''primed to find'' evidence that the shooting was racially
motivated, Galantucci alleges. And grand jurors were not admonished
that racial profiling, the practice of police targeting minorities,
was not a case issue before them.
</P>
<P>
   Also tainting the grand jury was an indictment alleging that
Kenna and Hogan falsified their traffic logs -- a tactic officials
maintain was an attempt to disguise the race of motorists they
stopped, the motion says. That should have remained sealed until
after the grand jury completed its work on the turnpike shooting,
he contends.

<HEADLINE> Annan Challenges Finance Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan challenged
world financial leaders Tuesday to listen to demonstrators who
protested in Washington against world poverty and the exclusion of
many poor nations from the benefits of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's audience included many finance ministers fresh from the
tumultuous meetings of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, which protesters tried to disrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to turn this unease, this ferment, this
confrontational energy, into something constructive -- into
something that benefits all the people and which all the people can
support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's remarks were made at a joint meeting of the U.N.
Economic and Social Council and the two global financial
institutions that met in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a report earlier this month on the challenges facing the
world in the 21st century, Annan called for an all-out effort to
lift more than 1 billion people out of extreme poverty by 2015, an
appeal he reiterated Tuesday to the controllers of government purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when some people have reaped enormous benefits from
new technology, Annan said, it is ''shameful and unacceptable that
another part -- and by most reckonings the larger part -- remains
excluded ... subjected to a life of grinding poverty often
accompanied by malnutrition and disease.''
</P>
<P>
   With minimal investment in basic education, Annan argued,
billions of poor people can leapfrog into the world of instant
communications and become part of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington meetings, ministers and bankers renewed
pledges to hasten debt relief for the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The international community has launched the Highly Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative to reduce the debt burden of
countries that are pursuing reasonable economic policies as well as
managing their future debt. But Cuba complained that only four of
the 33 poorest countries were going through the process.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank Managing Director Sven Sandstrom said $2.4 billion
has so far been pledged to the HIPC trust fund but ''this is only a
fraction of what is going to be needed in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF Acting Managing Director Stanley Fischer noted that the IMF
has not received permission to sell gold to help finance the fund,
that regional development banks don't have money to contribute, and
that many pledges have not been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's Finance Minister Jubril Martin Kuye said many
middle-income countries were becoming increasingly indebted and
suggested that the international community should consider
extending debt relief to them.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Unveil Water Heater Measure  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is proposing a
requirement for more energy-efficient water heaters -- the latest in
a string of environmental miniannouncements from Gore's office
aimed getting a jump on Earth Day this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing a plan to protect drinking water earlier in the
week, Gore will propose efficiency standards Wednesday for
residential water heaters with an aim toward ameliorating
atmospheric climate change.
</P>
<P>
   The final water heater standard, if finished this year, would go
into effect in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ''These new standards will help save consumers money on energy
bills and reduce greenhouse gases and other pollution,'' Gore says
in a draft announcement obtained Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Timing of the announcement took by surprise some people at the
Energy Department, where the standards are being developed. The
standards, which will apply to all new residential water heaters,
are not scheduled for publication in the Federal Register until
April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says the more efficient water heaters will reduce
greenhouse gas emissions over the next 20 years by 36 million
metric tons, equivalent to taking 28 million cars off the road, and
help curtail the prospects of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president notes that Americans spend $20 billion a year
to heat water, which accounts for 14 percent of household energy
requirements. Over the typical 12-year life of a water heater, the
average consumer would save about $100 with the more efficient
model, the vice president's office estimates.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gore announced the Environmental Protection Agency
was proposing new requirements on 157,000 water systems that get
water from public wells so as to reduce risks from bacteria and
parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's corner on the environmental market was challenged last
week by his Republican presidential rival George W. Bush, who
revealed a plan to expedite cleanup of abandoned industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency, under Carol Browner, a
close Gore confidant, also has put high priority on cleaning up
so-called ''brownfield'' industrial areas that are contaminated by
past pollution but with modest cleanup could be returned safely to
limited commercial uses.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: No ETs in Our Programs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Believe it or not, the Pentagon denied Tuesday
that extraterrestrials participate in classified U.S. military
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Ken Bacon was responding to reporters' questions about
Monday's Internet posting of the first detailed satellite images of
Area 51, the supersecret Air Force test site in Nevada that UFO
buffs think holds alien technology.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Internet posting revealed military secrets, Bacon
said he was ''not aware that any information was revealed that
compromised'' military activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since Sputnik, we have operated in a world of overhead
surveillance, and we have had more than 40 years to learn how to
deal with overhead surveillance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to confirm or deny whether alien spacecraft or anything
extraterrestrial has ever been stored at the facility, Bacon didn't
answer directly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have no
classified program that relies on aliens from outer space,'' he
joked.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh-based Aerial Images Inc. -- in collaboration with Kodak,
Digital Equipment Corp., Autometric Inc. and the Russian agency
Sovinformsputnik -- posted five images of the hush-hush desert
proving ground on the Web at http://www.terraserver.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first glimpse into the most secret training and
testing facility for the Air Force,'' said John Hoffman, president

<HEADLINE> National Park Passes Available  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vacationers who want to tour as many of the
national parks as possible this summer have a new way to save
money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service on Tuesday began offering a new $50
''National Park Pass'' that allows people access to any national
park that charges an admission fee. The pass is good for one year.
</P>
<P>
   It costs between $2 and $10 to get into many of the national
park units and as much as $20 to visit some of the most popular
parks such as the Grand Canyon. Visitors can be charged either by
the carload or individually.
</P>
<P>
   If the park charges by vehicle, the pass exempts only one
vehicle. If the park charges by person, the pass admits only the
purchaser, spouse, children and parents.
</P>
<P>
   A ''pop-out map'' of the 379 national parks, monuments,
seashores and historic areas is included with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The new park pass was approved by Congress as a way to reduce
the cost for those who plan to make frequent visits or plan
extensive tours of the park system.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said the National Park Service
expects to sell 485,000 of the passes this year and as many as 1
million a year in coming years. He said the new passes could raise
$160 million for the park system.
</P>
<P>
   The new pass also ''gives Americans a special connection to
their parks,'' said the National Park Foundation, a group charged
by Congress to help park fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the pass will feature a different park. The inaugural
pass features a scene from Yellowstone National Park.

<HEADLINE> Drug Director Criticizes Journalist  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House drug policy director Barry
McCaffrey is striking back at a prize-winning investigative
reporter he accuses of spreading ''defamatory'' allegations about
McCaffrey's conduct as an Army general in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, McCaffrey's efforts are bringing to the
public's attention an assortment of allegations against him even
before they are published.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to head off an article that is being prepared by
Seymour Hersh for The New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said Tuesday that Hersh, who won a Pulitzer Prize for
exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam in 1968, has been spreading
a range of false accusations during interviews with friends and
former military colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: assertions that troops led by McCaffrey killed Iraqi
prisoners of war, that McCaffrey committed unspecified crimes in
the Vietnam War and that he has acted inappropriately in pushing a
$1.6 billion anti-drug aid package for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey wrote New Yorker editor David Remnick last month to
warn against publishing false and libelous statements. He accuses
Hersh of malice and ''journalistic stalking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotten calls from dozens of friends over the last three
months reporting a series of accusations by Mr. Hersh ranging from
bike theft at age 11 to atrocities in the Gulf War,'' McCaffrey
said. ''They are defamatory and sort of frightening to my friends
and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said Tuesday he wouldn't comment on reporting that has yet
to be published.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to McCaffrey's Office of National Drug Control
Policy, made available by a McCaffrey spokesman, Hersh denied that
he was acting maliciously.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am simply going about my business, as I have for the past 35
years, asking questions, listening to answers and trying to verify
and assess what I've been told,'' wrote Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker spokeswoman Perri Dorset declined to discuss the
contents of Hersh's article but said it was going through normal
fact-checking procedures. ''Sy's a terrific reporter who has a
proven track record and The New Yorker stands by that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he isn't sure what Hersh is writing, McCaffrey is
convinced the reporter is biased against him and has refused him an
interview. He has complained to editors at The New York Times and
The Washington Post, as well as other journalists, about Hersh's
tactics. The Post published an account of the dispute Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he began discussing how to handle the situation
with a few journalists after reporters working on other stories
asked him about rumors that Hersh was pursuing the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was especially alarmed by suggestions that, under his
command, the 24th Infantry Division killed POWs and committed other
war crimes in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is only fair to give notice that I cannot accept
publication of false statements by Mr. Hersh that would dishonor
the 24th Infantry Division,'' McCaffrey wrote to Remnick,
specifically warning against ''libelous attacks'' that would damage
the good names of the division's 19,000 soldiers who, unlike
McCaffrey, are not public figures.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Raimondi, spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal
Investigation Command, said Hersh had requested and received
records of investigations of alleged wrongdoing at the end of the
Gulf War. ''There was no criminal wrongdoing found,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps Gen. C.E. Wilhelm, commander of the U.S. Southern
Command, and other current and former military officers have backed
McCaffrey in letters to the magazine's editor and written accounts
of their conversations with Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   Dorset said The New Yorker has received pre-emptive strikes
against publication before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time it's happened,'' she said. ''Anytime
you're working with sensitive material, you have people trying to
protect themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Qualcomm Beats Analyst Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings at Qualcomm Inc. beat
expectations as the company reported strong sales of its mobile
phone technology.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm said its net income for the three months ended March 26
totaled $199.7 million, or 25 cents per share, on revenues of $728
million compared to a loss of $42.6 million, or 7 cents a share, on
sales of $932 million during the same quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time costs, including those related to the sale of
the company's struggling consumer phone business, earnings rose 44
percent to 26 cents per share in the second quarter of 2000 from 18
cents per share a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts were expecting earnings of 24 cents per
share, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The company shipped more than 11 million of its Mobile Station
Modem phone chips to customers worldwide during the quarter,
compared to 9 million a year-earlier. Shipments are expected to
reach 14.5 million in the third quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm expects to meet current expectations for earns of 27
cents per share in the third quarter of this year on expected
growth in sales of chips and software, the company added.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings were released after regular trading on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, where shares of Qualcomm fell $4.68} to $112.87{. In
after-hours trading, shares rose to $119.25.

<HEADLINE> Gore Works on Consistency Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sounding almost like a Democrat, Republican
George W. Bush unveils an education agenda one day,
headline-grabbing health care and environmental initiatives the
next, an affordable-housing plan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   It may seem as if the real Democrat in the presidential race is
taking a nap during this springtime lull in the campaign. But after
one splashy misstep in the Elian Gonzalez storm, the vice
president, who put his policy proposals on the table months ago, is
executing a low-watt strategy to gain consistency for his message,
cash for his party, and a homespun shine to his public image.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides know he makes no front pages with the ''School Days''
he's begun conducting in battleground states like Michigan. There,
he talked education policy until midnight over teacher Claudia
Amboyer's chocolate cake before tucking himself into her son's
bedroom and immersing himself the next day in her eight-hour school
routine.
</P>
<P>
   But local communities eat up these vignettes, Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane said. And the campaign sees them as a way -- much like
Gore's exhaustive open meetings in Iowa and New Hampshire -- to undo
perceptions of him as detached and a Washington insider.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lesson from Iowa and New Hampshire, where Al Gore spent a
great deal of time, was that people liked him more the more they
saw him and heard him,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the sense that Gore is running under the radar is his
determination to let the Gonzalez furor pass.
</P>
<P>
   After first insisting that the Cuban boy's custody would be
''settled'' if his father came to the United States to state his
wishes, Gore endorsed legislation to give the family residency -- a
move criticized by Republicans and some outraged Democrats as
pandering to Florida's Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign finance reform package sparked derisive agreement
by some with his own line about being ''an imperfect messenger''
because of allegations about his 1996 campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Gore's evolving stands on Elian and campaign
reform resurrected a key vulnerability -- inconsistency. Already,
his record on abortion and gun control as a congressman from
Tennessee has been criticized as filled with flip-flops. More
recently, the issues were gays in the military and investing Social
Security funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's generally hard to know what Al Gore believes in on any
given day,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gore's Lehane called Bush's initiatives
effort ''the Seinfeld of campaigns -- a campaign about nothing
beyond his irresponsible tax cuts and embracing of Bob Jones
University.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's obviously now trying to find policy Band-Aids to cover up
the fact that he has very little depth on these policy issues,''
Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's schedule these days is dominated by almost daily fund
raising -- with severely restricted press coverage -- for the
Democratic National Committee, which out-raised the Republican
Party by $2 million for the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a single stop in California's Silicon Valley last week, Gore
picked up a record $2.6 million. His five-day total the week before
was $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, fund raising for the Republican National Committee
is on Bush's back burner while he tries to replenish the $60
million he's already emptied from his own coffers. He's also
playing catch-up in the policy game.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer rejected the notion that Bush's policy push is
belated.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are going to be scores of issues and we have a
deliberate plan to address them. But if you address everything a
year before the election, what's left?''
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives on the family, government waste and trade are still
to come, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nomination battle with Bill Bradley last year forced him
to the table early with health care, education, Medicare, tax,
child care and anti-hunger proposals. On the Republican side, Bush
sketched ideas for charitable institutions and defense spending and
outlined education reforms, but tax cuts made up the core of his
policy agenda before now.
</P>
<P>
   ''They sprinkled around some policy initiatives that they
thought would energize their base, particularly their conservative
base,'' said Republican strategist Greg Mueller, a former adviser
to Steve Forbes, who ran against Bush for the GOP nomination but
has since endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   After a primary season that saw Bush listing rightward and
courting religious conservatives, Mueller said Bush is ''now coming
back with issues, particularly education and health care, which
play very well with Hispanic and suburban-women swing voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush has proposed nearly $60 billion in new
spending on signature Democratic issues: childhood literacy, health
care for the poor, low-income housing and environmental cleanup.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Tuesday urged the authoritarian president of Uzbekistan
to ease his grip on opposition and show more respect for human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a frank discussion on the importance of meeting
international norms on a variety of human rights issues,'' Albright
said after meeting with Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other Central Asian nations, Uzbekistan fared badly
in the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report.
According to international human rights groups, political prisoners
in Uzbekistan number in the hundreds, prison conditions are rough,
inmates are treated badly and representatives of the International
Committee of the Red Cross are denied access.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, on a tour of the region, said that Karimov agreed to
look into the possibility of ICRC visits to prisons, but refused to
accept any criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took on board the issues that I raised, he disagreed with
me and I disagreed with him,'' she said. ''We will continue to make
our case and we will continue to follow the events very
carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Karimov is a Muslim like most Uzbeks, but he has established a
strong secular rule and views fundamentalist Islamic groups as a
main threat to his government. After years of relentless
repression, opposition leaders have been either jailed or forced
into exile, and the government has also cracked down on human
rights groups, Muslim activists and free media.
</P>
<P>
   A series of bombings of government buildings in February 1999,
which killed 13 people and wounded about 100, was blamed on Islamic
militants and served as a pretext for uprooting few remaining
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   Karimov, who has ruled Uzbekistan since 1989 when he became its
Communist party boss, won a second term by a landslide in February
elections. His single opponent said he himself voted for the
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Karimov's argument that harsh rule is needed to
prevent the spread of Islamic fundamentalism from Afghanistan,
Albright warned that it would only foment unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's necessary that the government of Uzbekistan distinguishes
very carefully between peaceful devout believers and those who
advocate terrorism,'' she said. ''An unwillingness to make such
distinctions actually undermines security by strengthening those
who favor extremism and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the United States acknowledges the risks posed by
extremist groups in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region and
offered Uzbekistan the same $3 million package of assistance she
promised at her previous stops to Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. money will help train and equip local border guards,
customs and counterterrorist units and is aimed at sealing porous
regional borders against flows of drugs, arms and militants.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Albright visited ancient mosques, a synagogue
and an artisan community during a tour Tuesday of the 2,500-year
old city of Bukhara, which stressed Uzbekistan's majestic cultural
history.

<HEADLINE> Collins asks high court to clarify school construction order  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- In an unusual move, Assembly Speaker Jack
Collins filed a motion Tuesday asking the state Supreme Court to
settle the nagging question of whether the state must pay the full
cost of school construction in poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins also said that, no matter what the high court does,
his request would not further delay long-awaited legislation to
create the statewide school construction program.
</P>
<P>
   He promised that a bill would be in place by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver is the latest in the ongoing struggle over how to
fund the program, which is estimated to cost between $11 billion
and $13 billion and would make building funds available to all New
Jersey districts.
</P>
<P>
   In question is a 1998 state Supreme Court decision that most --
including the governor and Senate president -- interpret as ordering
the state to fully fund construction costs in 30 of New Jersey's
poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins, R-Salem, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   He said the constitution -- and previous court decisions -- give
the Legislature the right to decide how to fund education needs.
That funding formula, the speaker argues, can include requiring
local districts to ante up their share.
</P>
<P>
   Collins wants to know whether the court decision prohibits the
state from compelling these poor districts to pay what they can
afford, as long as the state fully funds all ''constitutionally
necessary construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has proposed fully funding emergency repairs and new
classroom space to relieve overcrowding. State money for ''extras''
such as cafeterias and media rooms would be provided on a sliding
scale, depending on a district's ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the school construction legislation has dragged on for
months, with major differences separating competing versions backed
by Collins and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman and DiFrancesco say the court's 1998
landmark Abbott vs. Burke ruling compels the state to pay the full
fare for repairing and replacing crumbling buildings in the special
needs districts.
</P>
<P>
   The court set a spring deadline for that construction to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to meet May 18 to consider the school
construction bill. The Assembly plans to meet on May 22 and 25 and
could consider the bill during those sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Collins has no right to ask for court intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's language is crystal clear that the state would
fully fund facilities improvement in the Abbott districts because
of their dire fiscal circumstances,'' said David Sciarra, director
of the Education Law Center, which represents poor children in the
30-year-old school funding fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is entirely inappropriate for the speaker to ask for the
court's advice on how he should deal with pending legislation,
especially when the court has issued an unequivocal mandate,''
Sciarra added.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Askin, a Rutgers law professor, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where the Assembly speaker has any authority at
all to seek that kind of clarification,'' said Askin. ''He's not a
party to the case. It's a political statement of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins plans to run for governor next year and some say he is
using the school construction issue to distinguish himself from
DiFrancesco, the other likely Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Collins scoffs at that suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   He says it's his right -- and duty -- to question whether state
taxpayers should be forced to pay for construction in these 30
districts, especially since some of the districts are now in better
fiscal shape than some ''non-Abbott'' districts.
</P>
<P>
   Hoboken, for example, has become richer in the years that the
lawsuit has winded through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is specifically asking for clarification of the
following clause in the Supreme Court's 1998 ruling:
</P>
<P>
   ''We conclude that any funding formula that does not fund the
complete cost of remediating the infrastructure and life cycle
deficiencies that have been identified in the Abbott districts or
that does not fully fund the construction of any new classrooms
needed to correct capacity deficiencies will not comport with the
State's constitutional mandate to provide facilities adequate to
ensure a thorough and efficient education.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Comfort, spokeswoman for the state Judiciary, said the
state and Education Law Center have 10 days to respond and then the
high court will consider the matter.

<HEADLINE> Federal appeals court shuts down Megan's Law  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ordered a
freeze on sex offender notifications in New Jersey until it has
time to review the fairness of procedures being used by local
officials who issue these warnings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas last week ruled that the
state's Megan's Law guidelines, as revised by Attorney General John
Farmer, provided a reasonable system for warning neighbors about
sex offenders while making sure the privileged information was not
leaked to the community at large.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia issued
an order Tuesday saying it wanted to review these facts for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Appellate Judge Dolores Sloviter ordered Megan's Law
notifications frozen in the meantime -- a step Irenas never took
even after he demanded that the guidelines be improved.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Public Defenders office, which represents sex
offenders, hailed the order because in their view the current
system for notifications does not prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a ruling last year
written by Sloviter, said Megan's Law was all right provided
reasonable steps are taken to make sure that information about sex
offenders was given only to neighbors who were authorized to
receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Sloviter said people have a constitutional right to keep their
home address private, and that authorities must take steps to
protect this right when conducting door-to-door notifications about
sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, sex offenders who are released from prison or who
move into New Jersey are required to register their address, and
officials seek to conduct limited notifications to neighbors or
area schools according to their assessment of the risk that the
offender might pose to others.
</P>
<P>
   For high risk offenders, police conduct door-to-door
notification with name, address, photo, criminal record and other
details. For those deemed moderate risk, notifications are limited
to area schools, daycare centers, Little Leagues and other
facilities or organizations that have custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   In a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of sex offenders, the
Public Defender's office has challenged the notification
procedures, saying the information was frequently leaked to others
not entitled to receive it and further, that county prosecutors
were not doing enough to prevent these leaks.
</P>
<P>
   This lawsuit, named for one juvenile offender identified only as
Paul P., is the case now on appeal to the 3rd Circuit for the
second time in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Defender's office in a news statement Tuesday noted
that the federal court in its first ruling on the Paul P. matter
said sex offenders have some constitutional right to privacy
regarding where they live, however limited it might be. They
ordered that Megan's Law be designed to give the home address some
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Even though authorities can give a sex offender's address to
neighbors deemed to have a need to know it, this decision ''does
not strip the information of its protection against disclosure to
those who have no similar need.''
</P>
<P>
   Using this decision, the Public Defenders office has continued
to claim New Jersey's guidelines are too lax to meet the court's
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Davis, a spokesman for Farmer, said, ''We believe we have
made a good faith effort to comply with the court to strike the
right balance to protect the public and to meet any privacy
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis had no comment on the meaning of Sloviter's order to
freeze Megan's Law temporarily, adding that it is not an indication
that the new guidelines are flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have done this in the past,'' Davis said. ''Since they
didn't give us a reason why, it would be hard to say we are
disappointed because we don't know what the court's reasoning was
at this point. ... Let's not jump to conclusions.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Says It Violated Its Own Code  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service violated its
own code and the federal Privacy Act by improperly disclosing tax
data on 1,391 taxpayers to an accountant, agency officials said
Tuesday. The agency has apologized to the taxpayers and offered
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the error, the agency could be liable for at
least $1.3 million in penalties, said Jodi Patterson, an IRS
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was discovered last fall after certified public
accountant William Wewee, a former IRS employee, requested tax
return information for 50 clients fearful of the so-called Y2K bug.
The IRS sent him information on 1,391 taxpayers, including their
names, Social Security numbers, tax liabilities and taxable income,
Wewee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew they had just broken the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wewee reported the violation to the IRS and the Treasury
Department. He also contacted a number of those whose information
he was sent and is looking into a possible class action.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Department officials declined to comment on their
investigation. Calls to an assistant U.S. Attorney in Tucson also
investigating were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   IRS district director James Walsh in Phoenix sent out 1,300
letters of apology April 7, providing information about suing,
discussing penalties for wrongful disclosure and offering
administrative awards of $1,000 per violation. Under IRS code, a
judge could award damages of $1,000 or actual damages above $1,000.
Since the awards offered are administrative, a judge's approval is
not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a legal settlement,'' Patterson said. ''We're
offering this relief because they're entitled to it and it is the
right thing to do. But it absolutely does not preclude them from
suing for violation or for seeking punitive damages as well.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people have accepted the award, she said.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Janitors Go on Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Hundreds of janitors at suburban office buildings
went on strike Tuesday, hours after their striking counterparts
downtown reached a settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In separate talks Tuesday, negotiators for the Service Employees
International Union and the Suburban Contractors Association met
with a federal mediator to discuss contracts for the suburban
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still extremely far apart,'' said Barry White, a
negotiator for the contractors. He said plans were in place to
provide the necessary services in the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Ken Munz said about 500 of the union's 4,500
suburban janitors went on strike. Others were to report for work as
usual, but would gradually be asked to strike if no settlement was
reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No new negotiations were scheduled. The janitors' contract
expired April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The contract for downtown janitors was reached Monday night
after 5,500 SEIU members spent the day picketing outside downtown
offices. Their agreement with the Building Owners and Managers
Association calls for a pay increase of 45 cents in the first year
to $11.85 an hour, with increases of 35 cents and 30 cents in
subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very good settlement,'' Munz said. ''It's the best we
have seen in a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, thousands of commercial building janitors are on
strike, seeking wage increases and benefits. Union officials say
similar labor unrest could soon occur in other cities, including
New York, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia, where union
contracts are due to expire this year.

<HEADLINE> Report: Japan Banks Near Merger Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. and Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking Corp. have agreed to set up a joint holding
company in April of next year, published reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance would create the world's fifth-largest financial
group, with $837 billion in deposits and other assets, the Nihon
Keizai financial newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks were to officially announce their planned alliance
Wednesday, according to reports by the Nihon Keizai and the
nationally circulated Asahi, Yomiuri and Mainichi newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the two banks were not available for comment early
Wednesday. On Tuesday, both banks refused to discuss the reported
alliance, saying only that talks were in progress and nothing had
been decided.
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai said the two banks would integrate their
operations under a joint holding company to be established next
April. The firm would manage $433 billion in pension and other
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The firm would be a publicly-traded company, with shares listed
on both the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange,
the Nihon Keizai report said.
</P>
<P>
   Trust operations will be integrated by merging two
BOT-Mitsubishi subsidiaries -- Nippon Trust Bank and Tokyo Trust
Bank -- with Mitsubishi Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of three trust banks will be completed by October,
2001, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The banks involved hope the move will enable them to compete
against other planned megagroups in the financial industry, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks have been consolidating their operations to
recover from billions of dollars in bad loans made in the
speculative lending boom of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of these mergers is the Mizuho Financial Group,
which announced in August that it was creating an institution with
$1.3 trillion in assets by merging Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank,
and the Industrial Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank also plan to
merge, creating the country's second-largest bank with $1 trillion
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   BOT-Mitsubishi and Mitsubishi Trust will initially continue
current operations under the joint holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they will merge overlapping operations and
concentrate on their individual strengths, the Nikkei said.

<HEADLINE> Venue Change in Horse Shooting Case  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- In a legal move rarely seen in
Nevada, a district judge ordered a change of venue in the case of
three men accused of killing a wild horse, saying dramatic media
coverage of the slaughter of 33 mustangs has stacked tiny Storey
County against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never in all my jury trials had a judge ask, 'Has
anyone heard of the case?' And the entire panel raises its hands,''
said Sharon Claassen, Storey County's deputy district attorney.
''It just doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   All but three of the 73 prospective jurors questioned knew
something about the case, District Judge Michael Griffin said
Tuesday in announcing the change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of the horses in the hills near Reno drew national
outrage in the days after Christmas 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two former Marines, Lance Cpls. Darien Brock, 22, and Scott
Brendle, 23, and a former high school buddy, Anthony Merlino, 21,
were arrested in January 1999, and the two Marines were given
dishonorable discharges.
</P>
<P>
   The men were accused of killing more than 28 horses with
high-powered rifles, but are charged in the death of one mustang, a
misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said he intends to move the trial to Carson City, Reno
or Las Vegas where it will be easier to find jurors less familiar
with the case than the 3,700 residents of Storey County.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said the move is critical for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Changes of venue are so rare in Nevada that the state Supreme
Court doesn't keep track of them, a clerk said Tuesday. Griffin
said he was aware of it happening in a criminal trial in Nevada one
other time.

<HEADLINE> RFK Jr. Welcomed in Vieques  </HEADLINE>
By RICARDO ZUNIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. went scuba diving Tuesday with protesters off the coast of
bomb-ravaged Vieques Island and said he would sue the U.S. Navy for
endangering sea and bird life during military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy inspected sunken munitions buried in coral reefs, hefted
an artillery shell and surveyed a sunken barge off Vieques, where a
small group of protesters has occupied the training range for
almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to get the Navy out of here,'' he said after diving
around the barge, which was used as a target for warships.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a senior counsel for the New York-based Natural
Resources Defense Council, said Monday the group would sue the Navy
to stop further exercises, saying the Navy was getting away with
environmental violations it never would be allowed to on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said in a written statement Tuesday that it is ''firmly
committed to the environment and will continue to work with ...
(local and federal agencies) to ensure that all applicable
environmental standards are complied with regarding this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Kennedy visited protesters' camps in the bombing
area and at the training grounds main gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This visit helps us a lot in our fight to get out the message
to the American public with more force,'' said Carlos Ventura, one
of the protest leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy owns two-thirds of Vieques, a 20-mile by 5-mile
island, and calls it the Atlantic Fleet's most important training
ground. About 10,000 people live on the island, sandwiched between
the bombing area and munitions depots.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the Navy's presence boiled over in April 1999,
when a U.S. Marine Corps jet dropped two bombs off target, killing
a civilian security guard and injuring four other people.
</P>
<P>
   The accident prompted a report by the Puerto Rican government
that documented other accidents and alleged the exercises have
scarred the island, home to manatees, sea turtles, and endangered
peregrine falcons.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Puerto Rican government complained to the U.S.
Coral Reef Task Force that errant bombs had blown apart coral reefs
off Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1999 survey showed craters in the reefs, as well as
parachutes, shells and other debris, said Daniel Pagan, secretary
of Puerto Rico's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Pagan said the damage was more severe than during a survey in
1978, when scientists determined that at least 80 percent of a reef
on the island's north coast had been pulverized by the Navy's
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kennedy alleged the Navy has violated the Resource
Conservation Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered
Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has pledged to order the military out by May
2003 if Vieques residents vote for the expulsion in a referendum.
Clinton said he would allow practice with non-explosive munitions
to continue until the referendum is held, but protesters on the
range have refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's visit comes as protesters are planning a series of
special vigils, choir performances and a church service to
commemorate the April 19, 1999 death of the security guard, David
Sanes Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, about 25 activists occupied San Juan's 16th-century
Fort San Felipe del Morro, a U.S. national historic site, saying
they plan to camp there overnight in a protest over Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''the Navy must go!'' the protesters took down a U.S.
flag and replaced it with a Puerto Rican flag. They also took down
an old military flag from Puerto Rico's former colonizer, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said they would leave voluntarily Wednesday
morning, and the U.S. National Park Service said it had no plans to
force them out.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Close Edwards Case  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Declaring they had ''unmasked a terribly
corrupt governor,'' federal prosecutors presented their closing
arguments Tuesday in the three-month-old federal racketeering trial
of former Gov. Edwin Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   They cast Edwards as a greedy behind-the-scenes manipulator of
an equally greedy criminal enterprise managed by his son. The
object, they said, was to extort millions of dollars from
applicants for Louisiana riverboat casino licenses during and after
Edwards' fourth and final term, which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a liar, a thief and a phony,'' declared First Assistant
U.S. Attorney Jim Letten.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 72, faces a prison sentence of up to 350 years if
convicted on all 27 counts in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   During six hours of closing arguments, Edwards demonstrated the
cool demeanor he has characteristically displayed during four
decades in public life. He rocked in his chair, rested his face in
his hands and chuckled occasionally at a prosecutor's remark.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors built their case on plea bargains with men who
admitted paying millions in extortion money to Edwards and his
cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors Tuesday again heard Edwards' voice on tape worrying aloud
about one casino owner conspicuously withdrawing large sums of
cash, and discuss renting a tugboat to the casino owner at an
inflated price to get the money.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the only defendant to take the witness stand, said last
week the money was for legitimate legal work and consulting
services.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Magner likened Edwards to a kid who
got caught with his hands in the cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Edwin and Stephen Edwards, defendants include
three longtime Edwards friends, Bobby Johnson, Cecil Brown and
Andrew Martin; and two public officials, state Sen. Greg Tarver and
state gambling board member Ecotry Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers will begin their closing arguments Wednesday,
and jurors are expected to begin deliberations as early as Monday.

<HEADLINE> HUD Needs Cities for Gun Program  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five months after President Clinton announced
a $15 million plan to buy and destroy unwanted guns, only about 20
percent of the money has been earmarked for such initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem with the Buyback America program is how the
money is handed out. Local governments must spend $100 of their
drug-fighting funds from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to buy back guns from citizens to get an additional $43
from the federal government for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that a program administration officials predicted
would get 300,000 guns off the streets so far has removed only
about 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gun violence is not a huge issue for the residents of our
housing,'' said Virginia Felton, spokeswoman for the Seattle
Housing Authority, which did not apply for the program. ''We can
spend our resources more effectively in other crime prevention
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman David Egner said the agency is pleased with the
program and it is moving much faster than expected. ''No one ever
said this program would buy all the guns in five months,'' Egner
said.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo held a news conference Tuesday to
encourage more cities to apply for money. He was joined by several
mayors, while the father of a student killed at Columbine lent his
support via a satellite hookup from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see how any mayor in any city would not want to be a
part of this,'' said Mayor Al Jurczynski of Schenectady, N.Y., one
of 84 cities that has gotten money. His city has received $1,144
and plans to use it to buy 23 guns.
</P>
<P>
   The program has come under fire from gun-rights groups and many
Republicans in Congress. GOP leaders say HUD does not have the
authority to spend anti-drug money to buy and destroy guns. The
National Rifle Association says the money would be better spent
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone would really try to argue that they're
seeing long lines of violent criminals with guns turning in the
tools of their trade,'' NRA spokesman Bill Powers said. ''I think
most Americans would like to see their tax dollars go to tougher
enforcement of gun laws against bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said getting 50,000 guns out of homes, where they could be
stolen or used in suicides, accidental shootings or domestic
violence, is a good first step. He said cities need to take the
time to set up programs that can best use the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want these done quickly. We don't want these done
haphazardly,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, whose son Daniel was among a dozen students and a
teacher killed at Columbine last April 20, said gun buybacks help
prevent gun deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good because it's a targeted strategy for our
communities,'' Mauser told the news conference. ''Firearms in our
communities are just like matches in a tinderbox.''

Taber Students Honor School Shooting
</P>
<P>
   TABER, Alberta (AP) -- Hundreds of students at W.R. Myers high
school packed into their gymnasium Tuesday to mark the coming
anniversary of a fatal shooting of one of their own a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it was a tribute to Jason Lang, a 17-year-old
basketball and soccer player who was shot dead in the school hall.
For others it was a day to contemplate how their lives were
dramatically changed when a teen-ager walked into the school and
opened fire, killing Lang and wounding another student.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened April 28, eight days after two youths at a
high school in Littleton, Colo., shot and killed 13 people, then
turned the guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the accused boy in Taber has said he was harassed
and bullied at school and became obsessed with the Colorado
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   With a theme of ''Hope, Remember and Challenge,'' Myers
students, teachers and parents gathered to sing songs, pray and
listen to a speech by Rev. Dale Lang, Jason's father. The service
was held 10 days early because the anniversary falls during the
school's Easter break.
</P>
<P>
   The accused youth, now 15, is awaiting trial on first-degree
murder and two charges of attempted murder.

Coroner: Towns Ill-Equipped for Disasters
</P>
<P>
   KANGIQSUALUJJUAQ, Quebec (AP) -- Northern Quebec communities are
ill-equipped to deal with disasters a year after an avalanche
killed nine Inuit, a coroner said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four adults and five children -- the youngest 15 months old --
were killed when the avalanche struck the town's school gym on Jan.
1, 1999. Twenty-five people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the municipality of Kangiqsualujjuaq sent out a call for
help, no one in (nearby) Kuujjuaq had an emergency plan,'' Jacques
Berube noted in his report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hospital had an emergency plan designed to deal with
airplane crashes. I noted that a number of senior officials working
at the hospital did not know that this plan existed and did not
know how to implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster plans, along with more fire trucks, emergency phone
lines, increased training for medical and emergency response teams,
more medical equipment are among his suggestions for the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche was caused by weather conditions, Berube's report
stated. A ledge overloaded with snow gave way, sending powdery
death cascading down the hill.

Bernardo's Lawyer: Homolka Lied
</P>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ontario (AP) -- Sex-killer Paul Bernardo's lawyer
was poised in 1994 to snare Karla Homolka in a damning lie that
would scuttle the infamous plea-bargain deal that gave her just 12
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As friends and family teetered on every word, Ken Murray
described in court Tuesday how he was going to use Homolka's own
statements to drag her back into a case he believed she had
skillfully evaded.
</P>
<P>
   When she made her deal with the Crown in March 1993, Homolka
said nothing about Jane Doe, the anonymous fourth victim of the
notorious couple's lengthy spree of sex and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the deal was sealed, the Crown showed Homolka a
snippet of videotape depicting her drugging and performing sexual
acts on an unidentified girl.
</P>
<P>
   Homolka, who was claiming she herself was a victim of her
sexually sadistic husband, suggested the girl was one of three
teen-age victims known to police.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray, having viewed the six videotapes depicting the rape
and torture of teens Leslie Mahaffy, Kristen French, Homolka's
sister Tammy and Jane Doe, knew better.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Karla with a recumbent Jane Doe,'' said Murray, who is
testifying in his own defense against charges of obstructing
justice for holding on to the tapes for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The tape) shows her in control,'' he said. ''It shows her
performing sexual activities on her unconscious victim. It shows
her as enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she was caught lying about anything, or was found to have
committed other offenses prior to her deal, the deal was off . . .
she wasn't bargaining in good faith.''

<HEADLINE> US Rep. Defends Iraq Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By JASSIM MOHAMMED, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASRA, Iraq (AP) -- A visiting U.S. congressman Tuesday defended
U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq, but said there is no reason why
''innocent people'' suffering under them should not be given
humanitarian help.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tony Hall, a Democrat from Ohio, is in Iraq on a
four-day visit to investigate the plight of Iraqi people under
sanctions aimed at forcing the government of Iraq to give up its
weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions were imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very difficult country and we had difficult times in
the past 10 years. I think there is no question ... there is a
major health problem here,'' Hall told The Associated Press
Television News.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq blames the sanctions for the deaths of 1.2 million people,
including 750,000 children under the age of five, because of
scarcity of food and medicine. But the United States says President
Saddam Hussein's government must shoulder the blame for not
allowing U.N. weapons inspectors to finish their job of eliminating
illegal weapons that would lead to the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanctions ... sometimes can hit the most innocent people,''
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   But ''you must remember why sanctions were put on this country
and why U.N. (was) very concerned about weapons of mass destruction
being exported and that is the main reason for the sanctions,''
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But having said that, it does not mean that the innocent
people here, the children, women and old people, cannot be helped
in humanitarian sense and that's what I am hoping that we can do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall visited a water sanitation project in Basra, 281 miles
south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. He also visited hospitals in
three other southern cities, Babylon, Samawah and Nasiriyah, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Babylon's Maternity and Children Hospital, which had no
electricity, many beds were shared by two children because of
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Hall went up to Fatima Ali, standing next to her 2-year-old
daughter's bed. ''My daughter is dying,'' she said in Arabic. Hall
did not understand the words but replied: ''I will help.''
</P>
<P>
   In another bed, Mohammed Farhan, less than two months old, was
being treated for malnutrition and diarrhea. Hospital chief, Dr.
Ahmed Diab, said the infant needs 12 boxes of milk every month but
the hospital can give him only eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have seen a number of malnourished children and they need a
lot of care. There is a lot of humanitarian goods that could come
here and they are not coming through for some reasons. Maybe I can
help on that,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also visited the city of Ur, believed to be the birthplace
of the biblical patriarch, Abraham.

<HEADLINE> Plane Crashes in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying
120 passengers crashed Wednesday in the southern Philippines,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 727-200, which began its flight in Manila, circled
the city of Davao, 625 miles southeast of Manila, before crashing
on nearby Samal Island, said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation of any casualties or what
caused the plane to go down.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pilot of a small plane which flew over the crash
site told authorities that the craft appeared to be totally
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an initial report that one Air Philippines flight
circled around Davao first and then crashed,'' Mercado said. We are
getting final confirmation of the other details.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline said that the plane was carrying 120 passengers. It
did not say how many crew were aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was given its normal maintenance check before taking
off and it checked out OK, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather conditions at the time of the crash were good, the
government weather bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be the most serious crash in the Philippines
since a twin-engine plane slammed into the hills in the northern
part of the country on Dec. 7, killing all 17 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a Cebu Pacific DC-9 jet crashed near the top of a
fog-shrouded mountain in the southern Philippines, killing all 104
people aboard in the country's worst air disaster.

<HEADLINE> Federal investigators release findings of autism cluster probe  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRICK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal investigation of a possible autism
cluster here found the worried parents who pushed for the study
were right: The neurodevelopmental disorder is far more common -- at
least here -- than once thought.
</P>
<P>
   The parents did get some good news, though. A second arm of the
study could find no contamination in the water that Brick residents
have been swimming in and drinking that could be linked to the
autism cases here.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very satisfied,'' said Brick resident Bob Lanzieri, whose
6 1/2-year-old son J.T. is autistic. ''I appreciate the study
immensely for (showing) that we have a higher rate of autistic
people than we thought ... and we need to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the most intensive federal study of autism prevalence ever
conducted, researchers said Tuesday that they found a rate of 4 in
1,000 children with autism and another 2.7 in 1,000 with similar,
but less severe autism-like disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.7-in-1,000 rate is several times higher than past
estimates, although the true rate of autism is controversial
because there has never been a nationwide study.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major question for me is whether it's just more prevalent
(than previously thought) or it's on the rise,'' as some parents
and doctors suspect, said Dr. Eric London, vice president of
medical affairs at the National Alliance for Autism Research in
Princeton and a consultant for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A poorly understood disorder, autism is thought to occur early
in pregnancy. In moderate to severe cases, autism makes it
difficult to communicate or relate to the outside world, and drives
some to obsessively repeat certain motions, even hurt themselves or
others; in mild cases, it triggers behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s, autism was thought to afflict 1 in 2,000
children, but some recent studies in foreign countries found rates
of 3-6 in 1,000. Preliminary data from a federal study of children
in Atlanta show a rate of 2-3 in 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, data from California, South Florida and other areas
show a sharp increase in recent years in children getting special
educational services for autism, and parents in Staten Island,
N.Y., and other communities have complained of possible autism
clusters. None has been documented so far, even here.
</P>
<P>
   A group of worried Brick parents conducted a survey in late 1997
that found a high enough level of autism in this coastal town about
60 miles north of Atlantic City that state health officials and
politicians won federal funding for a comprehensive investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry began
related investigations, with the CDC team focusing on autism
incidence and the ATSDR team looking at whether the disorder could
be caused by environmental toxins suspected by the parents.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhaustive search for possible autism cases, the CDC
team studied 75 children ages 3 to 10. Of those, 36 children were
determined to have autism and another 24 had autism-related
disorders, said Jacquelyn Bertrand, a developmental psychologist at
the CDC. Twice as many boys as girls were autistic, 63 percent of
the 60 children also were mentally retarded, and seven families had
two children with autism.
</P>
<P>
   She said this study will be a model for new CDC studies on the
incidence of autism in other communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this (study) is going to bring more and more attention
to autism and the fact that it's not a rare disorder, that we need
more attention to diagnosis,'' so affected children can get
treatment earlier and reach a higher level of function, said Dr.
Audrey Mars, an assistant pediatrics professor at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey who examined many of the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The ATSDR team combed data on chemicals in the municipal water
supply dating to 1987, focusing on three chemicals found at high
enough levels to cause concern, said Robert Knowles, an
environmental scientist with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, TCE and PCE, were found in two now-closed municipal
wells. Both were either undetectable or at levels considered safe
by the time that water, highly diluted with water from the
Metedeconk River running through Brick, reached homes or
businesses. A third group of chemicals that are a byproduct of
water chlorination, trihalomethanes, occasionally exceeded safe
levels, but never when coinciding with pregnancies resulting in
autistic children.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles said the researchers also determined that swimming in
the river was safe, and that while the Brick Township Landfill, a
Superfund site closed in 1979, is leaking contaminants into
groundwater, none of it reaches the drinking supply. About 70
percent of Brick's drinking water comes from the river.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a father who led the fight for the study said he's not
convinced that there's no environmental cause for the autism cases
here or the apparent increase around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm slightly disappointed that (the federal experts) aren't
staying in town long enough to answer the questions in the
community this is going to provoke,'' added Billy Gallagher, a
commercial fisherman with two autistic children, Alanna, 9, and
Austin, 7.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-Robbinsville, praised the thoroughness
of the study. He expects a vote in early May on his bill to provide
$37 million for research of autism and other developmental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brick becomes the springboard for a nationwide effort,'' Smith
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   London agreed, and noted that his group has increased its
funding for research on autism's prevalence, cause and possible
cures. Meanwhile, the state is receiving $1.5 million from the CDC
to study autism and develop programs to teach medical personnel how
to identify the complex disorder.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes Israel's Pullout  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon signaled Tuesday its possible
acceptance of Israel's planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon,
after weeks of expressing suspicion over Israeli intentions to end
its 18-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss declared the planned
withdrawal ''a resounding victory for Lebanon and its heroic
resistance'' and a ''crushing defeat'' of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in the history of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, Israel is forced to withdraw from an Arab territory,''
Hoss said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But in a departure from previous statements, Hoss did not
criticize Israeli intentions or mention conditions for a withdrawal
-- a sign that Lebanon may be willing to accept the pullback as an
inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon frequently called for an unconditional and full Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied border zone. But it has viewed with
outright suspicion Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's pledge in
recent months to pull out by July. Many Lebanese officials saw
Barak's words as a bluff and a maneuvering tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon and Syria -- the main power broker in Lebanon -- had also
added a new demand in recent months that the pullout be part of an
overall Mideast peace accord, which has appeared unlikely soon with
the Israel-Syria talks deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut and Damascus' refusal to welcome the withdrawal had
frustrated Israeli officials, concerned about possible guerrilla
attacks into north Israel. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright this month called it ''strange'' that Israel was being
criticized ''for wanting to withdraw from another country.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said Syria is pushing Lebanon to oppose the
withdrawal, since the unilateral pullback could deprive Damascus of
a bargaining chip in future talks -- in the form of pressure on
Israel from Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Israel officially notified the United Nations of its plans
Monday, saying it would pull troops back to the internationally
recognized border by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council drafted a presidential statement Tuesday
welcoming the Israeli move and asking Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to start preparations, particularly concerning defining the border
and security. The council is expected to approve the statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss' statement did not mention misgivings shared by Lebanon and
Syria over the pullback. It said only that the content of the
Israeli notification is ''the subject of study and consultation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoss also did not repeat his government's earlier warning that
it won't be responsible for reining in guerrillas battling Israeli
troops, or armed Palestinians living in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which has about 30,000 troops in Lebanon, however,
remained suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel is undoubtedly insincere in telling the United Nations
and the U.N. Security Council permanent members that it wants to
withdraw from Lebanon by July,'' said an editorial by the
English-language Syria Times, which like other Damascus papers
reflects the government's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hezbollah guerrillas attacked an Israeli outpost,
wounding one soldier. Israeli retaliatory fire killed a Syrian
worker and wounded four other people, Lebanese security officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah responded by firing across the border into northern
Israel. Witnesses and military sources reported said six shells
fell, causing no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Later, two Israeli jets fired missiles at suspected guerrilla
targets in a central section of the occupied zone from which the
shells were believed to have come.
</P>
<P>
   Israel moved into Lebanon in 1982 and created an occupation
security zone in the south in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Salmon Pate Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Oregon food company is recalling packages
of its smoked salmon pate because they contain egg yolk without
listing it as an ingredient. People with allergies to eggs could
have serious reactions to the product.
</P>
<P>
   The Dundee-based Northwest Gourmet decided to recall the pate
after it was discovered the egg yolk was not listed. No illnesses
have been reported, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoked Salmon Pate comes in a 3.5 ounce gold foil package
inside a box marked with lot numbers 2561006 through 2561130,
110499 and 120499.
</P>
<P>
   The pate was sold in retail stores nationwide and in airports in
Detroit; Dallas/Fort Worth; Portland, Ore.; and Dulles
International in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The company advises consumers who bought the product to return
it to where it was purchased for a full refund. Consumers with
questions can contact the company at 1-503-554-9060.

<HEADLINE> NYC Panel Orders Cab Safety Moves  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Alarmed by the recent killings of livery cab
drivers, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission voted unanimously
Tuesday to require all drivers to install either bulletproof
partitions or digital security cameras in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has pledged $5 million in a grant program
to help pay for the security devices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what the federation asked the mayor to do, and the mayor
has granted us our wish,'' said New York State Federation of Taxi
Drivers President Fernando Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Seven drivers have been killed this year, and 11 were killed in
1999, according to police statistics. None of the drivers killed
this year had a partition, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said another driver was wounded Tuesday when a passenger
attacked him with a machete.
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairwoman Diane McGrath McKechnie said the grant
will pay for drivers to buy partitions, which cost between $250 and
$350, but will pay only up to $350 for cameras, which start at
$600. She estimated that about half of the city's 41,000 livery
drivers have neither security device.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to the new rule will be for livery cars owned
by companies that cater to corporate clients and take only vouchers
or credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also stressed to livery drivers that they must
stop picking up street fares, something only yellow cabs are
allowed to do so. Livery drivers must be dispatched to passengers,
but many flout the rule to make extra money. Of the seven drivers
killed this year, police say six were killed by passengers they
picked up on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The commission adopted the rule on an emergency basis for the
next 60 days. Before the temporary measure expires, the commission
will hold public hearings to make it permanent. Drivers have 30
days to comply.

<HEADLINE> Storm, Wind Rip Los Angeles  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL CHAVEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A powerful storm raked Southern California
early Tuesday with pounding rain and fierce winds that tore up
mobile homes and businesses and left thousands without power.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said another storm was expected to hit Thursday but
predicted it would not pack the fury of the one that began early
Monday and unleashed a destructive ''microburst'' windstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit was the city of Paramount in southeastern Los
Angeles County, where high winds severely damaged 71 mobile homes
and at least a dozen businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape resembled tornado-type damage more associated with
Oklahoma or Kansas than Southern California: hundreds of uprooted
trees, crumpled mobile homes knocked off their foundations, twisted
metal and awnings dangling from power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earthquakes are a dream compared to this,'' said mobile home
resident Diane Sullivan, who described the gale as a moaning sound
that grew louder and louder. ''We never had any damage from an
earthquake. I don't know how people can live in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of serious injuries, said Assistant City
Manager Linda Benedetti. City officials declared an emergency,
making Paramount eligible for state aid.
</P>
<P>
   Storm damage was spread throughout the Los Angeles basin. In
Diamond Bar, winds collapsed the roof of a fitness center and
lightning zapped a home in Altadena.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service studied debris patterns and fallen
trees and determined it was a so-called microburst rather than a
tornado, said meteorologist Clint Simpson. The windspeeds were
estimated at 75 mph to 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The wind, rain and lightning were part of a storm that rolled
into the region Monday morning, contributing to hundreds of traffic
accidents on Los Angeles County freeways. Four people died during
highway crashes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 45,000 Southern California Edison customers were
without power or had service briefly interrupted during the two-day
period, company spokesman Steven Conroy said. Service to nearly all
customers was expected to be restored by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Communities from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo counties
recorded 1 inches to 4 inches of rain from early Monday morning
through 10 a.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.
Monday's storm totals set records for the date in many areas,
including downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not unusual to get a storm in April. It is unusual to get
this amount of rain in April,'' Mike Wofford said.

<HEADLINE> Court says Florio can't use county committee label  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A state Superior Court judge in Union
County on Tuesday barred Jim Florio from using a ballot slogan that
was nearly identical to the name of the county committee.
</P>
<P>
   Florio had planned to call himself and his slate of candidates
the ''Union County Democratic Committee, Inc.'' on the June primary
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Edward W. Beglin, Jr. said that name infringed on the
existing Union County Democratic Committee, a group entitled to
''protect its name and goodwill associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio does not have the backing of the Union County democratic
organization and its leaders. Instead they endorsed investment
banker Jon Corzine over the former governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Were any other organization to use its name, particularly as a
slogan for certain candidates used to designate their affiliation
on the primary ballot, only public confusion and misunderstanding
would result,'' Beglin said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio now plans to use the word ''Democrat'' as his label,
campaign spokesman Jim Lanard said. Florio's lawyers have made that
offer to the Union County organization, as well as groups in
Mercer, Middlesex and Essex counties, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade on
Tuesday named Dennis Dutterer as interim president of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Dutterer, president of the Board of Trade Clearing Corp., takes
over from Thomas Donovan, who resigned Friday after 18 years at the
helm.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan had come under fire in recent months from members who
felt he was slow to move toward electronic trading, allowing the
CBOT lose its title as the world's leading futures market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dennis is well known to the members, member firms, and
staff,'' said David Brennan, chairman of the Board of Trade. ''He
is intimately familiar with all the aspects of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   The CBOT board also announced the start of the search for a
permanent president of the exchange. Dutterer will return to his
position at the Board of Trade Clearing Corp. when a permanent
replacement is found.
</P>
<P>
   Dutterer previously was general counsel to the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission and Assistant U.S. Attorney for the
District of Columbia.

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying 130 people
crashed in the southern Philippines Wednesday and rescuers said there were no
signs of survivors. The Boeing 737-200, which began its flight in Manila,
circled the city of Davao, 625 miles southeast of Manila, before going down on
nearby Samal Island, said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado. There was no
immediate word on what caused the crash. The airline said the plane was given
its normal maintenance check before taking off and it checked out OK. Weather

during the presidential campaign, when Bush and McCain were competing for votes

6-year-old Elian Gonzalez remain in the United States. Some of the protesters
suffered minor injuries in the fracas just before nightfall last Friday and were
treated at local hospitals. The disclosure came as the State Department summoned
a top Cuban diplomat here to express ''extreme concern'' over the beatings. If
Cuban diplomats were involved, they would not be subject to prosecution because

Two women were killed and a third was critically wounded in the melee. The man

<HEADLINE> Mexico To Combat Armed Groups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Mexican attorney general's office
announced the creation of a special unit to investigate armed
civilian groups in southern Chiapas state that have battled
supporters of the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The unit will not investigate the rebels, which staged a brief
uprising in 1994 in the name of Indian rights, nor will it target
the pro-government group blamed for the massacre of 45 Indians in
1997, prosecutor Jose Luis Ramos said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials already are in charge of monitoring the
Zapatistas, and the new entity replaces a special division of the
attorney general's office that has already concluded its
investigation into the 1997 massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Although the investigation is complete, authorities continue to
receive complaints about the presence of armed civilian groups in
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens and non-governmental organizations charge that the
armed groups are, in fact, paramilitary, government-sponsored
militias trying to quell guerrilla activity and repress rebel
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The government has insisted it has no link to the armed groups
and has moved to prosecute individuals possessing military-style
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of the new unit is to attack the historical factors
that have provoked confrontations in the state,'' including
ideological and religious differences and land-ownership disputes,
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1994 Zapatista uprising, scores of people have been
killed in clashes between rebels or their supporters and armed,
pro-government squads. Peace talks between the rebels and the
government are at a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, 1997, an armed group gunned down 21 women, 15
children and nine men in Acteal, a village in Chiapas that was
sympathetic to the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrators were Indians from neighboring villages who
supported the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and
allegedly received some of their weapons from the Mexican army and
police.
</P>
<P>
   All together, 102 people -- including the soldiers and policemen
accused of aiding the killers or failing to stop the massacre --
have been arrested. At least 20 of the alleged assailants were
sentenced to 35 years apiece in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But residents also have alleged that 87 Indians were falsely
accused of participating in the massacre. And on Feb. 18, Asma
Jahangir, the U.N. expert on summary and arbitrary executions, said
authorities handling the case were guilty of ''serious omissions
and neglect.''

<HEADLINE> Feds: Autism Cluster Found in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRICK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal investigation of a possible autism
cluster here found that worried parents who pushed for the study
were right: The neurodevelopmental disorder is far more common here
than once thought.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation stopped short of finding an autism
cluster, a higher-than-average rate of the disorder in an area.
Officials said there is not enough data on autism nationwide to say
that a cluser exists.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation did find that the water was not contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a father who led the fight for the study said he's not
convinced that there's no environmental cause for the high number
of autism cases in Brick or the apparent increase in the disorder
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm slightly disappointed that (the federal experts) aren't
staying in town long enough to answer the questions in the
community this is going to provoke,'' said Billy Gallagher, a
commercial fisherman with two autistic children, Alanna, 9, and
Austin, 7.
</P>
<P>
   After the most intensive federal study of autism prevalence ever
conducted, researchers said Tuesday that they found a rate of 4 in
1,000 children with autism in Brick and 2.7 in 1,000 with
autism-like disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The rate is several times higher than past estimates, although
the true rate of autism is controversial because there has never
been a nationwide study.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s, autism was thought to afflict 1 in 2,000
children. Preliminary data from a just-completed federal study of
children in the Atlanta area show a rate of 2-3 in 1,000 with
autism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major question for me is whether it's just more prevalent
(than previously thought) or it's on the rise,'' as some parents
and doctors suspect, said Dr. Eric London, vice president of
medical affairs at the National Alliance for Autism Research in
Princeton and a consultant for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A poorly understood disorder, autism is thought to occur early
in pregnancy. In moderate to severe cases, autism makes it
difficult to communicate or relate to the outside world, and drives
some to obsessively repeat certain motions, even hurt themselves or
others.
</P>
<P>
   Data from California, South Florida and other areas have shown a
sharp increase in recent years in children receiving special
educational services for autism, and parents in New York's Staten
Island and other communities have complained of possible autism
clusters, though no autism cluster has ever been documented.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a group of worried Brick parents conducted a survey
that found a high enough level of autism in this coastal town of
71,000 that state health officials and politicians won federal
funding for a comprehensive investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry began investigating in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC found 60 children ages 3 to 10 who had autism or
autism-related disorders, said Jacquelyn Bertrand, a developmental
psychologist at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this (study) is going to bring more and more attention
to autism and the fact that it's not a rare disorder, that we need
more attention to diagnosis,'' so affected children can get
treatment earlier and reach a higher level of function, said Dr.
Audrey Mars, an assistant pediatrics professor at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey who examined many of the
children.

   A decades-old dispute over water rights sparked demonstrations,
roadblocks and violent confrontations across Bolivia last week. In
this city, thousands of Indians crowded the Plaza 14 de Septiembre
to protest.
</P>
<P>
   For angry campesinos, the matter was simple: They had for
decades shared among themselves the cost of maintaining their local
wells, and now the government was privatizing the water supply.
Under an approved plan, an international consortium began
administering water in parts of the city, and initial bills shot up
between 35 and 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a head-on clash of the free-market policies of
modern-day Latin America against decades of Bolivian tradition. The
struggle brought Cochabamba, Bolivia's third-largest city, to a
standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Brandishing sticks and iron bars, men, women and children manned
roadblocks in a haze of smoke and tear gas. Buses idled, store
shelves sat empty and the price of soda skyrocketed fivefold. By
the time the protests subsided nationwide, six people lay dead.
</P>
<P>
   Cochabamba, 350 miles east of the capital of La Paz, has had
water problems dating back a quarter century. Only half the city's
residents have regular access to treated water; slightly less have
a working sewage system. It's not unusual to see throngs of Indian
families washing their multicolored wraps in the shallow rivers
snaking around the city.
</P>
<P>
   But mountain water flows freely just beyond the jagged Andes
mountaintops, and a consortium led by London-based International
Water Ltd. had hoped to redirect the water through a long tunnel.
The $200 million project, which the government can't afford by
itself, would have served as a source of electricity and provide
water for corn, alfalfa and fruit on nearby land.
</P>
<P>
   But the farmers argued against the plan, saying they were backed
by a 1906 law written when Bolivia was a mostly agrarian economy.
They said it states that water is not for sale because it belongs
to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where the government's problems with this whole
privatization began,'' said Gonzalo Rico, director of a state-owned
company involved with the water project. ''It didn't help that the
farmers didn't understand how the project worked and that it would
bring better water to them in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   One protest organizer, Juan Flores, said the farmers never
considered water a resource that could be bought or sold by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suddenly the government was selling water sources that had
been financed and maintained by these communities,'' he said. ''And
the new prices are way out of reach for many of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the most humble neighborhoods make little more than $65
a month, said Victor Flores, a community leader in one barrio,
called Vinto.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the simple, one-level brick homes have running water,
Flores said, but many don't. Barefooted kids carry metal cans to
collect water from an open well. Elderly men, bent over by heavy
plastic pails of water, stagger down dusty roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes the water comes out looking like coffee, or algae
will build up in the sinks or toilets,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we want water that is clean and drinkable,'' he
said, ''but we can't afford it at these new prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Like much of Bolivia, Cochabamba has felt the sting of a
government crackdown on coca leaf planting, once a leading source
of income. And what first began as a battle over water soon spurred
widespread protests against President Hugo Banzer, who Bolivians
insist isn't doing enough to jump start the economy of South
America's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the first unrest began, policemen were demanding
higher salaries. So were teachers at rural public schools.
Meanwhile, thousands of Aymara Indian farmers upset over Bolivia's
struggling economy filled the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer, a former dictator turned democrat, responded April 8 by
decreeing a state of siege. The emergency declaration restricted
travel and political activity while setting curfews.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the international water consortium, called Aguas
del Turani, pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   The people in Cochabamba cheered the news and the government's
announcement that it would roll back the water law imposing fees
for rural well water. It was a rare victory over the government by
Bolivia's poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the week of violence and the subsequent government
concessions did little to solve Cochabamba's nagging water problem.
The occasionally muddy water still flows, and many Indian families
still gather around open water wells.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office off the plaza where the protests raged
only a week ago, Cochabamba Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa contemplated
the violence and its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's almost impossible that another business will want
to come in here and invest in this project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in another protest that broke out after Cochabamba's
water protests ended, coca leaf farmers lifted roadblocks on a key
road linking the Andes to the coast after the government agreed to
suspend eradication of their crops.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would negotiate with the farmers over its
plans to the destroy plantations of coca leaf, used in the
production of cocaine, as part of anti-narcotics efforts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. approves world's first entirely new antibiotic in 35 years  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors are getting an important new weapon in
the growing battle against drug-resistant infections: The
government on Tuesday approved a long-awaited drug called Zyvox,
described as the world's first entirely new type of antibiotic in
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox, made by Peapack, N.J.-based Pharmacia Corp., seems to
cure some infections impervious to all other antibiotics, even that
longtime drug of last resort called vancomycin. Consequently, Zyvox
could help prevent hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of
life-threatening infections every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes at a time when we were literally running out of
antibiotics,'' said Dr. Robert C. Moellering Jr.,
physician-in-chief of Boston's Beth Israel Deaconness Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it is being made in both oral and intravenous forms --
meaning when hospitals discharge infected patients, they might go
home with pills instead of a troublesome IV unit, said Dr. Dennis
L. Stevens of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zyvox is just a superb drug,'' said Stevens, who helped test
it. ''It's good ... to treat some pretty nasty infections with an
oral drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that doctors should reserve Zyvox for only the
worst infections and those suspected of being antibiotic-resistant,
or bacteria will quickly evolve to make Zyvox useless.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my wish that Zyvox is used primarily in hospitals,'' not
when primary care physicians just hand out a routine antibiotic
prescription, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved Zyvox on Tuesday for
use by adults with pneumonia and skin infections, including those
caused by a tough-to-treat form of staph bacteria, and with deadly
infections caused by a supergerm named ''Enterococcus faecium.''
</P>
<P>
   This infamous germ frequently invades surgical wounds and also
causes serious abdominal, urinary tract and heart valve infections.
Worse, enterococcal infections are growing increasingly impervious
to antibiotics. About a quarter of enterococcal infections among
intensive-care patients last year were untreatable by even
vancomycin -- a stunning 43 percent increase from the mid-1990s,
said FDA antibiotic chief Dr. Gary Chikami.
</P>
<P>
   But in a clinical trial of 145 people with vancomycin-resistant
enterococcal infections, Zyvox cured 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In additional studies, Zyvox helped other infections as well as
vancomycin or other standard treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox isn't the only option for untreatable infections: The FDA
last fall approved competitor Aventis' Synercid as the nation's
first alternative when vancomycin fails. Synercid, an intravenous
drug, is a combination of two older European antibiotics that
delivers a one-two punch against bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Zyvox is a synthetic chemical designed from scratch
to fight germs at an entirely different point in their life cycle
than any other medicine -- a true surprise attack. It stops bacteria
from making protein, which in turn stops their growth so the body's
immune system can step in and finish them off, Moellering said.
</P>
<P>
   Known chemically as linezolid, it is the first in a long-awaited
class of antibiotics called oxazolidinones.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a magic bullet. Zyvox has been used experimentally
in only a few thousand people, yet doctors already have counted 15
Zyvox-resistant infections.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it fight all bacteria, only those known as
''gram-positive'' germs.
</P>
<P>
   But gram-positive bacteria are a huge public health threat. They
cause more than half of all serious infections treated in hospitals
worldwide, particularly the kind caught by patients while they're
in the hospital for some other problem.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox's main side effects are headache, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea, afflicting between 3 percent and 11 percent of patients,
the FDA said. The oral version caused more side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Zyvox can cause a decrease in blood platelets, so doctors
must monitor patients' blood, the FDA warned.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox patients should tell their doctors if they take
over-the-counter decongestants such as those containing
pseudoephedrine, or antidepressants such as Prozac, because Zyvox
can interact with such drugs to raise blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia said Zyvox would be available within a few weeks, but
refused to disclose the price except to say it was expected to be a
little lower than competitor Synercid, which costs $85 per
intravenous vial.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pharmacia were priced at $53.06\ at 5:15 p.m. EST on
the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.06\ or nearly 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hutchinson Tech Eliminating 950 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTCHINSON, Minn. (AP) -- Hutchinson Technology is eliminating
950 jobs in Wisconsin, South Dakota and Minnesota because of weak
demand for its computer components, the company announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs come on top of 600 jobs eliminated during the first
six months of the fiscal year at Hutchinson, the world's leading
supplier of suspension assemblies for computer disk drives, which
supports the mechanism that allows users to read from and write to
the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will immediately suspend photoetching in Eau
Claire, Wis., and consolidate those operations into its plant in
Hutchinson in central Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will leave Hutchinson with about 5,250 employees,
including approximately 2,500 in Hutchinson, 1,050 in Sioux Falls,
1,510 in Eau Claire and 190 in Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne M. Fortun, president and chief executive officer, said the
changes announced Tuesday along with other cost-cutting measures
will generate an estimated $110 million in annual savings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the moves, Fortun said the company does not expect to
return to profitability in the current fiscal year. It expects to
report a third quarter net loss of 35 to 45 cents per share,
excluding charges for severance costs and asset write-downs of 26
to 35 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson Technology made the announcement as it reported a net
loss of $13 million, or 53 cents per share, on net sales of $111
million, for the second quarter, which ended March 26. In the
second quarter of fiscal 1999, the company reported net earnings of
$13.7 million, or 54 cents per share, on net sales of $152 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fortun said sales for the third quarter are projected to dip to
$100 million to $105 million.

<HEADLINE> 4 Vie in Primary for Kerrey's Seat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- One of five candidates for the GOP
nomination for Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey's seat dropped out of the
race Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elliott Rustad, 66, was a distant second in the Republican
field behind state Attorney General Don Stenberg, according to a
poll conducted by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to win I would have to wage a (negative) campaign
that could divide the Republican party and that I'm not willing to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rustad retired from his dermatology practice and sold his
Milford ranch before starting his campaign in November. Kerrey is
not seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Rustad's decision narrows the field of candidates, but not by
much. Stenberg, Scottsbluff agribusinessman David Hergert,
Secretary of State Scott Moore and former state senator John DeCamp
are vying for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Ben Nelson is the likely Democratic nominee.

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks To Merge  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. and Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking Corp. agreed Wednesday to set up a joint holding
company, which would be the world's fifth-largest financial group.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks will form the holding company and integrate their
operations by April next year, officials said. The alliance would
have $837 billion in deposits and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   The firm would manage $433 billion in pension and other trusts
as it combines two BOT-Mitsubishi subsidiaries -- Nippon Trust Bank
and Tokyo Trust Bank -- with Mitsubishi Trust. The merger of the
three trust banks will be completed by October, 2001, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new holding company will be listed on both the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The move will enable the banks involved to compete against other
planned megagroups in the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks have been consolidating their operations to
recover from billions of dollars in bad loans made in the
speculative lending boom of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of these mergers is the Mizuho Financial Group,
which announced in August that it was creating an institution with
$1.3 trillion in assets by merging Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank,
and the Industrial Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank also plan to
merge, creating the country's second-largest bank with $1 trillion
in assets.
</P>
<P>
   BOT-Mitsubishi and Mitsubishi Trust will initially continue
current operations under the joint holding company, to be named
Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they will merge overlapping operations and
concentrate on their individual strengths, according to the Nihon
Keizai, Japan's leading business newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Indians Gather To Protest in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTO SEGURO, Brazil (AP) -- Hundreds of Indians held ceremonies
Tuesday to counter official celebrations of the 500th anniversary
of the arrival of Europeans -- an event many Indians call ''the
invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   On foot and by bus, in facepaint and feathers, Indians from
scores of tribes gathered at the Coroa Vermelha reservation, about
500 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro, to demand that the
government speed up creation of Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Ceremonies on Saturday will mark the anniversary of the
Portuguese arrival in Brazil in 1500. Explorer Pedro Alvarez Cabral
made his first landfall near Porto Seguro.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say up to 5 million Indians inhabited the country in
1500 compared with just 330,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   In coming days, the Indians will hold conferences on the
reservation just outside Porto Segura and build a monument to
Indians who died, which they hope to dedicate on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say that these 500 years were a time of bitterness, of
anguish, of death,'' Pataxo chief Nailton Pataxo said in a
statement released by the Missionary Indigenous Council, linked to
Brazil's Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''From now on, we want to show that Indians are more
organized,'' the statement said. ''We will come out of this march
and this conference much more prepared to fight for the recovery
and demarcation of our lands.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest skirmish over land, two Pataxo Indians were
wounded by gunshots Tuesday in a clash with landowners who invaded
Indian land about 125 miles from Porto Seguro.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, around 200 students clashed with police in a
protest against the commemoration in Fortaleza, about 1,370 miles
northeast of Rio. The students had been stoning a clock set up for
the celebrations, then began pelting police who tried to break up
the protest.
</P>
<P>
   A student and five police officers were hurt, and ten students
were arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions rose earlier this month when 200 police troopers
invaded the Coroa Vermelha reservation and bulldozed the 5-foot
concrete base of the Indians' memorial.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso met with Indian leaders in
Brasilia, the capital, and called the destruction of the monument
''absurd.'' Still, he canceled a scheduled visit to the reservation
and is to stay in town for the official commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   Since the monument was destroyed, the police presence has been
beefed up and roadblocks have been set up along key highways. Bahia
state Gov. Cesar Borges said he plans to put between 5,000 and
9,000 police in the area during the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians could get support from the Landless Rural Workers
Movement, which has pledged to step up land invasions this week to
call attention to the need for agrarian reform. A group of movement
sympathizers is in Porto Seguro, although the government hopes to
move them out before Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Launches Ballot Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Pat Buchanan launched a bid Tuesday to
qualify for the presidential ballot in Texas, home of presumptive
Republican nominee Gov. George W. Bush and former candidate Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Texas is the toughest state in the union as far as we're
concerned,'' Buchanan told reporters before a rally at a convention
hall in the Dallas suburb of Irving. ''It's the most demanding in
terms of numbers, and in terms of how you have to get on the
ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a former Republican candidate, is seeking the Reform
Party nomination and is trying to gather 56,000 signatures by May 8
to earn a spot as an independent on the Texas ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party is conducting its own petition drive to win
ballot status in Texas. Only the signatures of registered voters
who did not vote in a party primary or sign another access petition
count toward a candidate's bid to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 supporters heard Buchanan speak. Another rally was
planned Wednesday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe if we get on the ballot in Texas, we will make it in
North Carolina two weeks later, in Oklahoma and we will have
crossed, really, the Alps in terms of getting on the ballot in 50
states,'' he said. ''It's a small rally, but it's a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   The former television talk-show host and speechwriter for
President Nixon said Bush is nearly indistinguishable from his
Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're Xerox copies of one another,'' said Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan criticized Bush's meeting last week with gay activists
and has accused him of wavering on abortion. Buchanan also has
criticized Gore's support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan staunchly opposes abortion but has said he will not
force an anti-abortion plank into the party platform at the Reform
convention in August. Many party activists shun social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also is home for Perot, the billionaire and Reform Party
founder who ran for president in 1992 and 1996. Perot has not said
whether he will run again this year.

<HEADLINE> Heat 97, Raptors 73  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Jamal Mashburn keyed a third-quarter rally that
propelled the Miami Heat to a 97-73 victory over the Toronto
Raptors on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Carter led the Heat, who never trailed, with 17 points.
Mashburn added 16 and Alonzo Mourning contributed 10 points and
four blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter paced Toronto with 17 points, Tracy McGrady had 15
and Dee Brown 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors had a moment of concern when Vince Carter left the
game late in the third quarter with an injured left ankle. It
turned out to be nothing more than an aggravation of a muscle
sprain and Carter returned to start the final period.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the game was out of reach. The Heat scored nine
straight points, the final seven by Mashburn, to take a 58-47 lead
with 6:41 left in the third quarter. Vince Carter answered with a
3-point play, but Mourning scored the next four points and Miami
maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   One important factor for the Heat was shot blocking. They
blocked 12 Toronto shots to two by the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat concluded their home schedule with a franchise-record
33-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   The game meant nothing in terms of playoff matchups, with Miami
entering the game locked into second and Toronto in sixth in the
Eastern Conference seedings.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Tim Hardaway missed the game due to a sprained right
ankle and a sprained left foot. Hardaway will also miss the Heat's
season finale, Wednesday in Charlotte, and may not be ready to
return when the playoffs start this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 999th regular season victory for Miami coach Pat
Riley. A victory in the seas9on finale would make him the second
NBA coach with 1,000 victories. Atlanta's Lenny Wilkens leads with
1,179.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored the first 10 points of the game and maintained a
comfortable margin until Brown had eight points during a 10-1 run
that allowed Toronto to cut the lead to 25-24 with 7:10 left in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miami opened its advantage to nine before taking a 45-41 lead at
halftime.
Notes: Tim Hardaway's absence for the final two games of the
season due to injury ensures that he will receive a $1.6 million
bonus. Hardaway's contract calls for the bonus if he finishes the
year with an assists-to-turnover ratio of 3-to-1 or better.
Hardaway's final numbers of 385 assists and 119 turnovers put him
at 3.24-to-1, the best ratio of his career. ... With the game
having no meaning in the playoff race, the Raptors did some pregame
tinkering with their roster. They placed Muggsy Bogues and Kevin
Willis on the injured list and activated Haywoode Workman and
Aleksandar Radojevic, their 1999 first-round draft pick. Bogues'
and Willis' injuries? ''They had a bad cough,'' said coach Butch
Carter, tongue firmly in cheek. ... The Heat extended to 506 their
NBA record for consecutive games with at least one 3-pointer. ...
Bogues' absence left Vince Carter as the only Raptor who has played
in all of the team's games this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Eberhard Bethge, a Protestant
theologian and biographer arrested after the failed 1944 attempt to
assassinate Adolf Hitler, died March 18 of pneumonia. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Bethge was best known for his biography of Protestant theologian
and anti-Nazi activist Dietrich Bonhoeffe, the uncle of Bethge's
wife who died in Flossenbuerg concentration camp. As a friend of
Bonhoeffer, Bethge was arrested along with dozens of others after
the failed attempt to kill Hitler July 20, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Bethge worked as an assistant to Berlin Bishop
Otto Dibelius, and later as a pastor in London and as the head of
the pastoral college of the Rhineland churches in Germany.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fans Give Rocker a Standing Ovation  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- With camera in hand, Kim Tolvert worked her way
into the first row at Turner Field for batting practice, staking
out a prime position to snap some pictures of her favorite player,
Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't all that interested in John Rocker, who returned
Tuesday night from a two-week suspension after making disparaging
comments about foreigners, minorities and gays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't plan to cheer or jeer him,'' said Tolvert, who is
black. ''But I am interested in the reaction of the rest of the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon found out.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker returned to a standing ovation, pitching a scoreless
ninth inning for the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 34,903 gave Rocker a big cheer when he ran in from
the bullpen to face the Philadelphia Phillies. One fan held up a
sign that read: ''Rocker for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker left with the score tied at 3. Many of the fans left
Turner Field after he was finished.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, fans attending the game seemed willing to
forgive Rocker for his comments in a magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to cheer for him,'' said Beth Layfield, a friend of
Tolvert's who is white. ''I really think he got carried away in the
interview by Sports Illustrated. He said some things he shouldn't
have said. But I think he was taken advantage of by the guy at
Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Rocker said he's ''not a very big fan of
foreigners'' and spoke with disgust about riding the New York
subway ''next to some queer with AIDS.'' He also described a former
teammate, who is black, as a ''fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first heard about it, I couldn't believe that he would
say what he said in public,'' said Tolvert, who lives in Rocker's
hometown of Macon, Ga. ''All of us have a right to our opinions.
However, I don't know how he could expect anyone to just brush it
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lee of New Orleans attended the game with a group that's
in Atlanta for a convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know all that he said, but I'm not going to cheer for
him,'' said Lee, who is black. ''I was never a big fan of him
before and I'm certainly not now. He's too brash.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles and Sandra Seagraves, relaxing in the picnic area
beyond the center-field bleachers, were unabashed in their support
of Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a kid,'' Sandra Seagraves said. ''It's a shame it
happened. On the other hand, who's not had to stick a foot in their
mouths a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had already pitched in Atlanta during an April 1
exhibition game, drawing loud cheers and just a smattering of boos.
The Seagraves planned to cheer loudly if he got in Tuesday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we won't be the only ones,'' Charles Seagraves said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was accompanied by 21-year-old Stephan Skare Nielsen,
a native of Denmark who is staying at their home during a
three-month vacation in the United States. He seemed befuddled by
the whole controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Freedom of speech,'' he said. ''You still have that over here,
don't you?''

<HEADLINE> Devils 2, Panthers 1  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Brian Rafalski had a goal and an assist and
the New Jersey Devils moved within one victory of advancing to the
second round for the first time in three years with a 2-1 win over
the Florida Panthers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 3-0 lead in the best-of-7 series. Game 4 in
the Eastern Conference playoff series is Thursday at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur -- and the Devils defense -- continued to stifle
the Panthers. Brodeur stopped 21 shots, including 15 in the third
period, and improved to 7-0-3 in his last 10 games against Florida.
He was hardly tested Tuesday, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers were outshot 31-7 through two periods, but Mike
Vernon kept the game tied 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon made 38 saves despite allowing several rebounds. He made
save after save, stopping a flurry of shots from point-blank range,
but gave up two seemingly soft goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers took a 1-0 lead at 9:19 of the first. Mike
Sillinger sliced between two defenders, cut right at the crease and
dropped the puck for Ray Whitney, who beat Brodeur to the right
side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied it in the second, scoring their first power-play
goal of the postseason. New Jersey was scoreless in 11
man-advantage situations, including the first four on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pavel Bure in the penalty box for elbowing, the Devils
scored on Alexander Mogilny's slap shot from the right circle at
16:25. Mogilny's shot slipped through the legs of Vernon. Rafalski
and Scott Stevens assisted on the play.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils outshot Florida 19-1 in the second period, but Vernon
-- fifth in career playoff wins with 77 -- kept the game tied.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the third, when he allowed a 55-foot shot from
Rafalski to slip into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The two goals Vernon allowed were as mystifying as Bure's play
in the series. Bure has yet to score, something he did 58 times in
the regular season to lead the league.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens continued to shadow Bure, limiting the Russian Rocket's
shots and keeping him from skating in open ice.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 6, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez pitched an
eight-hitter, and Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada homered as the New
York Yankees kept up their dominance over the Texas Rangers with a
6-3 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need for any miracle play this night as Jeter's
homer came in a three-run first that pushed New York ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won their seventh straight game, matching their
longest streak from last season. The streak began last week with
two victories over the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   New York (10-3), off to its best start since 1988, has won 35 of
the last 46 games over the Rangers, including sweeps in the last
two postseasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won 5-4 in 11 innings on Monday night, benefitting
from a bizarre double play after Texas loaded the bases with no
outs in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (3-0) scattered eight hits to beat Texas and Kenny
Rogers for the second straight time in a week. He got stronger as
the game went on, allowing just two base runners over the last 5
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   New York got all of its runs off Rogers (1-3), who has lost two
straight home starts after putting together a 19-game home winning
streak that was the third-longest in major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's solo homer to center field got New York started. Later
in the first, Tino Martinez had an RBI double and scored on
Posada's single.
</P>
<P>
   Posada hit a two-run homer in the fourth, his third of the
season. The Yankees added another run in the fourth when left
fielder Gabe Kapler misplayed a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had extended his home streak with an opening-day victory
over the Chicago White Sox. The former Yankee has since lost three
straight games, including a 5-1 loss at New York last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler hit a two-run homer in the second inning, his first since
hitting home runs in his first two Ranger at-bats on opening day.
Kapler doubled and scored the other Texas run in the fourth on a
sacrifice fly by Tom Evans.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After a ball fouled off Yankees third baseman Alfonso
Soriano and rolled in front of the plate in the fourth inning, a
loud cheer erupted from the crowd when home plate umpire Eric
Cooper signaled foul ball. The mock cheer stemmed from that bizarre
11th-inning double play Monday that began when another umpire
didn't see the ball hit Luis Alicea's leg. ... Martinez snapped a
3-for-18 slump with four straight hits, RBI singles in the ninth
and 11th innings Monday, followed by an RBI double and a single in
his first two at-bats Tuesday. ... Before his two hits, Kapler was
2-for-25 the previous seven games. ... It was Hernandez's first
complete game since June 22.

Philippines Jet Crashes, 130 Aboard
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An No survivors were reported after an Air
Phillipines jetliner carrying 130 passengers crashed in the southern Phillipines
Wednesday. The Boeing 737-200, which began its flight in Manila, circled the
city of Davao, 625 miles southeast of Manila, before going down on nearby Samal
Island, said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado. There was no immediate word on
what caused the crash. The airline said the plane was given its normal
maintenance check before taking off and it checked out OK. Weather conditions at
the time of the crash were good, the government weather bureau said.

McCain To Back S.C. Flag Removal

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain intends to tell an audience in South
Carolina tomorrow he favors removing the Confederate flag from atop the state
Capitol in Columbia, and regrets failing to say so while campaigning for the
White House, according to Republican officials. The flag issue flared briefly
during the presidential campaign, when Bush and McCain were competing for votes
in the South Carolina Republican primary in February. The state is home to
thousands of veterans and has a strong conservative streak. McCain settled on a
strategy designed to avoid offending possible supporters, and declined to state
a personal preference on the flag.

Cops Probe Cuban Mission Attack

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District police said today they have launched a criminal
investigation into allegations that some 15 people from the Cuban diplomatic
mission here assaulted Cuban-American protesters who were demanding that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez remain in the United States. Some of the protesters
suffered minor injuries in the fracas just before nightfall last Friday and were
treated at local hospitals. The disclosure came as the State Department summoned
a top Cuban diplomat here to express ''extreme concern'' over the beatings. If
Cuban diplomats were involved, they would not be subject to prosecution because
of diplomatic immunity.

Fed Court Shuts Down Megan's Law

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ordered a freeze on sex
offender notifications in New Jersey until it has time to review the fairness of
procedures being used by officials who issue the warnings. U.S. District Judge
Joseph Irenas last week ruled that the state's Megan's Law guidelines, as
revised by Attorney General John Farmer, provided a reasonable system for
warning neighbors about sex offenders while making sure the privileged
information was not leaked to the community at large. But the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Philadelphia issued an order today saying it wanted to
review these facts for itself.

Feds: Autism Cluster Found in N.J.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BRICK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal investigation of a possible autism cluster here
found that worried parents who pushed for the study were right: The
neurodevelopmental disorder is far more common here than once thought. But the
investigation stopped short of finding an autism cluster, a higher-than-average
rate of the disorder in an area. Officials said there is not enough data on
autism nationwide to say that a cluser exists. The investigation did find that
the water was not contaminated. After the most intensive federal study of autism
prevalence ever conducted, researchers said Tuesday that they found a rate of 4
in 1,000 children with autism in Brick and 2.7 in 1,000 with autism-like
disorders.

U.S. Approves New Antibiotic

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors are getting an important new weapon in the growing
battle against drug-resistant infections: The government on Tuesday approved a
long-awaited drug called Zyvox, described as the world's first entirely new type
of antibiotic in 35 years. Zyvox seems to cure some infections impervious to all
other antibiotics, even that longtime drug of last resort called vancomycin.
Consequently, Zyvox could help prevent hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of
life-threatening infections every year. The Food and Drug Administration
approved Zyvox, made by Pharmacia Corp., today for use by adults with pneumonia
and skin infections.

<HEADLINE> Angels 16, Blue Jays 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Rookie Adam Kennedy tied a team record with eight
RBIs, hitting a grand slam and barely missing another in leading
the Anaheim Angels over the Toronto Blue Jays 16-10 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy went 4-for-5 with a home run, a bases-loaded triple and
two singles. He matched the Angels' mark for RBIs done four times,
most recently by Don Baylor on Aug. 25, 1979, at Exhibition Stadium
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance at hitting for the cycle, Kennedy walked in the
seventh and had an RBI single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   A wild ninth inning saw the Angels score five runs, Toronto
score six times, a bench-clearing brawl and a separate ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kennedy's RBI single, Blue Jays reliever John
Frascatore hit Scott Spiezio with a pitch. There were no punches
thrown and Frascatore was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cruz Jr. hit a three-run homer in Blue Jays ninth. Later,
Raul Mondesi was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   After two close strike calls, Mondesi flied out and was tossed
by plate umpire Al Clark on the way back to the dugout. Mondesi
threw a water cooler from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy hit a grand slam off Frank Castillo in the fourth. The
24-year-old second baseman almost did it again in the fifth,
tripling off the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim starter Jason Dickson (2-0) took a shutout into the
sixth before the Blue Jays hit three consecutive home runs. Craig
Grebeck hit a two-run shot and Mondesi and Carlos Delgado followed
with their fourth homers of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo (0-2) gave up five runs on eight hits in 3 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took a 5-0 lead in the fourth on Kennedy's first career
slam. After Bengie Molina hit an RBI single in the fifth, reliever
John Bale loaded the bases before Kennedy tripled to give the
Angels a 9-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus' homer in the sixth made it 11-0.
Notes: A hot dog promotion went awry before the third inning. Fans
got splattered with bits of wiener after they fell apart in midair
after being shot from the ''Hot Dog Blaster.'' Although they
repeatedly disintegrated, they kept getting shot into the stands.
Some fans could be heard yelling ''ohhhh.'' ... Kennedy was
acquired from the St. Louis Cardinals along with pitcher Kent
Bottenfield for outfielder Jim Edmonds on March 23. ... Three
players in Angels' history have hit for the cycle. Dave Winfield
was the last to do it on June 21, 1991 at Kansas City. ... Grebeck
hit his first homer since May 18, 1998. ... The Blue Jays have
allowed more than 10 runs in four of their last five games. ... The
Blue Jays have lost six of their last seven home games. ...
Attendance was 13,825. ... Toronto has allowed 64 runs in its last
five games.

<HEADLINE> Giants 13, Reds 9  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Bonds scored five times Tuesday night as
the San Francisco Giants overcame an embarrassing inning and ended
a seven-game losing streak with a 13-9 victory over the Cincinnati
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's two errors helped Cincinnati score seven times
on only two hits in the third, when the Reds pulled ahead 8-4 with
their biggest inning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Another collapse by the bullpen that was the NL's stingiest last
season helped the Giants get only their fourth victory in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Mirabelli hit a pair of solo homers, the second one leading
off a four-run sixth inning that put the Giants ahead once again.
Ellis Burks tied it with a two-run single off Scott Williamson
(1-2), and the 1999 NL Rookie of the Year walked J.T. Snow with the
based loaded to put the Giants ahead 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson's wild pitch with the bases loaded let in another run
in the seventh. The right-hander fired his glove at the back of the
dugout after the inning, threw his jacket and kicked at the drink
cooler.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added three runs in the ninth with the help of
Cincinnati's second error and the game's fifth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Rueter (1-1) got the win in only his second career relief
appearance, allowing two hits in 2 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams batted around once and fumbled around a lot in a
3-hour, 51-minute game that featured 13 pitchers, 16 walks, two hit
batters, four wild pitches and a passed ball. Starters Joe Nathan
and Ron Villone both failed to make it through the third inning,
putting the game in the hands of two struggling bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   Villone had a rough night all around, giving up eight hits in 2
2-3 innings and dropping a throw at first for an error that led to
a run.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit a two-run homer in the first, his 29th in Cincinnati,
tying Mike Schmidt for the most by an opponent. Bonds also reached
on an error and walked four times.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants threw away a 4-1 lead with their worst inning of the
season. After making only five errors in their first 12 games, the
Giants made two in the third as Cincinnati sent 11 batters to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan walked the bases loaded to open the inning, but had a
chance to escape without allowing a run. He struck out Dante
Bichette and got Dmitri Young to hit a potential double-play
grounder directly to second baseman Jeff Kent, but shortstop Rich
Aurilia dropped his on-target throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Russ Davis also fumbled away a grounder to let in
a run as the inning accelerated. Barry Larkin's bases-loaded double
made it 8-4 and ended Nathan's appearance.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Four of Bonds' six homers have come in the first inning. He
has three hits in his last 16 at-bats, all of them homers. ...
Bonds also scored five runs in a 1993 game at San Diego. ...
Rueter, who had his start rained out Sunday, made his major league
debut in relief on Aug. 4, 1996. His next 162 appearances were as a
starter. ... Nathan has walked 13 in 15 2-3 innings. ... Williamson
walked five in 1 1-3 innings, a career high. ... Reds RHP Pete
Harnisch will miss his scheduled start Wednesday because of a stiff
forearm. He won't pitch again until Saturday. ... 1B Sean Casey
took batting practice for the first time since breaking his right
thumb on April 1. He hit several balls into the seats and felt no
pain. He could be activated this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 8, Indians 5  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Rookie Mark Mulder stuck around long enough to
win his major league debut Tuesday night and Ryan Christenson had
three RBIs to lead the Oakland Athletics to an 8-5 win over the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder, a 6-foot-6 left-hander recalled earlier in the day from
Triple-A Sacramento, allowed four runs and five hits in six innings
for the A's, who were swept at home by Cleveland last week. Oakland
is just 3-13 against the Indians the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi added a two-run homer, his sixth, in the ninth off
Steve Reed for Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Mulder (1-0), the No. 2 overall pick in the 1998
draft, looked like he might be in trouble early when he gave up a
two-run homer to Manny Ramirez in the first.
</P>
<P>
   But despite facing one of baseball's toughest lineups, Mulder
recovered and showed good poise in a couple of sticky spots. He
walked three and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen allowed David Justice's RBI single and loaded
the bases with one out in the ninth before getting Omar Vizquel and
Travis Fryman to fly out. Isringhausen earned his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson hit a two-run single in Oakland's three-run sixth
off Charles Nagy (1-2), who entered the game 12-5 in his career
against the A's. Miguel Tejada went 3-for-4 for Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman also hit a two-run homer for the slump-ridden Indians,
who are hitting .183 since returning from a nine-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman was in a 1-for-14 slump before ripping an 0-2 pitch from
Mulder for his second homer, a two-run shot, to give the Indians a
4-3 lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakland came back and scored three runs with two outs in the
sixth when Indians manager Charlie Manuel pressed his luck and
decided to stick with Nagy, who walked Matt Stairs to open the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Nagy walked Eric Chavez intentionally and Manuel
figured to bring in left-hander Tom Martin, but stayed with Nagy
who then walked pinch-hitter John Jaha.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson fell behind 0-2 before slapping a two-run single to
put the A's up 5-4. Tejada followed with a single to make it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland took a 3-2 lead in the fifth on Christenson's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who homered in the ninth inning Sunday when he and Jim
Thome hit back-to-back shots off John Wetteland to beat Texas,
connected for his fourth homer in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, shut out in Boston on Monday, tied it in the fourth on
Olmedo Saenez's RBI triple and Giambi's run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada doubled to open the inning, Seanez's hit a high drive to
center that turned around Alex Ramirez, who was making his first
start of the year in center.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi followed with a tapper to first to score Saenez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The A's improved to 10-22 at Jacobs Field. ... Indians
catcher Sandy Alomar left the game in the fourth inning with
tightness in his right hamstring. ... Chuck Finley's complete game
for the Indians on Sunday was the first by a Cleveland left-hander
since Greg Swindell in 1991. ... The A's are in a stretch where
they'll play 19 of 25 games on the road. ... Cuban Danys Baez, who
signed a three-year, $14.5 million contract with the Indians in
November, allowed six runs and five hits in 2 2-3 innings in a
start Monday night for Class-A Kinston.

<HEADLINE> Hawks 111, Nets 109 2OT  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Lorenzo Wright scored four of Atlanta's six
points in the second overtime and blocked a potential tying layup
by New Jersey's Keith Van Horn at the buzzer in a 111-109 victory
over the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Nets' 10th straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks won their second straight after losing nine in a row.
Their final home game of the season drew a Fan Appreciation Night
crowd of 11,412.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, one of eight Hawks in double figures with 10 points,
scored on a tip-in 56 seconds into the second overtime for a
107-105 lead. George Muresan tied it with a short jumper with 3:42
left but Jason Terry scored for a 109-107 Atlanta lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's bucket with 2:48 left made it 111-107. Van Horn, who
led New Jersey with 24 points, got the Nets within 111-109 with a
basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had a chance to tie when Jim Jackson missed a 3-point
attempt and Van Horn rebounded with 5.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Van Horn went to the basket, but Wright made
the game-saving block at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Jim Jackson sent the game into the second overtime
when he hit a reverse layup with 10 seconds left to tie it 105-105.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Perry, who scored a season-high 20 points, scored all six
of New Jersey's points in the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks appeared to have the game won in regulation, leading
99-91 with 1:50 left, but New Jersey went on an 8-0 run in the
final 1:25, tying it on one of two free throws by Kendall Gill with
27.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, scoreless in the opening half, and LaPhonso Ellis led
Atlanta with 16 points apiece. Jackson had 15 points, Bimbo Coles
14 and Alan Henderson 13. Dikembe Mutombo had 22 rebounds and seven
blocked shots to go with 13 points and Dion Glover added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Lucious Harris had a season-high 22 points for the Nets, who had
six players in double figures. Gill added 15 points, Johnny Newman
14 and Muresan a season-high 11.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Hawks (28-53), who won for only the fourth time in 20
games, close out the season Wednesday night in Indiana and are
within a game of having their worst record since the franchise
moved from St. Louis to Atlanta for the 1968-69 season. The was
29-53 in 1975-76. ... The Nets suited up only eight players and
lost Jim McIlvaine with less than four minutes gone with a sprained
right ankle while blocking a shot by Mutombo. ... Hawks forward
Roshown McLeod, arrested Monday night on a charge of simple
battery, was not in uniform and had no comment on his arrest. ...
The Hawks will be missing the playoffs for the first time since the
1992 season, the last time they had a losing record (38-44).

<HEADLINE> Philippines Jet Crashes, 130 Aboard  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID THURBER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An Air Philippines jetliner carrying
130 people crashed in the southern Philippines Wednesday and
officials said all aboard were believed killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737-200 circled its destination city of Davao, 625
miles southeast of Manila, before going down in a coconut grove on
nearby Samal island, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews arriving at the site of the still-smoldering
plane said there were no signs of survivors. If that turns out to
be the case, it would the worst plane crash in Philippine history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initial report is that everyone was killed,'' said Melcar
Estella, the assistant regional director of civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of a small plane which flew over the area told
authorities that the craft appeared to be totally destroyed except
for its tail section.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said that the plane left Manila carrying 130 people
-- 124 passengers, including four babies, and six crew members.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on what caused the disaster. The
airline said a maintenance check before takeoff showed the plane
was OK. Forecasters said weather conditions were good.
</P>
<P>
   Planes, buses and ferries throughout the Philippines were jammed
Wednesday because of the start of Easter holidays, in which many
Filipinos return to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be the most serious crash in the Philippines
since a twin-engine plane slammed into the hills in the northern
part of the country on Dec. 7, killing all 17 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In the country's worst air disaster ever, a Cebu Pacific DC-9
jet crashed in 1998 near the top of a fog-shrouded mountain in the
southern Philippines, killing all 104 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the country's airlines created since the industry was
deregulated several years ago have been dogged with safety- and
maintenance-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing began producing the 200 model of the 737 in 1966,
building more than 1,000 of them over the next 22 years before
ending production. The plane can carry up to 130 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Sean Griffin this plane was first put into
service 22 years ago. He said he didn't know when the four-year-old
airline acquired it or whether this specific jet had any problems
previously.

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Crashes in Ariz., 7 Hurt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSAYAN, Ariz. (AP) -- A tour helicopter crashed shortly after
taking off Tuesday south of Grand Canyon National Park, injuring
six German passengers and the pilot, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the injuries was believed to be life-threatening. Four
of the victims were in fair condition and two were in good
condition with various back, leg and pelvic injuries, said Keli
Openshaw, spokeswoman for Flagstaff Medical Center. Another victim
was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell 206 Long Ranger helicopter lost power after rising
about 300 feet off the ground and came down on airport property,
authorities said. Witnesses said it skidded about 50 feet on its
belly, leaving a wide skid mark and bending the main rotor.
</P>
<P>
   It was operated by Kenai Helicopters, which operates out of a
heliport near the canyon's South Rim. Phone calls to officials with
Kenai Helicopters were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Roland Herwig said the
18-year-old helicopter had one prior accident, in 1992, when the
helicopter's tailrotor hit the ground at a Hawaiian airport. Herwig
said there were injuries, but he had no other details.

<HEADLINE> Survey: US Most Competitive Nation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The United States and Singapore
kept their hold on the top spots as the world's most competitive
nations, but European countries formed a solid phalanx behind them,
according to an annual survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, a previous leader, languished in 17th place in the poll
of business leaders conducted by the International Institute for
Management Development.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is breaking all records,'' said the
institute in its World Competitiveness Yearbook. ''It has had its
longest period of economic expansion since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy has turned in 108 straight months of growth,
surpassing the record of 106 months between February 1961 and
December 1969, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has led the competitiveness survey since it
ended Japan's eight-year reign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Filling out the top 10 were Finland, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Luxembourg, Ireland, Germany, Sweden and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Canada dropped a notch to 11th, and Hong Kong fell to 14th place
from seventh last year because of lagging economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The northern European countries owe their success in part to
heavy investment in technology, the report said. They are leaders
in mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, it said, is ''mostly back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore has shown extreme resilience with economic growth of
5.4 percent. South Korea has rebounded, jumping 10 points to 28th
place.
</P>
<P>
   Both China, in 31st, and India, 43rd, dropped in the rankings
because of uncertainties concerning their global economic
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,263 executives filled out the survey this year, rating
countries on criteria ranging from labor costs and investment in
research and development to education and society values, the
report said. Thirty-four partner institutes around the world joined
in making sure the final survey was balanced.

<HEADLINE> Dave Cowans To Coach Warriors  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Dave Cowens, former coach of the Boston
Celtics and Charlotte Hornets, will take over from Garry St. Jean
as coach of the Golden State Warriors at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean, the team's general manager, took over as coach when
P.J. Carlesimo was fired Dec. 28. He will coach the Warriors in
their season finale Wednesday night at home against Phoenix, then
turn the job over to Cowens.
</P>
<P>
   Cowens, a Hall of Fame player who has been with Golden State as
an assistant coach since Jan. 31, resigned as Charlotte's coach 15
games into the 1998-99 season. He has a 136-111 record as coach
with the Celtics (1978-79) and Hornets (1996-99).
</P>
<P>
   Cowens, who starred for 10 seasons with the Celtics, spent his
final season as a player with the 1982-83 Milwaukee Bucks on which
St. Jean was an assistant. He said he feels comfortable with the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the personnel. I know the general manager and have a
good relationship with him,'' said Cowens, who has never said why
he left the Hornets in 1999 and skirted the subject again Tuesday.
''When someone wants you and they need you, it's a good place to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean said the move was made Tuesday so he and Cowens could
discuss the change with Warriors players, and said he felt there
was no need to look at other potential coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt, looking around the league, you're not going to find a
better candidate out there right now,'' said St. Jean, who
announced the coaching change during a season-ending party for
Warriors season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean, who will remain as general manager, said it became too
difficult doing both jobs. He had expected to stay as coach as
well, but changed his mind this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to the conclusion it would be best for me serving the
team to go back upstairs. There were a lot of times I was looking
over my shoulder to the office,'' he said. ''I look at our team and
our record. We have a lot of decisions to make, basketball-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors are 19-62 this season, with three losing streaks of
10 games or longer. They have the third-worst record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors were 6-21 when Carlesimo was fired by St. Jean in
late December. But the losing continued under St. Jean, who went
13-41 heading into Wednesday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean coached the Sacramento Kings for five years before
taking the general manager's job with the Warriors before the
1997-98 season.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 93, Bulls 89  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bad news for the Philadelphia 76ers: It only gets
tougher from here.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron McKie made three free throws in the last 24 seconds
Tuesday night as the Allen Iverson-less 76ers held off the Chicago
Bulls 93-89 and kept their hopes for home-court advantage in the
first round alive.
</P>
<P>
   Barely.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers' fate is in Charlotte's hands now. Philadelphia is a
half-game ahead of the Hornets in the race for home-court
advantage, but Charlotte has one more game and wins the tiebreaker
because it won the season series 3-1. The Hornets host the Miami
Heat on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which missed 13 straight shots in the fourth
quarter and went more than 10 minutes without a field goal in
Monday night's 92-90 loss to Indiana, nearly blew it again.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Geiger's dunk with 11:06 left gave Philadelphia an 80-55
lead and the game should have been all but over. But the Bulls
weren't about to let their last home game go that easily.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Anstey scored 12 points as the Bulls went on a 29-8 run,
closing to 88-84 on his dunk with 58 seconds left. Eric Snow
responded with a 20-foot jumper, but Hoiberg scored on a driving
layup.
</P>
<P>
   McKie then made his first two free throws, but Corey Benjamin
came right back with a 3-pointer to keep the Bulls within 92-89
with 19 seconds left. George Lynch missed two free throws and
Chicago got the rebound, but Benjamin couldn't hold onto it.
</P>
<P>
   McKie was fouled, and he made the first of two. Chicago had one
last shot, but they lost the ball under the basket and couldn't get
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers hurt themselves as much as Chicago did during the
fourth, turning the ball over a whopping eight times in the quarter
and getting outscored 37-14. It didn't help that they were missing
Iverson, who went on the injured list earlier Tuesday with an
inflamed elbow and a broken toe. He's expected back for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   McKie finished with 14 points and eight assists. Snow led the
76ers with 20, and Toni Kukoc scored 18 against his old team. Lynch
added 16.
</P>
<P>
   Brand led the Bulls with 26 and 10 rebounds. Anstey had 17 off
the bench, and Benjamin added 12.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers struggled early, too. Brand scored 15 points in the
first quarter, and the Bulls started the second with three straight
field goals to take a 30-19 lead with 9:56 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers looked sluggish and lost without Iverson, shooting
just 43 percent in the first quarter and turning the ball over four
times.
</P>
<P>
   But after Geiger was called for a technical and Fred Hoiberg
made the free throw to go up 36-25 with 6:19 left in the half, the
76ers found some life. Snow scored on a fastbreak layup and a
jumper, and Geiger made two free throws to cut the lead to 38-33.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kukoc, who had missed his first five shots, got going. He
scored on a fallaway jumper and then fed Geiger for the
give-and-go. After a timeout, he had an outstanding spin-and-slam,
twirling away from Hoiberg and jamming the ball through the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't done. He stole the ball from Brand and found
McKie, who put up the easy layup for the 41-40 lead with 1:33 to go
in the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: 76ers center Theo Ratliff started, but played only seven
minutes before leaving because of a cold and the flu. He finished
0-for-2 from the floor without any rebounds. ... Chicago Bulls
guard Randy Brown, activated from the injured list earlier in the
day, didn't play the second half because of tightness in his back.
Brown had been on the injured list with back spasms since April 8.
... The Bulls had 19 turnovers.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 112, Lakers 102  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Finley scored 25 points as the Dallas
Mavericks ended their 19-game losing streak to the Los Angeles
Lakers with a 112-102 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash added 23 as Dallas beat the Lakers for the first time
since April 5, 1995. It was the Mavericks' eighth win in their last
nine.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' Shaquille O'Neal scored 38 points and had 20
rebounds, but hit just 8 of 19 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   In three previous meetings this season, Dallas coach Don Nelson
had his players foul O'Neal nearly every time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The ploy didn't work then as O'Neal averaged 30 points and 14
rebounds in three Lakers' wins.
</P>
<P>
   This time it did.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson held off employing ''Hack-a-Shaq'' until the final minute
of the third quarter, but the strategy keyed a run that put Dallas
in control.
</P>
<P>
   After Bradley knocked O'Neal to the floor with a hard foul,
6-foot-3, 185-pound guard Damon Jones came into the game with just
over a minute left. His sole purpose was to foul O'Neal, who
entered shooting 52 percent from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Jones grabbed O'Neal around the waist away from the ball,
the second time coming before the ball even crossed midcourt.
O'Neal missed six straight free throws in the final 49 seconds of
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas finished the quarter with a 6-0 run for a 80-75 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks went on 9-1 run to take a 101-88 lead with 3:45
left. Cedric Ceballos capped the run with a driving, left-handed
layup. Los Angeles got no closer than six the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos finished with 21 points, and Finley added five assists
and four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Kobe Bryant had 16 points and 14 rebounds, but made
just 7 of 20 shots.Notes: With 47 minutes played Michael Finley has 3,416 on the
season, breaking his own team record. The previous mark was 3,394
in 1997-98. ... Energetic new Mavericks owner Mark Cuban addressed
the crowd before and after the game, the team's final home game
this season. ... The Lakers had won their last eight games in
Dallas. ... The Lakers, the highest-drawing visiting team in the
league, drew a sellout of 18,190 Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Packers RB To Attend Drug Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARKHAM, Ill. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers running back De'Mond
Parker appeared in court Tuesday on a marijuana possession charge,
and agreed to attend a court-approved drug course.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas O'Hara of Cook County Circuit Court continued the
case until July 26 when the court will get a report on whether
Parker successfully completed the program.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors often drop charges upon successful completion of the
course.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 23, of Green Bay, Wis., was arrested April 1 after 7
grams of marijuana was found in an automobile in which he was
seated, according to police.
</P>

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Mark Johnson hit a three-run homer and Greg
Norton added a two-run shot in an 11-run fourth inning Tuesday
night that lifted the Chicago White Sox to an 18-11 victory over
the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who scored 47 runs in a three-game sweep in
Toronto over the weekend, gave up their most runs in an inning
since allowing 11 against the Blue Jays on July 20, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Norton drove in four runs, adding a two-run single in the
seventh, and Chris Singleton had four hits and four RBIs as the
White Sox scored their most runs since beating Minnesota 19-11 on
Aug. 4, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox overcame a 6-2 deficit in the fourth, sending 14
batters to the plate and totaling nine hits. Carlos Lee had a pair
of RBI singles in the inning, and Singleton and Johnson each had
two hits.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 runs in one inning were the most scored by the White Sox
since an 11-run fifth inning Oct. 3, 1987, against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko added a two-run homer in the seventh, his third,
and Norton had a two-run single as the White Sox snapped a
three-game losing streak before a sparse crowd of 9,898.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez went 4-for-4 for Seattle, driving in four runs
and hitting a two-run homer. David Bell drove in two runs for the
Mariners. Tom Lampkin hit a three-run homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Tanyon Sturtze (1-1) picked up the win, giving up three runs and
four hits in 3 2-3 innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (1-1) allowed eight runs and nine hits in three-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The White Sox record for most runs in an inning is 13 set
in the fourth inning Sept. 26, 1943, against the Senators. ...
Eldred gave up five runs and seven hits in 2 1-3 innings. He now
has given up 13 earned runs in three starts, 10 of those in the
first or second innings. ... Right-handed hitters have just three
hits in 24 at-bats against Sele this year. ... Chicago's Jose
Valentin started at shortstop after missing three games with a
strained right hamstring. ... The Mariners and White Sox rank 1-2
in the American League in runs scored.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 105, Jazz 104, OT  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Raef LaFrentz scored a career-high 32 points and
George McCloud hit a 20-foot jump shot with 25 seconds left in
overtime to lift the Denver Nuggets to a 105-104 victory over the
Utah Jazz on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   LaFrentz also had 17 rebounds and Nick Van Exel added 15 points
and 10 assists for the Nuggets, who struggled to win even though
the Jazz played its reserves for the game's final 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Having clinched the Midwest Division in Phoenix on Sunday, Utah
coach Jerry Sloan took the opportunity to rest starters Karl
Malone, John Stockton, Jeff Hornacek, Byron Russell and Olden
Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   Malone finished with 10 points in only 18 minutes, while Utah
was led by Scott Padgett's 13 points. Jacque Vaughn and Armen
Gilliam each scored 12 as the Jazz reserves accounted for 67
points.
</P>
<P>
   After McCloud's go-ahead jump shot, the Jazz missed several
chances to win on the ensuing possession. Quincy Lewis, who hit two
3-pointers in overtime, missed a 3-point attempt and was blocked by
LaFrentz inside the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Utah called a timeout with five seconds left, but threw away the
inbounds pass. James Posey recovered the loose ball and Denver was
able to run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   LaFrentz gave Denver a two-point lead on a two-handed dunk with
31 seconds left in regulation, but Vaughn -- LaFrentz former college
teammate at Kansas -- tied the game on two free throws seven seconds
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets had two good chances to win it in regulation, but
LaFrentz missed a tough 10-foot shot, and his putback attempt
rolled off the rim as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither team had anything at stake, things got a little
chippy in the third quarter as Van Exel took exception when
Stockton hit him after the whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel yelled at Polynice seconds later after being fouled by
the Utah center, and Malone picked up an offensive foul when he
knocked Van Exel down with a hard screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, behind the outside shooting of LaFrentz, shook off
the physical play and led 77-74 heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Malone had three assists and joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Wilt Chamberlain and Charles Barkley as the only players in NBA
history with 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists. ...
In their first season at the Pepsi Center, the Nuggets won 25 home
games, the most since the 1993-94 team won 28 games. ... Hornacek
was 3-for-3 from the foul line to raise his NBA-leading free-throw
percentage to 94.9, which would rank third-best in league history.
... Denver's backups had 25 points after scoring 18 in the previous
two games combined.

<HEADLINE> Senate votes to change GOP presidential primary ballots  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates will have
an easier time campaigning in New York during the next primary if
legislation passed by the state Senate becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which passed the Senate Tuesday, would allow New
York Republicans to vote directly for candidates instead of
delegates, which is the current rule. Voters have called the
ballots confusing because they list the delegates' names first and
the candidates' names second, and in smaller print.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also open the election to more candidates because
it would allow any candidate on the ballot who raised at least
$5,000 in each of 20 states; is certified with the state Board of
Elections as being a nationally recognized and serious candidate;
or collected at least 5,000 supporting signatures from New York
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Under current primary rules, GOP candidates must collect
signatures from party members in any of the state's 31
congressional districts in which the candidates want to field
delegate slates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a ballot access bill that approaches the presidential
primary in a very, very beneficial way,'' said Sen. Serphin
Maltese, a Republican from Queens who sponsored the bill. ''It's
kind of a warm and fuzzy approach to presidential politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are confident the bill will become law, even
though it still needs Assembly approval and the signature of Gov.
George Pataki and had a hard time in the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader of the Senate, Martin Connor, said certain
parts of the proposal, like a winner-take-all provision, could be
unconstitutional and violate the federal Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   That provision means a candidate who captures a majority of the
vote will get all New York's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to not get cleared by the Justice Department for
winner-take-all. But that's your problem,'' he said in Senate
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said the
proposal is definitely an improvement but still has flaws,
especially the winner-take-all provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''That gives the bosses control over the final selection,'' she
said. ''Frankly, the deck is stacked in favor of the organizational
candidate anyway, but then they further stack the deck by saying
all they have to get is get 51 percent of the vote to take all the
delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   But many experts applauded the proposal, saying something needed
to be done to change the ballot laws, which caused state GOP
officials some embarrassment during the 2000 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York is one of the worst states in the country in terms of
ballot access,'' said Rachel Leon, executive director of the state
chapter of Common Cause. ''So in general, we support any changes
that put elections back in the hands of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, originally proposed the bill.
He and State GOP Chairman William Powers led an unsuccessful effort
to use the state's complex ballot access rules to keep everyone but
Texas Gov. George W. Bush off the New York primary ballot this
year. Arizona Sen. John McCain began calling Pataki and Powers
''comrade'' and compared the New York ballot access rules to the
old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge's order eventually opened up the ballot to
McCain and other GOP presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a feeling some of the lesser-known candidates had
trouble getting on the ballot,'' Maltese said. ''We want to make
sure that any candidate who really has an opportunity to be
president can run in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   But Common Cause's Leon cautioned that changing the ballots just
to stymie the McCain backlash is the wrong thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're concerned that the Republicans and the governor are
reacting because of McCain's struggles,'' Leon said. ''We don't
want to see just his problem solved. There are a lot of candidates
out there whose problems won't be aired like McCain's were.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Allen, a spokesman for the state GOP, said he could not
comment on the bill because he hadn't seen it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires all polling places in the state to be
open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. during the spring primary. Those hours
are now in force only in New York City, the suburban counties
surrounding the city and Erie County. Primary polls open at noon in
the rest of the state.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton visits Adirondacks, criticizes Giulianienvironmental record  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG MOOSE, N.Y. (AP) -- In a pre-Earth Day environmental foray,
Hillary Rodham Clinton took her campaign into the heart of the
Adirondacks where she vowed to battle acid rain and criticized
Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she would continue her environmental
offensive today with a stop on Long Island to discuss problems
facing Long Island Sound and the island's lobster industry.
</P>
<P>
   During her appearance Tuesday, Clinton also questioned the New
York City mayor's campaign payments of $1 million to conservative
direct-mail fund-raising guru Richard Viguerie. With Viguerie's
help, Giuliani has outraised Clinton in their Senate race, $19
million to $12 million, according to records made public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think hiring Richard Viguerie, who does all of the
direct-mail for a lot of the most extreme and right-wing political,
public figures in our country is a disturbing development,'' she
told a news conference at the rustic Covewood Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Calling again for the mayor to release all his direct-mail,
fund-raising letters, Clinton said ''the people of New York deserve
to know what he is saying to try to raise money from people who
historically give money to Jerry Falwell or Ollie North or Jesse
Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign has repeatedly refused to make public its
fund-raising letters while the Clinton campaign has made its own
available as well as those of the mayor's it has been able to
obtain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that is the way most New Yorkers think,
regardless of party,'' Clinton said of the Giuliani letters. ''I
think most New Yorkers have a much more mainstream, practical view
about what the political process should produce.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, ever since the Viguerie connection became public,
Clinton has sought to use it to help her portray Giuliani as
someone who would work in the Senate with the conservative
Republicans who currently control Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke at a news conference set up by the
Adirondack Council aimed at boosting attention for anti-acid rain
legislation that was sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. It
would sharply limit emissions from power plants in the Midwest --
considered a source of pollution that has contributed to the death
of Adirondack lakes and ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she hoped Congress would pass Moynihan's
legislation as ''a going-away present to him.'' She is running for
the seat he is vacating at the end of the year and said she would
carry on his fight if Congress failed to pass his legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Giuliani's environmental record, Clinton said she
would be on Long Island today to discuss the demise of the lobster
fishery there and planned to raise the issue of dumping into Long
Island Sound by New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she was also ''worried about the loosening
of regulations that the city has done in the watershed that
protects the (upstate) reservoirs that supply the water to the
city.'' That is a theme that has been pressed by other critics of
the mayor in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the
mayor has a ''superb'' record on the environment and contended
Clinton has ''no environmental policy or record.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think she even knows where the watershed region is
located,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Glover Weiss also dismissed criticism of Viguerie by saying,
''when the Clintons get in trouble or need a scapegoat, they always
blame the vast right wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows, maybe Mrs. Clinton will blame the right wing
conspiracy for killing the lobsters on Long Island Sound,'' Glover
Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's news conference was held on the shores of Big Moose
Lake, scene of Theodore Dreiser's ''An American Tragedy,'' a novel
based on a true story about the murder of a pregnant young women
who had been accompanied to the lake by her lover.
</P>
<P>
   While the reception at the lodge for Clinton was warm, thanks in
part to a roaring fire in the massive stone fireplace, the first
lady's electoral chances in the heavily Republican area seem
chillier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have Democrats up here,'' said lodge owner and
Republican, Claude ''Major'' Bowes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Ellis assured the first lady that ''my wife, Jean, and
I are Republicans, but you have our votes.'' It turned out their
son had taught with the first lady at the University of Arkansas'
law school.
