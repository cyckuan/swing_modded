<HEADLINE> Poland to Strengthen Economic Ties With Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Poland is to strengthen ties with
Southeast Asia by hosting an economic forum in September,
according to a spokesman of the Foreign Economic Cooperation
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Poland had invited Thai, Malaysian,
Indonesian, Vietnamese and Laotian economic ministers for the
forum which is aimed at boosting mutual understanding, economic
cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Business representatives from those five countries, as well as
from Brunei, the Philippines, Cambodia, Singapore and the Hong
Kong region, will also be invited to the forum.
</P>
<P>
China, South Korea and Central European countries are invited
to observe the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Poland is trying to shift its focus
eastward so as not to rely too heavily on the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Jacek Buchacz, Minister of Foreign Economic Cooperation,
disclosed in mid-February that 75 percent of the country's exports
go to the EU, making Poland critically reliant on Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Polish economists believe that economic development in
Southeast Asia has been and will continue to be faster than in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
To explore the opportunities for cooperation with the region,
Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz will make a tour of
Southeast Asia in early March.

<P>
CARACAS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
rejected the U.S. decision to reinforce the embargo maintained
against Cuba for more than 30 years and to chastise third
countries which invest in that island.
</P>
<P>
EU Foreign Relations General Director for Latin America Juan
Prat said Friday that the EU does not approve unilateral measures
against Cuba, as established by the U.S. Helms-Burton bill.
</P>
<P>
"We agree with the United States about a democratic solution
for Cuba, but we do not agree with the ways the United States
government wants to use," Prat said.
</P>
<P>
Prat will preside over a meeting of EU ambassadors to Latin
America to be held in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered to harden the embargo
against Cuba following the downing February 24 by the Cuban air
force of two civilian planes belonging to the Florida-based Cuban
exiles' group, "Brothers to the Rescue."
</P>
<P>
Havana said the planes had violated its airspace while the
U.S. insists the aircraft were shot down over international waters.
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities estimate that the U.S. embargo for more than
30 years had cost the Caribbean country some 40 billion
U.S. dollars.

Milosevic was re-elected president of the Socialist Party of
Serbia at the third party congress today.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, the only candidate for the post, was supported by
1,795 of 1799 delegates to the congress.
</P>
<P>
The congress also elected the party's 185-member main board by
secret vote.

<P>
Milosevic has headed the Socialist Party of Serbia since it
became the governing party in the Serbian Republic of the former
Yugoslavia at the introduction of the multi-party system in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the closing address at the one-day congress this
evening, Milosevic said a new era lay ahead for Serbia and
Yugoslavia, in which economic and cultural development must be the
chief political goals.
</P>
<P>
"Peace (in former Yugoslavia) has been signed, the sanctions
have been suspended, refugees will slowly start returning home,
and Serbia should now turn to development, primarily economic," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The congress adopted the document "Serbia 2000 - A Step Into A
New Century" which sets the party's main political goals and the
foundations for a policy of Serbia's economic development,
cultural prosperity, and international affirmation at the
threshold of the new century.

LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Two of Britain's biggest mortgage
lenders say that house prices are rising steadily and that a
sustained recovery in the market has started after more than six
years in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the second-largest building society, Friday
reported a 1.4 percent rise in house prices last month, the
largest monthly rise since November.
</P>
<P>
Over the year to February, Nationwide says that house prices
rose by 0.9 percent, the first year-on-year rise since last May.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that on Monday, Halifax, the largest
building society and mortgage lender, will announce its seventh
monthly house price rise in succession. It is likely to say that
prices rise by less than one percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Halifax has predicted a two percent rise in prices this year,
followed by a five percent increase in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of housing transactions in January was
up 10 percent over the same time in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Housing analysts say that an underlying improvement in the
housing market has also been signalled over recent months by
mortgage lending data and also by survey evidence from estate
agents pointing towards significant rises in inquiries, viewings
and sales.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles End Peaceful Protest In Florida Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban exile flotilla today
held a brief memorial ceremony in the Florida Straits for the four
Cuban exile pilots killed when their planes entered Cuban airspace
and were shot down by Cuban air force last Saturday, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony which occurred at about 2:20 p.m. local
time, the flotilla turned back peacefully to Florida because of
rough weather, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard spokesman said the memorial service at sea had
been planned for spot about 66 miles south of Key West. But gusty
winds and swelling waves forced the flotilla organizers to halt
the procession about 40 miles south of Key West and conduct the
the ceremony there.
</P>
<P>
All about two dozen fishing boats in the flotilla were headed
back to Key West after the peaceful protest.
</P>
<P>
The United States military today sent warships, fighter jets
and an armada of Coast Guard cutters to escort the Cuban exile
flotilla to the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
The United States claimed that the two planes were in the
international airspace when they were shot down. But Cuba noted
that the planes violated its territorial airspace and they were
warned repeatly before Cuban fighter jets fired missiles at them.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the military escort had orders to do
whatever it could take to keep the flotilla from turning into
another international incident.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Industry Stagnates in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing industry has
stagnated for six months, putting pressure on jobs and prices and
shortening the odds on another interest rate cut next week,
according to an authoritative industry survey published Friday.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing activity contracted slightly last month and
prices slumped to their lowest level for four years, according to
the latest survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &AMP;
Supply.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on questionnaires sent to purchasing
executives in 310 industrial companies, shows that overall
Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.8 percent in February from
50.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
A reading below 50 percent signals a contraction in
manufacturing activity.
</P>
<P>
With demand generally weak, the prices index fell sharply, to
44.4 percent, its lowest level since January 1992 and down from
49.1 percent in January this year. This was the fourth successive
month in which prices fell.
</P>
<P>
The employment index fell below the crucial 50 percent level
for the second month running, a sign that companies are shedding
labour to cope with lower demand, and therefore output.
</P>
<P>
The chartered institute noted that February was the sixth
successive month without any significant growth in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The report added to the City's conviction that base interest
rates will be cut, with many economists betting on a quarter-point
move after next Thursday's monetary meeting between Kenneth
Clarke, the Chancellor, and Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of
England.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Progress in Syrian-Israeli Peace Negotiations Depends on Israel (by Wang Genbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between Syria and
Israel will take place Monday in the State of Maryland, U.S.A.,
resuming the earlier round that began on February 28.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe that the previous talks, described
by an American spokesman as "detailed and constructive," have not
achieved any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that actual progress in the new round depends
on Israel's commitment to the principles of the peace process as
specified in international legitimacy resolutions and on the
land-for-peace basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political observers in Damascus expect the current
Syrian-Israeli negotiations in Maryland to be maintained as it is,
awaiting the outcome of Israeli general elections. They attribute
this to the fact that negotiations are being focused on the basic
principles of the peace process, particularly security
arrangements and the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Political observers, however, do not anticipate a breakthrough
in the coming round of Syrian-Israeli negotiations, despite the
participation of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Yet,
they hold the view that the continuation of negotiations is in
itself evidence of the two parties' genuine desire to reach peace.
</P>
<P>
But the line to be followed and the prospects for expediting
negotiations will depend on the results of the Israeli general
election.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the recent Palestinian suicide
bombing attacks on Israelis in Jerusalem and Ashkelon have
diminished the popularity of Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
in his contest against the rightist Likud party leader Benjamin
Netanyahu and against the intransigent current in Israel. This
rigid Israeli current seeks to either dynamite the peace process
or to freeze it, particularly the Syrian-Israeli track, in view of
the suicide attacks being launched against the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomatic sources in Damascus, there has
been no breakthrough in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations so
far. They also rule out the prospects of progress at present in
view of the heated Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
It is quite probable that negotiations will be frozen until the
results of the Israeli general election are announced.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, is keen on maintaining contacts
between the parties concerned, and on keeping up the shuttle
diplomacy undertaken by the American coordinator of the peace
process Dennis Ross and his visits to each of Syria and Israel,
thus, sustaining the channels between them.
</P>
<P>
Yet, a Syrian official has been quoted as saying that Syria is
not concerned about the Israeli general election, and that it is
only keen on reaching a just and comprehensive peace in line with
the international legitimacy resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
He has further stated that Syria rejects hinging peace on the
Israeli elections or on a referendum on the future of the Golan
Heights, underlining that the Golan is Syrian territory and will
remain so, whatever the outcome of the Israeli elections will be.

Islamabad is engaged in certain programs in Taliban-held regions
including setting up of trade centers and telecommunications
systems.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came while some other Afghan officials expressed
willingness to improve ties with Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's General Workers Union Calls for Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's General Workers Union
(GWU) today called once again for staging strike and demonstration
for two successive days not later than the end of the current
month, in case the government fails to meet the GWU demands.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by the GWU's Executive
Committee following a committee meeting held here earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Elias Abu Rizk, president of
the GWU.
</P>
<P>
"The union insists on its demands and announces it will
continue its dialogue with the government on the basis of these
demands," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on Lebanon's House of Representatives
(Parliament) to play its role in protecting the liberties granted
by the constitution, describing the government's decision to ban
demonstrations as "unjustifiable."
</P>
<P>
The statement emphasized that the GWU would adhere to its
rights to strike and demonstrate unless its demands are
met.

<HEADLINE> Guarantees for Sarajevo Serbs Not Enough: Kasagic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Premier Rajko
Kasagic has blamed the international community for the mass exodus
of Serbs living in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"The international community could have given greater
guarantees to Serbs living in Sarajevo suburbs," which under the
peace plan are to be taken over by the Muslim-Croat federation by
March 19, Kasagic said in an interview published today by the
Serbian Daily in the Novi Sad city of Dnevnik.
</P>
<P>
The agreement from the recent summit on Bosnia in Rome has
obviously given insufficient guarantee for the Serbs to go on
living in the city, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fearing reprisals by the Muslim-Croat authorities, who will
take control over the entire Sarajevo area on March 20, about
40,000 out of 120,000 Serbs have already left their homes in the
five Sarajevo suburbs, and more Serbs were ready to leave.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic, who attended the Rome conference as a member of the
joint delegation of Yugoslavia, also promised that the Serb entity
will be a modern democratic community in which every person,
regardless of his religion, nationality, or any other affiliation,
will feel safe.
</P>
<P>
Private property, an open market and democracy will be the
basis of the future development of Serb state, Kasagic said.

<HEADLINE> Bruton Renews Call for IRA Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
urged the Irish Republican Army (IRA) again today to "quickly
resume" its cease-fire on the eve of the consulations on Ulster
elections among the Irish and British governments and political
parties in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Irish Radio, Bruton said the Irish people were
entitled to peace and peaceful conditions in which to sort out
their differences.
</P>
<P>
The only solutions to the conflict in Northern Ireland could be
found in peace talks and not in violent means, he said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the conditions for a peace agreement now
existed.
</P>
<P>
The Irish premier told the IRA, "Have no part of violence and
you have a full part of talks and in the political process."
</P>
<P>
Bruton also praised his British counterpart, John Major, for
showing courage in setting June 10 as the date for all-party
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
London and Dublin will preside over consultations on elections
in Ulster among the political parties Monday.
</P>
<P>
As stipulated in the Anglo-Irish joint communique issued in
London last Wednesday, delegates to the planned all-party talks on
June 10 will be selected from an elective body produced in the
elections following the consultations from March 4 to 13.
</P>
<P>
But Bruton and Major indicated Saturday that the IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein would be excluded from the consultations
beginning Monday until the IRA resumed its cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Announces Outlawing Hamas' Armed Wing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat announced today that Hamas' armed wing and the armed
wings of all the other Palestinian factions are outlawed.
</P>
<P>
A report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east
Jerusalem, said that the outlawed groups include Black Panthers
(Fatah), Red Hawks (Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine), Iz a-Din al-Qassam (Hamas) and Qassam (Islamic Jihad).
</P>
<P>
The move was taken following a wave of bombing attacks
launched by Hamas since last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that Force 17, also known as Presidential
Security, are deploying in armored personnel carriers in Gaza to
begin their crackdown on these groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government has given permission to the
Israeli right-wing groups to stage demonstrations in Jerusalem in
response to recent bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday's two suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem and
Ashkelon killed 28 people and this morning's suicide bus bombing
in Jerusalem killed 19 people.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians sources said that Jewish settlers from Ma'ale
Ephraim, on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, are pelting
Palestinian cars with stones. The cars were hit and swerved off
the road, but no details of injuries were available.

<HEADLINE> Most of Britain's Schools in Poor Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's schools are crumbling: 88
percent of classrooms are overcrowded and hundreds of schools
still have outside lavatories, a survey for the Observer has
found.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that more than 90 percent of schools
surveyed were forced to use temporary classrooms to ease
congestion, and 72 percent had inadequate heating, which teachers
believed affected the quality of education, according to The
Observer today.
</P>
<P>
Capital spending on buildings and maintenance is now running at
half the level of 20 years ago. In 1974-75, 1.82 billion pounds
(2.78 billion U.S. dollars) was spent on buildings.
</P>
<P>
But 10 years later, it had fallen to 604 million pounds (924
million dollars) in real terms, and is barely higher today.
</P>
<P>
More than half of teachers said they were under pressure with
parents to raise funds to help pay for salaries, textbooks and
teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
Britain spends only 3.9 percent of its public capital
expenditure on school infrastructure against 8 percent on the
continent, and local authorities lack the cash to maintain
buildings.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that schools up and down the country are in an
appalling state," said Peter Smith, general secretary of the
Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just bad news for teachers, it is even worse for
children," he said.

<HEADLINE> Leeson May Control Millions of Pounds Secretly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Nick Leeson, the fraudulent trader
whose massive losses caused the collapse of Barings merchant bank
a year ago, may control 23 million pounds (35 million U.S.
dollars) in six secret German bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
The accounts have been discovered by investigators working on
the collapse of Barings who are looking for some of the 850
million pounds (1.3 billion dollars) that Leeson lost in the
financial markets, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Four of the accounts are said to be controlled by an Indonesian
company while the two others are in Leeson's name.
</P>
<P>
But the investigation into the bank's collapse has failed to
obtain more details due to Germany's strict banking secrecy laws.
</P>
<P>
Allegations about the bank accounts, if true, cast doubt on the
Bank of England's belief that Leeson made no gain out of Barings'
crash.
</P>
<P>
Leeson, who is serving a six and a half year prison sentence
for fraud in Singapore, has insisted that he made no money out of
his trading losses. He claimed that he covered up his losses with
the knowledge of senior managers at Barings.
</P>
<P>
Three of the bank accounts are said to be in Berlin, two in
Frankfurt and one in Munich, and Leeson is said to have been able
to withdraw cash from all of them.
</P>
<P>
They were opened in April 1994, 10 months before the collapse.
</P>
<P>
The Barings debacle will come under public scrutiny again next
month when the Commons Treasury select committee hears evidence
from bankers and regulators involved in the collapse.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Carrington, a Conservative member of the committee,
said, "If these accounts are what they seem to be, it throws a
completely different light on what everyone thought was just a
rogue trader."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leaders Strongly Condemn Buss Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leaders have sternly
condemned this morning's public bus bombing attack in Jerusalem,
the second in the city since last Sunday, according to a report
of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority (PA) President, Yasser Arafat, quoted
by Voice of Palestine, stated, "This is a catastrophe. It
damages the interests of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
"The people behind this should be punished," said Salim
Zanoun, acting president of the Palestinian National Council.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, newly-elected member of the Palestinian Council
and spokeswoman of the former Palestinian peace delegation,
condemned it as "an immoral act."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Palestine Radio, Ashrawi said
that "it is not a military operation."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Nimr Darwish, head of the Islamic Movement in Israel,
declared that "this is not a battle, there are children there."
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on Radio Israel's Arabic Service, Darwish called on
Moslem religious leaders to give a clear fatwa (decree) about
these attacks, adding that the political leaders of Hamas should
raise their voice of opposition to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Let's give a chance for the peace process. Let's give a
chance for civilization," Darwish called.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement of the Ministry of Public
Security, a Palestinian suicide bomber blew up a Jerusalem city
bus today, killing 19 people and wounding 10 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Yahya Ayyash Units, first
heard of in last week's suicide bombings in Ashkelon and
Jerusalem, took responsibility for today's attack on No.18 Bus on
Jaffar Street in downtown Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in east Jerusalem, the units said in a leaflet that "this
blessed operation was carried out in loyalty to the blood of the
martyr engineer Yahya Ayyash. It sends our violent revenge to the
organized violence of the Israeli government."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli government, it said that "with this
operation, our response to the killing of "The Engineer" ends. We
will stop our armed activities starting this morning to give the
Israeli government and Hamas' political leadership in the
homeland a chance to reach a ceasefire via the Palestinian
National Authority."
</P>
<P>
"They have three months to do this," it declared.
</P>
<P>
It said that the units will violate this immediately if Israel
hurts Hamas or the wanted heroes of the Qassam Units in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. "The security closure and all security
measures will not prevent us from striking anytime or anywhere we
want," it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today denounced the suicide bus bombing in Jerusalem this morning,
voicing sorrow over continuation of such incidents against
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with his Slovenian counterpart Zoran
Thaler, Moussa told reporters that the peace march should continue
despite the tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Thaler, Moussa said that
extremists should not be given a chance to halt the peace process
that could lead to self-determination of the Palestinian people
and equal relations between Palestine and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides to
exercise restraint and not to halt their talks.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian foreign minister said at the press conference
that such incidents as the Jerusalem explosion targeted
peacemakers in the region.
</P>
<P>
The blast this morning, which left 20 people dead and more than
a dozen others injured, took place just one week after two
suicide bombings in Jerusalem and the Israeli coastal city of
Ashkelon killed 28 people, including the two bombers.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) reportedly claimed
responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement following the attack today, Moussa said
the suicide bombing should not affect the peace march.
</P>
<P>
He said that a halt to peace negotiations means surrendering to
attempts aimed at sabotaging the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Such kind of operations is of benefit to no one but the
enemies of peace and stability," Moussa said in his brief
statement.
</P>
<P>
He added that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's position is
clear and he has condemned such terrorist attacks.

JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua)-- "Hate speeches" could not

<P>
He said: "It is within this broader context that the recent
speeches by chief Buthelezi are unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the major task of the ANC and IFP
leaders was to rise above sectarian partisan politics and create
a climate of trust for the coming traditional Zulu gathering to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, organised by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini,
Mandela and Buthelezi as an urgent step to stop violence in
Kwazulu/Natal, had become "the central focal point and the hope
of all our people".
</P>
<P>
Makhaye said although there were serious problems between the
ANC and the IFP, "hate speeches cannot be a solution".
</P>
<P>
There was an urgency about holding the traditional gathering
and nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of peace, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to IFP supporters at a local government election
rally in Eshowe yesterday, Buthelezi said he was no longer able
to trust President Nelson Mandela because of recent political
developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, also Home Affairs Minister of the ANC-led
government of national unity, said that he had tried everything
he could to build a new climate of trust between himself and
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
A new climate of trust could only develop if Mandela
intervened to stop violence against the IFP in Kwazulu/Natal, he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the political violence in Kwazulu/Natal
between the ANC and IFP supporters had claimed the lives of about
20,000 people in the past few years. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Center-Right Parties Agree on Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Turkey's two
center-right parties signed a protocol here today for forming a
five-year minority coalition, thereby bringing an end to a
government crisis since last December.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister and True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman
Tansu Ciller signed the 10-article protocol with Motherland Party
(ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said such a coalition formation
was the "most logical" one out of the December 24 general
election.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, DYP and ANAP will set up a
five-year coalition based on a rotating premiership system with
ANAP leader Yilmaz being the first Prime minister until the end
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
He will be replaced by DYP leader Ciller for the years of 1997
and 1998. But Ciller will return the premiership to Yilmaz in
1999. An elected government will be formed for the last year of
2000 and a DYP member, except for Ciller, will head the
administration.
</P>
<P>
The protocol stipulates an equal division of cabinet posts
and government departments. The two parties also agreed to act
as one during parliament speaker and president elections in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the coalition program, the protocol calls for
"transparent politics" and crackdown on corruption in the
society.
</P>
<P>
It underlines the importance of "middle class", whose
interests should be protected, and calls for more fair distribution
of incomes.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government will continue the effort to wipe
out terrorism, but the protocol stresses that freedom of speech
should not be hindered.
</P>
<P>
The coalition accord also urges swift privatization of
state-owned enterprises, including state banks.
</P>
<P>
On foreign affairs, it says the new government will bring no
change to the present policies concerning the Balkans, the
Caucasus and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Since ANAP and DYP hold only 261 seats in the 550-seat
parliament, the minority coalition can survive a confidence vote
only with the support, at least not opposition, from the left
wing parties.
</P>
<P>
Bulent Ecevit, chairman of the Democratic Left Party, has
said that his party with 75 parliamentarians will not cast
no-confidence vote for approving the new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ciller and Yilmaz, two political rivals in the country's
conservative wing, had been faced with mounting pressure to
put aside their personal interests and competition in a bid to
prevent the islamic Welfare Party (RP) from coming to power.
</P>
<P>
The RP appeared on top in the December 24 election, but
failed to obtain a simple majority in the parliament with only
158 seats. It has made every effort to suit ANAP and DYP
for a possible partnership in the past two months, but neither
in the end wanted to take the risk of losing the heart of
secularist voters.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Heavy Fighting Breaks Out In Southwestern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A fresh fierce fighting is
reported at the outskirts of Baidoa, Southwestern Somalia,
between militiamen of General Mohamed Farah Aideed who occupy the
region and those of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) last
night.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness in Baidoa said as many as 11 militiamen supporting
General Aideed have been killed while 13 others are being treated
in Baidoa hospital.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed quoted a
spokesman for the RRA as saying the RRA forces have repulsed a
well planned attack by General Aideed's men, causing them heavy
casualties. The radio quoted a spokesman for the RRA, Colonel
Mohamed Hassan Shatigudud, as saying the fighting took place at
Dainunay village, just 10 km south of Baidoa, when what they
called the aggressors had attacked their village. He admitted
that his forces had lost 4 gunmen in the battle.
</P>
<P>
This renewed fighting is taking place at a time when the local
newspapers are carrying reports that all RRA senior militia
officials are coming to Mogadishu deserting their region for
General Mohamed Farah Aideed who since last September has been
residing in the region with huge militia presence. However,
Shatigudud denied the allegations, calling their presence in
Mogadishu as a brief visit to get militia consultation from their
alliance, the Somali Salvation Alliance led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
"We haven't deserted our land and will never do so," he said
angrily, "all RRA field militia commanders are in position to
defend their land."
</P>
<P>
However, South Mogadishu Radio, supporting General Aideed which
is celebrating the first anniversary of what they called the end
of foreign occupation in Somalia, did not mention the fighting
between the supporters of General Aideed and those of the RRA.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today condemned the latest bombing attack in Israel and said "this
is a troubling moment" for the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast earlier today blew up a bus in downtown
Jerusalem, killing 18 people and woulding 10.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised he will do everything he can to keep the peace
process alive, saying, "To Prime Minister (Shimon) Peres and

stand with you and with all those -- Israelis and Palestinians --
who support peace as you take up this challenge."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, now on a visit to
Brazil, called today's attack a "grotesque and uncivilized act of
terrorism" and said those responsible for the attack "are trying
to kill the peace process."

"They must not be allowed to succeed. They must be discredited,
isolated and defeated," he said.

<HEADLINE> New York City Prepares for Campaign Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- New York City police plan to
arrest 7,700 suspected narcotics sellers and buyers in a six-month
campaign against drugs beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug offensive will be launched in Queens and Brooklyn
boroughs, two of the main crime-infested sections in the city, and
it is expected to involve more than 1,000 investigators and
officers.
</P>
<P>
Police officials have warned the City Department of Correction
to expect 2,600 more drug arrests than usual during the first
month of the operation and an additional 5,000 arrests from May to
the end of September, according to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the expected number of new inmates, the Department
of Correction is looking for additional jail space as the city's
jail system is now operating at 98 percent capacity, accommodating
18,600 inmates.
</P>
<P>
The city's 1,353-bed Brooklyn Correctional Facility and the
800-bed Vernon C. Bain barge, which were closed last year to trim
the department's budget, are on the plan to reopen.

<HEADLINE> Portillo Sticks to Ban on Gays in UK Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo said today that lifting the ban on gays in the armed
forces would jeopardize the discipline and morale of the
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview earlier today, Portillo
said servicemen were supposed to trust one another and lifting the
ban would create a complication and jeopardize fighting power,
trust and morale in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary revealed that the vast majority of the
armed forces thought the gay ban in the military should not be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary made the comment on the eve of a
Homosexual Policy Assessment Team survey, to be published Monday,
on whether to lift the controversial ban.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a group of gay ex-service people challenged
the controversial ban and a judge recommended that the Ministry of
Defense (MoD) should review its policy.
</P>
<P>
For four months, the Homosexuality Policy Assessment Team of
the MoD has visited various ranks across the three services to ask
thousands of men and women if they objected to serving alongside
gay colleagues.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that only 30 percent of those troops questioned
felt that the services would be a more comfortable environment if
gays were accepted.

<HEADLINE> SADC Early Warning Unit Predicts High Yields This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Eearly Warning Unit has predicted an above
average cereal harvest for the 1995/96 season as a result of good
rains.
</P>
<P>
According to its latest bulletin, indications were that
production would be higher than last season in all the 12
countries of the region, which have in the last few years
suffered from severe food shortages due to recurrent droughts.
</P>
<P>
The region experienced a serious drought during the 1991/92
season, forcing almost all the countries to rely on food imports.
</P>
<P>
However, the unit warned that excessive rains, which had
caused floods, water logging, leaching of soil nutrients and
erosion in countries like Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa,
Swaziland and Zimbabwe, were likely to compromise crop yields.
</P>
<P>
Red locust infestations had also considerably damaged crops in
Mozambique and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It added that production prospects in Zimbabwe had improved
substantially following widespread rains and an above-average
maize harvest was forecast for both the communal and commercial
farming sectors.
</P>
<P>
The unit said that the overall regional cereal shortfall had
been reassessed at 3.23 million tonnes. ''Food supplies remain
especially tight in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia where
stocks are extremely low and import deliveries very slow,'' said
the bulletin. enditem

<HEADLINE> UUP Leader Appeals to Loyalist Groups to Keep Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), the largest Protestant loyalist political
party in Northern Ireland, told different loyalist groups in the
troubled province today that they have to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC TV, Trimble warned that if loyalist groups took
their revenge, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) could be tempted to
use violence once again to press the British government to make
concessions in search for peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped loyalist groups could be dissuaded from
using violence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, an unidentified loyalist group threatened to
break its truce and attack leading members of the IRA and its
political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The threat came on the eve of the planned consultations on
elections in Ulster among the British and Irish governments and
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The unknown loyalist group described the current peace efforts
as a farce in which Protestants were being humiliated into making
concessions to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party,
political wing of the banned loyalist paramilitary group Ulster
Defense Association, said that the threat was "somewhat ominous."

LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-party Liaison Committee,
consisting of five opposition parties in Zambia, today criticized
the ruling party's decision to recruit its cadres as police
officers in preparation for the coming general and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
The criticism was voiced at a meeting of the committee in
Lusaka, which groups the Labor Party (LP), the National Party
(NP) the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the
Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) and the Liberal Progressive
Front (LPF).
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that the plan of the ruling Movement for

country, according to a report of Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
IPF President Rodger Chongwe who chaired the meeting revealed
that 630 MMD cadres would be recruited and trained as police
officers, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Out of which, 180 would be full-time police officers who would
be posted to all districts while the remaining would serve as
police reservists, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Offers Non-party Government for Future  Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia tonight offered a non-party government during all
national elections in future, saying that a related bill will be
introduced in the first session of the newly elected 6th
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a nation-wide speech on television and radio, Khaleda said
the proposed non-party government will take care of the day-to-day
affairs of the government, but shall not take any policy decision.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be arranged on the non-party government
according to the constitution requirements, khaleda said, adding
that steps will be taken to hold the next parliamentary elections
within the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
She urged all political parties to come to negotiations
immediately with an open mind to discuss all these proposals and
other related issues.
</P>
<P>
The government and the opposition have been at an impasse over
the key issue of a neutral caretaker government. In the run-up to
the February 15 election, the opposition demanded the polls be
held under such a government instead of the present
administration.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) went ahead with
the election, which was boycotted by all opposition parties. The
BNP won the election, but the opposition demanded cancellation of
the polls and resignation of the BNP government to pave the way
for a fresh election under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that despite the government's offer, the
country's prolonged political crisis will continue for quite a
long time, as the opposition insists the February 15 election is
"farcical" and would not recognize what they call the "illegal"
BNP government.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- British runners made it double
as they took both men's and women's international invitational
races of the Annual Hong Kong Golden Mile Races here today.
</P>
<P>
Adam Duke, a 22-year-old university student of sports sciences,
led all the way to take the Bank of China Cup men's race in a time
of four minutes 14.53 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Lian Jianguo from South China's Guangdong Province was 1.02
seconds behind at the finish line for the second place, followed
by his teammate Li Hongjun in 4:15.86.
</P>
<P>
"I did quite mind the hot weather but the wind," said Duke, who
wore a pair of running shoes borrowed from his brother. This was
his first mile race on road.
</P>
<P>
The temperature during the race was about 20 degrees
centigrade.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to come back again next year," he said. "I think I
could do it better since I'm improving every year," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was a Briton again in the Nike Cup women's race, when
Shirley Griffiths took the top honor, clocking 4:44.60.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Yuying from China's Guangdong Province was second in
4:45.12 and Australia's Leanne Wilford finished third in 4:54.40.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to win," said Griffiths, who works in a post
office. "I felt so dry at throat that I could hardly breathe.
The later stage of the second lap was the most difficult
section," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old woman, third in the annual race two years ago,
also planned to be back here next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) issued a statement today strongly condemning the
"vicious crime" that took place in Jerusalem this morning.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was carried by the official Palestinian
News Agency Wafa, noted that the attack was not directed at the
peace process and Israelis alone, but in essence against the
interests of the Palestinian people, their national experiment
and the National Authority.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian National Authority, out of its feeling of
national responsibility toward the Palestinian people, will not
stand by in front of this blatant external conspiracy," it
said. "The conspiracy is being run by the enemies of the
Palestinian people and enemies of peace who are using Palestinian
elements in their crimes."
</P>
<P>
It said: "The Authority has decided to continue to take the
necessary and immediate steps imposed by this situation,
including the banning of all paramilitary organizations, like
Fatah Hawks, Black Panthers (Fatah), Iz a-Din al-Qassam (Hamas),
Red Star (DFLP), Red Hawks (PFLP) and Qassam (Islamic Jihad). This
is to impose law and order and ensure stability, tranquility and
safety -- and to fulfill the commitments made by the Palestinian
people."
</P>
<P>
The PNA sends its condolences to the families of the
casualties and the Israeli government, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Traditional Healers Trying To Find Cure For Aids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Traditional
Healers Association (ZINATHA) is trying to find a cure for Aids
following its successful clinical trials in Harare last year, the
Zimbabwean National News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zinatha President Professor Gordon Chavunduka told the agency,
''we are in the process of testing various medicine in the
medical laboratories with a view to identifying the killer of
Hiv/Aids virus.''
</P>
<P>
He said there was no doubt that with the tests being conducted
in the country Aids cure could come from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Asked how effective the 1995 clinical trials had been, he said
the trials were conducted on 80 Aids patients and had proved that
some of Zinatha's medicine played an important role in the
treatment of aids.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the patients who had been discharged from
hospital had been treated and were now back at work and were
still alive.
</P>
<P>
He said Zinatha was now planning to establish hospitals
countrywide so that people could make a choice of whether to go
to a health institution or a Zinatha hospital.
</P>
<P>
He said membership of Zinatha had doubled from 25,000 in the
1980s to more than 50,000 at present. enditem

<HEADLINE> Peres Declares War Against Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres announced here today that Israel is at a total war against
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) after it claimed
responsibility for a bus bombing in Jerusalem this morning.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the announcement at a press conference this
afternoon, in response to the suicide bombing attack, which left
19 people dead and 15 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Peres announced that more security forces will be brought into
Jerusalem to guard the city, saying the government will "fill the
city with security personnel."
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will seal the home of the suicide
attacker, a Palestinian student who blew himself up with other
passengers on the No.18 bus this morning. "Israel will no longer
allow celebration of joy to be held," declared Peres.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister also announced that a special
security unit consisting of 800 men, will be established to guard
the public transportation throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there will be a separation between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, adding that 300 million shekels
(about 100 million U.S. dollars) are earmarked to facilitate the
implementation of the separation.
</P>
<P>
Peres called on President of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Yasser Arafat to outlaw the Hamas' Izzadin Kassam military
group and crack down all infrastructures of extremist groups
inside the Palestinian autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
A huge bomb exploded this morning inside a bus on the busy
Jaffa street in downtown Jerusalem, a week after a twin suicide
bombing attack in Jerusalem and Ashkelon that killed 26 people and
wounded 84 others.
</P>
<P>
Arafat quickly condemned the blast, saying that it was
"a very serious, dangerous and awful terrorist activity."
</P>
<P>
He said that the attack "is not only against Israel, but also
against the Palestinians and the peace process." He urged the
Islamic military groups to stop such terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also condemned the powers behind the attack, adding that
the PNA and he himself will continue cooperation with the Israeli
government to fight against terrorism and continue the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli President Ezer Weizman called
on the Israeli government to suspend all contacts with the
Palestinians and halt the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel has already imposed a total closure on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, following last Sunday's bombing attacks in Jerusalem
and Ashkelon, to prevent further attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
All negotiations with the Palestinians were suspended.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Help Bosnian Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) --Iran today declared that it will
continue helping Bosnian reconstruction despite its frustration in
an attempt to send 10,000 forces there.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani assured visiting
Bosnian Prime Minister Hassan Murtovic that Iran will continue
to offer help as it helped her during the war, saying that
all Moslem nations have a duty to do so.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement made by Rafsanjani
shows that the Islamic Republic would not easily give up its
interest in the Moslem areas though the West headed by the
United States is trying to keep it out from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On the 17th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Rafsanjani claimed
that Iran will continue export of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the arrest of three Iranians in Bosnia, the
Tehran government denied military involvement in Bosnia and termed
the U.S. ballyhoo on the discovery of a camp as part of
the White House's plot against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Bosnian prime minister, Rafsanjani said
"Islamic countries must be on the side of the Bosnian people
in the era of construction as they were during the war."
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that Rafsanjani warned
Moslem nations not to seek financial benefit when they help
Bosnia during her reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"Helping the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina should not
be motivated by the profit motive, rather it should be done with
an aim to help a nation which has become the target of one of the
most savage types of attacks and the worst types of oppression in
history," he added.
</P>
<P>
Murtovic said that Bosnian nation is indebted to Iran, adding
that the help by Iran arrived "exactly at the time when Bosnia was
going through the most crucial and most sensitive juncture of its
history in which the Islamic identity of her people were
endangered."
</P>
<P>
Calling on Iran to expand its economic relations with Bosnia,
Murtovic said that his country could learn a great deal from Iran
in the area of reconstruction and the mechanism to help the war
victims.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic arrived here Saturday night on a three-day official
visit. He was welcomed by Iran's First Vice-President Hasan
Habibi at Sa'Dabad Palace here this morning.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Muratovic said, he is to discuss with
Iranian officials Tehran-Sarajevo ties in the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
He said implementation of the peace plan and settling economic
and social problems are the main problems of the Bosnian
people. The Bosnian government is planning talks with officials of
the Islamic countries to seek their assistance in reconstructing
Bosnia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meetings will be held in Sarajevo and Islamabad to accelerate
the trend of Bosnian reconstruction effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, promises and commitments of the world
towards Bosnia are doubted.
</P>
<P>
He added that contrary to many political pledges not much has
been forthcoming in this respect.

<HEADLINE> NATO Looks to Peacekeeping by Europeans on Their Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States and its NATO
allies have agreed on new procedures to allow European countries
to undertake future peacekeeping missions like the American-led
operation in Bosnia on their own if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted allied officials as saying that
unlike the lightly armed and unsuccessful effort by European
nations in Bosnia in the past few years, future European
peacekeeping operations could draw on the much heavier fire power
of NATO force structures, equipment and logistical support even if
no American combat troops were involved.
</P>
<P>
A French defense official disclosed that an agreement on this
principle reached last week would reinforce the more coherent
European defense effort.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany and other West European nations have insisted
that more active and coherent European defense effort is
indispensable to their future security.
</P>
<P>
A key senior U.S. government official said that Washington was
now convinced that French President Jacques Chirac had made a
fundamental shift in French defense strategy, one that focuses on
developing a more coherent European defense effort within NATO
rather than outsider or in competition with it.
</P>
<P>
France has been a thorn in NATO's side for 30 years, ever since
President de Gaulle forced NATO's headquarters out of his country
to Belgiumnsible in 1966 and withdrew French military forces to
protest American domination.

<HEADLINE> Dole Reclaims Front-runner for GOP Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole put his struggling presidential candidacy back on track
Saturday night by winning a commanding victory in the Republican
presidential primary in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The S. Carolina contest was widely believed a crucial test that
led the 72-year-old Senate leader to reclaim the title of
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Dole brushed back a challenge from conservative columnist
Patrick Buchanan, who won GOP caucuses and primaries in Louisiana
and New Hampshire last month.
</P>
<P>
With most of the precincts reporting this morning, Dole had 45
percent, Buchanan 29 percent, magazine publisher Steve Forbes 13
percent and former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The outcome in S. Carolina was an important psychological boost
for Dole who suffered successive defeats in Republican primaries in
February.
</P>
<P>
A survey of voters leaving polling places showed that
conservative Buchanan did not draw the overwhelming support of
religious conservatives that helped him in other states.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that Buchanan's protectionist trade stand
prevented him form enlarging his base. Half the voters said that
American free trade policies created more jobs for South Carolina.

DAMASCUS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed al-Bashir today ended a two-day visit to Syria, during which
he asked Syria to mediate between his country and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Sudanese leader discussed with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad the inter-Arab relations, the
situation in the African Horn region and the bilateral ties
between their two countries.

Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital noted that al-Bashir's

intensified anti-Sudanese diplomatic campaign launched by a number
of Arab and international groups.

behind the failed attempt to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, last June.

Relations between Sudan and Egypt deteriorated in January when

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has condemned this morning's
bombing attack in Jerusalem, which left at least 20 dead and more
than 10 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters in Gaza this morning that he strongly
condemned the bombing attack, which he described as "a very
serious, dangerous and awful terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
He said that the attack "is not only against Israel, but also
against the Palestinians and the peace process." He called on the
Islamic military groups to stop such activities.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also condemned the powers behind the attack, adding
that the PNA and he himself will continue cooperation with the
Israeli government to fight against terrorism and to continue the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
A huge bomb exploded on a No.18 bus on the busy Jaffa street,
in the center of Jerusalem, at around 6:35 a.m. local time (04:35
GMT) today, just a week after a similar attack occurred here last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated that this is an another suicide
bombing attack on an Israeli public bus.
</P>
<P>
The bus was totally destroyed by the bomb, and other vehicles
and shops nearby were also serious damaged.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the scene, and the usually busy Jaffa street
has been close to all traffic, ambulances rushed to the scene to
rescue the terrified wounded people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who is scheduled to chair
a weekly cabinet meeting later today to discuss the situation
following last Sunday's attacks, also went to the scene together
with other senior security officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli President Ezer Weizman called on the
Israeli government to suspend all contacts with the Palestinians
and halt the implementation of the peace accord with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on West Bank and the Gaza
Strip following last Sunday's twin bombing attacks in Jerusalem
and Ashkelon to prevent further violent attacks against Israeli
targets.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday's twin bombing attacks killed 26 people, in
addition to the two suicide bombers, and wounded 84 others,
</P>
<P>
All negotiations with the Palestinians were halted, and Israel
has been pressing the PNA and Arafat to crack down Islamic
extremist inside the Palestinian autonomous area.
</P>
<P>
However, the bomb had again been brought to the center of
Jerusalem this morning and exploded exactly on the same street,
on the same route of the No.18 bus and almost at the same hour.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the
attack.

CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today said that the suicide bus bombing in Jerusalem this morning
should not affect the ongoing Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement in response to the bombing incident,
Moussa said that a halt to peace negotiations means surrendering
to attempts aimed at sabotaging the peace process.

The death toll from the powerful explosion this morning has
risen to 20, according to reports from Jerusalem. The Islamic
Resistance Movement, or Hamas, claimed responsibility for the

The tragic incident took place just one week after two suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem and the Israeli coastal city of
Ashlekon left 28 people dead, including the two assailants. Hamas
claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Such kind of operations is of benefit to no one but the
enemies of peace and stability," Moussa said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
After the blast, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak made a phone
conversation with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for a
discussion on the present situation in the wake of the attack, the
Middle East News Agency (MENA) said, without giving details.

AMMAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti condemned here today a bus bombing in Jerusalem early
this morning which killed at least 20 people and injured more than
10 others.
</P>
<P>
In a phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
Kabariti offered condolence of his government to families of the
victims of the blast.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Jordan's condemnation of this criminal and
terrorist attack, which he said, is targeting not only children
and innocent people but also peace and efforts underway to secure
it.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the blast, also aimed at undermining
security and stability in the region, would not be accepted under
any pretext.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher, who was the first
Jordanian ambassador to Israel, also denounced the explosion in
Jerusalem and described it as a terrorist act that would endanger
peace talks in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan and Israel would cooperate to fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The bombing is the third terrorist attack against Israelis in a
week by Palestinian militant group Hamas. Twenty-six Israelis were
killed in last Sunday's two suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
The latest bombings prompted calls by Israeli President Ezer
Weizman and others for suspending peace talks with the
Palestinians, and also raised doubts on the future peace process
as Israeli politicians are entering an election campaign focusing
on how far the peace talks should go.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Airline to Launch New Flight Services to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan national airline
Ariana will launch new international flight services to China,
according to a report from Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Feda Fedawi, the acting president of Ariana,
as saying in Kabul today that Ariana will begin flying to Urumqi,
capital of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, within three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Fedawi said the twice-weekly service between Kabul and Urumqi
was due to begin last Friday but was postponed because of
administrative snags.
</P>
<P>
"We have already reached formal agreement with the Chinese
authorities to fly there," he added.
</P>
<P>
On this route, Soviet-built TU 154 and US-made Boeing 727 jets
will be used to take passengers and cargo to Urumqi via the Uzbek
capital of Tashkent or the Kazakh capital of Alma-Ata where the
airliners will be refueled, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, an official from the
Chinese Embassy in Islamabad confirmed the forthcoming opening of
the air corridor between Urumqi and Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The official said China had allowed Ariana to send cargo
flights to Urumqi but the issue of passenger flights was still
under discussion due to some technical problems, such as visa.
</P>
<P>
China has not reopened its embassy in Kabul yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
As well, it is impossible for the China Xinjiang Airline to fly
to Kabul at present mainly because of the unsafety there, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The final date for opening the air route is also under
discussion now," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the China Xinjiang Airline's office in Islamabad
told Xinhua by telephone that the Airline is reviewing the
possibility of flying to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, so far, Ariana is allowed to fly unscheduled
charter plane to Urumqi," a staff member said.
</P>
<P>
Before Afghanistan was gripped by the civil war in 1992, Ariana
had regular flights to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Moscow, Prague,
Tashkent and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Fedawi said Ariana currently runs only one overseas route to
New Delhi.

<HEADLINE> 20 Million Yuan Tibetan Craftwork Makes Public Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 Tibetan religious
believers today celebrated the completion of a 20-million yuan
Tangka, a kind of scroll painting, typical of Tibetan style.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony held in Lhasa's Potala Palace Square, some
Tibetan religious believers threw white hada, pieces of silk used
as greeting gifts. Their gifts were directed at the colorful
three-ton Tangka as it was being carried by about 100 monks and
laymen walking towards the square's exhibition place. It was the
first time that the work had been seen in public.
</P>
<P>
The Tangka, the largest of its kind in Tibet, measures 45
meters in height and 35 meters in width.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the major Tibetan cultural and handicraft
articles, scheduled for an exhibition in the United States later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Pictures of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, and founding
members of five Tibetan religious sects, are part of the 20 woven
figures in the Tangka.
</P>
<P>
Langje Wangjiu, general manager of Tibetan Handicraft and
Tourist Product Development Company, said it took Tibetan
handicraft masters 15 months to finish the Tangka, designed and
drawn by Zhaxi Cering and Danba Raidan.
</P>
<P>
The product was jointly made by the company and the Lhasa
Municipal Foreign Trade Company.
</P>
<P>
Bomi Qambalozhub, a famous living buddha in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, and nine other senior monks, also participated
in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, 60 pupils and cultural workers performed
local drama and dances.

<HEADLINE> Tenth Warm Winter in a Row For Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has enjoyed
another warm winter, with the temperature dipping below ten
degrees Celsius on only one day, said the city's meteorological
bureau today.
</P>
<P>
This has been Beijing's tenth consecutive warm winter since
1986, and it comes as no surprise, say experts, in view of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
However, more use of cars and freezing facilities also added to
the warm winter because of the so-called greenhouse effect, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
Experts sat it is natural to have warm winter periods lasting
for about ten years. The previous run of warm winters in Beijing
was in the 1920s, but it's difficult to estimate when the current
period of warm winters will end.
</P>
<P>
Farmers do not like warm winters because of the droughts they
usually bring, but well-built water facilities have helped ensure
good harvests in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing enjoyed a record bumper harvest last year, despite the
second most severe drought since 1949.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Ramos hails Asia-Europe Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the two-day Asia-Europe meeting has laid the
foundation for a strong partnership between the two continents and
should be allowed to give an impetus to the momentum of increased
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued upon his arrival in Cebu city from
Thailand, Ramos said he was most encouraged by the emphasis given
by the leaders of Asia and Europe on the need to enhance
people-to-people relations between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
He said the call for closer people-to-people ties between Asia
and Europe is not only timely but it also focuses on the real
issue of the Asia-Europe meeting (ASEM) -- the people.
</P>
<P>
It is time to make full use of the gains of the Bangkok meeting
to foster enthusiasm among the people of Asia and Europe and
encourage their direct participation in breaking down the
cultural, geographical and physical barriers and paving the way
for a people-led growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Asians should dispel fears of protectionism that has
kept their products and services from gaining niches in the
European market.
</P>
<P>
Europeans, he added, should concretize their realization of
Asia as the most viable alternative to Europe's traditional
markets by implementing action programs outlined in the European
union's "new Asia policy."
</P>
<P>
Ramos returned to Manila tonight.

SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-five percent of companies
in Shanghai have obtained unemployment insurance cover over the
past ten years, according to the city's labor bureau.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Shanghai government paid nearly 100 million yuan
as subsidies to about 600,000 workers. The subsidies are of great
significance to ensure social stability, said Ying Hongqing, an
official with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
He explained that workers are entitled to state welfare for up
to two years after they become jobless, and during that period
they must receive employment guidance and training from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment subsidies will be stopped for people who turn down
state offers three times without appropriate reasons, he said.

Fumio Watanabe, deputy secretary general of the organizing

The comment came after a trouble weekend of World Cup skiing on

<P>
Leading skiers supported the FIS, saying that the 2,920-meter
Olympic downhill course was too short. They also demanded the
120-meter start point be raised to 1,800 meters.

But this would deteriorate a national park and faces strong

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Privatized Bank Earns Good Profit in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Muslim Commercial Bank
(MCB), the first privatized bank in Pakistan, has absorbed
deposits of over 100 billion rupees (2.9 billion US dollars)
during 1995, the bank's president said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters here, MCB President Husain Lawai
said the bank's deposits were 27 billion rupees (783 million
dollars) at the time of its privatization.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also recovered inherited non-performing loans of
1.2 billion rupees (34.8 million dollars) and realized a profit of
700 million rupees (20.3 million dollars) since it was privatized
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said around 40 billion rupees (1.16 billion dollars) were
advanced during 1995 and the recovery ratio against the current
advances was 100 percent as loans were extended purely on the
merit basis.
</P>
<P>
Targets of deposits, advances and profits for 1996 were fixed
at 123 billion rupees (3.57 billion dollars), 60 billion rupees
(1.74 billion dollars) and 1.2 billion rupees (34.8 million
dollars) respectively, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lawai said the bank was pursuing the policy of effective
monitoring, merit and feasibility regarding credit and advances.
</P>
<P>
The MCB was privatized in accordance with Pakistan's ambitious
privatization process which began in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The United Bank Limited, the second largest commercial bank in
the country, was privatized last month according to Pakistan's
privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
Eight state-owned enterprises will be put on sale this year
according to the timetable.

<HEADLINE> China Climbs World Economic Ladder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China is nudging towards becoming
one of the world's top-ten trading countries, as its economy
continues to soar.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years China's position in world trading rose
from 15th place to number 11.
</P>
<P>
The past five years has seen a China more open to the world,
and a Chinese economy more closely involved in the international
division of labor and trade.
</P>
<P>
Information, provided by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, shows that China's imports and exports
totalled 1,010 billion US dollars in the five years from 1991 to
1995. It was more than double the results of the previous five
years.
</P>
<P>
The export structure of China has undergone an encouraging
change. In 1995, manufactured products accounted for as much as
85.6 percent of the nation's total exports, which is 11.1
percentage points up from 1990.
</P>
<P>
China is now the number one developing nation in the world in
terms of its overseas investment. In the past five years, the
country approved 229,800 overseas-funded projects and used 114.7
billion US dollars of overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
A more significant fact is that more and more overseas
investment is flowing to fields encouraged by the Chinese
government, such as infrastructure and basic industry departments.
</P>
<P>
While importing technology and equipment from 30 countries and
regions worldwide, China itself exported eight billion US dollars
worth of technology to 50 countries and regions in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that rate of interdependence of China's GDP
and its imports and exports value has approached 50 percent, which
means that nearly half of the Chinese economy is related to the
international market.
</P>
<P>
China's opening drive has spread from coastal areas to the
relatively backward hinterlands. The country now has 1,194 counties
and cities open to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The open policy has also been extended to greater
depths. Sino-overseas co-operation used to concentrate on
commodities trade, technology import and joint ventures. Now it is
expanding to service sectors.
</P>
<P>
China is even emerging as an international capital exporter and
is taking a more active role in international capital operations.

computer has escalated at an unprecedented rate, with demand
showing a 200 per cent increase for the past two years, In 1995
around 1.8 million computers were bought.
</P>
<P>
Six per cent of homes in Beijing have computers, and the ratio
is as high as one third among employees of China Science and
Technology University in Hefei, capital city of Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that surging computer enthusiasm is driven by
both rapidly developed application functions of computers for
personal life, and a desire by parents to invest in the education
of their children.
</P>
<P>
But a computer operating capability has been set by many
institutions as one of the basic requirements of employees.
</P>
<P>
Computer skills will even be judged through a computer
proficiency test, an official examination first launched by the
country's education bureaus at the start of 1990s. Now the test
has been developed into a nationwide standard.
</P>
<P>
As a catalyst, the pressure of the examination has prompted a
purchase motive among millions of 'computer illiterates'.
</P>
<P>
To lubricate his night work at home, architect Mr. Wu, from
Anhui Province, is planning to buy a Pentium-based PC, even though
his employer has installed a computer in his office.
</P>
<P>
"The PC has cost me my life savings, but I believe it will earn
more money for me," he said, without concealing his confidence.
</P>
<P>
Dropping a years-old pen-writing habit, Professor Pan of the
Nanjing University is another keyboard convert. His writing speed
has improved dramatically since he said a fond farewell to his
inkpot. Dozens of his academic works have been published he
joined in the computer stampede.
</P>
<P>
However, in most families, the computer's top priority is to
aid children's education. So, the "Study Machine," a simplified
computer, equipped with education software, is now increasingly
popular.
</P>
<P>
With a massive TV advertising campaign on broadcast every
evening by hundreds of television stations in China, the machine
has registered skyrocketing sales.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the computer will turn into another
indispensable electronic appliance for Chinese families, in
addition to the refrigerator, color television and washing machine.
</P>
<P>
The PC market can hardly wait for old style writing methods
to 'byte' the dust in favor of computers . The market is predicted
to develop along with the economic take-off among the world's
largest population.
</P>
<P>
So far, big-name overseas giants, such as AST, Hewlett-Packard
and Compaq, have become involved in the battle for a bigger market
share, with their domestic rivals, including Stone, Founder and
Legend, determined to win a slice of the action.

<HEADLINE> Teaching Earns Top Marks Among Guangzhou Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Teaching has become a popular
job again for college senior students in Guangzhou, capital city
of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Many are now busy seeking jobs in schools and colleges before
their graduation this July.
</P>
<P>
At a recent interview conference many college students crowded
information desks of local education bureaus from different
districts.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Education Bureau of Baiyun District said
that in the first 30 minutes of an interview program, he received
over 20 application forms filled out by students from a number of
well-known universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Huang Shan, a female student at Beijing Chemical Engineering
University, handed in her form applying to teach chemistry in a
middle school.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the official had to turn down her application,
telling her that only graduates from teachers' universities or
colleges were wanted this time.
</P>
<P>
"Both of my parents are teachers and I always dreamt of being a
teacher," Huang told Xinhua, adding that she now wished she would
be a student at a teachers' university.
</P>
<P>
Teaching become more and more attractive thanks to increasing
wages, better housing conditions and a higher social
status in recent years, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Ye Shixiong, director of the city's education bureau, said that
they planned to employ post-graduates as middle school teachers
with an aim to further promote education.
</P>
<P>
At another interview conference in the Teachers' University of
South China, in one hour, some 4,000 students actively consulted
many educational bodies in both urban and rural areas in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Among the students, 98 from Xinxing County, a less
developed area, were willing to go back their hometown as teachers.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hongxiu, a student who majored in English at Shaoguan
University, gave up other favorable jobs, and volunteered to teach
English in a country middle school.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the provincial employment office showed that of
12 regular social professions in Guangdong, teaching has so far
ranked fifth in terms of salary and living conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today announced his decision to
outlaw armed groups of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and
the Islamic Jihad, following his condemnment of this morning's
bombing attack in Jerusalem, which killed 19 people.
</P>
<P>
An armed group of the Palestine National Liberation Movement
(Fatah), led by Arafat, and a group of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine are also among those outlawed, according
to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a string of bombing attacks which started
last Sunday. Israel has repeatedly requested that Palestine takes
concrete measures to ban armed factions in the Palestinian
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that a convoy of armed personnel carriers, led
by Arafat, rolled through Gaza shortly after Arafat's
announcement, ready to take action against the outlawed armed
groups.
</P>
<P>
A huge bomb exploded on an Israeli public bus in downtown
Jerusalem, at around 6:35 a.m. local time (04:35 GMT) today, just
a week after a similar attack here last Sunday.

<HEADLINE> State Assets Totals 4,292 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's State assets have grown at
an average rate of 18 percent during 1991-1995, according to the
State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey of State assets conducted during the
five-year period shows that, by the end of last year, State assets
had totalled 4,292.9 billion yuan (5,172 billion US dollars),
nearly double the figure for the previous five years (1986-1990).
</P>
<P>
The statistics were based on a national survey, the country's
fifth, of 830,000 administrative units and institutions, 305,000
State-owned enterprises, and 24,000 financial firms at and above
county level.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the fixed assets investment by
State-owned units accounts for at least 70 percent of the
country's annual total.
</P>
<P>
State-owned companies also account for at least 65 percent of
the country's enterprise-controlled total assets.
</P>
<P>
Experts described China's establishment of State assets
evaluation system during 1991-1995 as another breakthrough in the
management of State assets.
</P>
<P>
During the period, China set up an asset appraisal and
evaluation administration system, with about 30,000 employees in
2,394 asset evaluation organizations, authorized by the State
asset administration departments, at central and provincial levels.
</P>
<P>
China also started its management work of non-business State
assets and overseas State assets, such as forest, land, coal, gold
and coast resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani left Kabul today for an official visit to neighboring
Iran, said a report from the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman was quoted as saying, "The aim of
President Rabbani's trip is to boost bilateral relations between
Afghanistan and Iran."
</P>
<P>
The visit, at the invitation of the Iranian government, is
Rabbani's second official one to that country since he came to
power four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This is a routine visit to a friendly neighbor and the
continuing high-level shuttle diplomacy which we started a few
months ago and we have found to be useful," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The trip comes after Iran sponsored and organized a "frenetic"
round of inter-Afghan peace negotiations aimed at finding a
peaceful solution to the long-running civil war, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Allauddin Brojerdi has shuttled
between the bases of the Afghan factional leaders trying to broker
peace pacts between the country's warring groups.
</P>
<P>
The Afghanistan's Presidential sources also confirmed that
Rabbani and his 60-member delegation will also visit the central
Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan during the tour of
the region.
</P>
<P>
"The central Asian leg of the trip is to cement our ties with
our northern neighbors with whom we enjoy good relations," one
official said.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how long the president's trip would last, but
the report said the visit might also take him to the former Soviet
republic of Kazakhstan.

problems, including repetitive imports, blind development and
doing things for the sake of laurels rather than effects.
</P>

"If such problems are not solved, a smooth and sound

importance to agriculture in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan has provided great opportunities for
private entrepreneurs to develop farming and agrobusiness, he
said. With greater input and the introduction of international
capital, China can expect, before the year 2000, to make a giant
step forward in agriculture and solve many rural problems,
including the elimination of poverty, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Eighth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCCC) gave free comments on China's
development plans before the annual session of the committee
opened here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining an annual eight percent growth rate for the
national economy in the next five years is appropriate, enough for
a quadrupling of China's 1980 GNP by the year 2000," said Dai
Yuanchen, an economist from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to contain inflation to around ten percent but
it is a difficult task, he said.
</P>
<P>
"People should not expect excessively high growth rates while
hoping for low inflation," he said. "We should learn a lesson from
past economic heating."
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't praise local officials who use operational
capital for capital construction. Instead, they should be removed
from office, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daming, chairman of the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee,
calls for quickly effecting a shift from a planned economy to a
socialist market economy and from simple capital
construction-created growth to growth brought about mainly by
management improvements and technological advances.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, many deep-rooted problems hindering China's
economic progress cannot be solved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also emphasized the importance of improving ethnics. "We
should draw a lesson from the corruption cases of Chen Xitong and
Wang Baosen," he said. Chen is the ousted secretary of the CPC
Beijing Municipal Committee and Wang was a vice mayor of Beijing
who committed suicide before investigations began into his
economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
"The Beijing municipal government should free itself quickly
of any negative impact of the cases and build the capital into a
model city," he said.

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A growing form of horsepower is
helping China's rural communities -- trucks and cars.
</P>
<P>
So many farmers are taking to the road that vehicle makers are
pondering on whether to accelerate production.
</P>
<P>
The country's Ministry of Machinery has confirmed that demand
in rural areas is growing rapidly..
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that consumption levels of Chinese farmers is
rising rapidly with the development of the rural economy. Many richer
farmers want to own vehicles to solve their transport problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the development of township enterprises has injected
vigor to vehicle production.
</P>
<P>
An investigation shows that the transport volume per
100,000-yuan worth of output for a township enterprise is around
50 tons.
</P>
<P>
These township enterprises, with their transport volumes
ranging each day from several hundreds kilograms to more than ten
tons, are showing interest in light-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
The development of self-employed households in rural areas has
also become a strong driving force for vehicle production.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has nearly 24.4 million
self-employed specialized households. Analysts noted that their
demands for light-duty trucks should be met by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the ministry show that sales of
agricultural-vehicles soared to 2.2 million units last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Yellow River Dries Up In Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A stretch of China's famous
Yellow River has dried up completely because of drought conditions
caused by a lack of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Drought officials stepped in with an order to the Sanmenxia
Reservoir in the middle reaches of the river to increase its
discharge of water. They say it will help quench a serious drought
in downstream provinces of Henan and Shandong.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir authority in Henan raised the discharge flow at
the weekend from 800 cubic meters per second to 1,000, in
accordance with an order of the Yellow River Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The unusually light rainfall in the past few months has caused
a serious drought in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
On February 15, the Lijin Hydrometric Station recorded that the
river bed was dry, the first time in the history of the Yellow
River that this had happened so early in the year. The station is
104 kilometers from the mouth of the river.
</P>
<P>
The start of the irrigation season was given as one of the
causes.
</P>
<P>
The drying of the river seriously affected industrial and
farming production in Dongying City, Binzhou Prefecture and the
Zhongyuan Oil Fields in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The authorities expect that the Yellow River will be flowing
again in seven to 10 days, after water levels increase from the
reservoir discharges and a restriction on irrigation systems.

<P>
PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette today strongly condemned the latest bomb attack on an
Israeli public bus in Jerusalem which killed at least 20 people
and injured more than 10 others early this morning.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued shortly after the attack, the minister
said that terrorism must be fought and that France stands by
Israel at this testing time, which posed the latest challenge for
the fragile peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added that his country is convinced that
this terrorist attack cannot jeopardize the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A huge bomb exploded on an Israeli public bus in the center of
Jerusalem at around 6:35 local time (0435 GMT), just a week after
a similar attack there last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated that this is another suicide bombing
attack on an Israeli public bus. An armed group of the Islamic
Resistance Movement HAMAS has claimed responsibility for the bomb
attack.

China's Purple Mountain Observatory, was named today after the
Chinese city of Quanzhou.
</P>
<P>
The naming ceremony was held at the seventh anniversary of the

<HEADLINE> Experts' Forum: Wang Meng on Building of Cultural Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's Note: Beginning today, Xinhua opens a column for those
experts and scholars, who are attending the annual sessions of the
National People's Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), to air
their views on the country's medium- and long-term development
programs.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Wang Meng, a noted Chinese writer
and a member of the CPPCC National Committee, urged China's
decision-making bodies to consider ways of turning the country
into a leading culture power.
</P>
<P>
With a large population, China still has a long way to go to
catch up with developed countries with regard to per-capita output
value, but it can play a role in the international community no
other countries can match with its splendid culture, said Wang
Meng, who is vice-chairman of the China Writers' Association.
</P>
<P>
"China should take economic development as the central link,
for a nation's poor economic strength will lead to lax and weak
cohesiveness culturally and its cultural image will be no good
either," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, a nation's cultural level is also an
important indication to social progress and people's life quality.
Developed countries in history and the present superpowers have
never neglected the impact of culture, the influence of mass media
in particular, apart from their economic and military might, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
By building China into a country with splendid culture, it is
meant that the country should give scope to its traditional
potentials and advantages as a nation with ancient civilizations,
he said, adding that a nation's cultural achievements can depart
neither from its traditions nor from its emulation and exchanges
with other nations.
</P>
<P>
"You eat pork, and you will fill out flesh but not pork," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The more we carry forward the nation's traditional culture,
the more daring we should be to learn all useful things from other
countries," Wang said. "What we have learned for our own use will
surely show our own Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Wang, 62, was a former member of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee and ex-minister of culture.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some people in China are now tending to neglect the
protection of the Chinese national culture and folklore culture,
he called for measures to be taken to solve the problems from the
angle of the nation's construction of culture.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia To Speed Up Studies On Asia-Europe Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian prime minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that his country would speed up
efforts to coordinate studies on the laying of the railway track
that will run across Asia and link it to the trans-European rail
track.
</P>
<P>
After arriving back from the inaugural Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) which ended in Bangkok yesterday, Mahathir said the meeting
appointed Malaysia as the coordinator for project studies on the
rail link, as ASEM did not have a secretariat or special body to
implement the plan.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the task of coordinating the studies would take a
long time because there were many aspects that must be taken into
account such as the type of trains to be used (electric or
fuel-engined) and the costs.
</P>
<P>
"The project not only covers the stretch from Singapore to
China but it also runs across Europe. We must know what are the
existing facilities that can be used and what needs to be studied
as well as which are the points that need to be linked," Mahathir
explained.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said that he was satisfied with what had been
accomplished at the ASEM because several recommendations by
Malaysia had been accepted such as the creation of an Asia-Europe
University.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government Accused of Arresting Rwandan Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
accused Kenya of arresting its diplomat in Nairobi, saying it
violated the Vienna Convention on diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Government arrested Francis Mugabo, diplomat of the
Rwandan Embassy in Nairobi on February 26 for being prime suspect
in an attempted murder of former Rwandan Interior Minister Senda
Shonga Seth exiling in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Senda Shonga Seth was sacked last August after he complained
of increasing detentions of Hutus by the present Tutsi-led
government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Friday, Kenya's Attorney General Ammos Wako
said that Mugabo was arrested at the spot moments after Senda
Shonga Seth had been shot. Mugabo was found to be in possession
of a pistol and 13 rounds of 9 mm ammunition when the he was put
under arrest, Wako added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued yesterday, Charge d' Affaires of the
Rwandan embassy Pierre Hakizimana said Mugabo was arrested by the
Kenyan police and his residence was looted. The diplomat was
still under police custody, he said.
</P>
<P>
"That violation of the immunity of the person and his
residence is a serious transgression of the Vienna Convention in
its Articles 29, 30 and 31," Hakizimana said.

Manila, march 3 (Xinhua) -- child abuse cases in the
Philippines rose by nearly 200 percent in the past five years with
sexual abuse on top of the list, according to the Department of
Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the DSWD recorded only 785 cases of child abuse, but
the number climbed to 2,016 last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure, however, is limited only to cases reported to the
DSWD and does not include those reported to the police and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,016 cases, 1,500 involve sexual abuse, 70 percent of
which are incest and rape cases.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the number of cases of sexual abuse involving children
was only about 200.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, child abuse includes pedophilia, rape, sexual
exploitation, incest, maltreatment, labor exploitation and child
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> More Dolphins Seen Swimming Near HK' New Airport Construction Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- There could be four times more
dolphins swimming off Lantau Island, which is near Hong Kong's new
airport construction site, according to the local newspaper South
China Morning Post today.
</P>
<P>
Marine expert Tom Jefferson, research associate of the Ocean
Park Conservation Foundation, was quoted by the paper as saying
that there were likely to be more than 230 Chinese white dolphins
near the north Lantau coast, compared to initial estimates of
about 80.
</P>
<P>
Chinese white dolphins have been categorized as among the
endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists who fear that the dolphin community was
endangered by the construction of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok,
have been campaigning for their protection.
</P>
<P>
The finding was done in a two-year survey project financed by
the Airport Authority and the Agriculture and Fishery Department,
which began in September.
</P>
<P>
Jefferson said the apparent discrepancy was due to different
survey methods and did not mean the number of animals had
increased. He held it was "too early" to asses whether the number
of dolphins had increased or decreased.
</P>
<P>
Researchers patrolled the north Lantau coast by boat and
recorded all dolphin sightings since November. Jefferson then
carried out a computer analysis of the figures using international
standards of animal behavior to estimate how many more dolphins
were in the survey area.
</P>
<P>
His assessment, which has just been completed, was based on
more scientific evidence than the earlier estimates, compiled from
photographs of dolphins with individual characteristics identified
by researchers.

MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine exports to Japan reached
2.75 billion US dollars in 1995, 35 percent up from the previous
year's level of 2.04 billion US dollars.
</P>

According to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Japan,

The country's largest market is still the United States, which
covered 35.3 percent of the total Philippine exports last year.
</P>
<P>
DTI officials said that several factors both in the Philippines
and in Japan contributed to the rise in exports.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the coordinated efforts by the government and
the private sector improved the competitiveness of Philippine
export products.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, they added, the strong yen encouraged importation and
the transfer of Japanese production facilities overseas.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks Foreign Experts' Help in Road Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it would
seek the help of foreign road safety experts in drawing up a more
effective safety program for the country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik told the press here
that the services of experts from several countries which had
successfully carried out such programs were sought to help the
Malaysian government in its program to raise road users' awareness
of safe driving.
</P>
<P>
Ling said foreign countries, like Australia, could give ideas
on road safety which had been successfully implemented in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia now is among the high traffic accident rate countries.
Commenting on the rise in the number of traffic accidents in the
country which reached 14,930 cases in January compared with 13,376
cases a year earlier, Ling said the campaign for road safety
carried out by the government had failed to heighten drivers'
awareness of safe driving.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has expressed dismay
at the high traffic accident rate in the country, and said the
government would take more effective measures to penalize those
who persist in flouting at traffic regulations.

MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev, who was ready to leave for Chechnya, said yesterday that
he would like to hold direct talks with Chechen rebel leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev, reported NTV, a private Russian television
station.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Grachev reiterated that Moscow's stand that Chechnya
is part of Russian territory would not change.
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks indicated a somewhat softened stance of
the Russian government, which had refused to hold direct talks
with Dudayev on many occasions since the Chechen crisis broke out
more than 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
With the voice for ending the war with Chechnya becoming
increasingly louder, President Boris Yeltsin has professed
recently to unveil new plans for a peaceful settlement of the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Ensure Good Agricultural Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council, the highest
governing organ in the country, has issued a circular, urging
governments at all levels to do a good job in the present spring
sowing to ensure this year's agricultural harvest.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, issued yesterday and made public today, the
State Council said that to ensure a successful spring sowing for
this year's good harvest is an "overriding task". It called on
local governments to keep a sober mind to the problems and
difficulties in the present rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that the present agricultural and rural
conditions are pretty good, adding that farmers' enthusiasm for
agricultural production has been brought into play by higher
purchasing prices of grain, acreage of over-wintering crops
increased and good progress made in the winter construction season
of water conservancy projects. The standing crops are growing
well, it added.
</P>
<P>
But there are still some problems in the present spring sowing
and rural economy that must not be overlooked, such as low
temperature in the southern part of China and drought in the
north, which seriously impacted the spring sowing.
</P>
<P>
The circular said farmers in some areas experienced
difficulties in sales of their grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops,
and other major agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The high prices of major agricultural means of product, such as
chemical fertilizers, and the still heavy burden for farmers in
some areas also impacted present rural economy negatively.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill this year's agricultural target, the circular called
on the local governments and concerned departments to keep
sober-mined on the present drought in the north, and to spare no
efforts to enlarge the irrigation area and adopt water-saving
measures.
</P>
<P>
The supply of agricultural means of product, such as chemical
fertilizers, must be guaranteed, the circular said, adding that
the fertilizer plants should operate at full capacity.

<HEADLINE> Session of Top Advisory Body Opens (Detailed) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Session of the Eighth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the country's top advisory body, opened here
this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,862 of the 2,111 members of the CPPCC National Committee
attended the opening meeting, presided over by Li Ruihuan,
chairman of the committee. Also present were leaders of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the state Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,
Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, of whom many
are experienced officials and well-known professionals and
scholars, will participate in the deliberations and administration
of state affairs, including the formulation of China's medium- and
long-term development plans.
</P>
<P>
The members will review the Work Report of the Standing
Committee of the CPPCC National Committee delivered this afternoon
by Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the Eighth National Committee of
CPPCC, according to the session agenda.
</P>
<P>
They will also be present at the Fourth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), the top legislature, and elect
a new vice-chairman for the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the work of the Standing Committee of the
CPPCC National Committee, Ye Xuanping said that the Standing
Committee has over the past year worked hard for the
standardization and systemization of its work in the fields of
political consultations, democratic supervision and participation
in the administration of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee, he said, has offered many constructive
views on major state policies. Many of them, he said, concern two
documents of the Communist Party: a proposal for formulating the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for national economic and social
development, and China's long-term development target for the year
2010, which were adopted last fall at the Fifth Plenary Session of
the 14th Central Committee of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee has received a total of 2,377 motions
from National Committee members since March last year, Ye said.
"These motions are a timely reflection of popular aspirations and
serve as important reference for decision making by the central
authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Special committees of the CPPCC National Committee have
sponsored 41 special research programs and produced 30 research
reports since a year ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, according to Ye, the CPPCC National Committee
held a series of activities to mark the 50th anniversary of
Chinese victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression, and its Standing Committee also worked hard promoting
the peaceful reunification of the motherland and enhancing its
links with compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the National Committee of the CPPCC had
established exchanges with 79 organizations in 61 countries,
according to Ye, who said CPPCC will do a better job this year.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic envoys from a number of countries were present as
observers at this afternoon's opening session. About 600
reporters including those from overseas covered the session.
</P>
<P>
After the conclusion of the opening session, Chairman Li
Ruihuan and Vice-Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Yang Rudai
and Wang Zhaoguo met with new National Committee members and had
a photo taken with them.

<HEADLINE> 18 Killed, 10 Wounded in Another Jerusalem Bombing Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a bombing
attack on a No.18 bus in the center of Jerusalem has risen to 18
with 10 more others wounded, according to an Israeli police
officer at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated that this is an another suicide
bombing attack on an Israeli public bus, just a week after the
twin bombing attacks last Sunday in Jerusalem and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack occurred around 6:35 a.m. local time (04:35
GMT) on the city's Jaffa Street, near the Central Post Office,
when the No.18 bus was traveling toward the Central Bus Station.
</P>
<P>
The bus was totally destroyed by the bomb, and other vehicles
and shops near the bus were also seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the scene, and the usually busy Jaffa Street
has been close to all traffic, ambulances rushed to the scene to
rescue the terrified wounded people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who is scheduled to chair
a weekly cabinet meeting today to discuss the situation following
last Sunday's attacks, also went to scene under heavy security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some dozens of people already gathered by the site
of the scene, chanting anti-government and anti-peace process
slogans.
</P>
<P>
Israel had imposed a total closure on West Bank and the Gaza
Strip following last Sunday's bombing attacks, which left 28
people dead, including two suicide bombers and 84 others wounded,
to prevent further violent attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
All negotiations with the Palestinians have also been halted,
and Israel has been pressing the Palestinian National Authority to
crack down Islamic extremists inside the Palestinian autonomous
area.
</P>
<P>
However, the bomb had again been brought to the center of
Jerusalem this morning and exploded exactly on the same street and
the same No.18 bus, and almost at the same time.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Vice-President Advocates Free Land Acquisition From Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-president Joshua
Nkomo said at a rally yesterday that time had now come for the
government to acquire land from the whites without having to buy
it because ''Cecil John Rhodes did not buy it''.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo told the gathering that he and Minister of Lands and
Water Resources Kangai had been tasked by President Mugabe, to
find ways of how land could be acquired to resettle the landless
blacks.
</P>
<P>
''We are going to move right round the country, to assess how
much land is owned by the whites and how much is in the hands of
the blacks. We want to address the imbalance where the whites who
are so few, own vast tracts of land when the black people have
none." he said.
</P>
<P>
" We are not saying the whites should leave
the country, but we want them to share the fertile land with the
black people,''he added.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said he saw no reason why the government should buy the
land from the whites when ''even Rhodes did not buy it'', adding
that although the laws of the country required that the land
should be bought, he was of the opinion that it should be
acquired for free.
</P>
<P>
''If we fail to use the laws of the land in trying to acquire
land for resettling our people, we will resort to the means we
used to attain our independence,'' Nkomo added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Firms Urged To Accommodate Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- It is time for foreign-owned firms
to change their stance and accommodate black people whom they
currently view as a threat to established (multi-national)
businesses, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
Rounding up his two-day campaign tour in central Zimbabwe's
Masvingo Province, Mugabe said that skilled Zimbabweans could be
allowed to buy into specialized firms in fields of mining,
manufacturing or agro-based.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who asked for a fresh mandate to push these programs
through, appealed to multi-national corporations to consider
offering partnerships to black entrepreneurs and help end whites'
stranglehold on the economy.
</P>
<P>
''We do not intend to grab these firms, but are simply asking
them (multi-nationals) to right a wrong by giving some shares to
their employees and allowing other indigenous Zimbabweans to buy
into the firms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He also unveiled plans to open dialogue with large
multi-national firms in the hope of persuading them to sell
shares to employees and indigenous businessmen--in a fresh
government attempt to empower blacks economically.

HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has challenged young professionals in the country to be patriotic
and take up jobs in rural areas where their services are needed
most.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in central Zimbabwe's Masvingo Province
yesterday, Mugabe said he was disappointed that young Zimbabweans
in teaching and nursing professions including doctors, were
reluctant to work in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very disappointing after building such a big
district hospital as the one government is building at Mwenezi to
see that no-one wants to work there,'' said Mugabe, adding that
some of the excuses given for shunning the rural areas were
flimsy.
</P>
<P>
"If with their expertise and knowledge they do not want to
work in rural areas, who is going to work in these places?"
</P>
<P>
"What does it take to dedicate oneself? If the missionaries
and expatriates could do it, some of them are even prepared to
die in these foreign lands, why can't we do the same?" asked
mugabe.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Poll In S.Leone To Go Into Second Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 3 (Xinhua) - Sierra Leone's presidential
elections will go into a second round because none of the
candidates emerged the outright winner, the Electoral Commission
has announced.
</P>
<P>
The elections, held last Monday and Tuesday, were the west
African nation's first multi-party poll since 1967.
</P>
<P>
"None of the candidates obtained the 55 percent as required by
decree and the constitution. As a result there will have to be a
runoff," the Head of the Interim National Electoral Commission,
James Jonah, said in a broadcast on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jonah said the leader of the Sierra Leone People's Party
(SLPP), the oldest in the country, won the most votes but not
enough for an outright victory.
</P>
<P>
SLPP leader Ahmad Tejan Kabbah won 35.8 percent of the votes
and will face his nearest rival, John Karefa-Smart of the United
National People's Party (UNPP), who had 22.6 percent, in the
runoff.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, the runoff should take place within
two weeks of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Jonah said five of the 13 parties that contested the elections
would be represented in the 80-seat assembly on a proportional
basis.
</P>
<P>
The SLPP also topped the parliamentary poll with 36.1 percent
of votes, followed by UNPP with 21.6 percent. The other three are
the People's Democratic Party with 15.3 percent, the All People's
Congress (APC) with 5.7 percent and the National Unity Party
(NUP) 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the (electoral) decree, the parties require a
threshold of five percent to be represented in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Jonah said that about 60 percent of those eligible voted, an
impressive turnout for a country where much of the interior has
been cut off by five years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I have already today conveyed these results to the head of
state. The electoral commission will soon meet the chairman (head of
state) to discuss the arrangements for a runoff," he said.

<HEADLINE> 20 Killed, 10 Wounded in Another Jerusalem Bombing Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a bombing
attack on a No.18 bus in the center of Jerusalem has risen to 20
with 10 more others wounded, according to an Israeli police
officer at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated that this is an another suicide
bombing attack on an Israeli public bus, just a week after the
twin bombing attacks last Sunday in Jerusalem and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack occurred around 6:35 a.m. local time (04:35
GMT) on the city's Jaffa Street, near the Central Post Office,
when the No.18 bus was traveling toward the Central Bus Station.
</P>
<P>
The bus was totally destroyed by the bomb, and other vehicles
and shops near the bus were also seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the scene, and the usually busy Jaffa Street
has been close to all traffic, ambulances rushed to the scene to
rescue the terrified wounded people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who is scheduled to chair
a weekly cabinet meeting today to discuss the situation following
last Sunday's attacks, also went to scene under heavy security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some dozens of people already gathered by the site
of the scene, chanting anti-government and anti-peace process
slogans.
</P>
<P>
Israel had imposed a total closure on West Bank and the Gaza
Strip following last Sunday's bombing attacks, which left 28
people dead, including two suicide bombers and 84 others wounded,
to prevent further violent attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
All negotiations with the Palestinians have also been halted,
and Israel has been pressing the Palestinian National Authority to
crack down Islamic extremists inside the Palestinian autonomous
area.
</P>
<P>
However, the bomb had again been brought to the center of
Jerusalem this morning and exploded exactly on the same street and
the same No.18 bus, and almost at the same time.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) - Talks to end civil war in Sierra
Leone broke off in Abidjan on Saturday and leaders of the
government and rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
were due to meet to try to resolve differences, said reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been bogged down over the RUF's refusal to
recognise civilian-rule elections held in the west African
country this week.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official of the Cote D'ivoire government,
which is hosting the talks, as confirming the meeting had ended
and a communique would be issued on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Sierra Leonean military government and
the RUF began talks for the first time on February 25 to seek an
end to five years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The talks were quickly deadlocked over the refusal of the RUF
to recognize elections held in Sierra Leone on Monday and Tuesday
to end the military rule, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The RUF wanted elections delayed until the conclusion of
negotiations,but the government said it could not decree a delay
of the polling, which was set by a national consultative forum.
</P>
<P>
The RUF in turn refused in talks to agree to a ceasefire and
said it will not recognizse or cooperate with a civilian
government that emerges from elections.

<HEADLINE> China's Shirt Industry Sees Rapid Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China developed an annual capacity
of making 1.25 billion shirts during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995) to become the world's leading shirt producer.
</P>
<P>
Along with the growth of the whole garment industry, the shirt
sector has become a major profit-maker for the state's treasury,
and registered a year-on-year increase in foreign currency earning
as well, said Dong Binggen, general manager of China National
Garment Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the shirt exports account for 18 per cent of that
of the whole garment industry, according to Dong.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the transformation process from a
labor-intensive industry to a technology and capital-intensive one
was accelerated along with a number of large conglomerates taking
shape within the sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, a dozen enterprises, including Shanghai's Kaikai,
Youngor and Wild Wind Groups of Zhejiang and Virtue of Guangdong,
formed an annual producing capacity of three million shirts each
or more. Statistics show that the Kaikai Group made 4.5 million
shirts, and realized a sales volume of 520 billion yuan (about 62
million dollars) in 1995, while the Youngor expanded the
production scale to five million shirts per year.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Caiqing, director of Special Committee for Shirt under
the China Garment Association (CGA), noted that all the big
enterprises have imported production lines based on Western
nations' latest technologies, or similar equipment developed in
China. They are now on the same par with their Western
counterparts in terms of size of assets and technological level,
although other garment sectors are yet to close the gap with
advanced international standards.
</P>
<P>
Backed by China National Textile Council and CGA, the shirt
industry aims at sharpening its competitive edge internationally
by coming up with more famous brands in next five years.
</P>
<P>
Sheng disclosed the steps to be taken include establishing a
national shirt development center, increasing input in technical
upgrading, enhancing professional training, and launching a
biennial selection of famous shirt brands.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Raw Jute Export Earnings Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh earned TK 2.22 billion
(55.5 million US dollars) from raw jute exports during the period
from July 1995 to mid-February 1996, TK 0.47 billion (11.75
million dollars) more than the corresponding period of the
previous fiscal.
</P>
<P>
Official sources confirmed that an uptrend in raw jute prices
in international markets upped the country's earning from exports
of the item significantly during the first seven and a half months
of the current fiscal beginning last July 1.
</P>
<P>
The export value of raw jute has gone up TK 1,100 (27.5
dollars) per bale, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of export of raw jute from Bangladesh
during the period declined from 0.999 million bales to 0.781
million bales due to temporary ban on its export through the land
route, which was imposed by the government last August.
</P>
<P>
"Export of jute to India consequently decreased as India has
been one of the major buyers of jute from Bangladesh through the
land route," an official from the Bangladesh Jute Association
said.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- With the June elections for the
Great Hural (Mongolia's parliament) round the corner, the
country's major parties are speeding up their campaign
preparations.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Revolutionary Party has set up a campaign
team, headed by Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray, to draft the
party's electoral platform and to nominate its candidates.
</P>
<P>
The party's platform and nominations will not be formally
announced until approved by the party congress to be held in April.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party,
which are both represented in the current Great Hural, have formed
a coalition chaired by Mendsaihani Enhsaihan, chief of staff of
the presidential office and also chief co-ordinator of the
National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The coalition will put out a joint campaign platform and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic Revival Party has called on all
opposition parties to join forces to defeat the ruling party in
the coming election.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition National Unity Party said it would
nominate its own candidates and contest the election independently.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, more than 80 Great Hural
representatives will be elected from 26 constituencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Candidates who win the most votes above the minimum of 25
percent of the vote in a constituency will be elected into the
Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
A run-off election will be held if no candidate wins more than
25 percent of the vote in a constituency. And if the runoff fails
to produce a successful candidate, the election will go into a
third round.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 3 (Xinhua)-- The United Kingdom has approved a
grant of 2.87 million US dollars to Sri Lanka under its Overseas
Development Administration program, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The fund is for the Maheweli Authority to implement a technical
cooperation project to institutionally strengthen the authority's
environment and forest conservation program.
</P>
<P>
The Mahaweli Authority was established to administer the
Mahaweli area which was developed following the diversion of the
country's largest river the Mahaweli Ganga to irrigate the vast
north-central arid zone of the country.
</P>
<P>
Consequently several thousand acres of land in this area became
arable and thousands of settlers went there.
</P>
<P>
The new project is expected to improve the Mahaweli Authority's
land use planning services and environmental monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Activities to be carried out include further development of the
geographic information system and land mapping.
</P>
<P>
It will also help in the assessment of reservoir sedimentation,
river flows and changes in land use of the upper catchment areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole tonight won Republican presidential primary in the crucial
contest in South Carolina, according to latest local television
reports.
</P>
<P>
It was Dole's best performance in the campaign to date. The
72-year-old Senate leader suffered repeated losses in the
primaries of New Hampshire, Delaware and Arizona in February.
</P>
<P>
With 25 percent of precincts reporting, Dole had 45 percent, 29
points ahead of extreme conservative columnist Pat Buchanan.
Multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes had 12 percent and former
Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Just over half of voters in an exit poll said that they thought
Buchanan, who has been calling for trade protectionism and
anti-immigration, was too extreme, and 60 percent said they
thought Dole was the most electable.
</P>
<P>
"We feel great. We had a great organization down there and they
produced. I hope it's an indication of what may happen on Tuesday
and then Thursday," Dole told Cable News Network, interviewed on
his plane on the way to a victory party.
</P>
<P>
Eight states, including five in New England, hold primaries on
Tuesday, with 226 delegates at stake -- the largest amount yet up
for grabs on a single day. That will be followed by the major New
York primary on Thursday with 103 delegates on offer.
</P>
<P>
A total of 996 delegates to the Republican National Convention
are needed to win the party's nomination to face President Bill
Clinton in the November 5 election.
</P>
<P>
The Republican National Convention is scheduled to be held in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary delegate count showed Dole springing into the
lead with 72. Forbes followed with 60, Buchanan had 37 and
Alexander trailed with 10.

BUCHAREST, March 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,700 birds, including
1,500 swans, were frozen to death in Romania's Danube delta due to
snowstorms and freezing temperatures in February, an official
report said recently.
</P>
<P>
Every year, more than 300 bird species, including pelicans,
swans and ibis, fly to the delta for the usually warm winter here.
</P>
<P>
But temperature have been lower this winter than in the past,
freezing rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Truth daily reported that most of the dead birds were
young swans coming down from Northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
It said the frozen surface of rivers and lakes prevented birds
from catching fish and many birds starved to death.
</P>
<P>
Rivers, lakes and swamps make up 77 percent of the
500,000-hectare delta.
</P>
<P>
The government has banned hunting of birds this spring in the
huge delta, which accounts for 2.5 percent of the country's total
land area.

<HEADLINE> China Keen to Expand Relations With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GEORGETOWN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic and commercial
cooperation between China and Latin American countries, whose
economies are complementary, have huge scope for expansion, a
visiting senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun
Zhenyu told Xinhua that the rapid development of China's economy
and foreign trade have created favorable conditions for
strengthening commercial ties between China and Latin American and
Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
According to customs statistics, the trade volume between China
and Latin American countries surpassed 6.1 billion U.S. dollars in
1995, 30 percent more than in 1994, said Sun, head of a Chinese
economic and commercial delegation to Guiana.
</P>
<P>
He added the trade volume between China and the 14 Caribbean
Community and Common Market member countries reached 107 million
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Attending a seminar today on relations between China and the
Caribbean countries, Sun said that as developing countries, China
and the Latin American states have similar historical experiences
and now face the same tasks of strengthening national sovereignty,
developing their economies and improve the living standards of
their people.
</P>
<P>
China gives high priority to developing commercial links with
Latin American countries, including those which have no diplomatic
relations with China, he said, noting that no fundamental
conflicts of interest exist between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister presented three proposals to consolidate
commercial ties: to deepen mutual understanding, which is the
basis for economic cooperation, to increase imports and exports,
and to seek new avenues in economic and technological
cooperation.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
strongly condemning the latest bomb attack in Jerusalem this
morning, has ordered a Monday meeting of his top national security
advisers to discuss the Middle East situation and study a possible
response.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held Monday afternoon and Secretary of
State Warren Christopher will cut short his trip to South America
and the Caribbean to return for the meeting, a White House
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to say what specific policy options
Clinton might be considering. However, the official noted that
when Clinton called Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres earlier
today to express sorrow and outrage over the bombing, they "agreed
that the people behind this (bombing) are trying to kill the peace
process," and they discussed "possible next steps" they could take
together.
</P>
<P>
In his phone call with Peres, Clinton "re-emphasized his
determination to do what we can to be supportive in the effort
against terrorism," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters he also planned to contact PLO leader
Yasser Arafat and others in the region involved in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In his White House South Lawn remarks upon return from his
weekend visit to the presidential retreat at Camp David, he said,
"This is a troubling moment, but I am determined to see that it
does not defeat the peace process, and I am determined to do
everything I can on behalf of the United States to support those
who are standing against terrorism, and standing for peace."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's African
National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) stated today that the
youth of the country should be at the center of national
reconstruction and development.
</P>
<P>
This was said in a declaration adopted by the ANCYL at the end
of its 19th congress in Durban today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing of the congress, the newly-elected
ANCYL President Malusi Gigaba said the congress was successful in
uniting and strengthening the organization.
</P>
<P>
The three-day congress had adopted several resolutions for
charting a new path for the ANCYL in a democratic South Africa,
Gigaba said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the ANCYL was convinced that the
challenge of transforming the country into a truly non-racial
democracy "calls on us to build even stronger organizations of
the people, with the youth constituting the sharp edge of this
movement".
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that the congress also resolved that the
ANCYL should become a more representative organization, not just
in its racial composition but also by ensuring the maximum
participation of all racial women.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Supports Cuba Against US Acts of Hostility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has supported Cuba against
the U.S. acts of hostility and provocation, according to a
statement issued today by an official source of the Iraqi Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The source was commenting on the recent outbreak of a
Cuban-U.S. conflict over the shooting down by Cuban fighter planes
of two SISSNA planes owned by a Florida-seated anti-Castro group,
leaving four people dead.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Iraq supports Cuba's request for the
convocation of a special session of the U.N. General Assembly, to
afford Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina a chance to address
the General Assembly and expose the realities of the acts of
hostility and provocation by the United States against Cuba as
well as the role of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in
supporting and backing the acts of espionage and sabotage against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The United States was intentionally putting certain states in
peculiar positions, and would then seek to exploit its
international influence to embarrass those states. Such behavior
represents the core of the provocative U.S. policy, in
contradiction with the basic responsibilities of the big powers,
said the statement.
