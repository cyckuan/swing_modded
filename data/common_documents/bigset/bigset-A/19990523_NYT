SENIORS FEELING HEAT FOR DEFEAT OF CROSSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - An angry Cardinals fan called the team's Tempe offices
last Wednesday and said he had planned to purchase a new truck from
a Mesa car dealership but was backing out of the deal because of
the city's overwhelming defeat of the Rio Salado Crossing
convention center and stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals coach was so upset by the lopsided vote and the
rudeness with which he was treated by senior citizen voters at a
polling place that he wondered aloud whether he would ever spend
another dime in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   You're blaming the wrong folks, fellas. The Mesa business
community supported the project from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Bashing Mesa's older crowd also became a sport last week on talk
radio, almost a feeding frenzy. Grandma didn't just oppose a
quarter-cent sales tax increase. She showed up at the polls,
according to the callers, wearing an oxygen mask and brandishing a
cane, a vigilante willing to use force to protect her right to
oppose schools, libraries, mass transit and, heaven forbid, a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became so emotional that Cardinals officials have
endorsed a cooling-off period. But it won't lessen their desire to
get a new stadium, and they aren't going to wait around forever.
Without plans for one in the Valley by the end of next season, the
team could begin to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have a strong ally in their quest for a new
stadium _ the Fiesta Bowl, which has begun to make its message loud
and clear that it has serious doubts about remaining a top-tier
bowl if it has to continue to play in Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Those same Valley politicians who are reluctant to stick their
necks out to try to get a stadium for Cardinals owner  &UR; Bill Bidwill
also don't want to be in office if the Fiesta Bowl drops down to
the status of the Cotton Bowl or Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Mayor  &UR; Neil Giuliano thinks he can make both happy by
spending $200 million to refurbish Sun Devil Stadium. Forget about
it. You're wasting your time trying to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't going to be the only team in pro sports to
continue to play in a college stadium. They don't want their fans
to continue to have to sit in the hot sun. Plus, they don't get any
revenue streams from playing there.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the Cardinals' wish list would be a domed stadium near the
intersection of highways 101 and 202, where Tempe, Mesa and
Scottsdale meet. But they're willing to listen to potential sites
in other parts of town, including the west side.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute that they're going to agree to any
facility that is without some public funding. They're not going to
play in a stadium built strictly by private money when the Suns,
Diamondbacks and Coyotes all could have new facilities that include
some public dollars.
</P>
<P>
   One Cardinals official said the next few months will show what
kind of leadership the Valley has, whether anyone, including  &UR; Gov.
Jane
 &UR; Hull, is strong enough to get all the parties together and get a
deal done.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the sports community will be the big loser. There
will be no Super Bowls, no Final Fours. The nation's No. 1 sport
will be gone, not to return until a fancy and more expensive new
stadium is built.
</P>
<P>
   That won't matter to some, including those seniors who showed up
in buses last week and shouted, ``Hell, no,'' as they stood in line
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior citizens are an inherent part of the process,'' said
 &UR; Rick
 &UR; Horrow, the NFL's stadium consultant. ``Every community has a
sizable senior influence. The question is whether the majority of
them believe in the infrastructure to build for future
generations.'' &QL; 
Trouble in Motor City &QL; 
Sometime in the next couple of weeks, Detroit Lions Coach  &UR; Bobby
Ross should know whether future Hall of Fame running back  &UR; Barry
Sanders will retire after 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has been trying to reach Sanders for nearly four months by
phone, fax and e-mail. But Sanders' agent,  &UR; David Ware, said late
last week that he expects the coach and player to talk soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has said he wants to know by June 1 whether Sanders plans
to retire because if Sanders isn't coming back, the Lions want to
acquire another running back.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' father,  &UR; William, continues to criticize Ross' offense,
saying, ``If they don't change (it), he won't be with the Lions in
August. . . . They can clean Barry's locker out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how important it is for Sanders to break  &UR; Walter Payton's
rushing record of 16,726 yards, Sanders' father said, ``He can do
just like  &UR; Jim Brown did in '65 _ walk away from the game and never
let it faze him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has rushed for 15,269 yards, 1,458 behind Payton. &QL; 
Little patience &QL; 
First-year Philadelphia Eagles Coach  &UR; Andy Reid, whose team opens
the regular season against the Cardinals, would like for
first-round pick &UR; Donovan McNabb to sit on the bench early in the
year and watch starter
 &UR; Doug Pederson play.
</P>
<P>
   But Pederson has struggled in the team's minicamps, and McNabb
said he plans to report to training camp focused on winning the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to sit,'' McNabb said.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting deadlines &QL; 
 &UR; James McAlister, the former UCLA running back who is Arizona
cornerback  &UR; Chris McAlister's father, knows that agent  &UR; Eugene
Parker isn't afraid to hold his client out of training camp to get
the best rookie contract.
</P>
<P>
   Parker clients  &UR; Peter Boulware, Bryant Westbrook and  &UR; Walter
Jones in 1997 and the Cardinals'  &UR; Andre Wadsworth last year were
long holdouts. In fact, Wadsworth didn't sign with the Cardinals
until the eve of the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   But McAlister's dad said he will push Parker to get the deal
done with the Baltimore Ravens, who picked McAlister 10th overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first met Eugene, the first words out of Chris' mouth
were, `I don't want to be a holdout,' '' the elder McAlister said.
``The most important thing for our son is to be in camp that first
day with everybody else. He wants to pay his dues and earn
everything he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray we can get that done. But money becomes an issue.
We'll follow Eugene's lead on this. He knows what he is doing.'' &QL;

   Wide receivers coach  &UR; Vic Rapp said he spoke to Boston on Friday
and the Ohio State product told him he was ``healing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston suffered a fractured bone in his left shoulder in a
collision with cornerback  &UR; Corey Chavous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's back in Columbus (Ohio),'' Rapp said. ``The doctors who
are treating him there told him the (bone) calcified real
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's brother,  &UR; Byron, a Dallas policeman, said Saturday that
Boston is feeling much better and should be 100 percent for the
July 30 start of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Boston will return to Valley on June 12, five days after rookie
camp begins.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said that as a precautionary measure, Boston won't
participate in any drills at rookie camp. &QL; 
Temporary loss?
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin doesn't think the team's future in the Valley
was sealed by last Tuesday's defeat of the Rio Salado Crossing
convention center and stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the first salvo,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer thinks the players can get beyond the
loss at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got to go on,'' Plummer said. ``We have a season
to play.'' &QL; 
Not cooling off &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Second-year pro  &UR; Andy McCullough, who entered Saturday as the
NFL Europe League's receiving-yards leader, had three touchdown
catches in Frankfurt's 42-35 loss to the Scottish Claymores.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough's three scores tied a league record, and he now has a
league-high seven touchdowns for the season. &QL; 
Contract update &QL; 
The one-year tender contracts signed by offensive linemen
 &UR; Aaron &UR; Graham and  &UR; James Dexter on Friday are worth $429,000 each.

PITCHING INJURIES CAUSES MINOR-LEAGUE WORRIES

   DENVER - A twinge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A twinge is good. If it's a sharp pain, like a knife, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the words of Diamondbacks interim pitching coach  &UR; Gil
 &UR; Patterson after watching closer  &UR; Gregg Olson throw in the bullpen
Saturday while testing the abdominal muscle he pulled in the ninth
inning of Friday night's 8-7, 11-inning loss to the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Club officials were determining whether to place the
right-hander on the disabled list. Olson convinced them he could
pitch through the problem, so they decided to option infielder
 &UR; Hanley Frias to Triple-A Tucson and recall right-hander  &UR; Bobby
Chouinard from Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The club will keep 12 pitchers on the roster, at least for the
immediate future, given Olson's status and the fact that
right-handed reliever  &UR; Darren Holmes came up with stiffness in his
back and is day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he had abdominal difficulty while throwing in the
bullpen about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You adjust and pitch through it (discomfort),'' he said. ``You
sort of know what to expect. This time, you had no idea it was
coming. That makes it different in a game situation. Now that I
know what I'm dealing with, I think I can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard was available immediately. He last pitched for Tucson
on Wednesday, throwing 80 pitches. He has pitched in two games for
the Diamondbacks this season, getting credit for a 7-6 victory over
Los Angeles on April 13 at Bank One Ballpark in 16 innings, the
longest game in club history. &QL; 
Bell takes kid to school &QL; 
Second baseman  &UR; Jay Bell walked down the clubhouse hallway before
Saturday's game, mixing coffee by pouring it back and forth into
plastic foam cups.
</P>
<P>
   A mad chemist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love chemistry in school,'' he said. ``You've got to
mix science and math together.''
</P>
<P>
   During the game, he mixed the science of hitting with math,
hitting a three-run homer off right-hander  &UR; David Lee in his major
league debut. Lee had been called up on Thursday from Double-A.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 26, is from Pittsburgh and went with his father to watch
the Pirates, for whom Bell played from 1990-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what (kind of pitches) he had, but it is still a
difficult at-bat when you haven't faced him,'' Bell said. ``He left
(a fastball) up and over the plate, but he seems to have a very
good idea of where he wants to throw the ball. The Rockies have a
good pitcher. He's going to be something special.'' &QL; 
Anderson presses on &QL; 
Left-hander  &UR; Brian Anderson was not overjoyed with his start on
Friday night, the first after being recalled from Tucson and the
first since Sept. 26. He gave up seven runs on nine hits in 4
innings but was not charged with the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because physically, I feel the best I've
felt, my arm feels great,'' Anderson said. ``Stuff-wise, it's the
best I've had. I won several games last season with way worse
(stuff).
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was back. I was moving the ball in and out . . .
I don't know, when a pitcher adds 2 or 3 mph to his fastball and
has more break on his slider and gets worse, something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Because right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre is on the disabled list
for a minimum of four to six weeks, Anderson is expected to be in
the rotation at least that long, so he'll have more chances to turn
things around. His next scheduled start is Wednesday night at Bank
One Ballpark against San Diego in the finale of a three-game
series. &QL; 
Pitcher to Dodgers &QL; 
The Diamondbacks have traded left-hander  &UR; Neil Weber, an expansion
draft pick from Montreal, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for future
considerations. Weber had been with Triple-A Tucson. In 1998, he
pitched in four games for the Diamondbacks (2 innings) with an
11.57 ERA and 0-0 record. &QL;

HOUSTON ACING TEST  
 ASTROS' STAFF LACKS NO. 1 BUT FLOURISHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once  &UR; Randy Johnson departed for the Arizona riches and  &UR; Moises
Alou went down for the year with a torn-up knee, the two-time
defending National League Central champion Houston Astros were
supposed to be very catchable by their divisional foes.
</P>
<P>
   One quarter of the way into the season, though, reveals the
opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros entered their weekend series in San Francisco with
the second-largest lead of any division leader. They are getting
the kind of pitching that makes other clubs green with envy, and
they took it personally when just about everyone in baseball
anointed Atlanta, Arizona and Los Angeles with the best pitching
staffs in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired of hearing that,'' Houston General Manager
 &UR; Gerry Hunsicker said. ``Statistically, we have the best pitching
staff in the National League, and it's an insult to the pitchers we
have when people keep saying that we need an ace. Well, we had one
(Randy Johnson) last year, and we didn't get past the first round
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many Number 1's are out there? Probably four or five.
Would I like to have one of those five? Sure. But I like the guys
we have, too, and I like the challenge of competing without the
high-profile guy that everyone says we are lacking. That makes it
extra satisfying when we quietly keep winning while everyone else
is debating what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than  &UR; Jose Lima, acquired a few years ago from
Detroit as part of the trade that sent  &UR; Brian Hunter and  &UR; Todd
Jones to the Tigers, for the leader of this Houston staff.
</P>
<P>
   He's definitely eccentric, but Lima is emerging as one of the
top pitchers in the game. His 7-1 record with a 2.98 ERA is proof
enough that he has the goods. Couple him with fellow starters  &UR; Mike
Hampton (5-1, 2.61) and  &UR; Shane Reynolds (6-3, 4.06), and the Astros
have themselves quite a top three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't ask for anything more from those guys,'' Astros
Manager  &UR; Larry Dierker said. ``Then again, those guys have been
doing it for a while now, so we can realistically expect them to
keep pitching this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they really think of themselves as Number 1
starters, and in a way, that's good. I think that creates some
internal competition, but at the same time none of them has to
carry the burden of being the Number 1 guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing in  &UR; Sean Bergman, a 12-game winner last season, and the
fact that  &UR; Mike Holt (0-6, 5.80 after Saturday) has managed to hold
off the oncoming  &UR; Scott Elarton (2-1, 1.50 in 15 relief
appearances) speaks volumes about the depth this staff has.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's detractors are quick to point to his automatic-pilot
style of managing. That he rarely makes moves worth noting and
that, despite winning 139 games during a 13-year major league
career, he didn't have the necessary grooming because he had been a
broadcaster in the years leading to his being named manager before
the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a solid club, top to bottom,'' St. Louis Manager  &UR; Tony
 &UR; La Russa said. ``They have few holes.'' &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Of the 30 major league managers, name the only two who accumulated
at least 2,000 hits during their major league careers. As a bonus,
more juicy information will be included with the answer. &QL; 
Bird droppings &QL; 
Will the mess in Baltimore ever end?
</P>
<P>
   With each passing week the Orioles seem to write a new chapter
to further make everyone conclude they truly are the most
dysfunctional ballclub in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The latest centers on the three high-profile figures in
management _ owner  &UR; Peter Angelos, General Manager  &UR; Frank Wren and
Manager  &UR; Ray Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos, unwilling to admit he made a mistake in letting  &UR; Davey
 &UR; Johnson go in favor of Miller after the successful 1997 season,
will not act on Wren's request to fire Miller. The mere appearance
that the three have an ongoing poor relationship caused Miller to
try to clear the record last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of this is I wanted to tell you I have a
relationship with Peter Angelos that requires me, when I signed the
contract, to fill him in two or three times a week,'' Miller said.
`That's all I do. . . . I can say that any decision that has been
made as far as releasing someone or sending someone out are mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank has the final say-so because he's the general manager.
There's absolutely nothing subversive, nothing hidden. I've
probably got the best relationship with the general manager that
I've ever had in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   If true, then Miller has had some awful relationships with GMs
in the past. It was Miller, club sources said, who persuaded
Angelos to release reliever  &UR; Heathcliff Slocumb a few weeks back, a
move that went against the wishes of Wren.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is also trying to get the club to let go of pitchers
 &UR; Scott
 &UR; Kamieniecki and  &UR; Mike Fetters. Angelos, however, is balking at
those moves so far. Wren, a rookie GM, offers very little these
days. Read between the lines, however, and it's powerful stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in every decision,'' Wren said. ``I can't
say I've agreed with every decision.'' &QL; 
Strangest of 'em all &QL; 
With all the hoopla surrounding  &UR; Luis Gonzalez's recent 30-game
hitting streak, San Diego Manager  &UR; Bruce Bochy was reminded of
then-Padres catcher  &UR; John Flaherty's 26-game streak in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say all you want about
 &UR; Joe DiMaggio and all the other great hitting streaks,'' Bochy said.
``To me, John's was the most amazing of them all. He's probably the
slowest player in the majors. For him to hit safely in 26 games in
a row is a minor miracle. The guy's got no legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Gonzalez legged out an infield hit or two during
his streak, Flaherty had to rely on clean hits to the outfield to
continue his streak. &QL; 
A voice from above &QL; 
The sputtering Anaheim Angels, who look like world-beaters one week
in sweeping New York at Yankee Stadium, and then like dregs the
next in losing two of three to Tampa Bay, apparently didn't listen
closely enough to their new leader after the surprising sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can look back on a series like this and remember this is
how it's supposed to be,'' first baseman  &UR; Mo Vaughn said. ``This
team is notorious for playing the Yankees well and everyone else
like crap. That's got to stop. I don't want to see any letdowns.
Let's continue to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels entered the weekend series stuck in last place in the
American League West. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Yankees skipper  &UR; Joe Torre had 2,342 hits during his distinguished
playing career, during which he won the National League's Most
Valuable Player award in 1971. The only other manager to reach at
least 2,000 hits is Montreal Manager  &UR; Felipe Alou, who had 2,101
big-league hits.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables with at least 1,000 hits are: San Francisco's
 &UR; Dusty
 &UR; Baker (1,981), Detroit's  &UR; Larry Parrish (1,789) Toronto's  &UR; Jim
Fregosi (1,726), Seattle's  &UR; Lou Piniella (1,705), Cleveland's  &UR; Mike
Hargrove (1,614), Milwaukee's  &UR; Phil Garner (1,594) and Los Angeles'
 &UR; Davey
 &UR; Johnson (1,252).
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the scale was Boston Manager  &UR; Jimy
Williams, who totaled three hits in his big-league career. Chicago
White Sox skipper  &UR; Jerry Manuel had 23, Minnesota's  &UR; Tom Kelly had
23, St. Louis'
 &UR; Tony La Russa had 35 and Pittsburgh's  &UR; Gene Lamont had 37.
</P>
<P>
   Three managers were pitchers, and six never made it to the
majors, including the Diamondbacks' Buck Showalter. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Just think, if they sell them out, they can
 &UR; cover Kevn Brown's yearly salary: The Dodgers are hoping to
complete construction for next season on 35 to 40 luxury suites
that will be leased for $370,000 to $390,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Further proof that Rickey is in a class all by
 &UR; himself: Cleveland's  &UR; Kenny Lofton last week slammed a home run to
lead off a game for the 14th time in his career. He now trails the
career record holder,  &UR; Rickey Henderson, by a mere 59.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Dick Drago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why weren't they thinking of this five years ago?: Texas
believed  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro's swing better fit the club's home
ballpark better than the now-departed  &UR; Will Clark, who tends to hit
into the left-center field gap. Palmeiro has eight home runs in 74
home at-bats. The most home runs Clark hit in Texas in a
single-season was 11.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Conclusive proof that he really played in the
 &UR; majors: Exhaustive research by  &UR; Jim Henzler of Stats Inc. revealed
that KGME-AM (550) radio host  &UR; Jim Traber ranked as the ninth-worst
hitter ever when it came to hitting a triple. Traber had none in
819 career at-bats. Of the eight players in front of him, half were
pitchers. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 clubs that have joined as expansion clubs since 1961,
only the Padres and Pilots/Brewers have had a player with a hitting
streak longer than  &UR; Luis Gonzalez's 30.  &UR; Paul Molitor had a 39-game
streak for the Brewers and  &UR; Benito Santiago reached 34. Both took
place in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Texas catcher  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez last week committed his first
error in 57 games. Cleveland catcher  &UR; Sandy Alomar recently had
this to say about Pudge: ``Nobody else is going to win the Gold
Glove. They should have the Gold Glove and the Silver Glove. Pudge
would get the Gold Glove, and the rest of us would go for the
Silver Glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles GM  &UR; Kevin Malone is so infuriated that
 &UR; Chan Ho Park's agent, who also happens to be his uncle, seems to be
negotiating a contract extension in the newspapers that he has
broken off negotiations until the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay first baseman  &UR; Fred McGriff, who is having himself a
nice season, hit a home run in his 35th different ballpark last
week, two more than anyone else. He can add Baltimore's Camden
Yards and Seattle's Safeco Field later this season, as well as any
of the four others scheduled to open next season.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's  &UR; David Justice entered the weekend series against
Detroit batting .391 (25 for 64) with nine home runs and an
astonishing 27 RBIs in only 16 games. Since the month began,
Justice's average has skyrocketed from .208 to .313.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Jeff Juden, now with the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate in
Columbus (Ohio) and someone with a long history of having bad
confrontations, got into one with his manager,  &UR; Trey Hillman, and
teammate and former Diamondback  &UR; Andy Stankiewicz, one of the
kindest souls in the game at any level. Juden's consistently poor
behavior appears unchanged. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bruce Chen has been called up to take  &UR; John
 &UR; Smoltz's spot in Atlanta's rotation for two starts. If he does
well, expect the Braves to keep Chen and send  &UR; Odalis Perez, who
seems to have some bizarre excuse every time he pitches poorly, to
the minors. Atlanta has scored at least nine runs three times for
Perez, who has only one win in those starts.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle came close to sending outfielder  &UR; Butch
 &UR; Huskey to Boston last week. The Mariners gave the Red Sox a list of
five players, any one of whom would have been acceptable to secure
the deal. Boston GM  &UR; Dan Duquette was unwilling to lose any of the
five.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he may, Philadelphia reliever  &UR; Jeff Brantley may not be
able to nurse his sore shoulder through the remaining 4{ months of
the season. It's more than likely that Brantley will wind up on the
DL and probably undergo season-ending surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore starter  &UR; Scott Kamieniecki may be down to his final
chance with the Orioles. He will make three starts at Triple-A
Rochester. Unless some form of progress is shown, he may wind up
with his walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and Texas might be interested in Pittsburgh starter
 &UR; Pete Schourek, who is 2-3 with a 5.27 ERA in his first eight
starts. The Mariners scouted his last start. One possible holdup is
the two-year, $4 million contract Schourek signed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Midre Cummings signed to a minor league deal, there is
growing belief in Minnesota that first baseman  &UR; Marty Cordova could
be gone soon. Cordova was recently placed on waivers far earlier
than normal. The Twins' hope might be for someone to claim the
former Rookie of the Year and take them off the hook for his $3
million salary. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Cleveland &UR; Manny Ramirez has not gone more than two games without
an RBI.  &QL; 
2. HoustonFront office maintains the pitching staff is the best in
the majors.  &QL; 
3. Atlanta &UR; Tom Glavine, who has won three of his past four starts,
appears to be back.  &QL; 
4. BostonStarter  &UR; Pedro Martinez is on pace to strike out a record
391 batters.  &QL; 
5. NY Yankees &UR; Scott Brosius slamming a bat to pieces offers a sign
of frustration.  &QL; 
6. ArizonaWent to the city by the Bay and flexed its muscle in
winning two of three.  &QL; 
7. San Francisco &UR; Barry Bonds may be slightly ahead of schedule to
return in early June.  &QL; 
8. TexasRookie  &UR; Ryan Glynn takes over  &UR; John Burkett's spot in the
rotation.  &QL; 
9. NY MetsImagine if they had any kind of production from their
outfielders? &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. FloridaCloser Matt Mantei is experiencing lower back pain.  &QL; 
29. MontrealNew signee Mel Rojas' first assignment is to lose
weight.  &QL; 
28. MinnesotaStarting pitchers not named  &UR; Brad Radke are 3-19 with
a 8.45 ERA.  &QL; 
27. Baltimore &UR; Cal Ripken finally got rid of that awkward-looking
batting stance.  &QL; 
26. DetroitTigers brass is battling with  &UR; Justin Thompson to alter
his delivery.  &QL; 
25. San DiegoThe dreadful offense is sputtering big time.  &QL; 
24. ColoradoEight of the 15 smallest crowds in Coors Field history
have been in 1999.  &QL; 
23. TorontoStarter  &UR; Joey Hamilton should be back in the rotation
this week.  &QL; 
22. AnaheimWhere have you gone,  &UR; Darin Erstad? The Halos' lonely
eyes are searching. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Chicago Cubs: Even with eight pitchers having spent some time on
the disabled list, the Cubs have not raised the white flag.  &UR; Sammy
 &UR; Sosa looks like he has his home run swing back and the Cubs have
regained some of that lost swagger.  &UR; Kevin Tapani is pitching like
one of the game's elite and  &UR; Mark Grace is among league leaders in
hitting. Maybe there is something to that old Cubs magic. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Chicago White Sox: While things are looking up on the north side,
they aren't so glib on the south side. The White Sox thought they
were going to have a litmus test of sorts by facing first-place
Cleveland last week. If so, Chicago remains separated by a wide gap
with the best in the division. The Indians scored 13 runs in each
of their three games against the White Sox. Starter  &UR; Jaime Navarro
blasted the umpires after he gave up nine runs in 1 innings. Fellow
starter
 &UR; Jim Parque took his beating like a man, admitting he was terrible. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Cincinnati first baseman  &UR; Sean Casey after the 24-12 victory over
Colorado at Coors Field on Wednesday afternoon: ``That was like a
summer league softball game and we won the keg of beer. I was on
base seven straight times? I didn't realize that. I scored five
runs? Don't think I ever did that because I can't run and steal
bases.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Yes, we know this space is reserved for young major leaguers worth
noting. This week we offer left-handed pitcher  &UR; Rick Ankiel, who
was promoted from St. Louis' Double-A club in Arkansas to Triple-A
Memphis. Ankiel, 19, was 6-0 with an 0.91 ERA at Arkansas. If he
continues on his pace, expect Ankiel to be a part of the Cardinals
rotation by the middle of June. ``I wouldn't bet against him if I
was going to go to the window,'' St. Louis Manager  &UR; Tony La Russa
said. &QL;

SUNS' GET NINTH PICK, BUT HORNETS PULL OFF MIRACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been that kind of year for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Luck scorned them Saturday in the NBA draft lottery,
smiling on the Charlotte Hornets instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets owned only five four-number combinations out of the
1,000 possibilities in Saturday's lottery. One of those
combinations was drawn third, giving the Hornets the No. 3 pick in
the June 30 draft. The Hornets had less than a 1 percent chance to
get the pick.
</P>
<P>
   And because Charlotte moved into the top three, by lottery
rules, every team below Vancouver, the Los Angeles Clippers and
Chicago were bumped down one spot.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Suns, who had the eighth-most combinations because
they own the Dallas Mavericks' first-round pick, dropped down one
spot to No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you travel this far with very small odds of winning it,
you hope at least to hold your position,'' downcast Suns General
Manager Bryan Colangelo said. ``Because of Charlotte's good luck,
everybody else slipped a spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, conspiracy theories will abound after the Chicago
Bulls won the lottery and got the first pick. But forget the Bulls.
They had a 15.7 percent shot at the No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   But how about the Hornets? Michael Jordan had been negotiating
to purchase the club from George Shinn until talks recently broke
off. What better way to rekindle Jordan's interest than for
Charlotte to have one of the top three picks?
</P>
<P>
   As for the Suns, it has been a tough year. They saw their
rebuilding plan blown up last summer when the NBA locked out its
players, and a new collective bargaining agreement changed the
rules that would have helped the Suns attract several top free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went through a disappointing 27-23 season and were
bumped from the playoffs in the first round for the fourth
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   With only 37 of the possible 1,000 number combinations in the
lottery, the Suns were a long shot to get into the top three. Now
they'll have to make due with No. 9, which still is the club's
highest pick since their last trip to the lottery in 1988. They
selected Tim Perry with the No. 7 choice that season.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also own the 16th pick unless they decide Monday to
pass it on to the Chicago Bulls to complete the Luc Longley trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it seriously alter our draft plans?'' Colangelo asked.
``If we had jumped from Number 8 to one of the top three picks, it
would have made a big difference. But there isn't a decided shift
from eight to nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll start zeroing in on the person, or persons, we think
will be there. The draft is deeper than most people will lead you
to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colangelo agrees with observers who have said that few
players, if any, in the draft this season will turn a team into an
instant contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you pick 1 or 9, the person selected is unlikely to
have an immediate impact,'' Colangelo said. ``The people who are
looked upon as the top picks are going to need a year or two to
have an impact because of their age, experience and the acclimation
period that all players go through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns could seek to move up in the draft by keeping the 16th
pick and packaging the two if that will move them up to get a
player they want. They also could make a pick for another team,
then complete a trade later.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could trade either or both picks for established players
in an attempt to get a player who will make an immediate
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means are we married to the pick,'' Colangelo said.
``We've had people approach us about the possibility of packaging
the picks, and we'll look at all scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some way, we'll add a player with the ninth pick who will
help us address one of our weaknesses.'' &QL;

MILLER WANTS TOUGHNESS IN POST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cheryl Miller had a scowl on her face and a message
for her team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Get attitude down low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day they step on the floor, I want them coming in here
with a bad attitude,'' the Mercury coach-general manager said.
``And to be hungry, and to get after it and be passionate and push
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition we have in the guards is ferocious. We don't
have that in the post. I don't like them being nice in the post.
Post players aren't supposed to be nice. Some of our toughest
players are on the perimeter, and that's got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   With Miller at training camp for just the second time in nine
days because of her broadcasting obligations, the Mercury is
without centers Maria Stepanova and Marlies Askamp, playing at the
European Championships, May 28-June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The absences are no excuse for a lack of intensity, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to step up to the challenge,'' she said. ``I'm not
going to ask Merle or Jenny to do something that physically they're
not capable of, but you can always play more aggressively. You can
be more active on the boards. There are a lot of things they can do
that hasn't been done consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Merlelynn Lange-Harris, a 6-foot-6 former Canadian Olympian, and
Jenny Crouse, a 6-3 pro rookie from the University of North Dakota,
are the main camp competition for veterans Jennifer Gillom and Toni
Foster. Trisha Stafford, a top-10 career scorer and rebounder at
the University of California who has American Basketball League and
overseas experience, joined the group Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The battles are more intense on the perimeter because starting
jobs at shooting guard and small forward are at stake. And Lisa
Harrison, Andrea Kuklova and Umeki Webb seemingly are in a
competition for the final two roster spots unless someone begins
the season on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix will play the first of two preseason games against the
Charlotte Sting at 7 p.m. Wednesday at America West Arena. The
rematch is June 4 in Charlotte. The Mercury opens its 32-game
regular season at Sacramento on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will be on the bench Wednesday but is uncertain when she
will join the team full time. She hopes to be back after the
Portland-Utah NBA series is finished. &QL;

Spurs take 3-0 lead
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ All season long, the Los Angeles Lakers have
been the story in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But now they're on the verge of becoming yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs took a commanding 3-0 lead in the
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals series with their
103-91 victory over the Lakers on Saturday before 17,505 at the
Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were on television practically every week, were
pictured on just about every magazine cover and were supposed to
pick up the league's banner in the post-Michael Jordan NBA.
</P>
<P>
   They are on the verge of getting dumped, and the Spurs, former
playoff fodder themselves, are doing the dumping. They scored the
final 13 points of the game to put the Lake Show on the verge of
cancellation entering Game 4, which is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Spurs are something special,'' said Spurs point guard
Avery Johnson. ``We're not losing these types of games. We just
keep on pounding away and keep on playing mentally tough. And if we
keep making our free throws, we're really going to be a tough
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Too tough for the Lakers, who must attempt to win four straight
games from the league's hottest team, a pretty tall order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation for them, there's no question about
it,'' said the Spurs' David Robinson. ``But it's a basketball game,
and when you play a basketball game anybody can win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be ready for (today). We really have to come out
and get going early and try to take some of this momentum into
(today's) game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Spurs are necessarily looking for the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important at all,'' Robinson said. ``For us, we just
need to work on getting better night in and night out. I don't
think we're even close to where we need to be on the whole, overall
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out there thinking about a sweep, you've got your
mind on the wrong stuff. You have to think about getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to imagine the Spurs playing much better than they
are now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, heroes were everywhere for the Spurs in this game _ Tim
Duncan pounded away inside to finish with a monster 37-point,
14-rebound game, and Jaren Jackson fired away from the outside for
22 points, including a huge 3-pointer with 1:40 to play.
</P>
<P>
   And after scoring just two points in the first three quarters,
Johnson scored six in the final 5:13, making all three of his shots
to help the Spurs put away the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan was the key, not only scoring 24 of his points in the
first half, but hitting 19 of 23 foul shots in his 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy never ceases to amaze me,'' said the Spurs' Mario
Elie. ``Tim is my Most Valuable Player, man. I've been hearing
whispers that Karl Malone is going to get it (the MVP award), and
that's not fair. Give it to the best player in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? After all, the Lakers gave him just about everything
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They might give, but the Lakers are getting little in return.
The stars have definitely not been aligned for the Lakers, and
we're not talking about celestial bodies here.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Big Three of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and
Glen Rice have not meshed against the defense-minded Spurs, one big
reason for their predicament _ or three big reasons, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Rice finished with a team-high 24 points, but hit just six of
his 19 shots. Bryant made just seven of his 18, and O'Neal was left
to pick up the scraps, getting only 14 attempts, making eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very frustrated,'' said O'Neal, who finished with 22
points and 15 rebounds. ``Down 2-0 (entering Saturday's game), I
felt we weren't in a hole. But down 3-0, I know we're in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a game (today), so we just have to come out with a lot
more effort than we did (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry hit a 3-pointer with 1:55 left to put the Lakers up
by a point, but Jackson began the Spurs' closing run by taking a
pass out of the post from Duncan and nailing a 3-pointer just 15
seconds after Horry's bomb, putting the Spurs up 93-91 and
appearing to break the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big shot, a big shot _ a very big shot,'' Jackson
said of his 3-pointer. ``It was late in the game, and I knew I had
to be very aggressive. All my teammates were supporting me, telling
me that when they doubled (Duncan) inside, to just take my shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the house knew how they were rotating (on
defense), so I just made sure I stepped up and took the shot.
That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   As in that's all for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   After a Derek Fisher miss, Johnson scored on a 19-foot jumper to
give San Antonio a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing went right for the Lakers after that. Unable to make a
shot (making just seven of their 20 fourth-quarter field-goal
attempts for 35 percent), they were forced to foul the Spurs, who
stepped to the line and drilled their last six foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little disappointed,'' said Bryant, who had 20 points.
``We didn't play like we wanted to play. We didn't come out with a
lot of energy and passion, like we should have at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're an explosive team. I think that if anybody can do it
(come back from the 3-0 deficit), it's us. We have a lot of
dynamite on this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but it's blowing up in their faces.

Caminiti can't avoid going on disabled list
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ As much as he wanted to believe otherwise, Ken
Caminiti knew his strained right calf wasn't going to get much
better over the course of a few days.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Caminiti, considered by many to be baseball's
ultimate gamer, offered no resistance when general manager Gerry
Hunsicker told him he was going on the 15-day disabled list before
Saturday's game against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti has a history of fighting such decisions, of ignoring
the pain and finding a way to get back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could say was, `That's fine,''' he said. ``I know how
bad it hurts. I can barely walk. I've never felt anything like this
before, and I've felt some pretty (bad) stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Daryle Ward was recalled from Class AAA New
Orleans to take Caminiti's spot on the roster. Ward, 23, will join
the Astros today. Caminiti joins Moises Alou, Ricky Gutierrez,
Mitch Meluskey, and Doug Henry on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said Caminti's recovery time could be anywhere from a
week to a month. Caminiti will be eligible to come off the disabled
list June 7, when the Astros open a three-game series against the
White Sox in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he can do is rest and get therapy,'' Hunsicker said.
``With any muscle pull or strain, you can't rush it. We're just
hoping for the best. We hope he'll be ready when he's eligible to
come back. With injuries like this, we pencil it in for a week to
10 days minimum; it could go anywhere up to a month.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred in the third inning of Friday's game against
the Giants. After delivering a two-out, RBI single off Mark
Gardner, Caminiti strained his calf in the process of stealing
second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one step and I felt it,'' Caminiti said. ``I thought
someone had thrown something from the stands and hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's game, Hunsicker termed Caminiti's status as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspected this (after Friday's game),'' Hunsicker said.
``But we wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. His calf is
extremely sore, and it's not likely he's going to get over this
very quickly. Rather than go (a player) short for another day, we
decided to bring up Daryle Ward.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward was hitting .339 with a Pacific Coast League-leading 15
homers and 41 RBIs in 42 games at New Orleans. This will be the
second stint in the big leagues for Ward, who was called up when
Jeff Bagwell went on the DL last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daryle's basically going to be a bat off the bench,''
Hunsicker said. ``I usually don't like to have a young player come
up here and sit _ especially a player like Ward _ but for the role
we were looking at, he was the best choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Villalobos (New Orleans) and Chris Truby (Class AA
Jackson) are the top third-base prospects in the organization, but
the Astros are well covered at third on the major-league roster
with Bill Spiers, Jack Howell and Russ Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti was struggling at the time of his injury (1-for-19) but
is hitting .292 with two homers and 17 RBIs in 36 games. This is
the third year in a row Caminiti has been disabled, and he believes
he has gained the reputation of a player who is always injured _ a
label he hardly appreciates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played hard in my career and I've paid the price,'' said
Caminiti, who missed 21 games during a stint on the disabled list
in 1998. ``It just seems like lately, people think I'm always
getting hurt. I handled my own contract negotiations this time, and
I heard what they had to say (about health concerns).
</P>
<P>
   ``It (ticked) me off, and now I'm dealing with it. I can
understand why they had concerns. I've had surgeries the last two
years. I'm sure they're like, `Who knows what we're going to get?'
That's not the way I like it, and that's not the way I want it.
This is a hard game to play, and I've played it hard. Things
happen.''

VICTIMS OF RAPE MUST ENDURE POORLY EQUIPPED MEDICAL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 and SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rape victims are being shuffled from hospital to hospital
throughout metropolitan Phoenix, their care delayed for hours by
overcrowded emergency rooms and doctors reluctant to examine them.
</P>
<P>
   Women who were at the mercy of their attackers have found
themselves at the mercy of a broken-down system that is supposed to
provide physical exams that are critical for police investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Even the basics _ rape-exam kits, for example _ aren't always
available. Last month, a woman at Maryvale Hospital Medical Center
had to wait for a kit to be delivered via taxi from Thunderbird
Samaritan Medical Center in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Flores, a Valley mother who was beaten and raped, was
driven to three hospitals last year before she could get an exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like, `What the hell do they have hospitals for?' ''
she said. ``Regardless if I've been raped or haven't been raped,
I'm hurting. Isn't that what you go to hospitals for?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, some women get help; some don't; some
give up and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Victims' advocates say a lack of communication and a maze of
contradictory rules and services create confusion that can
retraumatize victims and set rapists free.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Assaulted women sometimes go from hospital to hospital before
they find someone who will see them, or wait for hours in crowded
emergency rooms. During this time, they can't clean up and are
supposed to urinate as little as possible so they don't destroy
evidence. As they wait, physical evidence of the attack fades while
their emotional trauma builds.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency-room physicians acknowledge they are increasingly
reluctant to examine victims, largely because of a concern about
having to testify in court.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they routinely bypass nearby hospitals and take
victims to Mesa's Center Against Family Violence because they
consider it the best place for treatment and evidence collection.
Two other Valley centers are planned but won't open for months,
which means police officers in cities as far away as Glendale will
travel to Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most ERs right now are so helter-skelter, with people in and
out,'' said Chandler police Sgt. Kenny Thatcher, who oversees the
crimes against persons unit. ``If a sexual assault victim hasn't
been injured, they're very low on the priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just sit and sit and sit. They may sit for three or four
hours before they to see the doctor.'' &QL; 
THE SECOND ORDEAL
</P>
<P>
   After Flores had been held hostage, raped and beaten, she
escaped and called police _ and then began another ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale police Det. Kelly Shore drove her to St. Joseph's
Hospital and Medical Center and Good Samaritan Regional Medical
Center, but was turned away at both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of upsetting. We're trying to work a case, we're
trying to gather evidence, and she needs help and we just got
turned away,'' Shore said.
</P>
<P>
   Good Samaritan officials said they have no record of Flores
coming to the hospital. If she had no physical injuries, she could
have been sent elsewhere for a forensic exam, said Bill Byron, Good
Samaritan spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Helander, who was St. Joseph's emergency-department
manager at the time, said the hospital didn't have a record of
Flores, either. He added that what happened would have been an
``aberration'' from the hospital's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Frazzled, Shore and Flores eventually arrived at Maricopa
Medical Center, the county hospital, took a seat and waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed,'' Flores said. ``My shirt was torn. I was
walking in with no shoes. . . . Just imagine what people were
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like everyone knew I was raped.''
</P>
<P>
   After two hours she was led into an exam room. Then she waited
2{ hours more before she was released. After being shuffled around
and made to wait for a doctor, Flores felt unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   The system isn't supposed to treat people that way.
</P>
<P>
   And the Maricopa County Attorney's Office is lobbying for
change. &QL; 
A `SANE' APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want to adopt a system used across the country in
which specially trained nurses conduct sexual assault exams on
adults. The nurses would work from victim advocacy centers, like
the one in Mesa, and would collect evidence, provide emotional
support and then testify in court when needed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the perfect solution, advocates and others say. But
there never has been a perfect solution, they add, noting that the
current system is riddled with defects.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the victims' fates depend largely on their choice of
emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals such as Phoenix Regional Medical Center and
Thunderbird Samaritan Medical Center will likely send patients
elsewhere for exams. Others, like Mesa Lutheran hospitals, say they
offer patients the option of staying there or going someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's two John C. Lincoln hospitals and Phoenix Memorial
Hospital say they will do the exams if requested. Others, like
Desert Samaritan Medical Center in Mesa, expect the police to bring
their own kits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be years ago that you could take a victim to
whatever hospital was closest,'' said Chris Parks, victim services
coordinator for the Phoenix Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   But now, she said, ``It's hard. You prepare a victim: `This is
where we're going, this is what's going to happen, these people are
going to treat you very nicely.' And then you walk in and they say,
`Sorry we can't treat you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you turn around (to the victim) and say, `OK, this is
really what's going to happen.' '' &QL; 
DOCTORS RELUCTANT
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies in part with doctors' reluctance to perform
rape exams. When it comes to treating victims, doctors can be a
little ``schizophrenic,'' said Dr. Kent Layton, business manager &UR; of
Tempe Emergency Physicians Group, which provides services at Tempe
St. Luke's Hospital and St. Luke's Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, we are sympathetic and supportive. . . . We
are outraged that something like this would happen,'' he said.
``But like a lot of people in society, we don't want to get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go into that (examining) room because we
don't want to go to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in court can mean taking days off without pay or
throwing stretched-thin staffing schedules out of whack. It's
especially frustrating when cases are constantly rescheduled,
doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize it's my civic duty . . . but what bothers physicians
is the lack of coordination in court,'' said Dr. Todd Taylor, a
Good Samaritan emergency-room physician. ``Like most people,
doctors don't enjoy rearranging their lives around court schedules
and then seeing nothing come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike expert witnesses, doctors are not paid for their time
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even have to pay for parking,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, doctors can refuse to do the exams, although hospitals
are required to screen and stabilize anyone who comes into the
emergency department. But it shouldn't be an option, said Dr.
Charles Pollack, who runs Maricopa Medical Center's emergency
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no sympathy for doctors who don't want to perform the
exams,'' he said. ``These people are their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Deputy County Attorney Joe Heilman, who prosecuted sex
crimes cases for eight years and called doctors as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about seeing a patient and writing a
prescription,'' he said. ``I think it goes deeper than that.
There's an obligation to the patient.'' &QL; 
CROWDED EMERGENCY ROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is emergency rooms. They have become crowded in
part because of an influx of uninsured patients who wait until
their symptoms become severe, then seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Rape victims often wait until medical personnel work their way
through cases considered more of a threat to people's lives than
sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Victims can feel increasingly vulnerable amid a waiting room
full of strangers. At times, police have to interview them in
whispers. Or victims must repeat their story to various hospital
staffers.
</P>
<P>
   They may, or may not, sit in anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Cindi Nannetti, who heads the county attorney's sexual assault
unit, recalls once when an emergency-department staffer came out
into the waiting room and asked, ``Who's the rape victim?''
</P>
<P>
   When a friend of Kathleen Ferraro was raped a month ago, the
emergency room seemed the logical place to go.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Actually, it wasn't the right place at all, said Dr. Andrea
Stone, Desert Samaritan's manager of business operations for the
emergency department. Desert Samaritan's ER is over &UR; capacity these
days. It's never been designated as a sexual assault center and
police should have known that, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But no one told that to Ferraro, her friend, or the Phoenix
officer on the case as they waited 3{ hours at Desert Samaritan.
They only found out when a hospital social worker led them into a
small waiting room and told them the hospital didn't have rape
kits. The victim, Ferraro said, exploded at the social worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know that I have been waiting for hours? Why didn't you
tell me that at the beginning?''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no good explanation, and the three drove to the
Mesa center.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, an associate professor of women's studies at Arizona
State University, can't believe such poor treatment still exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had resolved this,'' she said. ``I didn't think
things like this happened anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Flores.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after being turned away twice, she didn't want to take
her chances at a third hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I just wanted to give up and go home,'' she said.
``But the detective told me he couldn't do that. He wanted me to
get the exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just giving up hope, like nobody cares.''
</P>
<P>
   EASIER TO STAY SILENT
</P>
<P>
   Victim advocates wonder what happens to women who don't have
Flores' tenacity. National experts say that only 10 percent of
assaults are reported; the current chaos invites assaulted women to
remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 10 of the Valley's hospitals entered into loose
contracts with the county to provide exams. The County Attorney's
Office must pay for sexual assault exams when the victim wants to
prosecute and with the contracts, it could set a fixed fee and
control costs, Nannetti said.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the contracts only complicated services for
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals that once did the exams shied away, fearing they would
get victims from all across the Valley. Meanwhile, police and
advocates were confused about where to take victims, because some
hospitals without contracts intermittently offered to do the exams.
Others with contracts later dropped off the list.
</P>
<P>
   A notable no-show was Samaritan Health Systems, which had four
hospitals at the time. Taylor, of Good Samaritan, said doctors
talked with hospital administrators, explaining that the exams
could take hours and that staffers could spend days in court. Also,
the county was barely covering the exams' costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals that agreed to do the exams started seeing their
emergency rooms fill up with sexual assault victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeing people being brought from across town, and we
didn't think that was in the patients' best interests,'' said
Helander, of St. Joe's. Eventually, St. Joe's dropped out of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arrowhead Community Hospital, which had been doing
the exams for many West Valley communities, decided not to enter
into an agreement with the county. Officials feared that their
emergency room would be filled with sexual assault patients, said
Susie Melendez, a nurse and emergency room director.
</P>
<P>
   When Arrowhead dropped out, that left an even larger void in the
West Valley, where there are few hospitals. &QL; 
MESA CENTER A MODEL
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly 20 hospitals around the Valley say they will do
the exams. Parks, the victim services coordinator for Phoenix
police, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling you they do (the exams)?'' she said. ``I sure
hope they're following through with it, because it's certainly not
what we're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others say they can usually count on St. Luke's,
Maricopa Medical and the Mesa advocacy center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been turned away from the majority of the other ones,''
Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa center, opened by the Police Department in 1996, is
seen as a model for victim advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mesa police have seen an enormous change in three years: Rape
prosecutions have increased from 50 percent to 91 percent, said
Mesa police Sgt. Jon Terpay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, police from as far away as Glendale and Peoria prefer
the Mesa center, regardless of the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drive is nothing compared to what (problems) you can
create by walking into an ER,'' said Sgt. Bill Copeland, who heads
Glendale's sex crimes and family violence unit.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police opened their own center last year. Police
detectives have already moved in, but the exam room isn't ready
yet. Phoenix officials will open their version of the Mesa center
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the centers are open, victims won't go to emergency rooms
unless they are injured, under the proposal by the County
Attorney's Office. Their exams will be done by a specially trained
sexual assault nurse examiner _ SANE.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale Health System already has 10 nurses trained under the
SANE program. It was the only group to bid on the county's contract
to provide sexual assault exams. Even if it doesn't receive the
contract, Scottsdale's Osborn Road and Shea Boulevard hospitals
would become other designated centers.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates and police welcome the centers, but wonder if there
are enough to serve the entire Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 1,360 women and men got exams at hospital
emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern with the county's proposal: getting the word out
to police and hospital staffers _ a challenge given how poor
communications are now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a new system _ even one with possible flaws _ is long
overdue, police officers and advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Lt. Joe Yonner, who heads the sex crimes unit,
wants to get victims into advocacy centers for both the exam and
police interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victim who gets the runaround, they're pretty worn out. We
lose information that way,'' Yonner said.
</P>
<P>
   How victims react to their attack runs the gamut of emotions,
said Dr. Emily Pollack, one of two doctors at the Mesa center, who
recently treated a teenager who said she had to wait eight hours at
Chandler Regional Hospital for an exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be depressed and sad and angry at their
perpetrators,'' she said. ``(But) they are not angry at the system,
and they have a perfect right to be.'' &QL;

RETIRED COYOTE MAKES BIG SAVE IN CHILDBIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember  &UR; Darcy Wakaluk, the former backup goalie for the
Coyotes whose career was cut short two years ago because of knee
problems?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the recently retired puck stopper, who now runs a rock and
gravel company in Alberta, came up with the biggest save of his
life a couple of weeks ago. He had just left home to take his
children out for an afternoon of putt-putt golf when he got a call
on his cellular phone from his pregnant wife,  &UR; Dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Wakaluk made a U-turn and a beeline back to his mother-in-law's
house, where Dawn had called from. She had gone into labor. There
was no time to rush to the hospital. The baby was coming, and
someone had to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Dad did the honors, after a few frantic moments on the phone
with a 911 operator. The conversation went a little something like
this, according to family friends:
</P>
<P>
   Wakaluk: ``My wife's having a baby! . . . The head's coming out!
What do I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``The head's coming out?''
</P>
<P>
   Wakaluk: ``Yeah. . . . Wait a minute, it's out! What do I do
now?
</P>
<P>
   Operator: ``You have to tie off the cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakaluk: ``Tie it up with what?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he used the shoestrings from his boots and, luckily
for Dawn, Darcy kept his focus and made the glove save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came out so fast,'' he said later, ``I'm surprised I didn't
lose it through my five hole.''
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, little  &UR; Brock Wakaluk was welcomed into the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Darcy) did real well,'' Dawn Wakaluk said. ``He was a
little shaken up. . . . His hair was standing on end there for a
while. He was a basket case. But he did real well, and I'm very,
very proud of him.'' &QL; 
Meltdown in Motown
</P>
<P>
   Don't kid yourself. Detroit's elimination in the second round of
the playoffs by Colorado was as difficult for the two-time
defending Stanley Cup champions as it was for their legion of
die-hard fans, many of whom reside in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the middle of May, and we're done,'' forward  &UR; Martin
Lapointe said. ``But we're not machines, we're human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   All too human, it turns out, allowing the Avalanche to win four
straight to capture the series in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of empty and humbling,'' captain  &UR; Steve Yzerman
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Nieuwendyk of the Dallas Stars had to rub it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a much better team (in Colorado instead of
Detroit), in my mind,'' he said. ``They proved that in the last
series, and now we've got to go out and beat this team. After what
they did to Detroit, I don't think anybody's worried about Detroit
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And now there's the  &UR; Scotty Bowman Watch. Will the NHL's career
winningest coach decide he's finally had enough of the game and
retire? Detroit General Manager  &UR; Ken Holland said he was
``optimistic'' that Bowman, 65, will come back for at least one
more season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope Scotty will be back,'' Avalanche Coach  &UR; Bob
Hartley said. ``By coming back next year, Scotty would be starting
his fifth decade as a coach, and I don't think that ever will be
repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Red Wings center  &UR; Sergei Fedorov to lose any sleep
of Bowman bows out. Fedorov openly grumbled about his role and
supposed lack of ice time after the Red Wings were ousted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a new feeling,'' Fedorov said. ``I feel like, all the
potential I have, I didn't have a chance to use it all the way.'' &QL; 
4x4 rally
</P>
<P>
   Is it a coincidence, or is there something a lot more to the
fact that four of the NHL's very best goalies are the final four
left in the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastern Conference Finals, it's Buffalo's  &UR; Dominik Hasek
against Toronto's  &UR; Curtis Joseph, and in the Western Conference,
it's Colorado's  &UR; Patrick Roy against Dallas'  &UR; Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows just how important goaltending is to hockey
teams,'' Colorado's  &UR; Joe Sakic said. ``Obviously, we feel we have
the best one in the game right now. Especially this time of year.
But I don't think it's a coincidence that the four best goalies in
the game are in the (conference) finals right now. That's what it
takes to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   All four have super credentials and incredible stats, but many
NHL experts pick Roy as the best of the bunch right now. &QL; 
The rumor mill
</P>
<P>
   With the Coyotes, it's hard to predict anything. But the
whispers around the organization are that Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld
will be back next season, possibly with a one- or two-year contract
extension. An announcement of some sort should come down by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be closing its offices in north Scottsdale for six
straight days beginning Thursday, and it's doubtful General Manager
 &UR; Bobby Smith will want another full week of coaching rumors to
persist. Besides, it's time to pull the trigger, one way or the
other, and stop letting Schoenfeld twist in the wind. Unless, of
course, they've already privately told him he's coming back. Maybe
that's why Schoenfeld won't grant any interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes lose assistant coach  &UR; John Tortorella to another
NHL team _ his contract expires this summer along with fellow
assistant  &UR; Gordie Roberts _ one potential candidate might be
 &UR; Claude
 &UR; Julian, head coach of the Hull Olympiques, a Canadian junior team.
According to NHL sources, Smith likes the guy a lot.
</P>
<P>
   According to other sources, Tortorella is a candidate for jobs
in Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Vancouver. Roberts,
meanwhile, will take a group of 10 Phoenix prospects to Helsinki,
Finland, later this summer for a two-week training camp with the
Jokerit club. They wouldn't send him without a new contract, so
expect him to return next season with Schoenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   The word is out that free-agent-to-be  &UR; Mark Tinordi, a veteran
defenseman with the Washington Capitals, has purchased a home in
the Valley. Is it the first step to signing with the Coyotes this
summer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsday'' has reported that the New York Islanders, co-owned
by former Coyotes Owner  &UR; Steven Gluckstern, have an agreement to
build a new $300 million arena and that the deal is ``97 percent''
completed. &QL;

DISCOVER STATE'S TREASURES FOR MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Longtime residents of Arizona usually have their favorite
Memorial Day weekend retreats. They know the state. They know what
they have to do to assure a place at a favorite recreational site.
</P>
<P>
   I've been in Arizona for 22 years, most of it exploring Arizona.
Anyone who has lived here that long is almost a native. I see
bumper stickers that proclaim the driver is a ``Native.'' I demand
one that says ``Alien.'' We ``aliens'' far exceed the natives in
numbers, and that disparity will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Just because I wasn't born here and didn't understand the desert
when I first arrived, doesn't mean I haven't come to love it as
much as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to help recent arrivals, newcomers to the desert,
come to know it better so they can love it and protect it, too.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so here's the deal: You have talked to co-workers and
friends since you moved to Arizona. You've heard of the White
Mountains, the Mogollon Rim, the Grand Canyon, Oak Creek Canyon,
high-rolling, status cities such as Sedona, weird but charming old
mining towns such as Bisbee and wonder about something special for
Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   First, you must know that many accommodations in hot spots such
as Oak Creek near Sedona have been booked for at least a year. The
lodges are among the best anywhere. They'll cost upwards of $300 a
night. I'm not interested. Unless I can weasel a room on my expense
account, I can't afford it. My boss wouldn't allow that often.
</P>
<P>
   But for short-time residents of Phoenix, I can provide some
places that should be good even if no reservations have been made.
We'll do a couple of distant treasures, and the rest closer in.
</P>
<P>
   The first would be the North Kaibab Plateau that borders Utah to
the north. This is the north side of the Grand Canyon's North Rim.
You must understand that the North Rim is 1,000 feet higher than
the more popular and easier-to-reach South Rim. The views from the
north are unsurpassed. Fewer visitors, too. But reaching the North
from the Valley of the Sun takes longer than getting to the South.
It's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   You take Interstate 17 north to Flagstaff, join U.S. 89 there
and head north through the Navajo Reservation on U.S. 89. Then,
near Page, you take U.S. 89A, pass over the Colorado River at Lees
Ferry and continue to the top of the plateau. It's a journey from
desert to alpine country. The drive is at least five hours from
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The crossroads is at Jacob Lake. There isn't much of a lake, but
there's a motel, restaurant, campgrounds and other services. Great
place about 8,000 feet above sea level. From there, you can go
south toward the North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   The country is outstanding, full of evergreens and wonderful
beauty. No fire restrictions have been imposed there yet. The
sparse campgrounds are wonderful, but dispersed camping is allowed
in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   Now at the other end of the state, in southeastern Arizona near
the New Mexico border, lies the Chiricahua Mountains and Chiricahua
National Monument. The rock formations, trails and camping areas
make it among the best in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   This is a grasslands area with the mountains rising above it. It
is spectacular, normal stuff for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Its isolation from urban areas makes this a prime place. Take
Interstate 10 from Phoenix through Tucson and on southeast to
Willcox, where you'll turn off toward the monument. Willcox has
plenty of motels. You can go through the monument, pass over the
mountains to Portal on the eastern side. This is absolutely
wonderful country _ probably a little warm during the day but cool
at night. It is four or more hours from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of my favorite spots in Arizona, if you're willing to
hike 3.5 miles one way, is Fossil Creek Springs on the Mogollon
Rim. It is so desirable that I hiked into it twice in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The springs are located near Strawberry, which also is one my
favorite places because of the Strawberry Lodge, which offers rooms
without TVs and excellent food. The cost in reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is several hours from Phoenix and can be reached two
different ways. From northern Phoenix, take Interstate 17 north to
Camp Verde and take Gen. Crook Highway (State Route 260) to the top
of the Mogollon Rim and back down to Strawberry. The same trip can
be taken on State Route 87 off the Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Turn off the highway at the Strawberry Inn on Fossil Creek Road
and head east down the road to Fossil Creek. There are two
entrances to the spring. An upper parking lot takes you to a trail
head that goes down. At the bottom of the canyon, there is a
trailhead that goes up on a road to the springs.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same distance to the springs from either trailhead. The
lower one is easier, but I prefer the top one. It's tough, but the
view is outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The springs put out about a million gallons an hour. Part is
used for power generation, but that's downstream from the springs.
There are great pools to swim in, including ropes hung to trees
that allow swings out over the water. There are fire restrictions
in the area but plenty of pull-offs for camping.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I hiked in there was during the week. The pools
were so great I skinny-dipped in them, thinking no one was around.
On the way out that day, I met Boy Scout troops and hordes of other
individuals. I didn't know that. With luck, I never embarrassed
myself.
</P>
<P>
   No campfires, please.
</P>
<P>
   Stay in Payson and take a great drive. It's called Rim Road and
offers some of the best views off the Mogollon Rim anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Motels will be crowded so start calling now. Besides Payson,
Kohl's Ranch, various places in Christopher Creek and a motel in
Forest Lakes are fine places.
</P>
<P>
   From Payson, take State Route 260 northeast toward the Mogollon
Rim past Kohl's Ranch and Christopher Creek and up to the top of
the Rim. It's a beautiful drive.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the Rim, you'll see a left-hand turn to Woods
Canyon Lake. That's the Rim Road. A short stretch is paved. The
rest isn't.
</P>
<P>
   It'll take you past the lake and on a trip that gives you
spectacular views. It may be the prettiest drive in the Arizona
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It ultimately takes you out at State Route 87 north of
Strawberry, where you can go south to Payson.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a newcomers heaven. Enjoy it. &QL;

UNUSUAL TYPE OF SURGERY SAVES CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Suffering from cystic fibrosis, Misty Laird
faced a bleak future earlier this year because of her rapidly
deteriorating lungs.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to an unusual type of surgery, officials at USC
University Hospital say her future now looks bright.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Oregon woman received lung lobes from both of
her parents in a dramatic three-way surgery last month at the
hospital.

UNUSUAL TYPE OF SURGERY SAVES CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENT

<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Suffering from cystic fibrosis, Misty Laird
faced a bleak future earlier this year because of her rapidly
deteriorating lungs.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to an unusual type of surgery, officials at USC
University Hospital say her future now looks bright.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Oregon woman received lung lobes from both of
her parents in a dramatic three-way surgery last month at the
hospital.

GUN DEALERS CRITICIZE BILL ON BUYER CHECKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Gun collectors and dealers at a Glendale gun
show blasted Senate legislation approved last week requiring
mandatory background checks on all people who buy firearms at gun
shows, saying that it targets the wrong group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see crooks at gun shows,'' said Jerry Walter, a Los
Angeles resident who manufactures gun sights. ``These legislators
are going after the law-abiding citizens who buy guns and are
conducting legitimate business.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers at the Glendale Gun Show, held Saturday and Sunday at
the Glendale Civic Auditorium, said they support background checks
but pointed out that the Senate amendment merely duplicates
existing California laws. The amendment passed in a 51-50 vote
after Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws are just copycat laws,'' said Harold Corbin, a La
Puente gun dealer. ``The problem is (the government) doesn't
enforce the laws already on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, gun show dealers in California have been required to
conduct background checks on all gun purchasers. A minimum 10-day
wait is required while the background check is conducted. The law
was created by former Assemblywoman Paula Boland, R-Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun show people supported that bill because here in
California the gun show people truly wanted to deal firearms
responsibly,'' Boland said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Those at Saturday's event recognized that the gun show
amendment, part of a broader juvenile crime bill passed by the
Senate, was approved amid nationwide concern about youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at it in perspective,'' Corbin said. ``If
one person goes out and does something wrong, you can't go out and
punish everyone. And that's what the politicians are trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   When incidents like the Colorado school shooting occur, the
government scrambles to pass tough anti-violence legislation, but
laws such as the Senate amendment don't address the real problem,
Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a gun walk right down the street and shoot
someone. It's the nut behind the gun that's the problem, not the
gun,'' Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these politicians aren't going to be happy until they
take all guns from the people and the only people who will be left
with guns are the cops and the crooks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than create more gun laws, Corbin said parents and
schools should be more involved in children's lives to prevent
violence on school campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who come in here, most of them are hard-working,
everyday citizens,'' Corbin said. ``Gun control is good, but to a
certain extent. Do background checks, but I believe the government
should destroy the information once a person has been approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Very rarely does a gun purchaser complain about background
checks, Corbin said. Felons and those with certain misdemeanors on
their records such as spousal abuse are not allowed to carry guns,
Corbin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years that Glendale Gun Show promoter Conrad La
Grasta has been organizing gun shows, background checks have never
been an issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything being fixed with this amendment,'' La
Grasta said. ``If we got rid of guns, would that solve the problem?
The real question is, Why did this person use a gun, why did these
kids go nuts and use guns?''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, at an undercover sting operation at the Great
Western Gun Show in Pomona, state agents discovered a handful of
gun dealers selling weapons without performing background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who is pushing to pass two bills
that would increase gun show regulations, used the sting to argue
for more regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But the more gun show laws that are passed, the more it will
cost taxpayers, said Ron Gaines, an antique-gun collector and
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to cost millions for something that does absolutely
no good,'' said Gaines, who owns a transmission shop in Glendale.
``Gun laws are really a reaction to incidents that happen in
society.''

Astros extend Holt's bad luck
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After yet another loss and round of questions
about his frustrating start to the season, Chris Holt slipped into
the hallway for a chat with San Francisco Giants pitcher Russ
Ortiz, a young righthander for whom everything has fallen into
place in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder Holt hasn't fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 3-1 loss was void of his usual first-inning drama,
but with Holt's luck, you almost knew something else would stand
between him and his first win since Aug. 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That something happened to be a someone _ Ortiz, who made the
best-hitting lineup in the National League look like one of the
worst. Ortiz, who owns a league-leading 2.25 earned-run average to
go with his 6-2 record, limited the Astros to just three hits in 6
innings and left them feeling like they never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid pitched a great game,'' said Astros first baseman
Jeff Bagwell, who was 0-for-3. ``He just doesn't make mistakes. His
pitches are either on the black (corners of the plate) or on your
hands. It's pretty tough to beat a guy who's doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good composure, and he doesn't get rattled. Of course,
we didn't do much to rattle him. To be honest, I don't even think
we hit a ball hard against him.''
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a belief in baseball that facing an elite
pitcher can throw off a hitter's timing at the plate for the next
few days. There may be something to that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Since being shut down by Dodgers ace Kevin Brown on Wednesday in
Los Angeles, the Astros are hitting .142 and they are averaging a
mere 2.7 runs per game. They only have 17 hits during that stretch,
and they've struck out 25 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to score runs, and it just hasn't happened in the
last three games,'' Bagwell said. ``But I'll tell you what; this
was the best-pitched game we've seen in the last three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros wasted a well-pitched game by Holt, who has lost 12
of his last 13 decisions dating to 1997. The high-powered Astros
offense has only averaged 3.3 runs for Holt in those 12 losses. The
hard-luck righthander allowed three runs (two earned) on six hits
in six innings Saturday, but he moved no closer to the winner's
circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot I can say,'' Holt said. ``It gets old. I'm
tired of losing. I know the guys are busting their butts trying to
score some runs for me, and I know it's going to happen. It's just
one of those unlucky things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to shake it off. I know this team will score some
runs. There's only so long you can keep having bad things happen to
you. Unfortunately, my spot in the rotation has just been
unlucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros need a victory today to break even on the six-game
road trip, and they will send their more prosperous pitcher, Jose
Lima, to the mound. But even Lima would have had trouble sneaking
out of 3Com Park with a win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (0-6) escaped the first inning without allowing a run to
score, but he missed out on his first 1-2-3 first inning when
Armando Rios worked him for a two-out walk. Only three of the first
nine batters reached base against Holt, who didn't encounter his
first sign of trouble until the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   With third baseman Bill Spiers playing on the grass in
anticipation of a bunt, Giants leadoff hitter Melvin Benard goosed
a single past Spiers' diving reach.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like an insignificant occurrence until Benard went to
third on Bill Mueller's double and scored on a groundout by Rios.
Jeff Kent drove in another run with a sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holt had good stuff again,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``He made a few mistakes, but you can usually get away with
that with our offense. He gave up two runs in (the third), and in a
low-scoring game, two runs is a big inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller's wild throw to first after a grounder to third by Tim
Bogar set up the Astros' only run of the game. Bogar wound up at
second base on the play and scored on Craig Biggio's single to left
in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The first of Bogar's two errors in the game helped the Giants
increase their lead to two in the fifth. Rios reached first safely
on a routine grounder bobbled by Bogar, whose throw to first was
close, but not in time according to first-base umpire Jerry
Crawford. J.T. Snow doubled Rios home.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros only had one other legitimate scoring opportunity,
and that came in the seventh inning. Carl Everett led off with a
single, and Ortiz issued back-to-back two-out walks to Tony Eusebio
and Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker summoned lefthanded-hitting Jack Howell to pinch hit for
relief pitcher Trever Miller, prompting Giants manager Dusty Baker
to call lefty Alan Embree from the bullpen. Dierker switched to
Russ Johnson, who struck out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a pretty good situation there,'' Dierker
said. ``Johnson has a tendency to draw some walks and Embree has a
tendency to walk people. I thought we might get a run and get
Biggio to the plate, but it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, not much did.

AVALANCHE STEAL HOME-ICE ADVANTAGE FROM STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dallas Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher has seen this
look in Colorado goalie Patrick Roy's eyes before, a twinkling that
he gets when he's playing game-stealingly good.
</P>
<P>
   He had that look while winning two Stanley Cups in Montreal,
while winning a Cup in Colorado in 1996 and again while helping the
Avalanche to a 2-1 victory against the Stars in Game 1 of the
Western Conference finals Saturday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played really well,'' Hatcher said, ``but both goalies gave
their teams a chance to win. They took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy finished with 30 saves, and Stars goalie Ed Belfour had 26.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had save No. 27 sitting before him with less than six
minutes remaining in a 1-1 game. He went to pounce just as
Avalanche winger Valeri Kamensky began poking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went up in the air and Mo tried to hit it in the corner,''
Belfour explained. ``It was one of those reaction plays, and it
ended up in our net.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It went off my stick,'' Stars center Mike Modano confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Kamensky's game-winning goal went in with 5:58 remaining,
finishing the Avalanche's come-from-behind effort and extending
their road record in the playoffs to 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   His game-winning goal helped to ease Kamensky's anger after he
had an apparent second-period goal disallowed, touching off a
mini-maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 15 minutes to save the integrity of the game!''
Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix screamed to NHL off-ice
official Wally Harris between the second and third periods.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had ruled the puck didn't cross the goal line. Avalanche
officials argued the puck didn't cross the goal line because it was
stopped by the padding that surrounds the bottom of the net.
</P>
<P>
   When the announcement was made that the goal had been
disallowed, Avalanche winger Claude Lemieux banged his stick
against the glass where the goal judge sits.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different Colorado team from that point on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had a goal. They probably did,'' Stars
defenseman Craig Ludwig said.''I'm sure that got them fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche center Peter Forsberg scored almost 10 minutes later
to tie the game at 1-1. He poked a rebound past Belfour with 5:53
remaining in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   An Avalanche goal looked to be just a matter of time, Stars
players said. They said they felt the game slipping away before
that. The Avalanche was skating well, generating a lot of chances.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the first period where the Stars looked to
be in firm control. They outshot the Avalanche 14-9 in the first
period and left with a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was the typical Dallas goal of late _ hardworking and
from the stick of Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado defenseman Adam Foote attempted to reverse puck, and
Modano intercepted along the boards. Roy had been heading behind
the net to get the puck and found himself in no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   A flick of Modano's wrist and a simple tap by Brett Hull
standing alone in front of the net and the Stars had a lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have to do some of the same things to generate
some type of offensive production,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances were plentiful, especially late, for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Stars players peppered Roy with 31 shots in all.
</P>
<P>
   No. 29 was by Jamie Langenbrunner with less than 60 seconds
remaining and Roy just barely pushed it wide. No. 30 was a rebound
by Benoit Hogue cradled in Roy's pads.
</P>
<P>
   He had that look going. He was feeling it, ready to steal
another series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let a goaltender beat us,'' Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor said.
</P>
<P>
   So how exactly do they beat him in Game 2?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, more shots, I guess,'' Sydor said. ``I guess we had
opportunities. We had chances. We had our chances. We just didn't
have second and third chances. That's what it is going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   They get another chance Monday night. nn

RAINING CATS AND . . . MORE CATS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman named Mary Reed is on my answering machine saying she
has a son with cancer and needs help. In a wavering voice, she
appeals not only to my news judgment, but to my hu manity. She's
frightened. Broken-hearted. Grasping at straws.
</P>
<P>
   I have no choice but to give her the brushoff.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, I'll call her back.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen wondrous results when news organizations publicize the
plight of par ents with ill or injured children. Miracles are
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But only when the timing's right.
</P>
<P>
   And near as I can tell, it's all wrong for Mary. The local news
has featured a suc cession of stories lately about ailing young
people and their families.
</P>
<P>
   And, while we pretend to care about each and every needy child,
the truth is, the sad stories wear us down. We can't deal with a
new one every day. So I con tact Mary with the idea of listening to
what she has to say, then politely declin ing to write about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspaper has done some won derful things for people in
need,'' she says. ``There are so many good people out there willing
to help other people. That's what I'm looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Is money a problem? she is asked.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance troubles?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Is her employer being uncooperative? Are the doctors giving her
the runaround? Has the hospital treated her badly? Does her son
need an organ do nor?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the support I need from my work and my family,''
Mary says. ``The doctors are great. The insurance company has done
its job. It's nothing like that. All I need help with are my pets _
my cats.'' &QL; 
WORLD UPSIDE DOWN
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Mary's 18-year-old son, Kris Ridlon, came
home com plaining of a backache. He worked at a restaurant and
thought he'd injured him self lifting a box of frozen pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Many uncomfortable tests later, Mary and her husband, Rick, were
told Kris had a rare form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our world was turned upside down,'' Mary says. ``Everything,
now, is focused on making Kris well. And for that, we must find
homes for the cats.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Mary's grandson brought home a stray. Her
daughter is al lergic to cats, though, so Mary took it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we got Samson,'' she says. Who was followed,
shortly after wards, by Delilah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never my intention to become someone who rescues
strays,'' Mary says. ``But if they come your way, and you be lieve
in preserving life, and you want to put those beliefs into
practice, what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   You take in Hersey and Harvey. And Leo and Cleo. And Cody and
Jerry and Juliet. And three-legged Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   Until the number of humans living in your house is three, and
the number of cats is 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' Mary says, ``things changed because Kris' immune
system has been depleted by chemotherapy and radiation, making him
at risk for infection. So we've decided to find homes for most of
the cats.'' &QL; 
`EACH ONE IS LOVED'
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't want to take them to a shelter, if she can help it.
Almost all of them have been spayed or neutered, she says. Most
have had their shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one,'' Mary says, ``is loved.''
</P>
<P>
   She's spent the past three weeks at Kris' bedside at Good
Samaritan Regional Medical Center, where he's undergoing treatment.
Because of that, she asks anyone inter ested in adopting one of the
cats to con tact her through the pager she wears at all times. The
number is 613-7562.
</P>
<P>
   What if no one calls? she is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have faith,'' she says. ``You've got to believe
in people. You've got to cherish life and count on the possi bility
of good things happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her cats getting adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Like her son getting well.
</P>
<P>
   Like a guy who wasn't interested in doing another ``sick kid''
story getting snookered. &QL;

   I have no choice but to give her the brushoff.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, I'll call her back.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen wondrous results when news organizations publicize the
plight of par ents with ill or injured children. Miracles are
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But only when the timing's right.
</P>
<P>
   And near as I can tell, it's all wrong for Mary. The local news
has featured a suc cession of stories lately about ailing young
people and their families.
</P>
<P>
   And, while we pretend to care about each and every needy child,
the truth is, the sad stories wear us down. We can't deal with a
new one every day. So I con tact Mary with the idea of listening to
what she has to say, then politely declin ing to write about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspaper has done some won derful things for people in
need,'' she says. ``There are so many good people out there willing
to help other people. That's what I'm looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Is money a problem? she is asked.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance troubles?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Is her employer being uncooperative? Are the doctors giving her
the runaround? Has the hospital treated her badly? Does her son
need an organ do nor?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the support I need from my work and my family,''
Mary says. ``The doctors are great. The insurance company has done
its job. It's nothing like that. All I need help with are my pets _
my cats.'' &QL; 
WORLD UPSIDE DOWN
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Mary's 18-year-old son, Kris Ridlon, came
home com plaining of a backache. He worked at a restaurant and
thought he'd injured him self lifting a box of frozen pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Many uncomfortable tests later, Mary and her husband, Rick, were
told Kris had a rare form of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our world was turned upside down,'' Mary says. ``Everything,
now, is focused on making Kris well. And for that, we must find
homes for the cats.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Mary's grandson brought home a stray. Her
daughter is al lergic to cats, though, so Mary took it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we got Samson,'' she says. Who was followed,
shortly after wards, by Delilah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never my intention to become someone who rescues
strays,'' Mary says. ``But if they come your way, and you be lieve
in preserving life, and you want to put those beliefs into
practice, what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   You take in Hersey and Harvey. And Leo and Cleo. And Cody and
Jerry and Juliet. And three-legged Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   Until the number of humans living in your house is three, and
the number of cats is 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' Mary says, ``things changed because Kris' immune
system has been depleted by chemotherapy and radiation, making him
at risk for infection. So we've decided to find homes for most of
the cats.'' &QL; 
`EACH ONE IS LOVED'
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't want to take them to a shelter, if she can help it.
Almost all of them have been spayed or neutered, she says. Most
have had their shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one,'' Mary says, ``is loved.''
</P>
<P>
   She's spent the past three weeks at Kris' bedside at Good
Samaritan Regional Medical Center, where he's undergoing treatment.
Because of that, she asks anyone inter ested in adopting one of the
cats to con tact her through the pager she wears at all times. The
number is 613-7562.
</P>
<P>
   What if no one calls? she is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have faith,'' she says. ``You've got to believe
in people. You've got to cherish life and count on the possi bility
of good things happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her cats getting adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Like her son getting well.
</P>
<P>
   Like a guy who wasn't interested in doing another ``sick kid''
story getting snookered. &QL;

HARD WORK IS SECRET TO COLORADO'S SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DALLAS _ An ugly word applies:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Outworked.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a label that hung from Stars necks last night as Game 1
of the NHL's Western Conference finals took a frantic third-period
tilt toward Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Score tied, game on the line, and the Avalanche shifted into a
forechecking frenzy that caught the Stars with anvils on their
skates and sticks. Or so it looked.
</P>
<P>
   No, Colorado wasn't on repeated power plays. It just seemed that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Belfour survived a couple of rough waves, but finally saw
the puck sweep past him and into the strings. With just under six
minutes remaining, the Avalanche had earned _ emphasize earned'' _
another large playoff road win, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   And with it, goes all the momentum relocation that occurs when
home-ice advantage is lost in the first game of a series. Monday
night's Game 2 at Reunion just became double pressurized for the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Also add an additional worry for the local lads. They were
beaten last night at their own game _ discipline, patience and
forcing turnovers in the other end _ which is what the third-period
goal by Valeri Kamensky was all about. Assists on the game winner
should have gone to all four Colorado lines, and each set of
defensemen. All helped it happen by wearing down the Stars during a
five-minute third-period surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept working at keeping the puck deep on them,'' said
Colorado's Peter Forsberg, who continued his playoff blitz by tying
the game in the second period. ``The little things are going to win
this series,'' he added. ``That means pressure like we had \Rin the
third period\S, plus not turning over the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded like one of Ken Hitchcock's constant sermons. The
first period had gone by Hitchcock's script, as Dallas was the
dominant team and had a 1-0 lead to show for it. The second period
was a repeat of the St. Louis series, with a full-blown controversy
thrown in. But the Avalanche won the 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Dallas appeared to have the jump in the third
period, but...
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the puck was being dumped in on Belfour, and it took
forever to leave the zone. Beginning at the 10-minute mark,
Avalanche sharp-shooters pounded away on three different shifts,
and finally, Kamensky took a belt-high swing at his own rebound
which had bounced in the air off Belfour. This time he didn't miss.
</P>
<P>
   With desperation creeping in, the Stars created that same kind
of forechecking storm in the final five minutes. Patrick Roy,
however, was sensational, and the Colorado road record in the
postseason climbed to a very serious 7-zip.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this conference finals opener provided outstanding
entertainment, along with the expected Belfour-Roy duel. And to top
off the hockey portion of the evening, the Reunion press box also
had fireworks, centering around a controversial no-goal ruling on a
Kamensky deflection past Belfour in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Play stopped as the Avalanche celebrated on the ice, except the
goal light never came on. (In case anyone asks, the goal judges
were from Phoenix, and obviously the guy on that one end was not
named Roenick.) The referees went upstairs to the replay judge, who
finally ruled ``no goal,'' shocking the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The puck appeared to graze the post, hit the bumper padding that
sits on the ice inside the goal, and bounce out. For one thing, the
padding had been placed too close to the post, and was cut back
after the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But between periods, Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix
tried unsuccessfully to storm the off-limits replay booth, and then
collared the league's supervisor of officials, Wally Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix apparently thought he had discovered another
grassy-knoll conspiracy theory in Dallas. He demanded the right to
speak immediately with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, and
repeatedly ordered Harris to get Bettman on the phone. ``The
integrity of the game is at stake,'' Lacroix yelled at Harris.
``We've got 15 minutes \Rthe time between periods\S to save the
integrity of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   As those two exchanged heated words, here came Stars general
manager Bob Gainey, looking like he might want to take Lacroix hard
into the boards. ``Wally, this area is off-limits,'' Gainey told
Harris, harshly.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Gainey wanted Lacroix moved away from the replay
booth _ like right now. And with Gainey in no mood to be debated,
Lacroix meekly moved, although in the end, he got his justice, and
Kamensky got his goal.
</P>
<P>
   The team that worked the hardest in the third period was the
team that won.

AFTER ONE LAPSE, ROY PROVIDES STONE WALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DALLAS _ Patrick Roy, the Avalanche's all-world goalie, can stop
shots from all angles and at all speeds when he's between the
pipes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He did it last night, turning aside 30 Stars shots.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to make a save when you stray, and that's how the
Stars scored their only goal.
</P>
<P>
   Roy, who has a tendency to liven up the proceedings by straying
from his crease to play the puck, allowed a goal in the first
period because he wasn't anywhere near the goal.
</P>
<P>
   He went behind it, anticipating that the puck was coming around
the boards, but it never got there. Mike Modano intercepted it, and
with Roy out of position, threw it in front to Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had one of the easiest goals of his career, throwing it
into an empty net from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad play by me,'' said Roy, who allowed a
first-period goal for the first time since Game 3 of the conference
semifinals against the Detroit Red Wings. ``I had no business being
behind my net. I just wanted to help back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy could chuckle about it after the game because when he stayed
where he was supposed to be, he was his usual brilliant self.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped 17 shots after the first period, including some tough
chances in the final two minutes when the Stars desperately tried
to get the equalizer. Overall, he stopped 30 of 31 shots, his sixth
consecutive game with at least 30 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great,'' Roy said. ``I was moving very well in my
net.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy said he was motivated by the first-period gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really mad at myself, and it gave me a boost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a continuation of his work in the Red Wings series, when
he was a big factor as Colorado came back from a 0-2 deficit to win
four consecutive games. Roy had a .954 save percentage and 1.75
goals-against average in those victories.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a weakness in his game, it was a failure to control
rebounds. Several times he would rush a shot and the puck would
tantalizingly sit in front of his crease, but the Avalanche defense
was able to clear the pucks before the Stars could get to them.
</P>
<P>
   Roy continued to increase his teammates' blood pressure by doing
his imitation of the Avalanche's fancy, puck-handling forwards.
</P>
<P>
   He was trapped behind the net by Pat Verbeek late in the second
period, but the Stars couldn't get a shot off this time, and did it
again in the third period with traffic buzzing around.
</P>
<P>
   Roy said he had to continue to do it because the Stars continued
to play dump and chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dumping soft, and it's a tough building to play in
because the glass is so soft,'' he said. ``I felt I could help my
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy helped more when he stayed put, and he did that enough to
let his team win.

DODGERS OUTSLUG SLUGGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The folks came to see Mark McGwire put on a home
run show. He did. Big Mac hit two homers, including one out of
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was the main attraction, but the Los Angeles Dodgers'
bats put on quite a display themselves. The Dodgers wracked up 14
hits and beat the St. Louis Cardinals 10-7 in front of a
season-high 54,179 on Saturday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth homered for the first time in more than a
year and Raul Mondesi added to his National League lead with his
16th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   You figure it had to be this type of game since Darren Dreifort
started for the Dodgers. When the right-hander is on the mound runs
are scored. Not necessarily against Dreifort, but rather on his
behalf. He had the eighth-best run-support of any pitcher in the
National League, and nothing happened Saturday to change that.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's first homer was a towering shot to left-center field,
but his two-run blast in the top of the eighth inning to
left-center dwarfed it.
</P>
<P>
   The 484-foot homer off Jamie Arnold cleared the roof of the
bleachers, the third player to accomplish the feat. Willie Stargell
did it twice and Mike Piazza, who did it Sept. 21, 1997, are the
other two. It was McGwire's 12th homer of the season and the 55th
time in his career he's hit two in one game.
</P>
<P>
   It brought the Cardinals within 9-7, but Mondesi homered with
one out in the eighth to push the Dodgers lead to 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (5-2) was neither dazzling nor disastrous, but he did
provide six innings in which he allowed five runs on six hits.
Dreifort walked three and struck out six in tying Kevin Brown for
the team lead in wins.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jeff Shaw, who blew his last two saves, walked a
tightrope in the ninth. He allowed a two-out single and walked
McGwire to bring Ray Lankford to the plate. Lankford homered in the
ninth to beat the Dodgers on Sunday in St. Louis, but Shaw got his
ninth save when Lankford lined out to first to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored for Dreifort. Each member of the starting
lineup had at least one hit and by scoring nine runs in the first
five innings increased his run-support to nearly one run per inning
he's pitched. The Dodgers have scored 41 runs in the 47 innings
Dreifort has thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Long called a pitcher's park, the first two months of the season
have gone a long way in ruining the reputation of Chavez Ravine.
During the last three seasons there were 1.6 homers hit per game at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the second game of the series with the Cardinals, the
Dodgers and their opponents had hit 67 homers in 22 games, more
than three per game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire made sure the new-fangled trend continued when he hit a
towering homer to left-center field in the top of the first to put
St. Louis ahead 1-0. It was the first time McGwire homered at
Dodger Stadium, though too much has been made of that. McGwire
missed last year's series in Los Angeles with an injury and was
playing here for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
   It was McGwire's 11th homer of the season, and it leaves
Cincinnati's Cinergy Field the lone major-league ballpark at which
McGwire hasn't homered.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' lead was short-lived behind the lackluster
pitching of starter and loser Clint Sodowsky (0-1), who allowed the
Dodgers to score five times in the bottom of the inning. The
initial blow came via Hollandsworth, making his first career start
at first base. He hit a two-run homer to right to give the Dodgers
a 2-1 lead, his first homer since May 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp Cromer added an infield single with the bases loaded and
Dreifort contributed a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added a run in the second on an RBI single from Dave
Hansen to go ahead 6-1, but St. Louis went back to the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria and McGwire singled to begin the fourth inning
and Lankford doubled in a run. Fernando Tatis, who hit a pair of
grand slams in the same inning during his last visit to Los
Angeles, then smacked his 13th homer of the season. The three-run
shot was his fifth homer of the season against the Dodgers. It
pulled St. Louis within 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi tripled in a run in the fourth and then scored on Todd
Hundley's single to make it 8-5. Devon White scored on a wild pitch
in the fifth inning to give the Dodgers a 9-5 lead.

LAKERS ONE LOSS FROM ELIMINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It started, as it always does, with the
little things. A stupid foul here, a rushed shot there, a pass that
should have been made. And it ended, as it usually does, with a
complete meltdown _ the result of too many mistakes strung together
at exactly the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the Los Angeles Lakers frittered away Game 3 of the
conference semifinals Saturday, allowing the San Antonio Spurs to
take a 103-91 victory at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the Lakers, all talent and bravado but still short
on wisdom, find themselves down 0-3 in a series for the second
straight postseason.
</P>
<P>
   No one had to remind them that no team in NBA history has come
back from such a deficit. They know all too well because they have
lived the statistic.
</P>
<P>
   And somehow haven't learned from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have played with our lives on the line,'' Rick Fox
said, ``and I don't think we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers played like the team that squandered leads
in Games 1 and 2 at the Alamodome. Same inconsistency, same lapses,
same results.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's Tim Duncan went unchecked for 37 points. Jaren
Jackson scored a career playoff-high 22 off the bench. And yet the
Lakers still had a one-point lead with less than two minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   But a 91-90 lead became a four-point deficit when the Spurs
scored five straight. Then the panicky Lakers abandoned their
offense in a rush to get it all back at once _ and instead got
nothing. San Antonio scored the last 13 points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said it never should have come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being at home doesn't guarantee you a win,'' he said. ``They
came in obviously up 2-0, loose, free, confident. And we came out
and didn't match that and played as if we were up 2-0....
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you let it come to a situation where they have a
chance to win that game at the end.... I think we all in this
locker room make enough money to go down fighting. You don't wait
to Game 4 to go down fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the second straight May, that's what it's come down to
for the Lakers. Only this time, they didn't wait for the conference
finals to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, they simply enticed and teased, showing signs of
their immense talent before conceding to the opponent's superior
poise and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   A Kobe Bryant 3-pointer staked the Lakers to an 81-77 lead with
6:52 to go, on a play that showed them at their best. Glen Rice
drove baseline, then kicked the ball out to Robert Horry, who swung
it to Bryant for the open shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Horry's flagrant foul on David Robinson let the Spurs come
back and tie the game at 81-81, and the Lakers began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   They took their last lead at 91-90, on an Horry 3-pointer with
1:55 remaining. They never scored again. A slow defensive rotation
let Jackson hit a 3-pointer, Avery Johnson followed with a 19-foot
jumper, and with 1:10 left, down 95-91, the Lakers lost their poise
for good.
</P>
<P>
   A Rice 3-point try bounced over the backboard with less than a
minute to go, but the Lakers had one last chance to recover. It
ended when Bryant drove too hard toward the baseline, trying to
turn the corner on Jackson, and instead lost his balance and the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of beating ourselves,'' said O'Neal, who scored
22 points but was upset after getting just two shots in the fourth.
``We always talk about it, but we've gotta get the ball in the
hands of the right people, and we've gotta take smart shots, and
we're just not doing it. I'm very frustrated. It's a shame that
we're down 0-3 in this series. It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Lakers played several stretches at their highest
level. Rice, Bryant and O'Neal all scored 20 points or more, and
Derek Fisher steadily guided the offense with 9 assists and 13
points. But the offensive precision was lost in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On several occasions, for periods of the game, we did some
things very nicely out there,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``But
turnovers once again killed us. Some quick shots hurt us throughout
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A near-empty locker room said more than any Laker could, and
most chose to say nothing at all. The talkative Fisher pushed
silently by reporters. J.R. Reid and Robert Horry left quickly. Fox
had to be enticed to come back to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Those who spoke tried desperately not to concede the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of fight left in us,'' Rice vowed. A comeback
from 0-3? ``It seems impossible, but it's not. We've got all the
motivation in the world. We lose, it's gonna be a long summer.
Teams don't like being swept, and that's another reason we
definitely should be motivated to put something together.''

HEY COACH, IT'S NOT OUR FAULT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Finally, a Los Angeles Lakers coach has
identified the problem, the reason the team is failing yet again to
meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Us guys. The writers. The Media.
</P>
<P>
   How did he find out?
</P>
<P>
   It's true, before the season, the newspaper guys held a
writers-only meeting. The topic: new ways to make the Lakers
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about if we don't allow them to grow?'' somebody said, six
beers into the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worked before,'' somebody else said through a mouthful of
pretzel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's resolve: Warning signs of growth are to be shared with
the group so that said growth may be headed off,'' suggested a man
in a plaid jacket, banging a hotel-logo ballpoint pen on the table
like a gavel. ``Everybody in?''
</P>
<P>
   And so the plan was agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   How could we have known it would work so well?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, still making the mistakes that once threatened to
keep them out of the NBA playoffs entirely, are a game from being
swept from the postseason a round earlier than last year after
their 103-91 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, his interim head-coaching job looking more ``interim''
by the day, didn't wait for the game to be played before pleading
for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have to understand,'' he said during a pregame news
conference, responding to a writer's question about Glen Rice and
ball movement. ``It's a very hard point to get across to you guys
that the development process of a team does not happen overnight.
Without practice time, it's hard to make sure that everybody ... is
best utilized in the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar theme: The Lakers' starting lineup has played only 17
games together. Glen Rice and J.R. Reid joined the team in
mid-March. The compressed schedule allowed less practice time....
</P>
<P>
   Rambis used the tight-knit Indiana Pacers as examples of how
you'd like it to work. When Mark Jackson drives the lane, he can
flip a blind pass to Reggie Miller because he knows where Reggie
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team hasn't developed into that yet. We will at some point
in time,'' Rambis said. ``But because we are in such a tremendous
media spotlight, you guys are not allowing us to grow and develop,
you're assuming that all of this stuff (just happens)....''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis conceded high expectations are ``not necessarily unique''
to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``nobody's following the Pistons or the Bulls or the Rockets
while they're growing into champions,'' he said, obviously not
having spent long in Detroit, Chicago and Houston. ``Nobody's
putting pressure on them to do that, or analyzing them and
dissecting all the little things that they (do), because no one's
expecting them to get to that level....
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of pressures and expectations for the
Houston Rockets, too. But they, like us, realize it's not easy to
do those things, to bring in a superstar ballplayer and _ voila _
everything works. It doesn't happen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As for the original question, about Rice's repeated criticism of
the Lakers offense: ``You guys prod him (to complain),'' Rambis
contended. ``You guys !ital!do!off!. It's part of your process that
you guys do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So who prodded Rambis to complain?
</P>
<P>
   Why did he think whining about ``expectations'' would help him
or his team?
</P>
<P>
   Was Rambis trying to whip up an us-against-them mentality for
his players? If so, it isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers guard Derek Harper said after Saturday's defeat the
expectations are ``not necessarily'' unfair: ``There are
expectations for this team because it's a good basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Rambis trying to win sympathy from fans? If so, does he
expect anybody to feel sorry for the franchise with the best
combination of talent (Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, etc.), brains
(Jerry West) and money (Jerry Buss) in pro basketball?
</P>
<P>
   If high expectations come from anywhere in particular, it's not
the press room. It's the Forum wall that bears the Lakers'
championship banners, and it's the front office that's impatient
for a title after a decade-long drought.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have gotten used to Rambis' sarcasm. It was refreshing
at first. People want to root for the old Lakers cult hero. Poor
guy, thrown into a situation like this, to deal with Dennis Rodman
and a major trade and a truncated schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, as he grows weary of his role as team spokesman, his
sarcasm sounds bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Writer (recently): ``With the playoffs coming up ... are you
concerned about Shaq's free-throwing?''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis (reading more into the question than was intended): ``OK,
I won't play him anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on that day to complain ``you guys'' are going to overdo
the Shaq's-free-throws angle.
</P>
<P>
   Most head coaches stay on the job for more than 45 games before
souring.
</P>
<P>
   Today is No. 46 for Rambis. That might be all he gets.
</P>
<P>
   Because if this is the way a coach reacts to simple questions
from reporters in the pregame peace and quiet of a locker room,
it's no surprise he can't find the answers in a sideline huddle
with fans screaming and a season at stake.

MAGIC IS CLEAR: L.A. FAILS IN FINAL MINUTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK 
and STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ As per tradition, dejected Los Angeles
Lakers fans left in droves long before the final buzzer Saturday.
But Magic Johnson stayed in his courtside seat until the bitter
end, then gave his bitter assessment of the Lakers' latest playoff
collapse _ a 103-91 loss to San Antonio that left them down 0-3 in
the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played dumb in the last two minutes of the last two
games. I've never seen us do that before,'' said the leader of the
Lakers' ``Showtime'' era, now a part-owner. ``What happens the last
couple minutes with us? We take an ill-advised 3-pointer, then
mistakes, mistakes, mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing in San Antonio (in Game 2). We gotta get
together. We gotta get together mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear which errant 3-point try Johnson referred to _
Derek Fisher's with 1:30 left or the three 3-point misses by Glen
Rice in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson was absolutely clear in his feelings about Robert
Horry's costly flagrant foul on David Robinson with 6:30 to go. The
Lakers were up 81-77 when Horry punched Robinson in the chest as
they battled for position. Robinson made both free throws, the
Spurs retained possession, and Robinson dunked to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up, we've got all the momentum going, and what do we do?
A flagrant foul,'' Johnson said. ``Why do we do that? Why? We've
got the game, and then (throw it away). That's a four-point play,
you know what I'm saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything, we just compounded. We do something good, we turn
around and do something bad. We do something good, we turn around
and do something bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Johnson turned to get into his limo, but first exchanged
consoling words with a season-ticket holder. ``I know,'' Johnson
told him, ``I'm as sick as you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's bad bounce: For the second straight game Kobe Bryant
had a chance to save the Lakers but faltered. In Game 2 it was two
missed free throws. On Saturday, it was his turnover with 33.2
seconds left, the Lakers down by four.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant tried to drive to the baseline to beat Jaren Jackson but
lost his balance and the ball, effectively killing the Lakers' last
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking too far ahead, that's all,'' he said. ``When I drive,
I can kind of visualize a picture of what's gonna happen before it
happens.... Sometimes you kind of run ahead of yourself....
Sometimes when that happens, you lose the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's miscue wasn't the only one, just the last in a series
for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of inexperience and not executing our
sets,'' he said. ``That goes back to the start of the season,
working at execution and being efficient.''

LAKERS BOUND TO BE OUT AT THIS RATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The good news is there's a remedy for what
ails the Los Angeles Lakers. The bad news is there's no way the
players can complete an Outward Bound course before today's
must-win game against the San Antonio Spurs in their best-of-seven
Western Conference semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Damn, those NBA schedule-makers. You can bet they'll be
Shaquille O'Neal's next target, once he tires of whining about the
officiating and his lack of touches in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Shaq: Your teammates will give you the ball in the final
moments of a close game as soon as they can trust you at the
free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   At this point they'd sooner hop in a raft in O'Neal and roar
down a raging rapid than look to him to bail them out at the foul
line.
</P>
<P>
   There's no getting around the trust issue. It's like the
elephant on the court that everyone pretends not to see.
</P>
<P>
   Trust, not the Spurs' terrific tag-team of David Robinson and
Tim Duncan, was the difference Saturday in Game 3 of the
best-of-seven series. San Antonio had it, the Lakers did not, and
that basically tells the story of the Spurs' 103-91 win in front of
a Forum sellout crowd of 17,505.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again in the fourth quarter the Spurs showed complete
faith in the perimeter shooting of Avery Johnson and Jaren Jackson,
never mind that they had combined for five points in the first
half. Pressed into prominence because of the Lakers' doubling and
tripling of Duncan (his 24 points in the opening 24 minutes got
their attention), Jackson contributed 13 points in the final 12
minutes. Johnson added six more to underscore the glaring
difference between the No. 1-seeded Spurs and the fourth-seeded
Lakers:
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have complete confidence in one another while every
Laker has utter confidence in himself.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder the Lakers look like a band of mercenaries
fighting an efficient army? Glen Rice and J.R. Reid, two-fifths of
the Lakers' starting lineup, joined the team in mid-March. That was
time enough for a little over two dozen games and oh, about a week
of productive practices thanks to the shortened season's
spandex-tight schedule.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Duncan's two years on the Spurs qualify him as an
old-timer. If he seems mature beyond his 23 years, perhaps it's
because he arrived in San Antonio via Wake Forest, where he stayed
long enough to earn a psychology degree.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' youngest starter, 20-year-old Kobe Bryant, would be
a junior in college if he hadn't decided to go straight from high
school to the NBA. Bryant is like the math genius who can't balance
his checkbook; he has the ability to make the ridiculously
difficult play look effortless and yet the simple concepts trip him
up.
</P>
<P>
   Little things such as passing the ball when you're triple-teamed
instead of taking the shot. Bryant was guilty of that late in the
third quarter, with the Lakers leading 56-54, and the Spurs got the
ball and a piece of the lead when the Spurs' Jackson drained one of
his jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of playing within yourself. Bryant
committed three of his four turnovers in the fourth quarter. Twice
in the final six minutes he tried to turn a simple play into a
spectacular one. Both times a basket would have brought the Lakers
to within two of the Spurs. Both times he turned the ball over and
the Spurs padded their lead at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Bryant's turnovers was a comeback killer as the
Lakers were down to their final 32.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking too far ahead,'' Bryant said of his turnovers.
``My mind was ahead of my body.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's problem has always been the opposite. His basketball
mind has yet to catch up to his body. Try as he might, he can't see
that sometimes the Lakers would be better off if he'd take pride in
something other than scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Oh what it were if coach Kurt Rambis had been the one to say,
``He understands you make double teams pay by involving your
teammates and he's willing to do that. That helps a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, that was Spurs coach Gregg Popovich talking about Duncan,
who finished with four assists on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal? He has two assists in the three games.
</P>
<P>
   Say this about O'Neal; his free-throw shooting showed some
improvement. After making 20 percent of his foul shots in Game 2,
he converted 57 percent on Saturday. Only three of O'Neal's seven
foul shots in the fourth quarter fell. That's why as long as the
Spurs have a player with a foul to give in crunch time, O'Neal, his
wondrous size notwithstanding, is a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Take away their obvious go-to guy and the Lakers look lost.
Indeed, you'd have to go to a comedy club to find more
improvisation than the Lakers provided in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly ugly sequence, Rice reached in on Duncan _ a
really silly foul _ and atoned for it by making a bad pass at the
other end. He also missed a couple of shots in the final minute (he
was 2 for 8 in the quarter) and was victimized on defense a couple
of times by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry passed up shots he made without thinking during his
championship run with Houston in 1994 and 1995. He made the only
shot he took in the final 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And Bryant was 2 for 4 with those three turnovers. Veteran point
guard Derek Harper, who sat the entire fourth quarter, said,
``We're so talented, we sometimes try to do things that are
difficult instead of keeping it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Lakers don't need to spend four days roughing it in
the Rocky Mountains to learn the finer points of teamwork and group
decision-making. Maybe their Outward Bound experience is taking
place right here, right now, with the Spurs serving as the
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they make a few forward strides today, the Lakers have
wandered so deep into the wilderness you have to wonder how long
it's going to take them to find their way to daylight.

DE LA HOYA HOLDS UP HIS END OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oscar De La Hoya promised before Saturday night's
engagement with Oba Carr that he was going back to being the Oscar
De La Hoya he was before his promoter, Bob Arum, began bringing in
trainers like Emanuel Steward, Jesus Rivero and Gil Clancy to work
with him.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall that Oscar De La Hoya earlier in his career
aggressively pursued opponents, seldom danced and usually wound up
with spectacular knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that version of Oscar De La Hoya made a stirring return to
old form before 11,528 fans at the Mandalay Bay Events Center on
the way to a violent knockout of Oba Carr at the 55-second mark of
the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   Carr was expected to be nothing more than a forgotten footnote
in De La Hoya's Sept. 18 date of destiny against the world's other
undefeated welterweight, Felix Trinidad and, oh, was he!
</P>
<P>
   From the first round, this was a different Oscar De La Hoya than
the cautious one of recent vintage who so often showed moments of
timidity against the likes of Ike Quartey, Pernell Whitaker and
Julio Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   This Oscar De La Hoya wore an evil scowl on his face from the
opening moments when he relentlessly went after Carr with a barrage
of left hooks, one of which sent Carr careening haplessly to the
mat.
</P>
<P>
   This Oscar De La Hoya never stopped shadowing his quarry,
pounding Carr round after round in a competitively one-sided fight
in which De La Hoya's superior power and quickness proved to be
simply too much for his game Detroit opponent.
</P>
<P>
   This Oscar De La Hoya never let adversity affect him in any
manner whatsoever, even when he seriously sprained his left hand
bad enough in the second round that afterward he had it X-rayed at
a local hospital, even when a butt by Carr opened a cut on his left
cheek in the seventh and even when Carr drilled him with a low
punch in the same round (infractions that referee Richard Steele
deducted two points from Carr's scoring).
</P>
<P>
   This Oscar De La Hoya showed overwhelmingly that he's now in the
prime of his fistic skills and that he figures to be ready for the
greatest challenge of his life Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the oddsmaker at the Hilton Hotel, Art Manteris, has
opened the De La Hoya-Trinidad fight as 6-5 and pick-it, a line
that figures to change quickly in the wake of De La Hoya's
impressive performance against Carr.
</P>
<P>
   It figures De La Hoya's followers soon will make their hero the
betting favorite, especially after the way he beat up Carr, a tough
gentleman who was thoroughly dominated by De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Trinidad also dominated Carr stopping him in eight
rounds and he did it four years ago when Carr probably possessed
greater skills.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Oscar De La Hoya made good on his vow and was a
commanding presence on a historic evening this was the first fight
show at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in front of a lively crowd
that included such celebrities as Al Pacino, Kevin Costner, Sean
Penn, L.L. Cool J, Dr. Dre, James Brown, Jim Brown, Antonio
Banderas, Woody Harrelson and countless others.
</P>
<P>
   He flashed nifty footwork, a stinging left jab, and a
devastating left hook that stunned Carr several times, and hurt him
so badly in the 11th that Steele wisely decided to halt the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Carr did manage to land a few right hands, but they never
bothered De La Hoya, who I had winning nine of the rounds before
Steele stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   When asked afterward who was the tougher foe, De La Hoya or
Trinidad, Carr took a most diplomatic stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both extraordinary fighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are and both are going to be extraordinarily
wealthy when they finally resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   If De La Hoya seemed unusually motivated against Carr, it was
quite understandable.
</P>
<P>
   The guy stood to blow a cool a ton of money he's in for a
percentage of the pay per view gate against Trinidad had he lost to
Carr.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that that De La Hoya-Trinidad is the biggest
non-heavyweight match in boxing since April of 1987 when Sugar Ray
Leonard and Marvelous Marvin Hagler settled their differences at
Caesars Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make $12 million from the live gate,'' says Arum, who is
pricing the tickets between $1,500 and $300. ``Oscar can make as
much as $20 million against Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   If Oscar De La Hoya continues to fight in the passionate manner
he did against Oba Carr, he figures to earn a lot more in upcoming
years.

KRAUSE HITS BULL'S-EYE IN LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ Flash! The Chicago Bulls have won the 1999 NBA
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   A breathless NBA awaits their move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the slightest idea what Jerry Krause is going to
do,'' says Vancouver coach Brian Hill, whose team will be picking
directly behind the Bulls at the June 30 draft. ``It might be some
guy from Bolivia, for all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the man known as The Sleuth did employ a Hungarian (Kornel
David) this year, and no one has ever done that before. Surely a
Bolivian or a Mongolian or a guy from Sierra Leone is a possibility
when the ever-secretive Krause is involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Sleuth likes to maintain a dignified public posture, but he
couldn't suppress his glee when NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik
opened the No. 2 envelope Saturday and pulled out a Vancouver
Grizzlies logo. The rotund GM pumped his fists a few times and
bounded out of his chair. It wasn't quite the Roberto Benigni-like
display put on by Philadelphia owner Pat Croce three years ago, but
for The Sleuth it was pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had also won the lottery during a TV rehearsal
conducted about 45 minutes prior to the lottery. `` `Doggone it,' I
was saying,'' beamed Krause. ``I didn't want to win the
rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   They're now sitting at No. 1, but a strong case can be made that
the Bulls were only the second biggest winners at the 15th annual
lottery. That honor could easily be given to Charlotte, which
entered the proceedings 13th, and last, with a laughable 0.5
percent chance of winning the lottery, and wound up third.
</P>
<P>
   It's been quite a run for Charlotte coach Paul Silas. He gets a
job for a handsome salary. He finishes third in the lottery when he
could easily have finished 13th. And now if he could only get some
dumb sucker to take Derrick Coleman off his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five chances in a thousand,'' said Silas. ``I thought there
was no way we'd ever wind up in the top three.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did anyone else. And it is enough to make people in the East
very nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Charlotte was a playoff team that didn't make the
playoffs,'' observed Boston general manager Chris Wallace, who was
quite content to finish eighth and then hand it over to Cleveland
as part of the Vitaly Potapenko deal. ``Look at the way they came
on down the stretch. They really responded to Silas. They might be
able to go for a need.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver ought to know the drill by now. Since 1996 the
Grizzlies have drafted third (Shareef Abdur-Rahim), fourth (Antonio
Daniels), second (Mike Bibby) and, now, second again. They could
write the lottery manual. Anyway, they have had two hits and a miss
in that time, with Daniels being a major flopperoo.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so let's assume Chicago chooses not to risk an international
incident by raiding the Bolivian League. What is out there for
them?
</P>
<P>
   If you follow the college game, you already know the answer.
Lamar Odom. Steve Francis. Elton Brand. Richard Hamilton. Wally
Szczerbiak. Baron Davis. Excited yet?
</P>
<P>
   Neither is anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, the versatile 6-foot-10-inch kid who hung out in Kingston,
Rhode Island, for a year and change, is the consensus top pick. He
has legitimate guard skills, but he is not yet ready to be a lead
guard in the pros. He needs to firm up his outside shot. He needs
to become more assertive. He has amazing skill and he has a good
heart. But he needs time to develop. In a better world, he'd be
spending at least one more year in college.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, we don't live in that world. We live in a very messy
athletic world. The only one of the above six who is truly ready
for the NBA is Szczerbiak, who, naturally, is the only senior in
the bunch. You can make a passable case for Hamilton's readiness.
The rest are all-too-typical of the unfinished products who are
infesting the world's greatest basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing we do know is where the ball is now. It's
in Chicago, and it will be Jerry Krause's serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen all the obvious people,'' he said. ``But I haven't
met any of them. We've seen them play. Now comes the hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause is a huge believer in personal contact. Starting Monday,
the Bulls will be bringing in waves of players, owing in large
measure to the fact that in addition to now owning the top pick the
Bulls also have the 32d.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to look a player in the eye,'' said Krause.
``And it's really important for us to work players out because he
must fit into our system. We need intelligent players who are
capable of playing in the triple post. We are committed to the
triple post. And we believe in character people.''
</P>
<P>
   The cynics are already accusing Krause of duplicity. ``You
telling me he doesn't know who he's taking?'' smirked one Windy
City Krause-watcher. ``Look how excited he was.''
</P>
<P>
   I think he was excited because he now has options, and there is
nothing more exciting to a GM in a situation like this than
options. ``A trade?'' smiled Krause. ``Nothing is ever out of the
question. If I've learned one thing in this business, it's that
nothing is ever out of the question. You keep your ears open and
you listen. You never close your eyes and your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes for all you other NBA teams. If you hear about some
little round guy booking a Chicago-to-La Paz flight, you might want
to tag along. The Sleuth might know something you don't.

IT WAS VALENTIN'S DAY 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As long as there is a Fenway Park, there will be the
``green light.'' Hitters love to be at the plate with a 3-and-0
count. Fans anticipate something spectacular, and often they are
right.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened Saturday when Red Sox third baseman John
Valentin stroked a grand slam in the third inning to spark Boston
to a 6-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Valentin got the green
light from manager Jimy Williams and never gave it a second
thought. The pitch by righthander Chris Carpenter was in his zone
and his bat did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy has the confidence in me to have me swing on a 3-and-0
count,'' said Valentin, whose bat has come to life in May. ``He
gives it to me a high percentage of the time, both last year and
this year. I'm glad he has that confidence in me. It's just a
matter of being aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the pitcher didn't want to go to 3-and-0 on me. He
wanted me to swing at a bad pitch. But in that situation, I was
able to be a combination of things. Patient and aggressive. It all
comes out a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are on quite a roll. They won two of three from the
Yankees, and thus far in this series twice have fallen behind the
Blue Jays but rallied to win.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is 4-1 on the current homestand and 14-8 for the season
at Fenway. Saturday's victory was its 13th in the last 16 games.
Over that same period, the club has rapped out 10 hits or more 14
times.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's home run was one of his four hits. That's the same
number as rookie Trot Nixon had, a career best. And let's not
forget that knuckleballer Tim Wakefield had lost four of six starts
before pitching 8 1/3 strong innings to claim the victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have good hitters,'' said Williams. ``Guys who make
contact and put good swings on the ball. We've been patient, too.
We've gotten key walks in situations that have helped us. We've
gotten good starting pitching. It all goes back to them, because
they set the tone. Coming out of the bullpen we've pitched good
when we had to. Today, we just played a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield gave up an unearned run in the first inning and it was
anybody's guess as to how he would react. He bore down, using his
fastball and curveball to supplement the floater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental approach is to keep battling,'' said Wakefield.
``(You say), `I've given up one run and that's all they're going to
get.' It worked out that way today. I was able to throw my
knuckleball with more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have that kind of attitude, it's easier to throw mostly
curveballs and fastballs and try to get ahead in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Darren Lewis reached on an error, and singles by
Nixon and Jose Offerman loaded the bases. Valentin teed off on
Carpenter to send the crowd of 32,088 into a frenzy. Boston scored
an insurance run with two out on a double by Troy O'Leary and a
single by Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Nixon picked up his fourth hit and scored the
sixth Boston run. Toronto scored three in the ninth before Tom
Gordon earned his sixth save by getting Mark Dalesandro to fly out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it all came back to that green light. The great hitters
in Fenway history never have been afraid to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing for a long time,'' said Valentin. ``I know
what pitch I like and what is my strength. I'd probably swing every
time. I'm not saying I'm going to hit a home run every time. But I
know if it's there I'm going to hit it hard someplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is team that works hard on hitting. If guys like myself
are struggling, you've got find out what's wrong. You've got to be
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you also remember it's a long year and you really can't
get too high or too low.''

IVERSON MORE THAN QUICK STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The coach was full of answers and quips. A crowd
had gathered where he was standing Saturday, near the quiet arena's
baseline. There were questions from a group of reporters and
subsequent responses from coach Larry Bird. But there was only one
question he couldn't answer. It was regarding The Answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sure goes baseline a lot,'' someone said to Bird, referring
to Allen ``The Answer'' Iverson. Bird shrugged. Yes, he is the
coach of the Pacers, but there is nothing he or anyone else can do
about the 76ers' Iverson dribbling the basketball, twirling the
basketball, and then blurring your vision of the basketball before
deciding to take it and himself along the lines and to the hoop.
You know it's going to happen a few times a night. Bird knows it.
Iverson knows it. It's still tough to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so quick,'' marveled Bird. ``You know, it's a lot harder
to defend him when he's not handling the ball than it is when he
has it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how most people now talk about the NBA's skinniest and
shortest (6 feet) shooting guard. There is less of a focus on his
cornrowed mane and more on his rapidly developing game. Bird and
his coaching staff have thought a lot about the unpredictable guard
during the past week. They know that one man can help extend this
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series _ which the
Pacers lead, three games to none _ beyond Sunday's Game 4. It is
Iverson, who is averaging nearly 30 points per game against the
Pacers. Forget his hairstyle; they want to know how to stop this
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do,'' Bird said. ``You really want to get him
underneath the basket. You can sorta tell whether he wants to shoot
or if he's looking for somebody. When he's not looking to shoot,
you can really clamp down on him under the hoop and make him throw
a pass out over the defense. But he's so quick . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's speed is not new. He was quick at Georgetown. He was
quick at his Virginia high school, where he also quarterbacked the
football team. He was quick during his first year in the NBA, 1996,
when the Sixers told the world that they were going to rebuild
around him. The difference now is that people are talking about
what Iverson does on the court rather than what he does off it.
Bird recently commented about Iverson's unselfishness. You didn't
hear comments like that before this season.
</P>
<P>
   But those around Iverson will tell you that a lot of what you
hear, read or, in some cases, think, is inaccurate. Local fans
still can't believe that one of his best friends is Bruce Hornsby.
He has begun to change his dressing style, becoming less of a jeans
man and more of a two-piece suit type. The hair? It is often
braided into neat strips atop his head. But sometimes he'll unbraid
it and display a 1970s-style, classic ABA afro.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Saturday. He is generally receptive to
speaking with the media. But he noticed a headline in a local
paper. His picture was next to the screaming headline, which read,
``Near Death Experience.'' What a switch. The day before, a
headline read, ``Go Sixers.'' Iverson didn't like that. His
teammate, Eric Snow, noticed that it bothered him. So Snow teased a
little. He spotted a writer from that paper and said to Iverson,
``You know he writes the headlines, right?''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't true. But Iverson didn't feel like talking. He left
the practice site without talking to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not doing everything perfect. But where he's come from
and the respect that he's shown is impressive,'' Sixers coach Larry
Brown said. ``I like the things he says. You know, a lot of times
kids can say all the right things _ because Allen is bright as hell
_ and I don't get caught up in it. But some of the things he says
mean a lot to me. Like, he said, `I'm not anything special for
Indiana; they played against Michael (Jordan).' And I think that's
a great way for the kid to show respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes on time now. He's dressing the right way. He's
starting to do all the things that you hope a young kid does when
he grows up and begins to understand. I've got one big guy on my
team, he'll tell you anything he thinks you want to hear. He has
his own agenda. But there is nothing phony about Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixers owner Pat Croce found that out in '96, when he first met
Iverson at an Embassy Suites near the Philadelphia airport. Croce
wanted to interview Iverson. They talked about Iverson's youth,
when he was jailed for allegedly inciting a riot. L. Douglas
Wilder, the former Virginia governor, eventually cleared Iverson's
name. What matters to Brown is that his team finds a way to play
better defense Sunday. It needs to rebound better, too. Matt Geiger
didn't grab a single rebound in 27 minutes Friday night. That has
to change. But if it doesn't, at least Brown has learned about his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look around and see how guys in this league handle
losing,'' Brown said. ``I've learned a lot about some of the guys
on the Celtics. I mean, their talent is just incredible. But they
have five guys who want to score and we have one (Iverson).''
</P>
<P>
   That one man will have to perform like he hasn't before to keep
the 76ers from joining the Celtics and other teams who are now
watching the playoffs. Croce has a cross-country biking trip
planned for June.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll postpone my trip if we make it to the Finals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers aren't that talented yet. If they happen to make it
that far, the man wearing jersey No. 3 will have to take them
there.

DEAL NOT FINAL FOR TITLE BOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Sept. 18 bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix
Trinidad has not been finalized, as De La Hoya's promoter, Bob
Arum, said Friday. However, Lou DiBella, senior vice president of
HBO, said the deal is ``almost done and it will get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum and Don King, who promotes Trinidad, have reached an
agreement that would pay De La Hoya at least $15 million and
Trinidad $10.5 million _ including their promoters' take _ for the
much-anticipated title-unification bout.
</P>
<P>
   However, Trinidad and King have yet to come to terms, according
to Trinidad's family lawyer, Nicolas Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Time-Warner, HBO's parent company, reportedly upped the ante
$500,000 after Trinidad rejected an offer that would pay him $8
million and King $2 million. However, Trinidad's people claim King
wants to take the additional money himself and they won't accept
that arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is stuck,'' Medina told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   DiBella, whose pay-per-view arm, TVKO, would televise the bout,
expects Trinidad and King to work out the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost done and it will get done with a little patience,
as opposed to publicly talking about it,'' said DiBella, who is not
directly involved in the negotiations. ``Everyone has a good idea
about what the terms are. Everyone should just be quiet and let Don
work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, the IBF welterweight champion, must defeat Hugo Pineda
on May 29 before he could face De La Hoya, the WBC titleholder.

DE LA HOYA FOUND IT TOUGH DRIVING CARR 
</HEADLINE>
 LA HOYA-CARR-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Oba Carr predicted he would be buoyed by God's hand
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night and for 10 rounds it appeared he was because
something had to be holding him up the way he was getting hit by
Oscar De La Hoya. Unfortunately, no one told God this was a
12-round fight.
</P>
<P>
   After getting up off the floor in the first round and being
rocked a half-dozen times by similar left hooks as the fight
progressed, a weary Carr came out for the 11th round and had one
more big left hook slam into his face. This time God's hand was
gone and Carr soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   Carr spun halfway around as he rocked backward, collapsing on
his face before De La Hoya could get close enough to land another
blow. As it turned out, none were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Although Carr got up at the count of five, he was a man adrift,
staggering sideways and then back as referee Richard Steele closely
watched. De La Hoya charged forward but Steele pushed him back to
the neutral corner. What Steele saw on Carr's face was the
expression of a game man saying ``Enough'' without moving his lips.
</P>
<P>
   Steele waved his hands, ending the bout 55 seconds into the 11th
round, giving De La Hoya his 31st win without a loss and Carr his
third unhappy ending to a world title quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I got tired at the end,'' Carr (48-3-1) said.
``I really should have been quicker. Oscar was very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Carr's weariness was probably the all-too-often
presence of De La Hoya's left hook. That hook, plus a stinging jab,
rocked Carr midway through the first round before finally dropping
him.
</P>
<P>
   Carr remained upright until the end but the damage he accepted
was considerable, a testament to his gameness but also his lack of
speed when compared to De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can take a punch,'' De La Hoya (31-0, 25 KO's) said. ``He
was rough and ready. But I put the pressure on.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya later claimed that pressure came despite what he
described cryptically as ``a personal problem'' that arose after
the second round. No one was sure what he was talking about but
Tony Daly, the Los Angeles Lakers' team physician, was dispatched
to De La Hoya's locker room after the fight, causing speculation he
might have injured his left hand, which remained gloved even after
the right glove was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, it didn't stop him from consistently rocking
Carr, although Carr would have enough moments of his own to keep
the crowd of 11,528 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center screaming
much of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's God barely had time to react before the fighter hit the
floor the first time, the victim of a big left hook with just over
90 seconds to go in the first round. Over the next four rounds,
Carr became well acquainted with that left, twice being rocked by a
left jab, and when it turned into a hook, it quite often left him
reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Carr kept his feet thereafter, but also kept getting hit far too
often for anyone whose intention was to win a portion of the
welterweight title. Carr occasionally landed some stiff lead right
hands of his own, and, from time to time, landed some with his
head.
</P>
<P>
   In Round 7, Carr slammed the side of his head into De La Hoya's
exposed left cheek, splitting it open. Steele immediately deducted
a point from Carr, whom he already warned about such un-Christian
behavior. Before the round was done, he had deducted a second point
for a low blow, which he also had been warned about.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as one-sided as the fight was, it was far more entertaining
than De La Hoya's battle with highly-regarded Ike Quartey in his
last outing because both De La Hoya and Carr were more often on the
offensive and intent on doing damage to each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, God knows Oscar De La Hoya did more of that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Mayweather craves exposure but he got more of it than he
anticipated Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The World Boxing Council super featherweight champion was
expecting a short night against challenger Justin Juuko, who was a
last-minute replacement for Goyo Vargas (flu), but Juuko refused to
cooperate. Or at least his chin did.
</P>
<P>
   Juuko absorbed some powerful right hands from the young champion
early in the fight and by Rounds 7 and 8 began to land some of his
own, several of which seemed to catch Mayweather's attention.
Although Mayweather wasn't hurt, his ego was by the ninth round,
when Juuko came out quickly and landed a flurry of punches that had
the crowd roaring.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for him, it also caught Mayweather's attention and
within seconds he nailed Juuko with an overhand right that stunned
the challenger. Juuko reeled backward and Mayweather stalked him,
landing a second, crisper right to the ear that sent Juuko to the
floor. Referee Mitch Halpern counted him out at 1:20 of the round.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight to
hit a snag. Less than 48 hours after promoters Bob Arum and Don
King reached an agreement that would put the two welterweight
champions in the ring at Mandalay Bay Resort Sept. 18, Trinidad's
lawyer declared the $11 million offer was ``unacceptable.''

IN LAST INDY GO-ROUND, LUYENDYK CAPTURES POLE 
</HEADLINE>
 500-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ One last time, Arie Luyendyk carefully rolled his
sleek Indy car out of the pits at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He
was given a rousing ovation Saturday as he set out on his four-lap,
10-mile, qualifying attempt for his 15th and final Indianapolis
500.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the pits, 2 minutes 25.179 seconds later,
the Dashing Dutchman was greeted with a conquering hero's welcome.
Luyendyk completed his qualifying tour of the fabled Brickyard in
an average of 225.179 miles per hour, good enough to win the pole
for the 83d Indianapolis 500 a week from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a calm, cool, and collected customer, Luyendyk admitted
to ``being a little nervous,'' just before his run because he knew
``I was going to have to drive the car on the limit and that's not
a comfortable place to be,'' referring to the windy and cool
conditions that played havoc with qualifying. So, after holding the
throttle of his G-Force Aurora wide open for four laps, including a
blistering 225.643 m.p.h. on his second go-round, Luyendyk returned
to the pits, where he allowed the adulation to wash over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy Pole Day,'' said Luyendyk, a two-time Indy 500
winner and three-time pole-sitter. ``Everyone is really tense,
there's a lot of electricity in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't until he heard the cheers and saw the
enthusiastic thumbs-up from his competitors up and down pit row
that it really hit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think the thing that struck me the most was that I
didn't wake up this morning saying this is going to be my last
qualifying day or my last this or that,'' said Luyendyk. ``When I
completed the run, I was really moved by the enthusiastic crowd all
around the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when a record 33 drivers qualified _ the first time the
field has been filled on the first day _ Luyendyk took center
stage, stealing the spotlight from Team Menard driver Greg Ray, who
was a heavy favorite to win the pole. Ray, however, wound up
qualifying second with a four-lap average of 225.073 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk withstood one last challenge from Robby Gordon with a
half-hour remaining before the track's closing. The CART driver,
behind the wheel of Ray's backup car that posted a hot lap of
227.192 during practice Thursday, qualified in 223.066.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk will be joined on the front row by Ray and Billy Boat,
last year's pole-sitter who rebounded from a crash on his initial
qualifying attempt to make the field with a four-lap run of 223.469
in his backup car.
</P>
<P>
   Ray seemed poised to wrest the pole away from Luyendyk when he
came smoking out of the barrel with a first lap of 225.643, which
was as fast as Luyendyk's second qualifying lap. Ray slowed a tick,
dropping off the pace for the pole when his speed dipped to 224.439
on his final lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very close,'' said Ray, who had hoped to deliver
the pole as a birthday gift to his 6-year-old son, Winston. ``I
drove all four laps exactly the same. We were close. My crew chief
(Thomas Knapp) said on the last lap, `We need a little more here,'
and I said, `That's all there is.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Eddie Cheever Jr. was the first to make a
qualifying attempt and appeared to make the field solidly when he
took the checkered flag on a four-lap run of 221.438. However,
Cheever's crew inexplicably waved off the run, nullifying the
results. Cheever waved off a second attempt, before he finally
qualified in his third and final try in his primary car in 221.314,
good for a spot in the middle of Row 5.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, who was on the tightest of schedules Saturday, was
the first to make the field when he qualified in 220.653. Stewart
then made a mad dash to the airport, where he took a private jet
belonging to his NASCAR Winston Cup owner, Joe Gibbs, to Charlotte,
N.C., where he competed in the Winston Open qualifying race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go quicker, obviously,'' said Stewart, whose
plans seemed to be jeopardized by a one-hour rain delay, ``but we
were flat-out the whole way around. That's all the car had today.''

NO WALKOVER FOR DE LA HOYA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ This wasn't the statement Oscar De La Hoya wanted to
make.
</P>
<P>
   He did one thing he said he'd do against Oba Carr on Saturday at
the Mandalay Bay Events Center. He fought aggressively, although he
did it more in spurts than on a consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   However, he ran into two significant problems: 1) An injured
left hand in the second round that he said hindered him the rest of
the fight and, 2) a game Carr.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger, not the pushover many believed he'd be, not only
stood up to De La Hoya's best advances for most of the fight, he
did some damage himself until the champion finally put him down and
hurt him with a single left hook in the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   Carr wobbled to his feet but referee Richard Steele had seen
enough. He stopped it at 55 seconds and no one complained.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which allowed De La Hoya to keep his WBC
welterweight championship, sets up a bout against Felix Trinidad
here on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   There are two !ital!more!off! problems: The injured hand _
possibly a sprain, according to De La Hoya's doctor, Tony Daly _
and the fact Trinidad's handlers said Saturday that the deal hasn't
been finalized, which leave the long-awaited matchup in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the second, I couldn't do the things I wanted to do,''
said De La Hoya, who wouldn't reveal the injury in interviews
immediately after the fight. ``It's kind of personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``... If the personal problem hadn't occurred, he would've been
out (earlier).''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (31-0 with 25 knockouts) almost ended the fight in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   He stormed out of his corner and, about halfway through the
fight, landed a straight left and follow-up short left that sent
Carr (48-3-1, 28 KOs) to one knee. The challenger from Detroit
survived the round but seemed vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   However, De La Hoya couldn't follow up. He told Daly he hurt the
hand throwing a jab early in the next round and he delivered few
punches the rest of the three-minute period. That allowed Carr to
regain his senses and build some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was a fight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who had said he planned to revert to the
knockout-minded fighter he was immediately after the 1992 Olympics,
engaged Carr in repeated toe-to-toe exchanges but hardly
overpowered him between the first and final knockdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Neither fighter landed a significant number of pain-inducing
punches during the flurries and neither was seriously hurt.
According to computer statistics, they landed a comparable number
of power punches _ 137 for the champion, 108 for Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, De La Hoya won the fight by outboxing Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a very good boxer, landed a miserable 49 of 442 jabs and
only 157 of 759 total punches thrown, an indication that the
champion was at his elusive best. De La Hoya landed 103 of 249 jabs
even though that punch caused him the greatest pain after the
injury and connected on 240 of 518 total punches.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, Carr was asked to compare Trinidad, who knocked
him out in eight rounds in 1994, with De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``De La Hoya is more evasive,'' said Carr, who wouldn't predict
a winner. Later he added: ``And Oscar can take a better punch.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was well ahead on points after the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
   The judges had it 96-91, 95-92 and 97-90 while the Daily News
scored it 97-90 in favor of De La Hoya. The scoring was lopsided
partly because of two points taken from Carr for butting and low
blows in the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   However, to his delight, De la Hoya didn't leave anything to
chance. The end came when Carr attempted to throw a left and De La
Hoya instantly responded with his best punch _ the left hook _
hitting Carr flush on his cheek and sending him face first to the
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   He got up immediately but couldn't go on. As Steele waved him
off, De La Hoya raised his fists in the air and then climbed onto
the shoulders of his trainer, Robert Alcazar, and strutted around
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the ring announcer proclaimed him the winner,
De La Hoya let out a cry of ``WHOOO! WHOOO!''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he was overjoyed that he was able to do what he'd set
out to do _ knock out Carr _ in spite of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though the Trinidad bout _ which would be the biggest
in his career _ could be in jeopardy, he couldn't resist striking
the first blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna get you,'' he said, referring to Trinidad. ``He
finally signed. We're gonna do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the fight of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya missed the postfight news conference to have X-rays
taken on his injured hand.
</P>
<P>
   In another championship bout, Floyd Mayweather knocked out
Justin Juuko to retain his WBC super featherweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather (21-0, 16 KOs) dominated the fight because of his
exceptional skill and quickness but had trouble. He didn't hurt
Juuko (33-3-1, 25 KOs) until he put him down and out with a
straight right at 1:20 of the ninth round.
</P>
<P>
   Juuko was a last-minute replacement for Goyo Vargas, who said he
pulled out the fight because he is ill.
</P>
<P>
   After the bout, Mayweather's grandmother, Bernice Mayweather,
collapsed in the ring as her family celebrated the victory. After a
few minutes, she walked out of the ring and appeared to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a scheduled eight-round heavyweight bout, unbeaten Lamon
Brewster (21-0, 19 KOs) of Los Angeles stopped Mario Cawley (21-3,
16 KOs) at 1:20 of the second round.

GEORGE IN LOSING BATTLE FIGHTING MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ As much as Tony George has made the motorsports
media out to be the Phantom Menace, we do not represent any Evil
Empire. What we really represent _ and this is what George, the
misguided president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway and founder of
the Indy Racing League, has trouble grasping _ is a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   So, Tony, you're just going to have to deal with us.
</P>
<P>
   George came to that realization Thursday when he backed off his
ill-conceived decision to revoke the credential ``privileges'' of
Sports Illustrated writer Ed Hinton for the Indy 500. After the
Chicago Tribune pulled its writer, and several other papers,
including the Globe, contemplated following suit, George came to
his senses and realized that he was in jeopardy of making the
Greatest Spectacle in Racing into merely a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu press conference in the Speedway's media center
Thursday, George said, ``The decision to not extend the privilege
of credentials to Ed Hinton at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was
based on a feeling that he's dangerous to himself and to the sport
that he's assigned to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   You're wrong, Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Hinton is not the menace to motorsports. He's just the
messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you are the one who's dangerous to yourself and the
sport we are assigned to cover.
</P>
<P>
   There have been suspicions that George was behaving in an
irrational manner since he founded the IRL, an all-oval, open-wheel
series aimed at competing against the Championship Auto Racing
Teams circuit. Why would he ruin a good thing like the Indianapolis
500 by tinkering with its time-honored traditions? He put Indy at
risk by taking all of his cars and his track and forming his own
series because the guys at CART refused to play ball with him.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions were confirmed this past week. The man is
vengeful and carries grudges, so don't hold your breath waiting for
a reconciliation in the lingering feud between CART and IRL that
has done irreparable harm to open-wheel racing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to revoke Hinton's credential, which George made
against the counsel of his own publicity people, seemed largely the
result of a personal vendetta. George was put off by Hinton's
critical story on the IRL following the death of three spectators
at the VisionAire 500 May 1 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``His comments in a recent article following a tragedy in
Charlotte where he seems to pontificate and be knowledgeable on
design engineering and construction again proves that he really
doesn't have much of a feel for the sport and is trying to make a
name for himself,'' George said, taking a swipe at Hinton before
reluctantly reinstating his credential. ``I felt it was extremely
in poor taste for Sports Illustrated to run his article with the AP
photograph, which I understand was available to others, and just
shows me that whoever's in charge of publishing that magazine
doesn't use very good judgment in how they place their ads. They
are insensitive and are treating motorsports tabloidal.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, that may be the case. You may take umbrage at that, too, but
that's their prerogative, Tony. You cannot dictate who can and
cannot be assigned to cover your race. It smacks of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The ad that George was upset about was a Valvoline layout that
depicted five men working underneath the hood of a car with the
caption: ``You're born. You die. In between you work on cars. We
should all be so lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gall they had to apologize to the advertisers for running
it next to the article, but not to the families of the victims, was
just beyond me,'' George said. ``It just shows a lack of
responsibility and poor judgment, and that's what I question.''
</P>
<P>
   You have that right, Tony. It's your track. It's your property.
And if, as you say, ``a credential isn't a constitutional right,
it's a privilege,'' then you have every right to hold the Greatest
Spectacle in Racing in a media vacuum. That's your ``privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   George claimed, ``It's my job to move the sport forward and not
be a party to its demise,'' but he very nearly was a party to its
demise himself by alienating the national media. And that would
have been a grave mistake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR driver Tony Stewart had his hands full this weekend,
shuttling between Indianapolis and Charlotte to qualify for both
the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600. Stewart made matters difficult for
himself Thursday at Indy when he slammed the wall between Turns 3
and 4 while practicing in his primary car. ``I'm just disgusted
with myself for making a stupid mistake as a driver and creating a
lot of extra work for my team that didn't deserve to have to work
this hard,'' Stewart said. `They've done everything perfect up to
this point.'' . . . McCormack Motorsports announced a week ago that
it had signed Jimmy Kite to pilot its No. 30 TransWorld
Racing/G-Force Oldsmobile for the Indy 500. Kite, 23, who was 11th
in last year's Indy 500, fills the vacancy left by the departure of
veteran Raul Boesel. He will be paired with Indy 500 rookie Nick
Firestone, the 33-year-old great-grandson of tire pioneer Harvey S.
Firestone. ``We are excited about it,'' said team owner Dennis
McCormack. ``Things happen for a reason, and everyone here at the
shop is really excited about having Jimmy on the team.'' McCormack
was not worried about a lack of preparation time before the time
trials. ``It is one of the reasons that we picked Jimmy,'' he said.
``He is a veteran here and ran very competitive times here last
year. Jimmy is the right person for the job.'' . . . FedEx-CART
rookie driver Juan Montoya continues to burn up the circuit,
winning his third race in a row in last Saturday's Rio 200.
Montoya, who previously won back-to-back races at Long Beach and
Nazareth, will go for four in a row in the Motorola 300 at Gateway
International Raceway next Saturday . . . For the record, Hinton
was greeted with lusty boos from his peers when he arrived in the
press room Friday morning at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

CELTICS LACK LUCK, LIKELY TO LOSE PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ No miracles for the Celtics. And no regrets,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitaly Potapenko is, in essence, our No. 1 pick this year,''
declared Celtics general manager Chris Wallace, whose team wound up
in the eighth spot in Saturday's NBA draft lottery. That pick
likely will be scooped up by the Cleveland Cavaliers as part of the
trade that brought the 6-foot-10-inch, 250-pound center to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Celtics' will hold the 37th pick, the eighth
selection of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would make that trade again and again,'' insisted Wallace.
``We needed a center. There are no franchise-type centers in this
year's draft, or in the next couple of drafts. Unless someone is
coming out of the foreign ranks, I don't know where the next Tim
Duncan or Shaquille O'Neal is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The first pick went to the Chicago Bulls, who, with a 13-37
record, had gone into the lottery with a 15.7 percent chance of
winning. Vancouver was second and the Charlotte Hornets, with a
microscopic .5 percent chance of winning, came up a surprising
third.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had a 3.7 percent chance of winning the lottery.
Toward that end, Wallace toted along such good luck charms as a
lock of hair from his young son Truman's latest haircut; a Notre
Dame ID card, courtesy of (Rick's son) Michael Pitino; a
15-year-old Celtics business card from trainer Ed Lacerte; a Red
Auerbach suit jacket worn by Celtics aide Jeff Noyes (``not
cleaned, so as to retain all the luck,'' said Wallace); and a
leprechaun figurine.
</P>
<P>
   It worked _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they moved down from 7 to 8,'' reasoned Wallace. ``That
alone makes it a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also pointed out fans had somewhat of a misconception
about what the Celtics were risking by tacking their 1999
first-round pick to Andrew DeClercq when they traded for Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were protected against Nos. 1, 2, and 3 from the trade,''
he said. ``But we were also protected on 4, 5, and 6 by league
rules. So the risk was even better than people thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth is that this is regarded as a woefully thin
draft that couldn't begin to address the Celtics' needs, even at 1,
2, and 3. They would rather have Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are much more comfortable with him than trying to be lucky
with the eighth pick,'' Wallace said. ``He's now played 200 NBA
games. He's been in the playoffs. We start off next year with a
center who does not have to be introduced to the NBA.''

VARGAS SPITES HAND THAT COULD FEED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The face of jealousy is never a pretty thing, even
if it's worn by a pretty face.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas is a good-looking fighter and a good-looking
kid, perhaps the best of the young 154-pound champions now ruling
the junior middleweight division. He wears the International Boxing
Federation belt despite having fought professionally only 16 times,
having defeated a tough Mexican warrior named Yory Boy Campas to
claim it, and is now preparing to defend it this summer against a
former champion on the downside, Raul Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in front of Vargas but blue skies because he
fights in a division with few challengers but also a former Olympic
teammate named David Reid with whom he could earn some money one
day if he plays his cards right. Reid holds the World Boxing
Association title despite having only 12 professional fights
himself and is the only gold-medal winner from the 1996 US team in
Atlanta, so there is a natural rivalry that any promoter worth his
salt easily could exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vargas has seemed an unhappy young man since the day in
Atlanta when he failed to do what Oscar De La Hoya had done four
years before him. De La Hoya became boxing's Golden Boy when he
seized his moment in Barcelona and won the gold medal, and he has
made millions off that experience.
</P>
<P>
   It transformed De La Hoya from a barrio kid in East Los Angeles
into a Hollywood star and he has become a boxing phenomenon: a
cover boy, a teen idol, a company pitchman, a money machine in
short pants.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, De La Hoya already has won four world titles in four
weight classes and earned some of the biggest purses in boxing
history for a nonheavyweight. As he said this past week, ``I feel
I'm carrying boxing on my shoulders. It is a burden, but I enjoy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Vargas doesn't enjoy watching it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his Olympic days, Vargas has taunted and criticized
De La Hoya, his Southern California rival, claiming De La Hoya lost
his roots after he got rich. He has claimed time and again that he
wanted nothing more than to get in the ring with De La Hoya and
show who the better fighter is, insisting that the true Mexican
boxing fan had no use for De La Hoya despite his apparent
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas continued his verbal assaults last week, telling writers
around the country that De La Hoya was ducking him. How a 147-pound
champion can be ducking a 154-pound champion is beyond me,
especially when the 147-pound champion is in no hurry to move up
now that he stands to make $16 million-$20 million for a Sept. 18
fight with Felix Trinidad in a unification fight for the
welterweight title.
</P>
<P>
   While De La Hoya fights for millions in one of the sport's most
glamorous divisions, young Vargas fights for peanuts in a division
cobbled together by boxing's three crime families as a way to
extract more sanction fees from more fighters who can't or won't
make either 147 or 160. That Vargas is jealous of all De La Hoya
has, which includes millions in endorsement contracts and millions
more in a long-term deal with HBO, has been obvious for a long
time. What is sad to see is his effort to turn it into a publicity
campaign that is absurd on its face.
</P>
<P>
   One of Vargas's three managers, Rolando Arellano, was amusing
when he pointed out the depth of the rivalry by announcing that
Vargas was about to sign an endorsement deal with Miller Lite, a
rival of one of De La Hoya's longtime sponsors, Budweiser. But when
the two droned on at length about how De La Hoya had ``been running
his mouth'' while he was ``avoiding'' Vargas, their position became
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is the one who chose to fight at 154 rather than 147,
which has been De La Hoya's weight class for some time. It is
Vargas who needs De La Hoya a lot more than De La Hoya needs him,
which, at this point is not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arellano says, ``We think he's scared to fight Fernando.
That's why his PR people keep telling him to say he won't fight us.
He shouldn't go after weaker champions. He should go to the one who
will give him the trouble and prove his point.''
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Rolando: He did. He went to Trinidad, who is considered by
many fight fans to be De La Hoya's welterweight equal. He did that
after he first went to Pernell Whitaker and then Ike Quartey. Your
man, on the other hand, went to Raul Marquez, who's a nice kid with
slow hands and a mug that's starting to get dented from taking too
many punches.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya tired of his young critic and said last week, ``I'll
never give Vargas an opportunity. He has no respect. He's very
disrespectful. He does not deserve an opportunity. I respect most
fighters but I don't respect him. I'll lose a fortune before I'd
fight him. I see David Reid in my future, not Vargas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly that galled Vargas, because even in his impetuous youth
he understands that De La Hoya calls the shots on such matters. Yet
the fact is he got what he's been asking for. He has been taunting
De La Hoya since he was a teenager and now he needs him to make a
payday. What he doesn't seem to understand is that when you're
begging someone for a favor _ and a job _ it's not wise to insult
him in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the two will fight in a year or two, but only if Vargas
forces the issue with his hands and not his mouth. If he wants a
shot at De La Hoya, he needs to worry about his own business, which
should be lining up all the 154-pound champions and beating them so
that when De La Hoya does move up in weight, there is no place to
go but to him.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Vargas will remain to De La Hoya like a gnat at a
picnic, a buzzing nuisance to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rumor around Vegas all week was that wily old trainer Gil
Clancy would work his final fight with De La Hoya Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
But De La Hoya told HBO on camera Friday night in a prefight taping
that Clancy will remain with him even after he begins a promised
housecleaning of his organization. De La Hoya had been talking
recently about changing much of his operation once Saturday's fight
with Oba Carr was over and he was critical last week of the parade
of trainers he'd added and subtracted in the past few years. He
will, for example, no longer serve as a co-promoter with Bob Arum
for future fights, something he had insisted on earlier in the
year. He also told a Los Angeles Daily News reporter that Clancy
was out, saying, ``This is his last fight. Like I said, it's gonna
be me, (head trainer) Robert (Alcazar), and (cutman) Chuck (Bodek).
Robert's my trainer and that's it. Gil is a excellent motivator.
He's a person with a lot of knowledge in boxing. It's nothing
against him. That's just the team I want.'' If true, that's news to
Clancy and would run counter to what De La Hoya told HBO's Larry
Merchant Friday night. As for Clancy, he said Saturday, ``I'm on a
fight-by-fight (basis) with Oscar, so he can make a change whenever
he wants, but he hasn't said anything to me. I don't know how these
things get started.'' In this case, apparently by his boss . . .
Word is Tony Ayala may return to the ring July 31 in San Antonio on
the undercard of World Boxing Council super bantamweight champion
Erik Morales's next title defense if details can be ironed out with
Morales's promoter, Arum. It appears that San Antonio promoter
Lester Bedford has signed Ayala to a three-fight deal worth
$600,000 with an option for three more fights. However, Arum said
Friday, ``We've got no deal with them. We might do the show in
Tijuana, and what does Ayala mean there? What does he mean on
pay-per-view? The guy hasn't fought in 17 years! Those people
(Ayala's handlers) are crazy. If Ayala means anything, it's in San
Antonio (his hometown), but we don't know if that's where we're
going.'' Ayala was one of the hottest fighters in the country in
1982 before he was convicted of a violent rape for which he served
the past 17 years in a New Jersey prison. During his incarceration,
Ayala underwent intense psychotherapy and claims to have become a
new man. He served nearly half his term as a prison counselor and
had an exemplary record . . . Roberto Duran recently went to Brazil
to fight for $100,000. He was paid $20,000 up front but the check
for the $80,000 balance he collected after the fight allegedly
bounced. Now Duran wants to sue. He's got a better chance of
beating Roy Jones than beating the Brazilian promoter in a
Brazilian court . . . Lou Duva sent a strongly worded letter to IBF
president Bob Lee asking why North American Boxing Federation
welterweight champion Vernon Forrest (28-0, 22 KOs) wasn't
considered to replace Vincent Pettay next Saturday night against
Trinidad (Pettway pulled out with a detached retina). Duva argued
that Forrest had faced much better opposition than either Hugo
Pineda or Raul Frank, the two welterweights ranked above him by the
IBF, and has been around since the 1992 Olympics. Pineda got the
shot anyway, in part because he is promoted by Cedric Kushner, who
has done several last-minute favors for HBO.

WALTON WILL BE SPENDING IDOL TIME AT FLEETCENTER 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No one had to ask Bill Walton more than once if he
might be interested in attending this week's Bill Russell tribute.
That'd be like asking Dennis Rodman if he wanted an extra ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Russell is my absolute favorite,'' Walton said. ``He was
my idol growing up, my hero, my role model. I absolutely love that
guy. I'm so happy that they're having another day for him. But as
far as I'm concerned, every day is Bill Russell Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton's first television memories of the NBA, formed while
growing up in San Diego, are of watching the Celtics and Russell.
He saw what a difference one man could make by being the consummate
team player, by focusing on the little things, and by starting the
fast break.
</P>
<P>
   He considers Russell to be the best player in the history of
basketball. He patterned his athletic life after Russell's book,
``Go Up For Glory.'' He liked the fact that Russell's only valued
statistic was number of championships won, that Russell considered
defense to be the most important part of the game, and that Russell
competed so fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   When Walton enrolled at UCLA, the number he wanted _ 33, which
he had worn in high school _ was unavailable because his West Coast
idol, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, had worn it. So he chose 32.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to Boston in 1985, Walton wanted the No. 32 he had
worn at UCLA and with the Portland Trail Blazers. Unfortunately,
Kevin McHale had the number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have played Kevin for it, because I would have had it
then and there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he chose No. 5, one less than the No. 6 that was worn by
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose that number for Bill Russell,'' said Walton. ``I knew
No. 6 wasn't available. As far as I'm concerned, No. 6 should be
retired on a league-wide basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton is elated to have been chosen to play a part in
Wednesday's gala at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be such a special event,'' he said. ``The way
Bill Russell played, and the way he lived his life, to me are one
and the same. He's a model for a whole generation that followed him
and tried to compete against him, and it all culminated with Larry
and Magic. Then it became a game of stats and numbers for players
on losing teams, and that whole focus has been lost. That's why
he's so special.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do you think ousted Knicks GM Ernie Grunfeld is enjoying his
former team's romp through the playoffs? He must be saying, ``Where
have you guys been all season?'' Grunfeld, of course, tried to
reshape the Knicks into a younger, more athletic team. It looked
like a sound strategy. But when the team was struggling, Latrell
Sprewell was moaning about roles, and the players were lamenting
the losses of Charles Oakley and John Starks, the Knicks jettisoned
Grunfeld. But as the playoffs proceed, they continue to amaze. This
is a team that was a hideous 8-17 on the road this season. They are
4-1 on the road in the playoffs. Sprewell lit up the Hawks for 31
points in both games in Atlanta. What's really come across is
Sprewell's incredible quickness as well as his stamina. The guy
doesn't get tired. If he's making his outside shot, he's almost
unstoppable. Meanwhile, the NBA Players Association this past week
(in between Games 1 and 2 of the series) filed a grievance
regarding the ridiculous $25,000 fine the Knicks levied against
Sprewell for statements made by the player's agent. The union is
hoping to resolve this with Madison Square Garden president Dave
Checketts, but if it can't, it'll go through the grievance
procedure . . . USA Basketball will announce the final three
players this week (probably Wednesday) for its team competing in
the July zone qualifier in San Juan. Nine NBA players already are
on board. The other three will be ex-collegians; look for Elton
Brand, Wally Szczerbiak, and Richard Hamilton to make the cut. The
NBA contingent is guard-heavy. The US needs to finish first or
second in the tournament to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney. The team will meet early in July in Florida for a week's
worth of training camp. Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich is still the
head coach (and will be in Sydney, as well). Lenny Currier, of
Newburyport and the 76ers, is the team's trainer . . . As if things
aren't tough enough for Denver nowadays (its first-round pick is
owned by Toronto), Nuggets fans are being reminded at this time of
year of what they had and what they don't have. Just tune into any
playoff series. In the East, there's Dikembe Mutombo and Jalen Rose
playing, with LaPhonso Ellis sitting and watching. Out West, they
can see Avery Johnson, who was cut on Christmas Eve in 1990.
Meanwhile, the status of head coach Mike D'Antoni, who has a
three-year deal, is still up in the air with new ownership on hand.
D'Antoni, GM Dan Issel, and owner Bill Laurie were to meet last
week but put everything on hold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was great to see America's Team, the Sacramento Kings, extend
Utah. Had Vlade Divac made one simple rotation on the
pick-and-roll, John Stockton never would have gotten off his
game-winning shot in Game 4. And there wasn't enough time to make a
pass. Also, what in the world was coach Rick Adelman thinking in
Game 5 by leaving so many key guys on the bench for so long while
leaving the defensively challenged Peja Stojakovic on the floor?
And while we're on the subject, where was Lenny Wilkens's mind when
he allowed the Knicks to simply walk the ball up the floor in the
final two minutes of Game 2 with Atlanta trailing by 6? Couldn't he
at least have tried a trap or press to induce a turnover or two? .
. . Things are souring again between Penny Hardaway and the Magic.
Penny took more than a few potshots at the organization the day
after Orlando was eliminated by the 76ers. Where once he said he
owed it to his teammates to stick around, Hardaway is now saying he
might play elsewhere. He sounded a lot like Shaq when he talked
about having to bear all the pressure _ the big fish/little pond
syndrome. The comments didn't sit well with Magic owner Rich DeVos.
In an interview with the Orlando Sentinel's Tim Povtak, DeVos said
Hardaway's comments ``were not appropriate'' and that if Hardaway
wants to play elsewhere, ``We'll help him to do that.'' DeVos also
said he's getting a little tired of the same old rant. ``It just
seems like we can't please him. I don't even know who he's mad at.
I used to think he was just a young kid trying to grow up. But this
has gone on for quite a while now.'' Hardaway can exercise an
``out'' clause in his contract and become a free agent. If he does,
Orlando would be eligible to re-sign him for $85 million over seven
years. (He has three years and $26.7 million left on his existing
deal.) Orlando had the third-highest payroll in the league at $43
million this season and, according to DeVos, will lose money for
the second year in a row . . . Then there's the Golden State
Warriors. They've announced they won't raise ticket prices, and
this came after they made the second-biggest improvement in the
league (after Toronto) and increased their attendance. ``We're
going in the right direction,'' said GM Garry St. Jean. ``We've got
more assets than we did at this time last year. But we still need a
couple stars. We've got solid guys. We need stars.'' Toward that
end, don't be surprised if the Warriors make a serious run at the
disgruntled Gary Payton, an Oakland native (Skyline High School,
where he was a teammate of Greg Foster). Golden State dearly wants
a point guard, and Payton would be perfect because he is also
undeniably a star. Whether Seattle would give him up for anything
the Warriors have is another matter entirely . . . Dino Radja came
up big for Panathinaikos in the Greek playoffs, leading his team to
a victory in the deciding fifth game over Olympiakos. Radja had 12
points and 13 rebounds. He averaged 17.6 points and 10.8 rebounds
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets apparently offering everything but a rest stop on
the New Jersey Turnpike to Phil Jackson, does that mean the rumors
about Jim Calhoun can stop? Then again, maybe Calhoun would take
the job just to be able _ again _ to do what John Calipari
couldn't. But Jackson seems like the logical choice given his ties
to the general area and the lefty leanings of the owners. If he
does say no, there's no reason not to give Don Casey the reins . .
. The Celtics had hoped to have Ben Pepper, their second-round pick
in 1997, available for some summer league fun, but the Aussie had
ankle surgery and the team isn't sure he will recover in time. For
the first time in (non-lockout) years, there won't be the
conventional four-day free agent/rookie camp at Brandeis (or
anywhere else, for that matter). With two summer leagues on the
agenda (Los Angeles and Boston), the Celtics will likely have a
couple of practice sessions before each venture. There is no need
to bring in a lot of players. They already have 11 NBA players
under contract for next season, 12 if you include Pervis Ellison.
They also have to decide on Bruce Bowen, who is still likely to
draw interest from Miami and maybe a couple of other teams . . .
Speaking of the Heat, Pat Riley told Miami reporters after their
crushing Game 5 loss to the Knicks that he won't panic and back up
the truck after ``one bounce of the ball.'' He added, ``Heads are
not rolling, unless it's mine.'' Hmmm. But with the way Jamal
Mashburn disappeared in the Knicks series, you have to think Riles
will at least explore trade options with the Celtics for Rick
Pitino's all-time favorite player . . . Dale Davis spent much of
last summer and fall working with a free throw teacher, and it paid
off. Now his agent, Steve Kauffman, is doing the same thing for
client Ben Wallace, a poor man's Davis. Everyone loves Wallace
except for the fact that he is an utter liability at the line. If
he can improve that part of his game, he could be a very valuable
commodity next summer as a free agent.

BOTTOM LINE ON BRUINS: BOSTON GOT MONEY'S WORHT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Not to be accused of being the CEO of Blue Skies Inc.,
but I don't think I was alone in feeling impressed by what the
Bruins did this season. No one around here really felt they were a
Cup contender _ did they? _ and, for a budget operation, they truly
got a lot of bang for their buck.
</P>
<P>
   It may be difficult to reckon with the Vault's prices and think
of the on-ice product as a budget operation. For some, it's as rank
as thinking of the Celtics as an expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But profit first, last, and foremost is the stated mandate of
both the owner and the Bruins' management team. That's nothing new.
In fact, it has been that way for more than 20 years. If you're
just getting to that now, then wake up and smell the $150,000
luxury boxes. And let's not forget, there are a lot of ol' time
Yankees here in the Hub of the Universe, just now switching to
their spring Harris Tweeds, who count Jeremy Jacobs as a soulmate
and dream of hooking up with him in an Internet chat session.
</P>
<P>
   Can't you imagine it?
</P>
<P>
   CHAD09: Hey, Jerry, how's biz?
</P>
<P>
   JJ$$: Can't talk now, time is money, you know. Uh, that'll be 55
cents.
</P>
<P>
   It's a business. So what. Can't we all get over it?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the budget ballyhoo gets all the louder when salaries
are spiraling, ticket prices follow in lockstep, and the local NHL
entry won't go out and pay for a bona fide competitor. It's true
what Harry Sinden says, that spending won't guarantee a winner. But
the unspoken truth that we never hear around here is that not
spending provides a 99.99 percent guarantee that a team won't be
able to marshal a true Cup run.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here then, folks, is a novelty item, a niche
franchise. The Bruins are fun to watch and they began to blossom
this year with a touch of personality _ a gregarious, talented
goalie in Byron Dafoe, a possible star in the making in Joe
Thornton, and Anson Carter, who keeps getting better, has an
infectious enthusiasm for his work, and is winning over an audience
that isn't, shall we say, accustomed to seeing a black kid do
things with a flourish in a hockey uniform. On top of all that, if
you haven't long appreciated Ray Bourque's work, then I imagine
you're not reading this anyway.
</P>
<P>
   When we heard the trash-talking, cash-talking Sinden again
Tuesday night, moments after his team got dumped from the playoffs,
it sadly took some of the luster off a decent season. He drove a
stake through Dmitri Khristich and Jason Allison, which for the
night made the veteran president/GM a .500 hitter. Rolling those
two names off the tongue is like ordering corned-beef hash and
filet mignon from the same menu. Bringing up player performance and
linking it to player payroll has become a very, very tired act.
</P>
<P>
   Can't all of us _ management, players, fans, and media _ just
get beyond the money around here? Everyone _ and I mean everyone _
knows that player salaries are ridiculous in every sport. If I'm
right, every NBA player works under a six-year, $72 million deal.
I'm just so numb to it all now. What they make is what they make.
My feeling is, good luck to 'em, and now let's watch the game. As
fans _ and for the most part media _ isn't that where we all
entered the equation in the first place? It was meant to be fun, an
escape, not an hour-by-hour assault of our economic sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden should know better by now. His soliloquies immediately
following his club's playoff elimination games have become
legendary. Beat writers from around North America leave their homes
in the middle of the night, like old-country vets attending to
horses in foal, and rush to their offices to read Sinden's comments
on the AP wire when his Bruins get bounced. They fantasize over
where to place the exclamation points, which expletives to delete.
</P>
<P>
   But, clearly, it's counterproductive, on so many levels, and it
was especially so this time. If this had been, say, the great,
prolific '71 Bruins team that folded shop, a championship team
snuffed out by Ken Dryden's glove and stick and blocker, then OK,
let 'em have it. But no one in their right minds saw the 1998-99
Bruins as being anything close to championship fodder. Sinden was
kicking his own dead horse.
</P>
<P>
   It is what it is, and it will remain what it will remain: just
another NHL club, a for-profit business that can provide some
decent entertainment and maybe win a round or two.
</P>
<P>
   If you're OK with that, then please shut up and enjoy the game,
no matter where you fit in the
owner-management-fan-player-agent-media equation. If you're not,
then I suggest you leave, while the gettin's still good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An update on Shayne Stevenson, the former Bruin first-round pick
(No. 17 in '89) who ran afoul of the law in early March when he and
a teammate hijacked a cab _ the driver was off-duty, eating at the
Waffle House _ in an early-morning attempt to drive back to their
hotel in Bossier City, La.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stevenson, reached at home in Aurora, Ontario, the
entire affair was a prank gone wrong. Leaving the Waffle House
early one morning with his teammate on the San Angelo (Texas)
Outlaws, Kevin McKinnon, Stevenson said the two were prepared to
walk back to their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were drinking,'' said Stevenson. ``We were both juiced.''
</P>
<P>
   When McKinnon spotted the keys in the cab's ignition, Stevenson
said he dared his pal to get in and drive them home. They were on
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us probably 45 seconds to get out of the parking lot,
because we couldn't find the main entrance,'' said the 28-year-old
Stevenson, who hasn't missed playing a season _ be it in North
America or Europe _ since last playing in the NHL for Tampa in
1992-93. ``We could see the driver looking at us through the Waffle
House window, and he was with some cops. No one seemed to care. He
knew where we were going, because we asked him to take us to the
hotel, but he said he was off-duty. We figured the cops probably
would give him a ride later to the hotel and he'd just get his cab
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, Stevenson said, he was on the taxi's CB, talking
to the dispatcher (could Jack Nicholson play this part or what?),
who didn't like what she was hearing. The dispatcher called the
cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw about a dozen cruisers flying down the other side of
the highway,'' recalled Stevenson. ``I remember saying, `I wonder
where they're going?' Then I realized, they were after us.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief visit to the local lock-up, Stevenson eventually
paid a $500 fine and said he has been assured that he won't carry a
permanent record. McKinnon, he said, also paid a $500 fine and got
tagged with a DUI charge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stevenson is back home, planning to get in shape for
another season. He said he earned $1,500 a week with the Outlaws
and finished with 30 goals in 45 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 10 times the player I was than when I was in Boston,''
said Stevenson. ``I just wasn't mature. But, hey, as soon as you're
branded, you're all done. I blew that opportunity, right out the
window. I should be worth millions, but I'm not. But I could make
that Boston team right now, I know I could. But, hey, everyone's
got a story, and that's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet one more confirmation that everything in New York is
overpriced and the money is mind-boggling: the deal Brian Leetch is
about to sign _ perhaps as early as Monday _ that will bring him
some $35 million over four years. It makes Leetch the highest-paid
blue liner in NHL history. The truth is, Leetch, scheduled to
become an unrestricted free agent July 1, would have gotten
something close to that in the open market. After losing Mark
Messier (free agent to Vancouver) and Wayne Gretzky (retirement),
the Rangers couldn't have afforded another PR hit, especially after
missing out on the playoffs for two straight seasons . . . Dafoe
doesn't have true free agency as a weapon, but he has an arsenal of
eye-popping statistics, which is why he should reap a hefty award
in arbitration. Remember when we all thought Bill Ranford would
have a slam dunk at the arbitration table in the summer of '96 when
he was on the Boston payroll? Instead, he failed miserably, and
arbitrator Claude Foisy pointed to the goalie's mediocre statistics
in rendering that lowball decision. All signs point to arbitration
now for Dafoe, and the Bruins undoubtedly choosing a one-year
award. Based on his numbers, and comparisons to other netminders
with similar statistics (remember, Foisy emphasized current
numbers, not past performance), Dafoe easily can ask for $4 million
or more a year and expect to get it . . . The Hurricanes are
contemplating retiring the late Steve Chiasson's No. 3 or having a
street named after him next to their new arena (opening in October)
in Raleigh, N.C. Chiasson was very drunk (his blood-alcohol reading
was .27, more than triple the legal limit of .08 in North Carolina)
and was traveling at 74 m.p.h in a 55 m.p.h zone, without a seat
belt, when he smashed his truck . . . What a collapse by the Red
Wings, who folded up like the Dead Wings of old after taking a 2-0
lead over the Avalanche. Among the most troubling signs, looking
ahead: Chris Chelios was a minus-8 for the series. The Wings gave
up two first-rounders to bring in the 37-year-old Chelios and
quickly agreed to extend his existing contract by two years. Not
that Chelios was alone in his futility. Brendan Shanahan, Sergei
Fedorov, and Darren McCarty also went bust . . . The Oilers have
decided they won't offer Joe Hulbig, ex- of St. Sebastian's, a new
deal. The 13th pick in the '92 draft, the 6-foot-3-inch Hulbig is a
decent banger (Edmonton has lots of those) who made less than
$300,000 last season. For that kind of dough, he could be a Boston
pickup, provided the Islanders don't get to him first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't you love the circus in New Jersey? Now Devils owner John
McMullen is joining hands with Cablevision, owner of the Knicks,
Rangers, and Madison Square Garden, in hopes of building a new home
for the hockey team over the rail station in Hoboken. Only four
years ago, McMullen squeezed another $5 million per year out of the
state when he threatened to move the Devils to Nashville. That's no
longer enough, and it's off to Hoboken, where McMullen and friends
want to build a $206 million facility with, oh, $30 million in
state aid (think they'll toss in one of them de-luxe
Foxborough-like off-ramps?) . . . Don't look for Miroslav Satan,
the Sabres' 40-goal scorer, to be in the lineup for the start of
the Buffalo-Toronto series. However, his bruised ankle (compliments
of an Alexei Zhitnik slapper) is improving and he could be back
mid-series . . . Alexei Kovalev may be streaky, but he plays in
pain. Pittsburgh's skilled Russian winger played the last
Penguins-Leafs game with a broken foot and refused to take
pain-killers . . . Look for the Flyers to buy out the last year of
Ron Hextall's deal. He's due just over $1.1 million, and they'll
save one-third of it. Brian Boucher, ex- of Woonsocket and Mount
St. Charles, is the heir apparent as John Vanbiesbrouck's backup .
. . The Penguins might be in the same mood to buy out Tom Barrasso,
in line to earn $2.717 million next season. They'll need some of
that $900,000 savings to pay free agents Martin Straka and Jiri
Slegr.

SALT LAKE CITY GETS A LITTLE CASH FLOW 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Though the budget trim list keeps growing _ no lunches
for volunteers, fewer free tickets for International Olympic
Committee members, less outdoor seating at venues _ the Salt Lake
organizers are seeing more cash flowing in.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC recently signed three local sponsors (the first since the
December corruption scandal) for more than $25 million, and last
week's mascot unveiling boosted merchandising sales that are
supposed to provide at least $40 million of the $1.4 billion
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake had planned on trotting out its mascot trio _ a
yet-unnamed snowshoe hare, coyote, and black bear _ in February,
but the scandal fallout kept them on the shelf. The trend toward
multiple mascots _ Sydney has a platypus (Syd), an echidna
(Millie), and a kookaburra (Oly) _ is entirely souvenir-driven. Why
sell one pin, one T-shirt, one stuffed animal when you can sell
three?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While SLOC looks to chop costs, its Games keep growing. If the
IOC decides to add men's and women's skeleton sledding, women's
bobsledding, and men's and women's cross-country sprints, the 2002
program will have 75 medal events, nearly a third more than a
decade ago and seven more than 1998. Extra cost: $650,000 . . .
First it was Utah's lenient gun laws that had the Lords of the
Rings arching their brows. Now it's the sticky Mormon-inspired
rules on alcohol. Among the IOC coordination commission's concerns
during last week's visit to Salt Lake was whether media members
will be able to belly up to their customary bar inside the main
press center at the Salt Palace. SLOC promised to ask the state for
an exemption to the liquor laws so the scribes won't have to carry
concealed flasks . . . The International Ice Hockey Federation will
scrap its controversial two-game final for next year's world men's
championships and return to the one-for-the-gold format. Even the
Czechs, who won their second title in four years last weekend,
conceded that the two-game concept (also used for the semifinals)
was goofy. The Czechs had to beat Canada in a shootout after they
split their semis, then took the Finns in overtime after they split
their finals. ``It's a very weird system, but it worked for us,''
shrugged forward Martin Rucinsky. Commendable showing, meanwhile,
by the Americans, who ended up sixth after having to survive a
relegation tournament to stay in the A pool. Former Bruin Ted
Donato led the squad with 8 points in six games . . . No accident
that the International Skating Union assigned Michelle Kwan to the
two Grand Prix events closest to home for next season: Skate
America and Skate Canada. The ISU knows Kwan is entering UCLA in
the fall and figures she'd never skate the Grand Prix if she were
sent to Japan or Russia. Kwan, though, won't make up her mind until
the summer after she has conferred with coach Frank Carroll and
seen her class schedule. Sarah Hughes, the 13-year-old skater who
finished a startling seventh at the world championships, will
compete in Skate America and Trophy Lalique in France. Still stuck
on the junior circuit is 13-year-old Naomi Nari Nam, who was second
to Kwan at the US nationals but couldn't compete at Worlds. ``There
wasn't that much downside this year, but next year worries me much
more because it starts setting up for Olympics and Naomi won't have
any senior exposure,'' says John A.W. Nicks, Nam's coach. ``The
junior and senior levels are judged very differently. You can excel
at the junior level, but you're still not accepted at the senior
level.''

   Splitsville after 14 years (and three world crowns and two
Olympic silvers) for figure skater Elvis Stojko and coach Doug
Leigh. Different directions and all that. Stojko, who broke his
collarbone in a practice tumble while skating backwards earlier
this month, says he'll decide this fall whether to turn pro or stay
eligible for the 2002 Games . . . Back on the sled is three-time
Olympic luger Duncan Kennedy, who retired before the last Games
with brain-stem bleeding that was making him dizzy. Though
neurologists have cleared him to slide again, Kennedy will have to
survive a summer conditioning test and an autumn raceoff to get
back on the US team. Off the sled for good is Somerville's Erin
Warren, who is calling it a career at 27 to finish college at
Northeastern. ``It's time to do other things,'' says Warren, who
competed in two Olympics and was sixth at Nagano. ``I'll be home
for Thanksgiving for the first time in 10 years.'' . . . The first
batch of US oarsfolk for this summer's World Rowing Championships
in Ontario will emerge Sunday and Monday from the sculling trials
in Aiken, S.C. Favored are former world champ Jamie Koven and Julia
Chilicki in the men's and women's single, Lisa Schlenker in the
women's lightweight single, and Steve Tucker-Conal Groom in the
men's lightweight double . . . Slow ticket sales for this summer's
quadrennial Pan American Games in Winnipeg. Barely two months
before the opening ceremonies, only a third of the projected
600,000 tickets have been sold, though 60 percent of Manitobans
told pollsters they'll be attending . . . The US women's water polo
team can earn its Olympic ticket this week by finishing ahead of
the Canadians in the World Cup in Winnipeg. The two top teams from
the Americas and Europe (probably Italy) plus the host Australians
will qualify for the six-team field. The rest will have another
shot next May . . . Amateur boxing's switch to shorter bouts (from
nine minutes to eight) and more rounds (from three to four) will
stand for next year's Olympics. Doctors had pushed for the change,
saying the old format caused boxers to wear down in the final
minute and made them more vulnerable to injury . . . If women's
boxing were added to the Olympic program, the US would win a
fistful of medals. The Americans dominated the first-ever
international tournament in Finland last weekend, winning five of
the nine weight classes plus three other medals . . . Juicy _ and
embarrassing _ reading in those personal dossiers that Australia's
Phil Coles compiled on his IOC colleagues and sent to the Salt Lake
bidders. Venezuela's Flor Isava, confided one note written by
Coles's girlfriend, ``loves men, especially good looking, attentive
ones. They keep her young.'' Isava, who is 78, is steaming and says
she might boycott the Sydney Games.

YOUNG, PURSLEY WINNERS AT IRWINDALE
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Darren Young and Greg Pursley made their
Irwindale Speedway victories look easy Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Young pulled away from Ron Peterson and Frank Steiner to win the
51-lap Speed Truck Challenge main event and Pursley took advantage
of a broken rear end to win the 50-lap Super Late Model race before
a crowd of 3,666 people.
</P>
<P>
   However, both drivers say Saturday night's victories were
anything but easy.
</P>
<P>
   `The car was a little loose, said Young, from Gilbert, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the spec truck ran fine once he got running, but four
caution flags made the race troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   `Those restarts were hard, he said. `The car ran loose, but once
we got a long run, it ran great. It was hard to hold those other
guys off the first couple of laps after the restarts.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barron led the first 27 laps in Super Late Model, closely
pursued by Pursley. But Barron dropped a rear end and Pursley
pulled ahead and eventually pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   `It was anything but easy, said Pursley, who was involved in a
first-lap crash last week. `I just had to get back in the car,
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Newhall resident was racing with a sore neck and back after
the wreck took out all but the rear end and sent him to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   `The team worked its rear off to get the car here, he said. `The
car was flawless.
</P>
<P>
   In another main event, Jim Warden of Anaheim won the 40-lap MSRA
Pro-4 race, pulling away from the field to win by half a track
length. The race was marred by a four-car crash on the final lap,
which Warden almost ran into on the victory lap. No one was hurt in
the crash and all four cars left the track under their own power.
</P>
<P>
   In Street Stock, top qualifier Albert Sallie of Tujunga rallied
from last to win the 12-lap main event and Mike Peace of El Cajon
won the 24-lap Allison Legacy main event.
</P>
<P>
   Pole sitter Tony Green of Oak Hills led the Speed Trucks until
Young, Steiner, of Crestline, and Peterson, of San Bernardino,
caught him on the yellows. Young got the lead, but Steiner nearly
got by him on the restarts. Peterson finally got by Steiner with
less than 10 laps to go, but when both drivers thought the race was
over and were pulling off the track, they hit, knocking Peterson
into fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   Barron, from Corona, seemed to have the upper hand in Super Late
Model. Pursley, who won the Southwest Featherlite Irwindale 100
last week before crashing in Super Late Model, finally caught him
on Lap 28. They ran side-by-side for six laps before Pursley took
the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   `Brian Barron ran really good, Pursley said. `He's getting a lot
closer.
</P>
<P>
   Barron said he just wanted to stay close to Pursley after the
rear end went out.
</P>
<P>
   `It ran really good until it started going, he said.

WHEELS CONTINUE TO SPIN IN LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The PGA Tour sometimes just doesn't get it. It's one
thing to escalate purses to lofty levels, quite another to
virtually phase out longstanding tournaments such as the one at
Pleasant Valley. Then there is the Tiger Woods/David Duval
made-for-TV extravaganza on a Monday night in Los Angeles in August
that clearly will sabotage the Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   Duval had a sponsor's exemption at the GHO before he earned his
Tour card, and Woods had great success playing in junior events
underwritten by tournament sponsor Canon. But instead of playing
there, they will be in a match-play event on the West Coast, with
the winner taking home $1.1 million, the loser $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the Casey Martin case, now on appeal. Last
year, the PGA Tour banned Martin from using a cart during events,
even though he has a rare genetic disorder that affects the
circulation in his right leg. Martin had to go to court to win the
right to use a cart.
</P>
<P>
   He played in the GHO, the US Open, and three other official
events, with $37,221 in official earnings. He's back on the Nike
Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the PGA Tour has appealed the court ruling, making an
appearance in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walking rule is a substantial rule, expressly designed to
inject stress and fatigue and impact the outcome of the game,''
argued PGA attorney Andrew Hurwitz in court. ``In an elite athletic
competition, certain rules must apply equally to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a position endorsed by Jack Nicklaus, but following hip
replacement surgery this year, Nicklaus suggested that he might use
a cart on the PGA Senior Tour since it was within the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the Martin case, the PGA Tour could have just relented, but
instead it has brought a lot of bad publicity on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Now this past week comes news that a federal judge in South
Bend, Ind., has denied a request by Ford Olinger, who has a
degenerative hip disorder, for an injuction against the US Golf
Association that would have allowed him to use a cart in a local
qualifier for the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger, like Martin, sued under the Americans With Disabilities
Act, but Judge Robert Miller wrote in his ruling that athletic
competition is different from work in a normal place of employment.
Stay tuned. Martin could still be history.

   Recent observations from a springtime spent at Irish golf
courses: The Connemara GC in the village of Ballyconneely, located
in the wild west of County Galway, is about to expand with nine new
holes that will rival any in Ireland. The first two border the
Atlantic Ocean, and the second is a par-3 measuring 240 yards into
the prevailing wind. Plans eventually are to incorporate this nine
with the back nine on the present 18 to create a true championship
course. ``This nine should really put Connemara on the world
stage,'' said John McLaughlin, the club's secretary/manager. ``We
would hope to be available for any of the major tournaments that
come around. We'll be making a big play for them. We're going to
play the three nines, and we would hope to build another nine and
have a 36-hole complex.'' Plans are to make life memberships
available to Americans for 5,000 pounds. ``We hope to go to America
this fall to promote it,'' said McLaughlin. ``It's a pretty good
deal.'' The new nine at Connemara features pot bunkers, fresh water
hazards, and a spectacular ocean view. It has been 17 years in the
making, because original architect Eddie Hackett and successor Tom
Craddock died during construction. The new nine will provide ``18
championship holes we should genuflect to,'' said board member John
McWilliams, who runs the vastly expanded general store in
Ballyconneely . . . Then there is the Old Course at Ballybunion GC,
one of the game's great courses, located at the mouth of the river
Shannon in Kerry. It requested Ryder Cup consideration for 2005,
but money prevailed, and the Ryder Cup went to the K Club west of
Dublin, which isn't even a links course. Ballybunion may be
somewhat isolated, but no place could have been more difficult to
get to than Valderrama in the last Ryder Cup two years ago. ``We
possibly did not have a chance to get it,'' said Ballybunion GC
secretary/manager Jim McKenna. ``It's good for the country, and
that's the good thing about it. The whole country will benefit as a
result. We're pleased for the K Club. It will be a fabulous event,
and it was a great coup to get it.'' Tom Watson has made some
improvements at Ballybunion, and he will be the club captain in the
millennial year. That is a rare tribute, and Watson wasted little
time in accepting the honor when it was extended to him at
Christmas time. Last year, Ballybunion attracted Watson, Woods,
Ernie Els, Mark O'Meara, Payne Stewart, Ben Crenshaw, Andrew Magee,
and Jim Furyk _ on the same day _ as they were en route to the
British Open. . . . West Coast Links has attractive packages to
Connemara, Carne Golf Links, Inniscrone GC, County Sligo GC at
Rosses Point, Murvagh, and Ballyliffin. For information, contact
your golf tour operator or Michael Burke in Oranmore, County
Galway, at 011-353-91-794500 . . . Europeans who are critical of
Boston prices for the Ryder Cup should note that a two-bedroom pad
in Carnoustie for the British Open this July is 3,000 pounds, with
a 500-pound refundable deposit. This is more expensive than a
three-bedroom townhouse was at Valderrama.

INCENTIVES ARE THERE FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hungry players or angry players?
</P>
<P>
   Either might be a good thing for the Patriots as a prelude to
the 1999 season, a season that is critical to the future of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Several key players will be entering the final year of their
contracts. Those who excel will earn either an extension on their
careers or a ``dream'' contract.
</P>
<P>
   Some players will be consumed by the pressure of the situation.
And some with no firm future commitment from the team could look at
the situation as hopeless, which could lead to bad feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are counting on players being hungry enough to
perform at high levels _ not only the ones whose contracts are up,
but also the ones such as Willie McGinest, Chris Slade, Ted
Johnson, Terry Glenn, Max Lane, and Vincent Brisby who have a
chance to jump-start their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a good thing,'' said vice president of player
personnel Bobby Grier. ``You could see players playing harder than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   It could all work out very well, or it could be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was very frustrating,'' said All-Pro cornerback Ty
Law. ``We had so many guys out that it felt like we were swimming
uphill all year. I wanted so badly to do more than I did. I wish I
could have touched the ball more. The way I was feeling, I wanted
to play every position.''
</P>
<P>
   Law heads the list of players whose contracts are ending. He,
defensive backfield mates Willie Clay, Lawyer Milloy, and Steve
Israel, plus receivers Shawn Jefferson and Troy Brown, linebacker
Tedy Bruschi, defensive lineman Chris Sullivan, and offensive
lineman Heath Irwin, are all entering the final year of their
contracts before unrestricted free agency.
</P>
<P>
   This is a significant group of players, one that could have a
huge say in whether the team goes deep into the playoffs or
continues to languish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we'll be together,'' said Law, who is hoping
to break the bank. ``I'd like to play with these guys in the same
backfield for the rest of my career. But I know that's not
realistic in today's NFL. I'm sure some of us will be back and some
won't. Or maybe they'll clear everyone out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tough not knowing what the future is going to
be, but if this is our last dance together, we might as well go out
and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to be a great defense because we've been
together a few years now,'' he said. ``We're used to the system,
and now we can build on that. We have good players on this team.
There's no reason we can't be one of the best. Sure, all of us are
a little uneasy about the future. We all want to continue playing.
All of us would like to stay in one place and not have to move from
team to team. Hopefully things will work out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Law will be the top priority. At some point,
the Patriots will clear out the roster to pay him, and that could
mean sacrificing Clay and Israel. Milloy is probably the second
priority, and the Patriots have options, such as making him the
franchise player to take him off the free agent market. Many
believe that signing both players to long-term deals is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson would like to remain a Patriot, and because of his
durability and help with the younger receivers, he deserves the
right to a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is another underappreciated player. Oddly, the Patriots
reworked Brisby's deal even though he has missed a lot of playing
time the past three years, but they haven't rewarded Brown for his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi, who has been used as a nickel-type linebacker, will
compete with rookie Andy Katzenmoyer for a starting job. His energy
on the field is important, but this will be the season in which
Bruschi proves that he's either an every-down player deserving of a
big contract or expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Israel added stability to the secondary once he finally got
healthy. Now his time is almost up.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the Patriots have paid out big money to
McGinest, Slade, Johnson, Bruce Armstrong, Todd Rucci, and Max Lane
and gotten little in return, mostly because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Those commitments have made the Patriots salary-cap poor. It is
a predicament in which many teams find themselves. With the $17.6
billion television deal came outstretched hands from All-Pro type
players who are absorbing huge percentages of salary caps, leaving
little room for the average to above-average veterans who in past
years served as important backups or spot starters. Now those spots
are being taken up by younger players.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots have failed in one area this offseason, it is in
getting more experience. Grier asserted after the season that they
needed more veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet first-round draft pick Damien Woody will replace five-year
man Dave Wohlabaugh at center, and Katzenmoyer may well replace
six-year veteran Todd Collins. The Patriots have added veteran
Lamont Warren to the running back corps, and before all is said and
done, they will also add Terry Allen or Harold Green to that mix
and hope to get a veteran for a defensive line that is getting
younger and younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a chance to acquire veteran players at certain
positions,'' said Grier. ``There's always the chance you can get a
veteran who sacrifices a bit of salary and says, `I'll play for you
for a year on an incentive-type contract.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But a steady veteran such as Zefross Moss will likely be the
player who is dumped to make room for Allen.
</P>
<P>
   On draft day, the Patriots had a chance to trade for one of the
best backs in the NFL _ Jamal Anderson, who has brought great
talent and leadership to the Atlanta Falcons _ but cap restrictions
prevented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Falcons called us twice on draft day,'' said Grier. ``The
first time, we said no. Then they called a second time after the
two backs (Ricky Williams and Edgerrin James) were gone. We got
together and said, `How can we do this?' After discussing how we
could do it, the solution was we'd have to cut six players off of
our team to be able to get Jamal in here and then sign him to a new
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a problem with the asking price. They wanted our
two No. 1s, and we figured the market had also been established for
a top running back. We received a first- and a third-rounder for
losing Curtis (Martin), and Marshall Faulk went to St. Louis for a
second- and a fifth-round pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has $1.6 million remaining on the final year of his
current contract, and he would have been looking for a $10 million
signing bonus and an average salary of $6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 26, is just the kind of rugged runner the Patriots
would love to have, but they said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these teams talk about the salary cap, but they can
find a way to have the players they want to have on their team,''
said a Patriot player.
</P>
<P>
   With what they have, if the attitude is right and the top talent
is healthy, the Patriots should be able to overcome money problems
and compete very well in their division. Judging by the number of
players in their strength and conditioning program, they feel they
are far ahead of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the players who were injured or feel they have something
to prove have decided to take matters into their own hands. One
Patriots executive said that Armstrong, who has lost 25 pounds,
``will be coming to camp with a chip on his shoulder. He wants to
prove a lot of people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungry may be good. Angry may be even better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   McGinest and Slade are on the mend after having medical
procedures recently. McGinest, 27, missed seven games with a
groin/abdominal pull last season, the first year of a five-year,
$25 million contract for which he received an $8 million signing
bonus. McGinest, who had 3 1/2 sacks last year, had some tightening
of muscle done in the groin area in an effort to prevent future
damage. He has been attending the strength and conditioning program
consistently since April after spending much of the offseason in
Vancouver, where he worked with a groin specialist on strengthening
muscles. The program was taken to Foxborough, where McGinest has
worked closely with trainer Ron O'Neil and strength and
conditioning coach Johnny Parker. Slade, 28, had a minor
arthroscopic procedure on his knee about three weeks ago and should
begin running again next week. Both players are expected to be at
full strength by the start of training camp in Smithfield, R.I.,
July 30 . . . Funny line by former Patriots coach Dick McPherson on
a recent ``Imus in the Morning'' program: ``Bill Parcells should
thank me every day of his life. Because we went 2-14, he was able
to draft Drew Bledsoe.'' . . . Just asking: With The Wall and the
infield being preserved as part of the new Fenway, will the
Patriots seek to preserve the aluminum seats at Foxboro Stadium? .
. . There is speculation in Dallas that Deion Sanders may get cut,
which would relieve $8.2 million from the salary cap. Sanders had
toe surgery and is expected to be out 3-4 months, which means he
likely wouldn't start the season . . . Michael Bishop and Scott
Mutryn, the two young quarterbacks vying for a spot on the Patriots
roster, have both ``had good days and bad days,'' according to
Grier. Bishop wasn't coming close to a spiral on Thursday.
Meanwhile, North Reading's Jim Murphy, also New England property,
is third string in Barcelona of NFL Europe. The Patriots are hoping
a team in need of a young quarterback comes to them and pays a
price for Murphy . . . As much as the Patriots have tried to get
away from the practices of the Parcells era, they keep inching
back. Assistant coaches are once again off limits to the media,
just as they were during the Parcells reign . . . OK, I give up.
Where is the Boston franchise in the International Football
Federation, a professional spring league due to open in March 2000,
going to play home games? The league supposedly has other
commitments from New York, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Orange County
(Calif.), Toronto, Detroit, Cincinnati, Denver, and Chicago.

   The Tennessee Titans have sold 48,000 personal-seat licenses for
their new stadium in Nashville, less than the 55,000 they had
projected . . . At their meetings Tuesday in Atlanta, owners will
get an electronic presentation on how instant replay will work, in
addition to a glimpse of the Patriots' Massachusetts stadium plan .
. . It might be overstating things, but Randall Cunningham had an
interesting line on Titans QB Steve McNair: ``The guy is as
talented as any quarterback who has ever played the game.'' . . .
Kadar Hamilton, a safety for Barcelona who is the son of Patriots
assistant coach Ray Hamilton and on the New England roster, said
the reason he wasn't drafted in the NFL out of Stanford two years
ago was his 4.8 time in the 40-yard dash at the combines. The
5-foot-11-inch, 204-pounder, who grew up in Sharon and spent many
years accompanying his father to Foxborough for practice, has given
himself two years to make it in the NFL before he pursues a career
as a financial account executive for Merrill Lynch in San
Francisco. ``The 40 time is very important at the combines, and it
determines whether you get drafted or not,'' he said. ``I just had
a terrible day that day, but Ronnie Lott ran a 4.8 toward the end
of his career, and he was still making plays all over the field. I
just need to get out there and get the experience and show what I
can do.'' Hamilton was cut by the St. Louis Rams in training camp
last year . . . Does anyone blame Barry Sanders for not wanting to
play for the Lions? He has endured 10 years of losing, a great
talent wasted. With 15,269 yards rushing, he is 1,458 short of
Walter Payton's all-time record. Would he retire? It wouldn't
surprise a lot of people who think Sanders is one of those players
who will just ride off into the sunset and never be heard from
again. He would look pretty good taking handoffs from Bledsoe . . .
Receiver Herman Moore is about to receive a big deal from the Lions
. . . Speaking of Bledsoe, he has thrown 128 touchdown passes: 64
at home, 64 on the road. Yet his home/away won/lost record is 28-18
at home, 22-22 on the road . . . Bledsoe will stay in Foxborough
until the middle of June, then head to his Montana retreat until
the end of July, when training camp starts. Bledsoe weighed in on
losing friend and confidant Scott Zolak, who signed with the New
York Jets: ``I'm very disappointed to see him go. He's the best
backup I could have asked for. He's been great for me over the
years. John (Friesz) is a good player who has played a lot over the
years, and if I go down _ which I don't anticipate _ he can come in
and win for us.'' Bledsoe said he saw Zolak last weekend and came
away feeling New England was ``his first choice, but I think he's
happy where he is now.''

ARGENTINE TEAMS FACE SEA CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mauricio Macri has been described as a ``hincha con
plata,'' a rich fan. In the case of Macri, chief executive of the
industrial conglomerate SOCMA and president of Club Atletico Boca
Juniors, we're talking about the very richest of South Americans.
</P>
<P>
   River Plate is considered ``The Millionaires,'' the club that
took a socioeconomic leap from La Boca barrio and has been the
transcendent club in Argentina sports. But while River Plate is
reloading, Macri has capitalized, and Boca Juniors is leading the
way, not only in the Clausura standings but in other initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In five years as president, Macri has modernized Boca Juniors'
infrastructure and their famous stadium, La Bombonera. Like a fan
with no experience in soccer, Macri made grand errors in the early
part of his administration. But he has learned. Carlos Bianchi, his
third coach, is the right person for the position. Macri is
enterprising _ instead of setting a rent on executive box seats at
La Bombonera, he auctioned them off, attracting more than $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Boca Juniors entered this weekend with a 37-game unbeaten
streak, two less than the Argentine record set by Racing in 1966.
And after Gimnasia y Escrima de Jujuy upset San Lorenzo, 3-2, last
Sunday, Macri's club holds a 6-point lead with four games
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But soccer is complicated in Argentina, and all is not well. The
sport is inextricably woven into the fabric of society, and many
problems are rooted in social unrest resulting from economic and
political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   There are 80 professional and semi-professional soccer clubs for
greater Buenos Aires's 12 million people. There are six 50,000-plus
capacity stadiums and another 15 with 20,000-plus capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, clubs have produced revenue by selling players.
River Plate, financially the healthiest of the Argentine clubs, has
earned more than $30 million from sales of Ariel Ortega and Chilean
Marcelo Salas to Spain and Italy in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The next big-money exports will be from Boca: Juan Roman
Riquelme, whose free kick gave Boca the lead against Estudiantes,
leading scorer Martin Palermo, and Guillermo Barros Schelotto, who
is being scouted by Bayern Munich's Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's president, Carlos Menem, who was booed as he became
an honorary socio of San Lorenzo during the defeat last Sunday, is
urging clubs to become ``commercial organizations or sociedades
anonimas (franchises).'' Indeed, futbol should be recognized as a
business. But it will be difficult to transform clubs that have
evolved from social organizations into bottom-line enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Argentine soccer already displays many traits of an
advanced stage of capitalism: an international revenue stream
through development and exportation of assets (players), a
sophisticated internal shadow economy involving barra bravas
(superfans), and a television rights agreement worth hundreds of
millions of dollars from Torneos y Competencias (TyC). The
conflicts begin when a club's business or on-field fortunes
decline. Probably, there are too many clubs for all to remain
solvent, but eliminating any will leave a vacuum in the community.
</P>
<P>
   As in England, and other developed nations, there is a great
amount of pent-up angst among the populace in Argentina. And the
soccer stadium is where most of it is released. Such anxiety cannot
be repressed by draconian means _ police are omnipresent at games,
and moats, barbed wire, and fences 60 feet high are in use,
contrary to edicts of FIFA and worldwide trends.
</P>
<P>
   Panstadia International magazine's Simon Inglis recommends ``a
firm, national strategy based not on heavy policing or containment
but on modernization and information.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadiums in Argentina simply must be upgraded to minimize the
chances for a large-scale disaster. The conundrum is that clubs are
not profitable enough to make the necessary improvements, and any
talk of reduction of clubs, mergers, or stadium sharing is resisted
by the loyal populace, which instinctively fears the loss of
identity that accompanies a club's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis notes that the clubs have sports halls, all-weather
fields, swimming pools, social clubs, and even schools and
kindergartens; precisely the sort of community facilities the
hard-pressed municipalities struggle to provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than jeopardize this crucial social role, it may
therefore be wiser to separate the running of the stadiums from the
rest of the organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Passion and tradition must be harnessed in a contemporary
context. In November, lower division games were suspended because
of excess violence, and Primera Division A players went on strike
in sympathy. Now, Racing has been declared bankrupt with $50
million in debts. The president of the club has been blamed for the
losses, and Racing has only been allowed to continue playing
because a group within the club went to court and posted a $1.5
million security.
</P>
<P>
   As Menem noted: ``If the clubs are not adapting to the current
times, I am not going to judge the honesty of the directors.
However, what is failing at this time is the system.''

UMASS MEETS ITS MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST REGIONAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ The University of Massachusetts softball season
was supposed to end on a high note, led by senior hurler Danielle
Henderson, who has broken every school pitching record in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it ended with red eyes and bitter words as the team was
left with a heart-wrenching 2-0 extra-inning loss against the
University of California Saturday before 910 fans at Totman Field.
The defeat eliminated the Minutewomen (43-10) from the NCAA East
Regional and cost them a third straight trip to the College World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   California (47-10) will now face top-seeded Southwestern
Louisiana (54-9) Sunday at 10 a.m. for the regional title and a
berth in next weekend's World Series. If California wins, the teams
will play again due to the double-elimination format.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UMass and its five seniors have only Sunday's
graduation to look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really a devastating loss,'' said coach Elaine
Sortino. She pointed to a pitch made by Henderson in the eighth
inning she believed was a strike. Instead it was ruled a ball, and
California second baseman Lisa Iancin belted the next pitch for a
double that scored Amber Phillips and Maiko Bristow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Henderson) pitched a great game, but I also think
that call was critical on a changeup,'' said Sortino. ``I think
I'll probably remember it the rest of my life, but that's just the
way the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even trying to strike her out, I was just trying to
get her to put the ball in play so we could make an out,'' added a
teary Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   California freshman Jocelyn Forest (21-6) proceeded to fan the
final three UMass batters on her way to striking out 14 and
collecting her first career no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson (30-4) struck out 10, and looked as if she had the
same stuff that enabled her to toss her own no-hitter and strike
out 14 in a 3-0 win over Long Island University earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth no-hitter of the season for Henderson, the kind
of performance that has made ``Harry,'' as she's known to UMass
fans, the reason that virtually every home game has been packed.
Saturday, a half-dozen fans sat on the roof of a shed past the
bleachers and put up ``K'' cards every time Henderson fanned a
batter. They were busy all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A leadoff double by second baseman Mandy Galas, followed by a
sinlge by center fielder Teri Rooney, resulted in UMass's first
run. Catcher Nikki Faessler blasted a home run to center field in
the fourth to up the lead to 2-0, and UMass added one more in the
top of the seventh when first baseman Cherra Wheeler doubled to
knock in Katie Kenderski.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Saturday's elimination, both the fans who cheered the
team as they walked off the field and Sortino seemed to recognize
the impact that the team had on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say about five kids that took you to four NCAA
tournaments, won four Atlantic 10 titles, and took you to two World
Series?'' said Sortino. ``No other class has had as great an impact
on the UMass softball program than the class of 1999. I think it's
quite fitting that they close out the century, because the record
books will probably stand for a long, long time with what these
kids have done.''

DESPITE McGWIRE'S BLASTS, DODGERS OUTSLUG CARDINALS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The folks came to see St. Louis' Mark McGwire put
on a home run show. He did it in batting practice, and again in the
game. Big Mac hit two homers, including one out of Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A lesson McGwire learned during his 70-homer crusade last season
resurfaced Saturday: in the overall picture, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit two homers totaling 900 feet but St. Louis still
lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers 10-7 in front of a season-high
54,179 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were nice hits but if we were to win it would mean a lot
more,'' said McGwire, a Pomona native who grew up going to Dodgers
games. ``I remember being a young kid having Dodger Dogs. They're
the best dogs in baseball. I'd have three or four.''
</P>
<P>
   That is about the extent of how much McGwire wants to talk about
homers these days. The National League leader is taking a cue.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi answered McGwire's 11th and
12th homers with his 16th. He also tripled, drove in two runs and
scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not talk about the home runs,'' Mondesi said. ``It was a
good night for me. We have to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Mondesi weren't alone in their long-ball shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' Todd Hollandsworth played first base for the first
time in his career and hit his first homer in more than a year. St.
Louis' Fernando Tatis hit his 13th of the season _ and fifth
against the Dodgers _ but another Dodgers nemesis was retired with
the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jeff Shaw, who had allowed runs in his last three
outings, had a hairy moment in the ninth trying to secure the win
for Darren Dreifort. Shaw allowed a two-out single and walked
McGwire to bring up Ray Lankford, who had homered in the ninth last
Sunday to beat Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the Dodgers holding a 10-7 lead, Lankford lined
out to first. It allowed Dreifort, buoyed by a five-run Dodgers
first inning, to tie Kevin Brown for the team lead in wins.
Dreifort is 5-2 while Shaw has nine saves. Clint Sodowsky (0-1)
allowed eight runs in 31/3 innings and took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always learn from the mistake,'' Shaw said. ``You have to
make sure you get the ball in to (Lankford).''
</P>
<P>
   Especially with the way the ball is jumping out of Dodger
Stadium. Long viewed as a pitcher's park, the first two months of
the season are ruining that reputation.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three seasons there were 1.6 homers hit per game
in Chavez Ravine. In 23 games this season the Dodgers and their
opponents have hit 72 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth followed McGwire's first-inning homer with his
own, a two-run shot to right field in the bottom of the first. It
was Hollandsworth's first homer since May 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While more important homers have been hit this season here, none
were as impressive as the second one McGwire hit.
</P>
<P>
   After his first shot _ a 416-foot homer which left Cincinnati's
Cinergy Field as the only major-league park in which he has played
in but not homered _ the 6-foot-5, 250-pounder astonished everyone
in the eighth inning with a two-run blast off Jamie Arnold that
cleared the roof of the bleachers in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   With the 484-foot homer, McGwire became the third player to hit
a ball out of Dodger Stadium. Mike Piazza did it Sept. 21, 1997,
and Willie Stargell did it twice. It was McGwire's 12th homer of
the season and the 55th time in his career he's hit two in one
game.
</P>
<P>
   It also brought the Cardinals within 9-7, but Mondesi homered
with one out in the eighth to push the Dodgers lead to 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even impressed (Dodgers catcher Todd) Hundley,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``He said, `I never saw one hit that
good.' I said, `You called (the pitch).'''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were able to joke about it because they won. Now,
they'll try to win back-to-back games for the first time this month
when the teams conclude the season series today.

TWO OF VEGAS' MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF BOXING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Marc Ratner and Jack Leone have for years been major
players in the fight scene of this gambling metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner is the longtime executive director of the Nevada State
Athletic Commission. He oversees every fight card in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Leone worked 11 years as a marketing director for Caesars Palace
during its boxing heyday. He since has worked in the same capacity
at the MGM Grand - until Feb. 1998 - and currently is Vice
President of Marketing for the new Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Talk boxing to these guys, and they become animated. Saturday's
WBC welterweight title bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Oba Carr
highlighted the first fight card held at the Mandalay Bay Events
Center. Leone was overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have a marquee name and Oscar De La Hoya is a big
name, Leone said. ``Caesars built its reputation on big fights and
big events and to an extent, so did the MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about bringing people to your property.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner also was thrilled. About Mandalay Bay's first card?
Absolutely. He's also excited about what he perceives as a
resurgence of major fights in this dessert town.
</P>
<P>
   This city has arguably been the biggest player in the fight
game. But two of its largest players - Caesars Palace and the MGM
Grand, have been less visible of late.
</P>
<P>
   Caesars' interest began to dwindle when it tore down its outside
stadium in late 1996, and was going through a sale. The MGM Grand
actually closed for boxing for one year and seven months in the
aftermath of the riot that followed the second Mike Tyson-Evander
Holyfield bite fight in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Things are changing, Ratner says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caesars was recently bought by a company called Park Place,
which owns the Hiltons and Ballys, he said. ``Park Place is very
much fight conscious. Caesars used to be a player, and will be a
player again, but under a different owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very positive thing for Caesars.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner said that the MGM Grand will also become a major force
again. Mike Tyson will be released from prison inside two weeks,
and he has a contract with MGM. Ratner said he expects Tyson to be
fighting there again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then this magnificent place (Mandalay Bay) will have De La
Hoya-Trinidad in September (provided the contract gets signed), and
hopefully the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield rematch in November,
Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez rematch last
September at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center, there were few major fights
in this city last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying last year, `What happened in Vegas?' Ratner
said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was, very few of the top fighters squared off
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this year they are, Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Tyson-Francois Botha at the MGM Grand in January.
De La Hoya and Ike Quartey fought inn February at the Thomas &AMP; Mack
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although Caesars Palace has sponsored some of the bigger fights
in this city the past few years, it has not held a major fight at
Caesars since the first De La Hoya-Chavez fight in 1996. Caesars
tore down its outdoor arena, and did not rebuild. It has been using
the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   With Park Place now owning it, Ratner expects Caesars to make a
move for another large stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mandaly Bay Resort &AMP; Casino, while Leone is highly
anticipating how major of a player it will become, he is cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with Caesars for 11 years and back then we had Leonard,
Hearns and Tuson was beginning his career. So, it goes in cycles,
he said. ``But it's also timing. I'm sure if the proper fights
would have come along, the MGM Grand would have been interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are a lot of concerts, conventions, things like
that, to consider. You don't just see a big fight and then go,
boom, we're going to have it.

<P>
   KOSOVO PACKAGE:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ Developments. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DOCTOR (Jazince, Macedonia) _ There are moments when the
pure exhilaration of being here leads Dr. Jennifer Walser to wish
she did not have to return to New York. But there are also moments
when her efforts to alleviate are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the
tragedy unfolding before her. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The mood in the city. It is
weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism. The
citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week, feel
they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame at
what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the
obvious. By Stephen Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Fier, Albania) _ In a place called Fier,
pronounced fear, there is a camp called Hope, and the Americans who
are building the camp hope thousands of Kosovo refugees will come
to safety here until they can return to their homeland. But so far,
the refugees' fear of coming this far south seems to be winning out
over hope. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ More refugees cross the border from
Kosovo, in the biggest surge in weeks. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>

   INDIA-GANDHI (New Delhi) _ A profile of Sonia Gandhi. By Celia
S. Dugger.

turmoil. By Michael R. Gordon.

Greenberg.

Albright and the Clinton administration for denying him a second
term. By Paul Lewis.

   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE (Newnan, Ga.) _ The members of the Coweta County
Board of Education are not naive enough to think that they
vanquished school violence two weeks ago when they voted to
prohibit students from carrying bookbags unless the bags are
transparent or made of mesh. But at least it is something, they
say. And their attitude is not unique: In the month since the
shootings at Columbine High School, school boards, county
commissions and state legislatures all across the country have
proposed and enacted a broad series of measures aimed at attacking
the youth violence problem at the margins. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Undated) _ After decades of flops, $100 billion
in costs and sharp rises in the political stakes, the Pentagon is
trying again to build a system that can defend America against
missile attack. By William Broad.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-SPEECH (Grambling, La.) _ In a commencement address,
Clinton says the Labor Department will review requests from four
states to allow them to spend some unemployment compensation
surpluses on family leave for new parents. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   GUNSHOW-REACT (Fresno, Calif.) _ Talking to gun enthusiasts at a
gun show about the new legislation coming out of Washington. By
Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   EMBRYO-RESEARCH (Undated) _ A presidentially-appointed ethics
panel has decided to recommend that the federal government begin
paying for some research on human embryos. A draft report of the
decision to be announced next month concludes that the moral cost
of destroying embryos in research is outweighed by the social good
that could come from the studies. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   (Coded w)
</P>
<P>
   APPEALS-COURT (Washington) _ The Federal Appeals Court based in
Richmond, Va. has, in the view of scholars, lawyers and many of its
own members, quietly but steadily become the boldest conservative
court in the nation, setting remarkable new precedents and adopting
a striking tone on several issues. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   SENIORS-POLITICS (Washington) _ Once reliably Democratic in
congressional races, older Americans have become a critical swing
vote, the object of intense competition on Capitol Hill. Democrats
lost the 60-and-over vote by a 60-40 margin last November, while
breaking even or carrying every other age group. Democrats also
lost that vote in 1996 and 1994. Explanations abound for this
fundamental shift, and what the competition for the vote has meant
on Capitol Hill. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   COX-PROFILE (Washington) _ He is something of a closet
Renaissance man in the House, one who speaks Russian, savors Ayn
Rand and seeks out the latest translation of Omar Khayyam. For a
hobby, he reads book after book on mathematicians. And so Rep.
Christopher Cox may seem the perfect prospect for presiding over
the House's ultra-secret investigation of suspected espionage by
China. By Francis X. Clines.

businesses and governments are now being forced to decide just how
much they will invest in preparing for Year 2000 computer problems,
and suddenly contingency planning has moved to the top of many
companies' agenda. Unlike most repair work, contingency plans have
to take into account not just the computer user's own systems, but
all the outside forces the user cannot control, like public power,
phones, water, and the readiness of both suppliers and major
customers. As a result, executives and their project leaders are

 &HT;    IQ to I-Ching, favorite sites brighten the day
 &HT;    CYBERSCENE column
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For people who spend most of their working day and some of their
personal time connected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of
the daily routine.
</P>
<P>
   Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the place
where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the territory,
those of us who spend half our waking hours in cyberspace get to
know the lay of the land, as well.
</P>
<P>
   We have sites that are part of our practical everyday working
life. For instance, I check the weather by zapping over to the
Weather Channel (weather.com); or for looking up a street address,
e-mail address, or phone number go to Switchboard
(www.switchboard.com), or to find the best way to get to a business
across town use Yahoo!'s excellent mapping service
(/maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).
</P>
<P>
   But over time, I've also found some places that just tickle me.
Just as a traveler might urge a friend to someday visit the
Petrified Forest or to plan a long week at the Grand Canyon, there
are some destinations that I like to recommend to my friends. Today
we'll talk about those favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have no notion in the world of just what our IQ is.
We know that it's an overrated way of measuring intelligence, but
yet there may be moments when you wonder just how smart you really
are. If you'd like a pretty good measuring stick on IQ, there's a
Web site that _ as nearly as I can tell _ produces reasonably
accurate results.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Self-discovery Workshop and is at www.iqtest
</P>
<P>
   .com/welcometest.html. While at the page you can read a fairly
unbiased account of how IQ tests work.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can take, in just 18 minutes, an online version of the
IQ test. This isn't nearly as accurate as the kind of test you'd
pay hundreds of dollars to take, but _ based on the experiences of
some friends who had their IQ measured professionally _ the results
here are close enough to offer a rough gauge of how you'd test out.
</P>
<P>
   Since part of the test results are based on how much of the test
you complete in 18 minutes, make sure that you carve out at least
that much time for yourself if you decide to try the test. The nice
thing about taking an online test is that you can keep quiet if the
results horrify you. If, on the other hand, you wind up being an
undiscovered Einstein, then you can brag.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on our tour is a site run by Bell Labs (the folks
who, among other things, brought you the transistor). It's located
at www.bell-labs.com
</P>
<P>
   /project/tts/.
</P>
<P>
   This particular part of the Bell Labs site deals with turning
computer text into synthesized human speech. While the notion of a
talking computer is no longer a novelty, the power of the program
demonstrated on this site is still impressive enough to bring a
smile. You can type in text, and then your computer will repeat it
back as spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, and this is my favorite of the bunch, there is a site
that uses the ancient fortunetelling technique called I-Ching on
the anything-but-ancient Web. Just go to this site at
www.iching.com/ and follow the directions.
</P>
<P>
   _ While you shouldn't use the advice you find here to start a
new life or decide what car to buy, it's a lot of fun and _
sometimes _ chillingly specific to the question that you ask.
</P>
<P>
   _ The site, by the way, is an advertisement for a program that
uses the same software you'll use online. But the Web version is so
good that you probably won't feel the need to buy the program, even
if you enjoy the experience.

 &HT;    Registering domain name to get easier
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ My editor, Bob, got curious about domain names
the other day and went to the Web site of Network Solutions Inc.,
the company in charge of doling out Internet domain names. He did a
domain name search out of curiosity to see who owns
``www.bob.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft?'' he moaned. ``How the hell did they get to use my
name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they used to have a piece of software called `Bob,'''
I told him. ``It wasn't all that successful.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who's ever coveted a particularly juicy domain name
(sorry, ``starwars.com'' and ``maytheforcebewithyou.com'' were
snagged, let's just say, a long time ago), there's good news afoot.
</P>
<P>
   The process of registering a domain name, which is simpler than
it used to be, is still not as effortless as it could be. But soon,
it will be a little easier and likely cheaper if a plan to include
more registrars and add new domain suffixes is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, administered by the government's nonprofit group,
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, began its
first huge step recently by adding companies that can register
domain names for users and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those five companies are the first step in taking domain
registration control away from Network Solutions, which has been
the sole assigner of domain names. Those new registrars, which
include America Online and Register.com, are just the beginning. An
additional 29 registrar companies are to be announced at the end of
June, and they are expected to include such heavy hitters as AT&AMP;T
and Verio.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest obstacle is setup _ the five initial
companies are still testing their software and eliminating bugs
before going live.
</P>
<P>
   Sascha Mornell, a director of marketing at Register.com, said
the addition of new registrars will be similar to the deregulation
of the long-distance phone business, which, among other things, has
meant discounts and better service for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition always brings in better pricing, better service
and faster change,'' Mornell said. ``And right now, it's a
laborious process to get domain names registered. I think that's
about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Mornell's company, based in New York, estimates the number of
domain names registered will grow from about 6 million currently to
100 million over the next three years. The growing number of domain
name owners means new services must make it easier to manage
domains and easier to register them.
</P>
<P>
   Competition will probably mean lower prices for registering a
domain. Currently it costs $70 to register a domain in addition to
what an Internet service provider charges to host the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As more companies come online offering domain registration,
other issues will hopefully be addressed. Cybersquatting, the
practice of buying up domain names for the sole purpose of selling
them at an inflated price later, may be challenged with legislation
and new standards for registration.
</P>
<P>
   Domain name disputes _ when a copyright holder sues someone else
for using their company's name as a domain, for instance _ will be
addressed in the courts and a legal precedent will eventually be
set on who has the right to use a name.
</P>
<P>
   And the dwindling number of available ``.com'' and ``.org''
addresses is leading to the introduction of new suffixes including
``.info,'' ``.firm'' and ``.store.'' The addition of these may lead
to even more confusion in what is becoming an increasingly
convoluted World Wide Web, but the cure for that lies in better
search engine technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, in a booming Internet economy, it's still difficult
for most users to find information on the Internet. Search engine
technology must evolve dramatically and the way we navigate the
Web, which currently is less than intuitive, must also improve.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all to say that we can expect to see a lot more
``first-time-home-pages.org'' and ``obscure.companies.com'' finding
a home on the Web as the street signs of the Internet become easier
and cheaper to erect.

 &HT;    NaturallySpeaking available soon
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some areas, dare I say it, the PC world commands a lead over
Apple Computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more significant is voice-recognition software, a
technology that Apple Computer pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to the
relief of many Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   At the company-sponsored Worldwide Developers conference two
weeks ago, interim chief executive Steve Jobs announced that Dragon
Systems will produce a Mac version of its NaturallySpeaking
software.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's NaturallySpeaking software is the leading
voice-recognition title in the United States. It enables computers
to translate conversational speech into text.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Dragon produced only a Windows version of
NaturallySpeaking. Now it will release a Mac version later this
year, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Macs have some limited voice-recognition capabilities through
their PlainTalk technology, which comes installed on most models.
PlainTalk, though, cannot translate conversational speech into
text.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Apple Computer has never had a Mac program that could
translate conversational speech. It hasn't been for a lack of
trying.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been working to enhance its voice technology
with a company called Articulate Systems Inc. But the two companies
couldn't get along, and Articulate pulled the plug on its Mac
offering, PowerSecretary, last year. Dragon Software, by the way,
owned a stake in Articulate.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dragon's Naturally- Speaking, released two years ago,
computers could only translate speech spoken unnaturally slowly and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking has created whole new uses for computers in
the past two years. Companies use it to take orders over the
telephone and provide automated customer support, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   And NaturallySpeaking is a wonderful alternative to people who
can no longer type because of repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that NaturallySpeaking is perfect. Far from
it.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking is a hog in terms of its requirements for disk
space and RAM. But the software is improving all the time with new
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon hasn't announced pricing or a brand name for its Mac
version of NaturallySpeaking. The Windows version, available in
several configurations, sells for between $200 and $700.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's Mac version of NaturallySpeaking also appears to be a
peace offering. It has battled with Apple Computer through the
years about voice-recognition technology patents. The two
companies, for example, have sued each other over the technology.

 &HT;    Web sites can help in tracing ancestors
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week I saw the places where my great-grandfather lived and
worked _ something I would not be able to do without the Web. For
me, the grandchild of Eastern European immigrants, learning about
my family history seemed nearly impossible. Finding bits of
information on the Web was a bit like shining a light in a dark
corner of my attic and finding unexpected treasures I didn't know
existed.
</P>
<P>
   I owe it all to Katie Couric. Well, actually, I owe it to the
entire anchor team of the ``Today'' show, who spent a week tracing
their respective family trees and posting lists of links to help
users get started in the job of researching their own families by
exploring on the MSNBC Web site.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Web sites that MSNBC had recommended were so
swamped by other novice genealogists like myself, it took a lot of
time for each page of requested information to load. Finally, I
just gave up and started looking for Web sites on my own, armed
with some of the links and suggestions that had been provided by
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that it would be impossible to trace my family
tree much past my grandparents, Morris and Fanny Katz, who came to
New York City in the early 1900s. Neither the Russians nor the
Nazis were much into keeping records of the Polish and Latvian
villages they plundered and destroyed in the first half of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   Even if I had the time and resources to travel to Europe to seek
out my family's records, I wouldn't know where to begin, because so
little is known about my great-grandparents. Making things even
worse are my family's many and conflicting oral histories. My
father has nine brothers and sisters who all tell different stories
about my grandparents and great-grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   So, although I am able to call up a wide variety of genealogy
sites and links on the Web, none of this stuff turned out to be of
much use to me, coming as I do from a family that can spend the
better part of a wedding reception _ as mine did once _ debating if
we really did have a Great Uncle Harry who absconded with the
family fortune and went to South Africa to strike it rich in the
diamond rush. The one thing everyone seems to agree on is where my
grandmother was born. It's a place called Slonim, which she said
was in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with just the name of a city in Poland, I began my search.
It was pretty discouraging at first. I tried searching for my
grandmother's maiden name but, since I didn't know quite how to
spell it, I had to rely on a ``sound-alike'' search engine that
couldn't come up with anything even close. After about a month of
searching nearly every genealogy site there I could find, I was
depressed and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving up entirely, I decided to call up one of the
search engines and type ``Slonim'' in the search field. I nearly
fell over when I found 71 sites. The reason I couldn't find Slonim
was now clear. After World War II,
</P>
<P>
   Slonim became part of the Soviet province of Belarus. More
searching led me to the homepage of a British genealogist whose
family had come from Slonim and who maintained a Web site devoted
to his family history. He included a page called ``The Ledger of
Slonim.''
</P>
<P>
   I discovered my grandmother's hometown had encouraged Jewish
immigrants who were escaping from the Crusades to settle there as
early as 1388. From all indications, it appears that Jews began
their settlement in Slonim that same year. The Web site describes
the prosperity of the city from the Renaissance through the late
1800s. There was also a page of pictures of libraries, synagogues
and other buildings my grandmother and her parents may have
frequented.
</P>
<P>
   The site also describes the anti-Semitic arson attacks on Jewish
homes and businesses. My great-grandfather's comb-and-brush factory
was burnt to the ground in one of these pogroms. That was when my
grandmother was given just enough money to go to America out of
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandmother left Slonim in the 1900s, there were about
12,000 Jews living there. After the Germans took Slonim from the
Russians during World War II, the Jewish population dwindled to
zero, where it remains today. Further investigation, all done on
the Web, uncovered first-person accounts of life in Slonim after my
family had left and efforts of the Belarussian government to
restore the libraries and synagogues destroyed by previous
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for my family tree involved using what you could call
``the other Internet.'' So many people think of the Web as a
utility, something used for commercial or practical purposes. Along
with established commercial sites, there is a wealth of information
that will never make a dime or the Media Metrix top 10. But to
scholars, students and family tree-hunters like me, they are every
bit as valuable.

 &HT;    Investment book aimed at the Y2K wary
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you fear the Y2K bug, this may be the book for you. ``Crisis
Investing for the Year 2000'' is a guide on how to protect your
finances if computers _ especially those on Wall Street _ start to
go haywire after midnight on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparing yourself and your investments for Y2K is not the act
of a fringe survivalist,'' say authors L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua
in the promotion blurb on the jacket of their book. ``Such measures
are the practical precautions of an informed realist.'' Here are
some of the authors' predictions: Y2K will disrupt time-sensitive
industries such as banking and stock trading; Y2K will hurt
companies dependent on computer automation for making products; and
companies dependent on overseas investments will be hurt because
most countries are ill-prepared for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer is right. The lowly but highly practical floppy
drive is on the way out. Learn about all the new bigger and faster
drives ready to replace it in the June issue of PC World. Among the
contenders is a new drive called the Orb, which stores 2.2
gigabytes _ yes, gigabytes _ of data on a single disk. It retails
for only $200. Another favorite of PC World is the new Iomega drive
based on the USB standard. The magazine says these drives are the
easiest to install and use.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Can you run your household like an office? An affirmative answer
to that question is the idea behind a new computer CD called
FamilyTime. The CD includes six integrated tools designed to help
you plan, control and simplify everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Those tools include a calendar that lets every family member
keep his or her own schedule and then integrates all those
schedules into one master calendar. There's a meal planner that
prints out shopping lists based on the meals you've scheduled and a
record organizer that stores all kinds of information, including
medical and car records. FamilyTime is published by TimeSoft and is
available only for PCs running Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   For kids, Microsoft has released its latest title in the Magic
School Bus series. This one is about animals and features
exploration of seven different geographic zones. There are also
60-plus photographs and 14 games and puzzles. This latest Magic Bus
game is available only for PCs running Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is full of news, and most of it is about itself.
Yes, there's no better place to learn about and keep up with the
Internet than cyberspace itself. One of the best places for news
about the Net is CNET's News.com site. This site not only offers
news but is a daily updated compendium of where to find more
information about the Net. You'll find this site at www.news.com.

 &HT;    RadioMouse works, but who needs it?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Ndews Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We gather today to examine a thing called RadioMouse.
</P>
<P>
   RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an AM-FM
radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been marketed it
soon will be.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first wireless
mouse I've tried.
</P>
<P>
   RadioMouse is a two-button affair of a fairly conventional
humpback style, made rather heavy by the three AAA batteries it
requires. It is smaller than the Microsoft mouse to which I am
accustomed, and I do not find it as comfortable, but that may be a
matter of habit.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver is a small plastic box with a cord that attaches to
the mouse port. It can sit just about anywhere on the desk; it
doesn't seem to require being right in front of the mouse pad.
According to the manual, it can be six to 10 feet from the
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That, basically, is all there is to RadioMouse. There isn't any
software; it is entirely plug-and-play and in my case, at least,
worked automatically with the Microsoft drivers already installed.
</P>
<P>
   The radio connection appears to work quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the mouse itself. The
buttons are too sensitive, resulting in unwanted right-button
clicks. The ball and rollers have a tendency to lock up, as if
dirty.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the manual warns that ``Mouse ball is easy to attach
dirt and causes malfunction. Clean mouse ball and the two rolling
rolls with tissues.''
</P>
<P>
   From this, you could deduce that RadioMouse is made in China
even if half the manual wasn't printed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, however, whatever causes the jams isn't related to
attached dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The manual also suggests a novel form of at-your-desk exercise:
``You may discover how easy it is to get comfortable, and enjoy
pointing your PC with freedom and convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, finally, is: Do we need this thing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Probably not, even if it worked smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of a contraption some outfit sent me years ago
that was intended to serve both as a mouse pad and as a kind of
tether for the cord to keep it from fighting you. The modern
Microsoft mouse seems to have a better cord; mine doesn't give me
any trouble at all. I'm perfectly happy with it, and it doesn't
need batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The only real need I can see for a wireless mouse is a situation
in which you're so far from your CPU unit that the mouse cord won't
reach. Then it might be a viable alternative to an extension cable
on the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you feel a wireless mouse would serve you best, you
can learn more about the RadioMouse at:
</P>
<P>
   www.cordlessmouse.com/
</P>
<P>
   It costs $40 _ batteries included.

 &HT;    Software, Internet make tracing family tree easier
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene and Janice James of Riverside, Ohio had been interested in
the histories of their families for years, but Gene said they never
got deeply into the genealogy hobby until he retired around 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get started once or twice, but the record-keeping
and paper pushing was just horrendous,'' Gene James said. ``I
didn't have the time and patience for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Gene James is a dedicated hobby genealogist who has traced
his direct ancestry to the 17th century. And the tool that cut out
enough hassles for James to pursue the hobby is his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   James said the computer does two things that make genealogy
simpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes records, and it
links hobbyists through the Internet for the exchange of ideas and
information.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately, the Internet is not the genealogy panacea
that some people believe. Genealogy experts like James and Carole
Medlar, genealogy librarian for the Dayton and Montgomery County
Public Library, say nothing can substitute yet for the hours people
spending looking through paper records for data about their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who come in thinking they can find their
entire family tree on the Internet, but that's not usually true,''
Medlar said. ``That doesn't happen unless you stumble across
someone online who has gone to all the trouble before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering information
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in tracing your roots, a good place to
start is with your family members, according to James and Medlar.
And a key bit of information you need to have is where people
lived.
</P>
<P>
   James, for example, said his father left him a family tree with
names and dates relating to his ancestry. ``When I was starting out
I brought it to a woman who had been doing research, and she said
the things my father left me were exciting, but they weren't all
that useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James was a civilian employee in the flight dynamics laboratory
before he retired, and he worked with computers 15 or 20 years
before retiring. He now writes a monthly column on computer
research for the newsletter of the local chapter of the Ohio
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   To get authoritative information on who was related to whom, a
researcher has to get to local records in the places their
ancestors were born, exchanged property, died and so on. In the
United States, most of the important records are kept at the county
level.
</P>
<P>
   A birth certificate on file in a county office with the names of
the parents and the child is an example of the kind of primary
source material that is tapped to produce a well-documented family
tree. Also important are marriage and death certificates, church
records, deeds and wills and old federal Census records.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said only a fraction of that kind of information is
accessible directly through the Internet, but the Internet
computers at the public library are still a great resource for
genealogical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researching genealogy has grown to be one of the top three
hobbies in the United States and the Internet does offer marvelous
support for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said library patrons can log on to one of the library's
Internet computers to access databases with research information.
</P>
<P>
   One such database is the Social Security death benefit index,
she said. The online resource allows researchers to find the names
and dates people died and the names of people who received death
benefits after the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said the library provides free access to some premium
reference databases. These are reference tools that normally carry
a subscription or per-use price, but the library pays the fees for
its patrons.
</P>
<P>
   If you're doing research on the Internet from home, the place
most people start is at cyndislist.com. Cyndi's List is a free site
managed by genealogist Cyndi Howell, and it contains links to
41,700 sites and archives.
</P>
<P>
   The sites include thousands of links to hobbyists who have
researched their family trees, and there's a chance you'll find
someone with common ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet resources, though, generally only provide clues
that point researchers to more traditional research avenues such as
county records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is all secondary data,'' James said. ``You can't
trust any of it as absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   The public library is a great source for noncomputer records.
For example, the Dayton library has microfilm Census records for
all Ohio counties through 1860 and for Montgomery County through
1920.
</P>
<P>
   The main branch of the Dayton library downtown has a genealogy
research section, and Medlar is on duty in the area from 2 to 6
p.m. Wednesdays. She's available at the reference desk on other
days.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar said even if researchers can pinpoint where to look for
old records, they usually have to review such records themselves to
get information. ``Usually county workers are busy doing county
work,'' she said. ``Going through old county records is not what
they're paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he and his wife gather much of their information
while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't build our vacations around places we want to go to do
research,'' James said. ``But it's not unusual for us to stop for a
day on the way to going somewhere or on the way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizing information
</P>
<P>
   James said that where computers really shine is in compiling
data in a convenient form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working with the same piece of genealogy software
for the last nine years, and I still don't know all the things it
can do yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James said he keeps his genealogy records using a software
program called Brothers Keeper, but he said most of the programs on
the market cost about $15 to $45 and do basically the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   He said some popular programs include Family Tree Maker,
Ultimate Family Tree and Personal Ancestral File. To find reviews
of these programs and others, you can check the Genealogy Software
Springboard site at toltbbs.com/(tilde)kbasile/software.html.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic types of interlinking records kept in
genealogy research.
</P>
<P>
   One is the ancestor sheet that starts with an individual then
names that individual's parents, and the parents' parents, and the
grandparents' parents, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of record is a family group sheet. It lists a
husband, wife and their offspring along with some details about the
family's personal history.
</P>
<P>
   James said genealogy software allows the researcher to enter
data in a simple format. The software maintains the links between
people that have been entered into the system, and it helps the
researcher manipulate the data into useful forms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the software packages allow the researcher to enter
notes on the people whose names are listed. Some also store photos
connected with records.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people go back a few generations and they stop trying
to go further and further back,'' James said. ``Instead they get
into researching details about their ancestors' lives. They're more
interested in what their ancestors did day to day than in anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he's primarily been interested in tracing his direct
ancestors back as far as possible. So far he's traced his line back
eight generations to a man named David James who was born in 1660,
probably in Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Just including direct ancestors only going back eight
generations involves recording information on 256 people. And
James, who is still filling gaps in his direct lineage, also has
records of siblings and multiple marriages that make his database
even more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have been able to keep all this straight without
a computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When James goes to a county office, cemetery or library to look
up information about his family, he doesn't take a notepad and
pencil like old fashioned genealogists. He takes a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Online exchanges
</P>
<P>
   In addition to record-keeping, James said computers are most
useful in linking researchers to other researchers via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days before the Internet your chances of finding
somebody else working on your family tree would be almost nil,'' he
said. ``Now it happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   James said his wife's maiden name was Allenduff and in 1800,
there were records for only two people with that name in the United
States. ``Nobody knows where they came from,'' he said. ``They
could have been dropped out of a spaceship.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with such a small family, James has found four people
online researching the Allenduff ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   He's found even more people researching the James lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further you go back, the more direct ancestors you have,''
James explained. ``And the more direct ancestors you know about,
the better the chances are that some other direct descendant is
doing research, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Resources like Cyndi's List provide a way for people doing
research on their family trees to let the world know what they're
doing. And it's common for researchers to cross paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard greeting is 'Hi, Cousin!' when you hear from a
relative you didn't know you had,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   He said researchers do more than chat when they meet on line;
they also exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, James said if he found a relative working on
James family history he and the relative would print out their
family tree records and send them in a big envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Now he said it's possible to send records electronically. Most
genealogy software programs are able to convert information into a
standard format that can be shared by other software programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last week a relative sent me an e-mail that had
data on 200 people in an attachment,'' he said. ``Every year you do
more exchanges and you send more data electronically.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, James doesn't just dump information from other
researchers into his own database without checking out the new
information first. ``It's source material just like everything
else. It gives you new information to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   James also said exchanging information via e-mail has its
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful with the information you send on living
people,'' he said. ``Things like mother's maiden name, for example.
Do you realize how often mother's maiden name and information like
that is used as a security check? You don't want to spread
information that someone could use to steal someone else's
identity.''

 &HT;    MiniDisk unit makes digital recordings
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cos News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1979 Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran,
taking the occupants hostage, Anwar el-Sadat and Menachim Begin
signed a treaty ending a 30-year war between Egypt and Israel, and
a reactor accident at the Three Mile Island generating station
spewed nuclear waste into the air.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all that, it's not surprising if you've forgotten
another milestone from 1979: Sony introduced the ``Soundabout,''
later to be known as the Sony Walkman personal stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said critics at first were skeptical of the idea of a small
stereo cassette player that played its music through headsets
rather than through speakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Walkman was an immediate success in Japan and about
50,000 of them sold in the first two months.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest additions to the Walkman line is the MZ-R55
portable MiniDisc recorder/player.
</P>
<P>
   The MZ-R55 records and plays music on Sony MiniDiscs, which are
small discs that store digital recordings similar to those found on
compact discs. But while almost all compact discs are prerecorded,
most MiniDiscs are sold blank for consumers to make their own
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   A 74-minute MiniDisc sells for about $4.49 when purchased
singly, according to Sony. They're less expensive purchased in
packs of three or more.
</P>
<P>
   The MZ-R55 is the world's smallest MiniDisc recorder/player at 3
1/8 inches tall, 3 3/8 inches wide and less than an inch thick.
It's powered by a rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery.
</P>
<P>
   The player has digital connecting cables to tie into home stereo
systems to record the owner's favorite music. It allows the user to
attach titles, dates and times to recordings, and the titles show
up on the unit's LCD screen.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested retail price is $349.95.

STEPHANIE KWOLEK, THE DUPONT CHEMIST BEHIND KEVLAR, IS HONORED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Stephanie Kwolek went to work for the DuPont Co. in 1946,
it was the dawning of a synthetic era. Chemists were turning coal,
castor oil and antifreeze into new plastics and products, many of
which were for the ostensible benefit of womankind.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Tupper was just starting to turn DuPont's polyethylene into
unbreakable kitchen tumblers. Stores were hawking Lucite jewels and
rayon frocks. ``Nylon riots'' were in full swing, with women,
according to press reports of the time, clawing their way through
store crowds for nylon stockings, a scarce commodity in postwar
America.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont marketers understood the promise of women as consumers.
But, alas for Ms. Kwolek, company managers did not think much of
their potential as chemists.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Ms. Kwolek _ who held a college chemistry degree and would
one day invent the technology behind Kevlar, best known as a
bulletproof fabric _ languished for 15 years in the lab without a
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she is one to complain. Ms. Kwolek, now 75, says she is
no ``flag-waving feminist.'' Her approach was to break down
barriers quietly, from the inside. ``If you were ambitious and
applied yourself, you could acquire a great deal of knowledge,''
she said. ``There were a lot of bright, creative men. This made the
atmosphere in which I worked so stimulating and so enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Kwolek does not want for recognition. She has
been inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. She has
been awarded a National Medal of Technology. Last month, she
received the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   The use of Kevlar has expanded beyond bulletproof vests for
police officers. It is used in firefighters' boots, military
helmets, fiber optic cables, car brakes, skis and racing sails.
Though the original, pioneering patents granted to Ms. Kwolek and
her colleagues have long since expired, the trademarked Kevlar
continues to earn DuPont hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kwolek did not set out to design a bulletproof fabric. At
the time, in the mid-1960s, her goal was merely to create a fiber
strong enough to reinforce radial tires.
</P>
<P>
   The problem she and other chemists faced was that polymers with
rigid, rodlike molecules were difficult to dissolve. But she
succeeded in dissolving a polymer that had rod-like molecules. But
when she held up the solution, she saw that it was not as thick and
clear as it was expected to be, but rather, thin and cloudy. She
decided to try anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But first she had to win over the operator of the spinneret, a
colander-like device through which polymers are extruded to produce
fabric. Such a cloudy solution was sure to gum up his equipment,
the spinneret operator argued. But in the end, he relented.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Kwolek found was that under specific conditions, these
rod-like molecules arranged themselves into bundles. In each
bundle, the molecules were arranged parallel to one another _ that
is, all the rods in one bundle were oriented all in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   But the bundles themselves were in a jumble and facing different
directions. When forced through the tiny holes in the spinneret,
however, the bundles came out on the other side all facing the same
direction. And this uniform direction made the fiber that was
created very strong and stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stiffness was absolutely spectacular,'' Ms. Kwolek said.
``That's when I said, `Aha.' I knew then and there it was an
important discovery.''

HAPPINESS FOR A $400 FEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are

(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Subtlety is not Irene Nathan's middle name. Her first question
at an encounter is likely to be, ``Are you Jewish?'' The second,
``Do you want to get married?'' Or maybe, ``Would you marry a
goy?'' If so, that client is not for her.
</P>
<P>
   As a partner in Matchmakers, Ms. Nathan claims to have created
almost 300 marriages in 16 years, drawn mostly from Chicago's
Orthodox Jews; only four ended in divorce. Her fee, which she
announces up front, is $400. That certifies a prospect's serious
intentions: ``If you give $400, you want good merchandise.'' She is
candid about her candidates at any given moment: ``We have better,
but this is all the stock I have just now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nathan, a widowed fast-talker in her peppy 60s, is at the
center of Mark Wexler's appealing documentary, ``Me and My
Matchmaker,'' but it turns out that although Wexler hides behind
his camera, he is her prey.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her clients think they know who they are (``I have a
graduate degree'') and whom they are looking for or trying to avoid
(``They have to not be on drugs''). One female client speaks for
many: ``I don't ask for much; I just want happiness.'' Wexler, 39
and presumably still looking, is less forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The easygoing, hourlong documentary consists mainly of Ms.
Nathan's wooing Wexler with meals while she tries to figure out
whether he really wants a bride and, if so, what kind. ``I've got
to get you married,'' she announces. He becomes her merchandise. Or
does he?
</P>
<P>
   As he tells of the breakup of his mother and father, client and
matchmaker find themselves verging toward intimacy. ``You invaded
my heart,'' she says. When he brings home a woman for chicken soup
with matzoh balls, Ms. Nathan rushes to judgment: ``I didn't like
her. I didn't like anything about her.'' Is her judgment strictly
professional?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to interfere in your life,'' Ms. Nathan
announces. Can you believe her? Can Wexler believe her? Does she
believe herself? After all those dozens of clients and her own
lonely years, she must know better. ``Me and My Matchmaker''
becomes an account of an affair unlike any other in Irene Nathan's
career.

 WALL STREET TAKES A LOOK AT EISNER, THE MAN AND THE MANAGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The financial feud between the Walt Disney Co.'s chairman,
Michael D. Eisner, and his former lieutenant, Jeffrey Katzenberg,
may have made headlines. But few of the customers examining Mickey
Mouse backpacks or Disney T-shirts, at the Disney Store in Times
Square on Friday even knew a dispute was going on.
</P>
<P>
   The one shopper in an informal survey who did, Chad Coleman, a
Canadian tourist, said the courtroom battle made ``absolutely no
difference'' in his perception of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   But for its part, Wall Street is not happy watching Disney air
its dirty linen in public. The company's stock has been depressed
for months, primarily because its earnings have been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Some media industry analysts believe the lawsuit has been a
factor, raising questions about Eisner's judgment in letting a
private battle go public at a time when Disney needs all his
attention. Disney stock closed at $29.50 on Friday, up from its
52-week low of $22.50, but far from its July 15 high of $40.625.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Eisner's failure to resolve his dispute with
Katzenberg makes a number of analysts nervous, though they are
generally reluctant to criticize the Disney management in public.
</P>
<P>
   Some have even become concerned about Eisner's management
skills. ``The fight highlights not managing well, and it has to be
distracting on a management basis,'' one longtime Disney analyst
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But Laura Martin, a media industry analyst at CS First Boston,
disagrees. ``I do not think that losing the lawsuit reflects poorly
on Eisner's management skills at all,'' she said. ``The fight was
personal and people are human. I do not think it is indicative of
his judgments in operating the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, Disney's former film studio chief, and now a partner
at Dreamworks SKG, contended that Disney owed him $250 million
because his contract guaranteed him a percentage of the profits
from films produced during his tenure. Disney had initially
countered that when Katzenberg left the company in 1994 for
Dreamworks SKG, he forfeited those profits. Eisner was adamant
about not settling.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides reached a partial settlement in November 1997 in
which Disney conceded that Katzenberg was owed something, and
Disney has paid Katzenberg $117 million. But there was no agreement
about the exact amount of that ``something,'' leading to last
week's hearings. Several people close to Disney said Katzenberg had
nearly doubled his demands from his initial asking price of $250
million, making negotiations difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Although Paul Breckenridge Jr., the retired Los Angeles Superior
Court judge who is acting as referee in the current hearings, ruled
on Tuesday that Katzenberg was entitled to some payment, he has yet
to quantify the amount.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney spokesman said the company did not comment on its stock
price. But a person close to Disney noted: ``If there were a
reasonable amount of new money that Katzenberg were asking for, it
would have been settled. But Disney considers it has a fiduciary
responsibility to shareholders to pay him a reasonable amount and
not the excessive amount he is still seeking.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, where image is all-important, the image-trashing
that has characterized the public fight is unusual. The name
calling reached its peak in court last week when the plaintiffs
introduced notes to Eisner's autobiography, published last year, in
which the Disney chairman said, referring to Katzenberg, ``I think
I hate the little midget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is embarrassing on both sides,'' said another analyst who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``This is the kind of thing that
should have been compromised somewhere along the line. I don't know
if Eisner's behavior has been responsible for a decline. How can
you measure it? There are seven good reasons for the stock to be
down. But it has to have tarnished his image.''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on whom you ask. Abraham Zalesnik, the Konosuke
Matsushita professor emeritus of leadership at Harvard Business
School, said the dispute raised questions about Eisner's ability to
continue running Disney successfully. He said he thought Eisner
expected too much from both Katzenberg, and Michael Ovitz, whom
Eisner brought in as his second in command in 1995 and who left the
company in 1996, with a cash and stock settlement valued at $120
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether Eisner attaches magical significance
to these people he brings in and then gets disenchanted and
therefore lashes out,'' Zalesnik said. ``At this stage, his
judgment of people is really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Zalesnik says Eisner is responsible for protecting shareholder
value and should not simply agree to pay Katzenberg the $250
million he is seeking. But he adds that Eisner made a serious
mistake in letting a personal battle erupt into a courtroom drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could not work it out with this man who is gifted, but his
job is to make it work out so that it does not become a public
spectacle,'' Zalesnik said. The dispute, he said, reflects on
Eisner's ability to retain top managers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Professor John Coffe of Columbia University
Law School is dismissive of the court case, saying it does nothing
to discredit Eisner. ``This is not the kind of episode that has
recurring significance, that says Eisner is functionally incapable
of being a successful manager,'' Coffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think institutional shareholders want Eisner to be
generous with shareholder funds,'' he continued. ``They want Eisner
to get the cheapest settlement possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst cautioned that Wall Street often indulges
in overkill in its propensity to criticize executives when their
companies are doing badly.
</P>
<P>
   This person recalled that when Time Warner Inc. was doing
poorly, its chairman, Gerald A. Levin, was widely criticized. But
as Time Warner stock has soared, Levin is being widely heralded as
a visionary leader.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levin never had the mystique that Eisner had. After
taking over Disney in 1984, Eisner produced an impressive record
until 1998. Certainly, Eisner would be less vulnerable to criticism
if the company were continuing to do well.
</P>
<P>
   But not only is the company's ABC broadcast network facing
problems, as Ms. Martin of CS First Boston noted, there are also
cost problems driven by escalating sports rights fees at both ABC
and its ESPN cable network. In addition, there is concern that
``the company is spending too much money on theme parks, which
potentially depresses long-term returns on capital,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   These problem unfortunately come at just the moment when Disney
needs its investors to feel confident that Eisner can himself focus
on Disney's problems and rally a strong management team to help
him.

   For papers of Monday, May 24, The New York Times plans the
following stories on the continuing crisis over Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ As NATO enters its third month
of air attacks, the Serbian military is sending fresh troops into
Kosovo to shore up its positions near the border with Albania, NATO
officials said Sunday. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DOCTOR (Jazince, Macedonia) _ There are moments when the
pure exhilaration of being here leads Dr. Jennifer Walser to wish
she did not have to return to New York. But there are also moments
when her efforts to alleviate are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the
tragedy unfolding before her. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The mood in the city. It is
weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism. The
citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week, feel
they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame at
what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the
obvious. By Stephen Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ More refugees cross the border from
Kosovo, in the biggest surge in weeks. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Fier, Albania) _ In a place called Fier,
pronounced fear, there is a camp called Hope, and the Americans who

   For papers of Monday, May 24, The New York Times plans the
following stories on the continuing crisis over Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ As NATO enters its third month
of air attacks, the Serbian military is sending fresh troops into
Kosovo to shore up its positions near the border with Albania, NATO
officials said Sunday. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DOCTOR (Jazince, Macedonia) _ There are moments when the
pure exhilaration of being here leads Dr. Jennifer Walser to wish
she did not have to return to New York. But there are also moments
when her efforts to alleviate are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the
tragedy unfolding before her. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The mood in the city. It is
weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism. The
citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week, feel
they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame at
what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the
obvious. By Stephen Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ More refugees cross the border from
Kosovo, in the biggest surge in weeks. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Fier, Albania) _ In a place called Fier,
pronounced fear, there is a camp called Hope, and the Americans who
are building the camp hope thousands of Kosovo refugees will come
to safety here until they can return to their homeland. But so far,
the refugees' fear of coming this far south seems to be winning out
over hope. By Anthony DePalma.

FACES ON TV GET YOUNGER AND COMEDY IS NOT KING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The main impressions from the unveiling of new shows for the
fall television season: The new shows in September will be filled
with teen-agers, sex, gay characters and glamorous white people;
they will not be filled with comedy, adults over 40, rural
characters and African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Shows about teen-agers and model-quality folk under age 25
dominated the 38 new series as the smoke cleared from a week of
program presentations. The smoke was being blown by a succession of
network executives selling the notion that they were faring
brilliantly, despite ratings evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Because advertisers pay more for younger viewers, most networks
(except CBS) have built shows around young characters for years.
But the target age is moving lower, edging nearer to the level of
those not yet eating solid food.
</P>
<P>
   Shows are also moving away from one of the most firmly
established genres in the history of the medium, the sitcom. The
half-hour comedy, if not in retreat, is losing ground. Only 14 of
the new shows are sitcoms, an unusually low number. Most seasons,
there are as many comedies as dramas, and in some recent seasons
there have been more comedies than dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new shows are hourlong comedies: ``Get Real,'' about
the tribulations of a contemporary family on Fox; ``Popular,''
about the forced union by their parents' marriage of a girl from
the in crowd with a girl from the out crowd, and two NBC entries,
``Freaks and Geeks,'' about more out-crowd woes, and ``Cold Feet,''
about the interaction of three couples.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly a reaction to the success of ``Ally McBeal,'' the
hit hourlong comedy on Fox. Paradoxically, the creator of that
series, David E. Kelley, decided to remix it into half-hour
segments for a new series called ``Ally,'' on Fox this coming
season. Kelley wants to improve his series' chances of selling as a
half-hour show in syndication, where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   The move away from the sitcom is most noticeable at NBC. Only a
few seasons ago NBC emphasized its ``must-see'' comedies as the
core of its schedule. At a high point there were 18 sitcoms on NBC.
Next season that will drop to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wright, the president of NBC, said: ``The writing talent is
spread so thin. It just seems like the genre has run out of gas for
the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, every network has complained about the
comedy writing talent, with one main charge being that the young
comedy writers favored by studios and networks have little life
experience and no frame of reference beyond other television shows.
Those limitations may be reflected in the crop of three new
comedies at ABC, for example, which deal virtually exclusively with
relationships, dating and sex.
</P>
<P>
   One agent who represents some of television's biggest comedy
clients said another problem affecting the amount of comedies was
the movement by producers to push their comedies as far toward the
edge of subject matter and taste as possible. Most of these efforts
were judged either too wild or too unfunny. One show that pushed
limits and won is ``Action,'' a new Fox comedy as aggressively
outrageous as any recent show. ``Action'' is about a driven
Hollywood film producer who uses language never tried on network
television before (and always bleeped here, though it is clear what
the character is saying). The show also depends heavily on
anatomical jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Anatomy plays a role in many new entries, even on staid CBS.
This is true of some of the teen-age shows. One, ``Manchester
Prep'' on Fox, has a scene of a stepsister eyeing her stepbrother
after he emerges from the shower.
</P>
<P>
   But teen-agers will be everywhere doing everything next season.
As networks are more befuddled than ever about the future and
emphasize more than ever the need to create new hit shows, one main
trend is discernible: a mania to imitate a network whose audience
is among the smallest, the soon-to-be-six-night network, WB.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the success of several of WB's youth-oriented shows,
especially ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Felicity,'' with success
defined almost solely by the network's ability to attract female
viewers ages 12 to 25, television will be filled next fall with
shows set in high schools and prep schools or among twentysomething
singles looking for love in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Every network but CBS and UPN has one or another of this type of
show, and many have both. CBS does not, mainly because it seems to
be as aggressively running away from young viewers as the other
networks are chasing them. CBS continues to be the only network
featuring unglamorous actors, grandparents and assertively nonhip
story lines.
</P>
<P>
   UPN does not because, as it struggles to find some niche for
survival, it has changed direction yet again and is now seeking
what might be called the un-``Dawson'' audience: young males moved
by wrestling, not nestling. UPN will have two hours of wrestling
every Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   That is evidence of one clear trend of the new season: for the
first time in years competitors are going after the network leader,
NBC, on its stronghold night, Thursday. The competition detects
vulnerability in NBC on that night, especially with younger viewers
and male viewers. That is why Fox, which hopes to mount a serious
challenge to NBC for overall network leadership, has reconstructed
its Thursday night around its hit animated show, ``Family Guy,''
teamed up with ``Action.'' ABC wants to out-WB the WB with
``Wasteland,'' one of the new shows about dating in Manhattan. Even
CBS sees an opportunity and has moved its revamped ``Chicago Hope''
(again to be written by the ubiquitous Kelley) there.
</P>
<P>
   WB, meanwhile, sees a chance to go in a direction NBC seems to
have no interest in _ toward black viewers. This is not a statement
of principle by that network. WB has essentially ghettoized its
lineup of black comedies on a single night for several years. Now
it will be Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from UPN, which has two new shows aimed at black
audiences, and CBS, which in midseason will have a Steven Bochco
show about black doctors, no other network seems much interested in
blacks as viewers or cast members.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has an ambitious drama set in the White House, ``The West
Wing,'' and there are no African-Americans among members of the
president's staff. Fox, once a network with a large black audience
base, does not have a single significant black cast member in any
of its eight new series for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It does have a regular gay character in ``Action,'' a studio
executive who surrounds himself with gay studs. Other gay
characters are less outrageous. One on ``Wasteland'' is a gay man
terrified of being ``outed.'' On ABC's comedy ``Oh Grow Up'' a gay
man leaves his wife and moves in with a straight friend, though the
wife is always around to insult him for ``going Nancy'' on her.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the new season has teen-agers. It has
teen-age aliens in the WB show ``Roswell.'' It has a teen-age boy
surrounded by a houseful of females in ABC's ``Odd Man Out.'' It
has four male teen-agers living with their widowed father in ``Safe
Harbor'' on WB. It has mean-spirited teen-agers in ``Manchester
Prep,'' nerdy teen-agers in ``Freaks and Geeks'' and teen-agers who
talk to the camera in ``Get Real'' and ``Malcolm in the Middle'' on
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   What has yet to be determined is whether the new season will
have enough teen-age viewers to go around to prevent it from
driving away even more viewers than the 7 percent who defected from
network television this season.

 &HT;    Home Improvement: Show grew as families did
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Tuesday night, there'll be no place like ``Home.''
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Home Improvement,'' a broad-appeal TV situation comedy
an entire family could watch. Kids could laugh at it, and parents
not only got it, they could trust that they wouldn't be blind-sided
by dirty innuendo snuck in under the guise of being hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' was never really hip; the only edge it ever
cut was lumber with a bandsaw. But it was funny, well-executed, as
dependable as duct tape and wildly popular in ``flyover land,''
that huge stretch of America that TV network execs look down on as
they jet between L.A. and N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It portrayed a loving married couple (strong but with plenty of
stress points) raising good sons (although never easily). It won
People's Choice Awards, but no major Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's 90-minute finale, there will be nothing else on
TV quite like it, which is sad.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's a strong No. 14 in the Nielsen rankings this
season, its eighth, ``Home'' is no longer the powerhouse it once
was for ABC. Back in its third season, it was the No. 1 show in all
television, and at various points, it clobbered both ``Seinfeld''
and ``Frasier'' in head-to-head competition. It's also made $800
million from syndicated reruns, and is expected to hit $1 billion.
That's power.
</P>
<P>
   In January, I had the chance to wander around the ``Home
Improvement'' set in Burbank, and surprised myself by getting a bit
wistful. Standing in the Taylors' adjoining kitchen and family
room, I was taken back to when ``Home'' debuted in 1991, and my
daughter was eight years old, and we'd watch it together. Now's she
16, and into ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   My family's growth paralleled the Taylors', as their three sons
grew from cute little tykes into teenagers, and rather hulking
young lads at that. The show grew, too, from a fairly simple
spinoff of Tim Allen's chest-thumping, pig-grunting stand-up act to
one that dealt with the arcs of family life. (``Home'' was almost
always more real with the family stuff than the ``Tool Time''
segments.)
</P>
<P>
   It was time for ``Home '' to call it a day, but that doesn't
mean one can't miss a show that children and parents could watch
together. These days _ and it's not just my family, it's a wide
swath of demographics _ many families are fragmented, watching
separate TVs in separate rooms. ``Home Improvement'' didn't change,
we did.

 &HT;    Mad About You: Lovable couple never able to wow us
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've rarely been mad about it, but we have liked it quite a
lot. It's been a kind of ``Seinfeld'' for married people. It mined
humor from commitment rather than from ducking commitment _ an
out-of-favor concept in an era when sitcoms began to blur into
doomed herds of city-living single people shuffling between coffee
shops.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mad About You'' would not have worked the last seven
seasons without the remarkable chemistry between Paul Reiser and
Helen Hunt. As the Buchmans, they played out the trivia and trauma
of married life with an almost balletic comic timing. It's not a
stretch to compare them to such memorable TV couples as Lucy and
Desi, Rob and Laura, Burns and Allen. Paul and Jamie really have
been that good, if not quite that emblematic of their times. As
much as they tried _ the lesbian sister, the almost-affair, the
baby _ they never quite pricked the zeitgeist that would have made
them all the talk in offices the next day. It was as if this was a
show that would be a smash in any era _ except its own.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes tonight's hour-long finale a disappointment.
Rather than be itself, it yearns to be something else _ hipper,
darker, profounder ... memorabler.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo narrates the time-shifting episode as the
Buchman's all-grown-up daughter Mabel. She's a loving mess: engaged
four times to three men, still unmarried, she's upped her therapy
to three times a week. She blames her parents.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are a series of remembered scenes _ some in the
present, some in the near future, some way, way ahead _ that rarely
celebrate Paul and Jamie, or even just make light of them. Instead,
tonight's finale, despite a few classic moments, manages to make us
like Paul and Jamie less.
</P>
<P>
   A tragic drama beats in the heart of every sitcom. Too bad this
one didn't keep it to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

 &HT;    Melrose Place: When it was bad, it was sooo good
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Eileen Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, Monday nights at 8 meant ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cozy Los Angeles apartment complex with a pool, you got to
watch beautiful people do so many interesting things. Like scheme
and lust, plot and seduce in the kind of clothes you only dreamed
of walking around in. Blonde, brunette or redhead; male, female or
undecided, they married and divorced, lied and cheated,
double-crossed and triple-crossed and punched, burned, cut, crashed
and exploded their way right into our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a cross between an older ``90210'' and an L.A.
``thirtysomething'' soon became a much kinkier cousin of neither,
with a distinctive soapy hysteria all its own. But it did spin
around the same kind of self-contained cast (who never befriended
others, unless it turned out to be next week's Villain, who'd
kiss-and-tell for a couple episodes then disappear) who battled
Recurring Problems in their own fabulous way. A hipper Peyton Place
where women with names like Amanda, Sydney, Kimberly and Taylor
wore the tightest clothes, lowest necklines, shortest skirts and
the men wore ... who cares?
</P>
<P>
   No one did a stitch of work, even while they were at work _
considering the size of L.A., a tiny world made up of cutthroat D&AMP;D
Advertising, neighborhood bar Shooter's and Wilshire Memorial
Hospital. No, the action was all in what they said, and didn't say.
How they misunderstood, lied, seduced, betrayed and made up in the
most delicious ways.
</P>
<P>
   Sample classic dialogue: ``Listen to me you zipper-headed
mutant. You tried to kill me twice _ then you blew up an entire
building because your imaginary playmate told you that naughty
people lived there.''
</P>
<P>
   The action was all walking into and out of rooms and beds and
cars and kisses. Walking down the aisle then getting hit by a car
outside the church. Hearing voices in the mirror that tell you to
kill them all. Going through more careers (secretary, stripper,
madam, designer) in a season than most of us do in a lifetime.
Thinking vodka could help the pain only to find it sent you on
rip-snorting dish-crashing rampages. Rigging promotions by digging
up dirt on your bosses _ and getting away with it.
</P>
<P>
   In Melrose's heyday, roughly 1993-1995, Heather Locklear and
company made inspired TV not just by going over the top. They
out-soaped all the competition with a psychotic beauty that was the
guiltiest of guilty pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping tonight's series finale, titled ``Asses to
Ashes,'' does them proud.

 &HT;    Big finales: Well-loved series given last hurrahs
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most TV series just drift away into the atmosphere. Somewhere,
their signals headed away from Earth and our consciousness, are
``L.A. Doctors'' and ``Brimstone'' and so many forgettable others,
canceled without so much as a burp of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Others get the big send-off, out of longevity, network loyalty,
star clout. And the biggest of these attain a combination of hype
and viewer interest that surpasses Super Bowls _ the finales of
``MASH,'' ``Mary Tyler Moore,'' ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing this season can match those farewells, but three
long-running series over the next two days take their final bows
with splashy goodbyes: ``Mad About You'' (9 tonight on NBC
(43786)), ``Melrose Place'' (8 tonight on Fox (77704)) and ``Home
Improvement'' (8 p.m. Tuesday on ABC (47800)).
</P>
<P>
   All three series are well past their prime as hits, yet each
was, in its day and in its way, quite a favorite. ``Home
Improvement'' was once No. 1, a family-friendly show that parents
could trust. ``Mad About You'' got bounced around the schedule but
people kept watching. ``Melrose Place,'' after Heather Locklear
joined the cast and it turned from earnest Yuppie drama into
unabashed soap, had fans gathered in bars on Monday nights to watch
and hoot.
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only series getting a network-noted exit this
month. ``The Nanny'' got all misty-water-colored-memoried two weeks
ago; NBC let ``Homicide'' have a sense of closure on Friday, and
two WB series, ``Unhappily Ever After'' and ``Sister, Sister,'' had
finale episodes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The series finale dates to 1967 and ``The Fugitive,'' when
Richard Kimball finally caught that one-armed man. Over the years,
we've seen finales in which ``St. Elsewhere'' was turned upside
down as merely the long-running fantasy of an autistic child, and
``Newhart'' was exposed as just a dream dreamed by Bob Newhart on
his previous series.
</P>
<P>
   Not every series can, or should, have a finale with that level
of twistedness. In the brutal, get-the-hook world of network TV,
just getting a finale is accomplishment enough.

   KOSOVO PACKAGE:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ Developments. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DOCTOR (Jazince, Macedonia) _ There are moments when the
pure exhilaration of being here leads Dr. Jennifer Walser to wish
she did not have to return to New York. But there are also moments
when her efforts to alleviate are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the
tragedy unfolding before her. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The mood in the city. It is
weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism. The
citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week, feel
they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame at
what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the
obvious. By Stephen Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Fier, Albania) _ In a place called Fier,
pronounced fear, there is a camp called Hope, and the Americans who
are building the camp hope thousands of Kosovo refugees will come
to safety here until they can return to their homeland. But so far,
the refugees' fear of coming this far south seems to be winning out
over hope. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace) _ More refugees cross the border from
Kosovo, in the biggest surge in weeks. By David Rohde.
</P>

   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE (Newnan, Ga.) _ The members of the Coweta County
Board of Education are not naive enough to think that they
vanquished school violence two weeks ago when they voted to
prohibit students from carrying bookbags unless the bags are
transparent or made of mesh. But at least it is something, they
say. And their attitude is not unique: In the month since the
shootings at Columbine High School, school boards, county
commissions and state legislatures all across the country have
proposed and enacted a broad series of measures aimed at attacking
the youth violence problem at the margins. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Undated) _ After decades of flops, $100 billion
in costs and sharp rises in the political stakes, the Pentagon is
trying again to build a system that can defend America against
missile attack. By William Broad.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-SPEECH (Grambling, La.) _ In a commencement address,
Clinton says the Labor Department will review requests from four
states to allow them to spend some unemployment compensation
surpluses on family leave for new parents. By John M. Broder.

<P>
   GUNSHOW-REACT (Fresno, Calif.) _ Talking to gun enthusiasts at a
gun show about the new legislation coming out of Washington. By
Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   EMBRYO-RESEARCH (Undated) _ A presidentially-appointed ethics
panel has decided to recommend that the federal government begin
paying for some research on human embryos. A draft report of the
decision to be announced next month concludes that the moral cost
of destroying embryos in research is outweighed by the social good
that could come from the studies. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   (Coded w)
</P>
<P>
   APPEALS-COURT (Washington) _ The Federal Appeals Court based in
Richmond, Va. has, in the view of scholars, lawyers and many of its
own members, quietly but steadily become the boldest conservative
court in the nation, setting remarkable new precedents and adopting
a striking tone on several issues. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   SENIORS-POLITICS (Washington) _ Once reliably Democratic in
congressional races, older Americans have become a critical swing
vote, the object of intense competition on Capitol Hill. Democrats
lost the 60-and-over vote by a 60-40 margin last November, while
breaking even or carrying every other age group. Democrats also
lost that vote in 1996 and 1994. Explanations abound for this
fundamental shift, and what the competition for the vote has meant
on Capitol Hill. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   COX-PROFILE (Washington) _ He is something of a closet
Renaissance man in the House, one who speaks Russian, savors Ayn
Rand and seeks out the latest translation of Omar Khayyam. For a
hobby, he reads book after book on mathematicians. And so Rep.
Christopher Cox may seem the perfect prospect for presiding over
the House's ultra-secret investigation of suspected espionage by
China. By Francis X. Clines.

PEOPLE OF BELGRADE FEELING WEARY, BUT RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The daily rock concerts in downtown
Belgrade continue, because officials said they would until the
bombing stops, but the audiences have dwindled from 10,000 to a few
hundred.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily promoted night-time rallies on Belgrade's bridges,
sponsored by the political party of Mirjana Markovic, the wife of
President Slobodan Milosevic, no longer take place.
</P>
<P>
   The venomous language on Serbian state television and radio,
aimed at NATO and its leaders, is much reduced, and for the last
week or so, television has even stopped claiming that NATO planes
are being shot down regularly, as if they were ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Parents wait anxiously for the war to end and their sons to
return from the front; the civilian casualties and material
destruction of infrastructure and industry steadily mount;
strangers ask a foreigner ``when will all this end,'' as if anyone
really knows; Serbian jokes, if anything, are becoming darker.
</P>
<P>
   But it is weariness that hangs heavily in the air, not
defeatism. The people of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen last
week, feel they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express
shame at what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians;
most express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   They smell a political settlement that will bring foreign troops
into Kosovo, and they don't know why it's taking so long to write
down the obvious. They say they fear that people are now dying for
the reputation of politicians on both sides, and that NATO will
somehow double the stakes as it continues to bomb Serbia's
hospitals, bridges and power stations.
</P>
<P>
   They feel they have no more control over Milosevic than they do
over President Clinton or British Prime Minister Tony Blair. And
while they want peace, they also fear the aftermath of this war:
the destroyed country, the joblessness, the sharp potential for
internal political strife or even a form of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Dejan Cukic, a famous rock star here who played Friday's
concert, as he had played in the very first rock rally two months
ago, when the bombing started, says that people are simply
exhausted, and ``in a way, we've made a kind of peace with the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   It's gone on longer than anyone expected, he said, and ``now
we're stuck, on both sides, and it's irrational and it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cukic, 39, said he couldn't believe that the West believed in
its aims, which he defined as helping the Albanians of Kosovo and
bringing down the Milosevic government.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone who has spent more than five days in Serbia, and
wasn't drunk all the time _ which is hard, but spies should be
sober for at least half-an-hour a day _ it should have been obvious
that the bombing would set off a humanitarian catastrophe and
empower this government, maybe forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people here believe the violence in Kosovo started with
the Kosovo Liberation Army that killed Serbs to get independence,
and that the state is right to defeat them.'' And even if one hates
the leader of the state, he said, ``first comes the war _ we'll
vote later.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO missiles have largely been so precise that many Serbs no
longer believe that NATO ever bombs in error, even if the damage is
to the Chinese Embassy or a hospital. ``Psychological warfare,''
said a doctor named Zivko, demands attacks on hospitals, trains and
buses ``to demoralize the people.'' He said fervently: ``I don't
think NATO ever makes a mistake.'' If NATO truly wanted to change
this regime, he said, ``they should hit the person of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, as among lab animals, a kind of rapid adaptation to
the war. Belgrade is bombed in fits and starts, which Serbs are
convinced are timed to any improvement in the prospects for peace.
Belgrade was badly bombed the night the Rev. Jesse Jackson arrived,
and it is badly bombed whenever the Russian envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, comes here, noted a neurologist, Dr. Dejan Sumrak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either NATO doesn't want peace,'' he said, ``or it bombs from
frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade lost its electricity again on Saturday and Sunday, to a
series of NATO attacks on power stations. But even this kind of
powerlessness has lost its novelty and is only serving to get
residents angry at NATO, not at Milosevic, who has been signaling
his readiness for a peace settlement for more than a week now. No
one thinks that attacks on electricity supplies are militarily
justifiable, but simply an effort to demoralize civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost better to have no electricity or water, because it
makes you realize that it's a war,'' said Ljiljana Smajlovic, a
Serb journalist. ``It's almost worse if it's a quiet night, if you
wait up and there's no bombing, if everything seems normal, because
you know something horrible is happening elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Velimir Curgus-Kazimir, a communications specialist, says the
tension keeps him from reading or concentrating. ``The most
important thing is to organize yourself in some small, practical
things. Today, I'll stock up on water, and tomorrow, some batteries
and vitamins. Practical things become most important, and it makes
you feel competent, like you can win over these difficulties and
control your life. If there's electricity and hot water, take a
bath.''
</P>
<P>
   A man whose son is serving in the army in Kosovo is nervous
about his fate. But he is also proud that his son's unit, based
near the Albanian border, is avoiding the fierce NATO bombing and
is keeping up morale. ``A good trench will defeat a cluster bomb
unless it lands inside,'' he says knowingly, then adds: ``At least
that's what the boys say.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of no news at all from his son, which had him
frantic, another soldier from his son's anti-aircraft unit of 100
visited last week, bringing cheerful messages. ``Of course, my son
tells me that everything is less dramatic and dangerous on the
ground than it seems from the outside, and I tell him that
everything here is normal,'' said the man, who asked that neither
his name nor that of his son be printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I am proudest of is that he's mentally fine. He
doesn't pretend to be a hero and he hasn't ruined himself. I
recognize his spirit, that he is the same man in absolutely
disastrous conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The father described his son's horror at seeing a column of
ethnic Albanians being marched around Kosovo under the control of
the police. ``He described the cries and tears of Albanian children
who were on the road, and he said we gave them all we had, all our
food, but he said we couldn't do anything about it,'' the father
said. ``He said that it was terrible, that we are soldiers and
should be fighting against soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The father obviously wants to believe the best of his son, but
there was no reason to doubt the account. ``The regular army has
behaved well,'' he said. ``But they will be happy just to come back
home. And when they do they will tell stories of what they have
seen, and the truth will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers, like most people, ``psychologically can't
think about the end of the war,'' he said. ``We have to live as if
it will go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't true of everyone, of course, especially the young and
educated, many of whom are not discussing political change, but
emigration from a broken, post-war Yugoslavia still ruled by
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra, a vivacious office worker in her 30s, with striking
short platinum-dyed hair, goes dancing every weekend, in a round of
apartments turned into informal nightclubs. But when this war is
over, she says, she wants to go, before her whole life is wasted
and the country degenerates into civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived with this for 10 years, and we're so sick of it,''
she said. ``He's ruined our lives, the best years of our lives. We
just can't take it any more. We all thought it would get better,
but it just gets worse.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all the endless, circular discussions with people here,
there are a few jokes that capture this mood of helplessness, irony
and pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   One has the American F-16 pilot, shot down, unable to find the
right cord for his parachute. He sees another person flying through
the air and shouts: ``Which one do I pull?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the Serb shouts. ``I'm from the refinery.''
</P>
<P>
   Another joke asks: ``Why will Bill Clinton become the next
President of Yugoslavia?'' The answer: ``He's succeeded in uniting
the Serbs and destroying the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Another has a young boy discovering from his father that the
United States has fought both Germany and Japan, and won, and yet
the Germans and the Japanese live wonderfully. ``Are we an unlucky
country?'' the boy asks. ``Why?'' his father wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, a sign at a rally, says: ``Don't worry, Serbs. Billy
never finishes anything _ Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Another centers on the acronym for Milosevic's party, the SPS,
and Mrs. Markovic's party, known as JUL, which is also the word for
July.
</P>
<P>
   When will this war finally end? ``At the end of JUL,'' the
answer goes, ``and the SPS.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who told it laughed uproariously, then said: ``It's a
better joke than a prediction.''

(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Feb. 28, 2000, at the start of Kurt Andersen's huge and
entertaining first novel, ``Turn of the Century.'' New York City
buses are now shaped like Absolut vodka bottles. The Yankees play
in Pepsi/Taco Bell Yankee Stadium. Big Japanese collectors in
Scarsdale will pay at least $1,600 for a mint first-edition pair of
Nike Air Jordans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Webzine Slate has become ``a same-day-delivery
home-office-site and selective-admission chat room'' because
Microsoft finally understands that it has ``no business in media.''
Brill's Content will shortly publish its final issue, featuring a
31-page ``pundits' round-table critique of pundit-on-pundit
punditry.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mactier is a hotshot television executive who earns
$16,575 a week and is about to produce a revolutionary new show for
the Mose Broadcasting Company, whose leader, the billionaire Harold
Mose, insists on calling it the MBC, like the BBC or the CBC.
(Office clowns call its headquarters ``the The MBC Building.'')
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie Zimbalist, George's wife, owns a software company called
Fine Technologies that Microsoft seems interested in buying for
many millions. Fine Technologies makes video games and a year 2000
problem solver called Y2KRx, which Lizzie pronounces
``YAKety-rex.'' George and Lizzie have three children: Sarah, from
Lizzie's first marriage, whose darker complexion sometimes causes
her to be mistaken for the family au pair; Max, who has changed his
name to Sir after seeing some old World War II movie (which suits
Lizzie since their naming him Max was ``too trendy too late in the
wave''), and LuLu, who is cheerfully obsessed with death.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to Lizzie and George in the long novel to
follow? Not all that much. Lizzie will keep turning down
Microsoft's advances and sell her company to the MBC, where she
will become president of Mose Media Holdings, Digital. George will
produce his revolutionary television show, ``Real Time,'' a
fictional drama about newscasters who announce actual news, only to
have it bomb and be killed by the higher-ups at the MBC. Since
Lizzie has become one of those higher-ups, whom George already
suspects of a romantic involvement with Mose, the death of ``Real
Time'' leads to a serious rift in their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and each loses a parent, George when his mother slows her
car for a weasel and gets rammed by a giant semi; Lizzie when her
father's pig-liver transplant turns out not to have happened
because he was part of ``a new placebo protocol, placebo surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then does it take 659 typographically packed pages to
describe all this? Because no character in the story can have a
thought, say a word, take a step, open a door, go through the mail,
dial a phone, eat a meal, view a cityscape or breathe without
inspiring the narrator to elaborate. It's a little as if Leopold
and Molly Bloom had been slimmed down, hyped up, tuned in and given
a year instead of a day to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most of the digressions are informative, wickedly
satirical or outrageously funny and often all at once. George has
drinks with Zip Ingram, an old pal from his reporting days, and
learns that Ingram has been on a ``meat gig'' for the National Lamb
Board, trying to think up ``a new name for lamb that isn't so
beastly, that doesn't remind Americans they're eating a cute
animal.'' Two pages follow on the lamb nomenclature problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie has dinner in Seattle with a scientist who says he has
succeeded in establishing direct communication between cats' brains
by means of computer chips. Two and a half pages are devoted to
satirizing the pretentiousness of provincial cuisine. (``Would you
like to settle into your table now? Or would you prefer to relax at
the bar du vin with a complimentary glass? We have some very
surprising Idaho Rieslings.'')
</P>

   Almost anything sets the narrator off. ``George likes
international music because he can't understand it, neither the
words nor the music,'' one passage goes. ``It's the same reason
American graphic designers love Japanese magazines. It's why
strangers speaking foreign languages look more attractive and
interesting than they would if they were speaking English _ we hear
their voices without judgment, snobberies deactivated, oblivious to
nuances of class and education and geography. Conversely, it's why
fashion models become less beautiful the moment they speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, an editor, reporter and critic who now writes a column
for The New Yorker, is endlessly energetic (and occasionally
exhausting) and seems to know just about everything (except that
Lady Macbeth's husband isn't Duncan). It would probably take at
least two readings to catch all the book's jokes and
cross-references.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as several characters say, the ratio of noise to signal
is high. Maybe that's precisely the point that the relation of the
commentary to the plot is making: that for all the noise that the
communications revolution at the turn of the century is making,
what still truly matters is the fundamental _ love, death, jealousy
and trust. If this conclusion is a cliche, why then, ACAT, meaning
All Cliches Are True, as Lizzie and George keep reminding each
other. To reach this conclusion Andersen has written the most
uncliched novel imaginable. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jonathan Bines &LR;  and  &UR; Gary Greenberg &LR; 's new ``Self Helpless''
(Career; $12.95) describes a range of non- &LR; existent self-help books
that includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Book of Rhetorical Questions,'' endorsed by the author
of ``The Pope Is Catholic; Answers to Rhetorical Questions.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``The Stella Stein Prophesy,'' in which Mrs. Stein predicts
what may happen to you, for example, if you don't have a good
reading light or don't sit far enough away from the TV.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Attention Deficit Disorder: Help is.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``Reviving Ophelia; the Royal Shakespeare Company's Emergency
Preparedness Handbook,'' which tells what to do, for example, when
``the wind machine blows  &UR; King Lear &LR;  into the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WORD'S THE THING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - There's a problem with the location of that huge ``Re-Elect
Mayor  &UR; Willie Brown &LR; '' sign on the plumbers' union headquarters on
Market Street, notes  &UR; Paul Spiegel &LR; . The building is at the foot of
Franklin, visible all the way up the street. But traffic on
Franklin is one-way north, so the sign is visible mainly in
rear-view mirrors, and so it appears backward. Too bad the building
isn't at the bottom of Gough Street, suggests Spiegel, ``where
drivers in traffic on the way to the freeway and Market Street
could take a long and thoughtful look.''
</P>
<P>
   - That San Francisco bus shelter ad picturing a urine specimen
bottle with the simple words, ``Your boyfriend. 43 seconds. Taking
the STD test even quicker,'' wasis &LR;  posted by St. James Infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Barbara Fritz &LR;  is impressed at the Martin Windows' catalog
quoting the classics _ ``They can do all because they think they
can'' _ but thinks the company's erudition ought to extend to the
spelling of the author's name, which ain't Vergil.
</P>
<P>
   - A fine year for squash in Chico:  &UR; Morgan Omaha &LR; , 5, inspected
his family's vegetable patch and ran inside exclaiming ``There's an
enormous Lamborghini in the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Sharon Stone &LR;  has turned over to Beverly Hills police one
shotgun and three handguns she said she kept for protection. She
issued a statement saying she'd been motivated by the Littleton
shootings, &LR;  to do her part to ``change our world into a safer, more
loving, more thoughtful environment for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Kate Moss &LR; , recently out of rehab, is reported to have fallen
off the wagon at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   - Two thousand members of the American Psychiatric Association,
convening at Constitution Hall in Washington last week, were heard
singing, ``Getting to Know You,'' ``The Impossible Dream'' and ``I
Gotta Be Me.'' A San Diego psychiatrist who arranged the sing-along
told the Washington Post that his colleagues ``really need music to
come together.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Reese Ehrlich &LR; , just back from Caracas, Venezuela, reports
wistfully that public transportation there, clean and efficient,
costs the equivalent of 40 cents a ride.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Edwin Heaven &LR;  sends advance word that Starship, nee Jefferson
Airplane nee the band that once commanded motherandsoforth to
``tear down the walls,'' will appear on ``The Donnie and Marie
Show'' on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   - National Accordion Awareness Month being June,  &UR; Tom Torriglia &LR; 
certifies that the instrument ``has just been certified as being
Y2K compliant. ... Can you say that with absolute certainty about
any other musical instrument?''
</P>
<P>
   - New York writer  &UR; David Margolick &LR; , who's doing a book on
 &UR; Billie Holiday  &LR; and the political implications of ``Strange
Fruit,'' says she sang it often in repeated club gigs in San
Francisco in the '40s and '50s. ``Strange Fruit'' was written by
 &UR; Abel Mirapol, &LR;  a left-wing schoolteacher who is the adoptive father
of the sons of  &UR; Ethel &LR;  and  &UR; Julius Rosenberg &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Margolick wants to interview people who heard her perform the
song live, or were influenced by her recording of it. He's at 315
West 86 Street, No. 14F, New York, N.Y. 10024; or at
damarg &LR; aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Debbie Reynolds was indeed the girl next door, if you lived
next door to a self-centered, totally driven, insecure, untruthful
phony.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Eddie Fisher  &LR; in his forthcoming memoir, ``Been There, Done

 &HT;    As prices drop, once-fancy gadgets become the norm
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was thinking about pocket calculators the other day. I
remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a
Hewlett-Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could
add, multiply and divide, as well as do all sorts of math problems
that would have made my high school trig teacher proud.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo
small enough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you
can find more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those
little shrink-wrap packages as you stand in the grocery store
checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how prices drop
so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _ microwave oven,
VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough, you'll be
struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is now. While
prices for cars, houses and T-shirts have zoomed up over the years,
gadget prices invariably have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening now with PCs. Sure, I know it's been
going on for a while, but, I promise, you haven't seen anything
yet. As the technology is refined, as the size of the market grows,
and as manufacturing costs drop, PC prices will follow the same
script as my pocket calculator. Someday soon, PCs will be so cheap
that even people like me with ordinary incomes won't think twice
about buying a new one on a whim.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, AMD _ a big competitor to Intel in the
microprocessor market (those are the chips that are the brains
behind a computer) _ announced price cuts of up to 45 percent. AMD
had to do it because it is the sort of company that stakes its
fortune on selling chips for less than Intel. And Intel has dropped
prices itself, as well as doing a great marketing job with its
excellent but lower-priced Celeron chip.
</P>
<P>
   The price drops alone are a big deal and worth marveling about.
But I think the real impact of all this is going to be the way it
changes how we use computers. When the world changes, it seldom is
because of just one event. It's usually a combination of related
events. And as prices for PCs have dropped, using the Internet has
become easy and affordable, too. Most of us have Internet
connections at work and at home, and, without really thinking about
it, we've shifted a lot of our ordinary lives (ordering books,
chatting with friends, checking the weather) to the Net and to PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who know me as a techno-dinosaur, a man afraid of
some of the ways the Internet and computers have muscled in on our
lives, may be surprised by what I think about this coming change.
</P>
<P>
   I think that, as computers and the Internet become as ordinary
as clock radios and the morning news on TV, we may finally put it
all in perspective. Up to now, we have treated the cyber-world as a
magical place with different rules. Just as earlier social critics
worried television and radio would tear apart the fabric of
society, we've had the same worries _ me especially _ about this
new cyber-world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying, by the way, that the worries were foolish.
Remember how Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast created
panic? When the public puts magical belief in a medium, the power
of it becomes real. It has been the same with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But I believe that as technology becomes a routine part of life
_ as radio did _ we may begin to treat cyberspace and the Internet
as we treat television and radio. The message will become the
important thing, not the medium that carries the message. The magic
will go away, but the power will stay.
</P>
<P>
   So while the good news is that prices are dropping, I think the
even better news is that computers and the Internet are poised to
become just another excellent way of dealing with information.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ As NATO enters its third month of air

to shore up its positions near the border with Albania, NATO
officials said Sunday. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The mood in the city. It is
weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism. The
citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week, feel
they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame at
what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the

Board of Education are not naive enough to think that they
vanquished school violence two weeks ago when they voted to
prohibit students from carrying bookbags unless the bags are

say. And their attitude is not unique: In the month since the

LATIN MUSICIANS DISCOVER NEW WORLD'S TO CONQUER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricky Martin, Ricky Martin, Ricky Martin. The name has become
some sort of Gertrude Stein exercise since Martin put a match to
the tinder of the pop-music world with his performance at the
Grammy Awards in February. He has not dropped out of sight since,
riding his hit ``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' He has become a symbol on
two sexy feet of Latin culture's new mainstream status in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's Latino credentials are in order: he is originally from
Puerto Rico and had a stint in the Spanish-language teeny-bop
supergroup Menudo. But his album ``Ricky Martin,'' which hit the
No. 1 spot on Billboard's pop chart in its first week, is in
English and features Madonna. Martin is a U.S. citizen, speaks
English, acted in the soap opera ``General Hospital'' and dyes his
hair blond.
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to see in his success the mainstream
rushing to embrace Latin culture, Martin, who has been a Latin and
international idol for at least five years, became acceptable to
the English-speaking audience only recently, when he recorded in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, Martin is talented,
photogenic and bilingual; they have all decided to sing in English.
But to understand the inroads that Latin music is making in the
United States, one also must listen to Elvis Crespo sing in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic, black-haired Crespo released his second album,
``Pintame,'' last week; it hit the Billboard pop charts at No. 49.
``Pintame'' is in Spanish. It has no guests from the
English-speaking world. It uses no deracinated international pop
styles, as do the majority of the Spanish-speaking pop stars, from
Julio Iglesias to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Crespo's album was not created to infiltrate the
English-speaking market, though a few concessions have been made
and it will surely cross over. Most important, it is hard,
danceable tropical music. It is unapologetic merengue, a form from
the Dominican Republic that in the hands of Crespo is becoming one
of the biggest international dance styles since the mambo traveled
around the world from Havana in the mid-1950's.
</P>
<P>
   That English speakers are buying the album tells an important
story, especially to English speakers who are only now becoming
aware of the extraordinary amount of talent and variety that Latin
music offers. But it is hardly the only story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to say it, really, but in some senses we don't
need the English-speaking market,'' said Oscar Llord, the president
of Crespo's label, Sony Discos, the Latin branch of Columbia
Records. ``Remember, we've sold half a million copies of Elvis'
first album, `Suavemente,' in Europe, and we still haven't really
started the campaign there on his behalf. The European market is
humongous, enormous, as is the Latin-speaking market here and in
Latin America. Really, when you speak about the Latin market now,
you're talking universally.''
</P>
<P>
   The album ``Suavemente'' rode a hit of the same name, using the
tough, repetitious rhythms of merengue. Crespo, like Martin, grew
up in Puerto Rico; he was born in New York and traveled between the
two.
</P>
<P>
   He started professionally as an older teen-ager, singing chorus
in famous merengue bands in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic,
including Tono Rosario's band and Grupo Mania, whose bigger hits
featured Crespo as a lead singer. A year and a half ago he started
on his own. He had no idea what was going to happen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed so much for Latin artists in the last two
years,'' said Crespo, who was in New York to perform at a concert
put on by an English-language radio station. ``When I started out,
Latin music, regional music, wasn't part of America. We were off to
the side. But look at the success that so many Latinos have had,
even if they're working in English, whether it be Ricky or Jennifer
Lopez. They've all helped open the door. If I had started my career
two years earlier, I wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Crespo, who is taking English lessons to polish up a language he
had been forgetting, is right, for several reasons. One important
reason is that Sound-scan, a service that counts album sales, has
over the last several years begun to move into Latin record stores,
especially in Puerto Rico, to report on sales there. Two years ago,
before that effort began, Crespo's ``Pintame'' would not have
registered as highly on the Billboard charts as it has, even if the
sales had been the same. Soundscan was literally blind to Latin
sales.
</P>
<P>
   A result of increased accuracy on the part of Soundscan has been
that the Latin sections of record stores are expanding across the
country, and chains that never had a Latin section are now carrying
Spanish- language albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``As record stores see the increased Soundscan numbers, they
respond by expanding the sections,'' Llord said. ``When you expand
a section, you sell more.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps English-speaking fans are changing their tastes a bit,
venturing out of linguistic limitations and into a broader vision
of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids go for beats first,'' Llord said. ``Then they think about
language, and what Elvis is offering is some of the best beats
around. It's music that makes you feel good, regardless of the
language.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason of all is simple: the demographic. The
Latin population of the United States now numbers some 30 million
(most under age 30), and the Census Bureau expects it to overtake
the country's black population in a few years. The No. 1 FM radio
stations in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are Spanish-language
stations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Latin population is not one monolithic entity, and the
Latin music world is split into different markets, including
Mexican pop, Mexican regional, salsa, merengue, cumbia from
Colombia, rock in Spanish and more. The reason for the success of
the biggest Latin pop singers is that they usually resort to a
bland international pop style to bridge the various communities. A
Mexican usually listens to Mexican music, a Cuban to Cuban music.
When all the different Spanish-speaking populations come together
to buy one type of music, all the movement creates a hit.
</P>
<P>
   In Crespo's case he tapped into a type of music that has become
the international dance style of choice, without losing its
regional wrinkles. Merengue is heard at poolside in Havana and at
clubs in New York. It is heard in Paris and all over the rest of
Europe. At the Copacabana in New York, a Honduran woman will dance
merengue with a Puerto Rican man; Dominicans dance it, and Mexicans
and so do French tourists. It is easy to dance to, and fun, and
every tourist who has spent time in the Caribbean has heard it.
</P>
<P>
   Crespo, 27, sold somewhere between 30,000 and 90,000 copies of
``Pintame'' two weeks ago. ``Pintame'' may have reached the highest
chart position for regional records to date, and its success is far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Pintame' is selling much faster than `Suavemente' did,''
Llord said. ``We've already sold 1.5 million copies of
`Suavemente,' and the record isn't finished yet.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But Crespo made some concessions. Merengue is close to being the
fastest music man has ever played. He slowed it down, put some
groove back into it and plied the songs with obvious melodies. He
accentuated the bass, making it closer in depth and volume to
hip-hop. Then there were the remixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar Llord wanted me to do a Spanglish remix of
`Suavemente,''' Crespo said. ``So I did it. It came out in the
movie `Dance With Me,' and then all of a sudden it became an
English pop hit. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Llord said: ``Merengue is great because everybody understands
it. It's great for remixes because it has a solid, four-four beat;
it's not complicated. You can play remixes of it on English pop
stations here, and in clubs in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a Spanglish version because that's the way kids
are today. I have two teen-age daughters, and that's the way they
speak. Our parents were ashamed of being immigrants, but our kids
aren't. They aren't afraid to say, `I love Ricky Martin, and I also
love Tom Cruise.'''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Crespo is being courted by the English-language media,
even if he is singing, at best, in Spanglish _ the Spanglish
version of the song ``Pintame'' comes out in a week _ and has not
dyed his hair blond, though an English-language album is probably
inevitable. He performed on ``Late Night With David Letterman''
several weeks ago; other shows are lining up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a tropical artist, and so I started doing research on
Latin music,'' said Sheila Rogers, a music producer for the
Letterman show. ``People had seen him at the Billboard Latin award,
and said he blew everybody away, and so we booked him and at the
show people were dancing in the aisles, which doesn't happen very
much. So the response was fantastic, and we plan to do it more. I
want to get Marc Anthony, and Shakira.''
</P>
<P>
   But the English-speaking world is not the target. Llord and
Crespo have not fully conquered Latin America and Spain yet, and
the first thing on their agenda is to tour there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good moment for us Latinos, lots of happiness,'' Crespo
said. ``We're going to be going lots of places where we weren't
seen before. I used to be something tropical, local. Now I'm the
taste everybody wants.''

AT 30 AND CLIMBING THE MASTHEAD, NEWSWEEK EDITOR EARNS BEGRUDGING
RESPECT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Meacham, a stolid fellow known in the Newsweek offices for
his neatly combed hair and carefully chosen words, has a bust of
George Bush on the shelf next to his desk. An authority on
civil-rights history and World War II arcana, Meacham drinks Jack
Daniels, loves to talk about his wife _ ``she's a real Mississippi
Delta girl,'' he said _ and goes to church on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Meacham has also been part of the team supervising coverage of
dozens of national news stories, from the 1996 presidential
campaign to Monica Lewinsky for the magazine owned by the
Washington Post Co. Last November, he was named managing editor, a
title he shares with Ann McDaniel, Newsweek's longtime Washington
bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   If Meacham sounds like _ let's be blunt _ a vastly experienced
old fogey ticking off the days to retirement, read on: Meacham,
arguably one of the most influential editors in the news magazine
business, was still in his 20s last week. On May 20, he finally
passed over the epic chronological cusp of 30, an age when most
newsweekly journalists are still grinding out articles, not
overseeing a magazine staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my age is an issue,'' Meacham said in an
interview on his birthday (Thursday) in his Manhattan office (the
size of a studio apartment, which is what most of his college
classmates are probably still living in) overlooking Central Park.
Meacham pointed out that Richard M. Smith, Newsweek's editor in
chief and chairman, doesn't care either. ``He believes in `Throw
them in the deep end of the pool and see if they can swim.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek correspondent whose reporting
helped to uncover the Lewinsky affair, refers tartly to Meacham in
his book ``Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story'' as ``the `Boy
Wonder' nation editor.'' Around the Newsweek offices, Meacham's
reputation is that of a man so methodical _ although his youth and
relative inexperience have rankled some staff members _ that
colleagues often referred to his age by reversing the numerals,
said one editor; when Meacham was 27, for example, they considered
him 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that we all thought, when we learned he was going
to be the nation editor, well, gosh, he's awfully young,'' Isikoff
said. ``But he certainly filled the role pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meacham is a bit of an anomaly, although there is historical
precedent. After all, Briton Hadden and Henry R. Luce founded Time
magazine when they were in their early 20s. But the standard
trajectory in the newsweekly business has been to rise through the
reporting ranks _ as Whitaker and Ms. McDaniel did _ before
assuming the authority of senior editorial roles. At 29, for
example, Ms. McDaniel was covering the Supreme Court and the
Justice Department for Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess I was no slouch,'' Ms. McDaniel said. ``But it
did take me until I was 42 to be named managing editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chattanooga, Tenn., Meacham spent most of his childhood
at the knee of his grandfather, a prominent Chattanooga judge.
``Every morning at ten, he had this group of old guys at the
Downtown Hotel who would meet for coffee, five days a week, every
day except for Christmas,'' Meacham said. ``I remember that the
governor would stop by, and Al Gore would stop by,'' he said,
referring to the father of the vice president. ``So my earliest
memories are talk of politics and personalities, from what was
going on in Watergate to who was going to become the new county
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meacham said that because Chattanooga was a relatively isolated
city, in terms of news, in the 1970s and 1980s, newsweekly
magazines were cherished objects. ``It was before the national
edition of newspapers and before CNN, and so Time and Newsweek
played a huge cultural role,'' he said. Tuesdays, the day Time and
Newsweek arrived, ``were a big day in my house.''
</P>
<P>
   He majored in English at the University of the South in Sewanee,
Tenn., purposefully skipped journalism school, going to work as a
reporter at The Chattanooga Times instead. After a year, he went to
work for The Washington Monthly, which _ for the annual salary of
$10,000 _ he was put through what he referred to as ``journalism
boot camp'' and caught the eye of Newsweek's editor, Maynard
Parker, who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's Time, Newsweek and U.S. News &AMP; World Report have
watched their readers age during the last decade; to thrive they
must attract younger readers with ever-younger editors. Stephen A.
Douglas, the general partner at the Douglas Jones Group, a research
firm for the advertising industry, said that aging readership is a
special concern for the newsweeklies, and pointed out that in 1985
the median age of Newsweek's readership was 37, and in 1998, it was
43.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``A news magazine has a bunch of old editors, and sometimes
having a young editor brings a different perspective the readers
can sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that ``no one has ever asked or considered how old
someone was around here.'' He added: ``Jon's a wonderful writer. He
sees stories whole and he sees packages of stories whole. He has a
great sense about how to make the words and the pictures and the
organization of cover packages accessible, entertaining and
informative for the readers. That's not an age-specific thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But does Meacham risk cultivating too stodgy an image with his
old-fashioned demeanor, his bourbon habits and his membership in
the Council on Foreign Relations? ``No,'' Meacham said, explaining
that he was a ``term member'' of the Council. ``That means I'm
junior league. Just a pledge. That means I run around getting them
drinks.''

NETWORK NEWS MAGAZINE SHOWS HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALITY TRAITS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The list of television shows coming from just one producer this
fall is impressive: ``Chicago Hope,'' ``The Practice,'' ``Ally
McBeal'' and a new show called ``Snoops.'' Nobody produces more
hours of prime-time programming than Michelle Pfeiffer's husband,
David E. Kelley, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. He has two rivals, two unassuming native New Yorkers who
happen to live seven blocks apart on West End Avenue in Manhattan.
Between them, Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of NBC's
``Dateline,'' and Victor Neufeld, the executive producer of ABC's
``20/20,'' control nine lucrative hours of prime-time programming
every week.
</P>
<P>
   While skeptics said, earlier this season, that the networks had
stuffed far too many news magazines into their schedules, and that
the genre would become either puffy or stale, all the magazines did
reasonably well for the season, which ends this week. Their Nielsen
ratings slipped, but not by as much as overall broadcast network
ratings fell.
</P>
<P>
   Last week almost all were renewed for the fall _ not only five
``Dateline'' and four ``20/20'' programs, but all three CBS
magazines, ``60 Minutes,'' ``60 Minutes II'' and ``48 Hours.'' Only
Fox bucked the trend, and it plans to keep ``Fox Files'' in
production as a potential midseason replacement show.
</P>
<P>
   News magazines held onto their prime-time slots because they are
profitable _ they cost less to make than dramas or sitcoms, and
they cost nothing in rights fees because the networks own them.
</P>
<P>
   With so many news magazines on the air, are they becoming
fast-food operations, churning out almost interchangeable
bite-sized bits of journalism each week? Or are they distinctive
enough that each brings something special to the viewer?
</P>
<P>
   Talking informally, many producers and executives at the news
divisions of major networks say that each news magazine has certain
personality traits peculiar to itself, although there is overlap
among them. Most people will not share those observations for the
record, in deference to colleagues (who might, after all, become
co-workers or bosses some day).
</P>
<P>
   In general, ``Dateline'' is viewed as the magazine that does
best at jumping quickly on a breaking news story, producing
well-reported pieces for that night's program, by correspondents
who are relatively anonymous. ``Dateline,'' for example, did far
more pieces on the Monica Lewinsky scandal than any of its rivals _
but ``20/20'' got the most attention on that subject, when Barbara
Walters interviewed Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline'' is also seen as the show that leans most heavily on
``soft,'' feature-like pieces and small-scale consumer news, as
well as on weather and natural disaster stories.
</P>
<P>
   Some admire its packaging formula _ a familiar pace, each piece
introduced by the anchors, Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips, the
-``Timeline'' quiz in which viewers guess what year something
occurred, and a closing-credits -voiceover that make viewers feel
they are listening in on the production staff. Others criticize the
packaging as hokey.
</P>
<P>
   The distinguishing trait of ``20/20'' is its high-profile
anchors, and the high-profile interviews they deliver. But each
used to star on her own night: Ms. Sawyer co-anchoring ``Prime Time
Live'' on Wednesdays with Sam Donaldson; Ms. Walters ``20/20'' with
Hugh Downs on Friday. This season, the two programs merged under
the ``20/20'' franchise, and it was expanded to four nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   While still showcasing the big interviews and lengthy
investigations on medical and consumer topics that ``20/20'' has
done for almost two decades, with four nights to fill, the program
is also now more likely to report on a breaking news story the same
day. If a star anchor has done a piece that because of news
developments should run right away, Neufeld no longer has to wait
until the night that ``belonged'' to that anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, ``20/20'' staff members and Ms. Sawyer
did some marathon ``crashing'' _ rushing to finish ahead of
schedule _ on a piece Ms. Sawyer had reported, revealing what
children know about guns in their homes or neighbors' homes. The
piece had been planned for this week or next, but was finished for
Friday's ``20/20'' because of the Georgia school shootings
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that in the rush to deliver four programs a week,
``20/20'' has lost some of the polished, sophisticated look it
formerly had and that the program sometimes sounds a bit
overdramatic.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's ``48 Hours'' has always been different, devoting its whole
hour to a single subject. Its audience, while small, is quite
loyal. In the same time period as NBC's ``ER,'' the most popular
show on television, ``48 Hours'' drew about eight million
households on average this season.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from its CBS sister, ``60 Minutes,'' with its
average of 13.2 million homes a week. ``60 Minutes'' will finish on
the Nielsen list of the top 10 prime-time programs this season _
for the 22d consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   In personality, both ``60 Minutes'' and its spinoff, ``60
Minutes II,'' are more likely than their competitors to do
complicated, arcane pieces _ which critics call dull _ and far more
likely to report on subjects outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They differ in style, too, having four or five well-known
correspondents who report individually, with no on-air interaction
among them, unlike ``20/20'' and ``Dateline,'' which have larger
staffs of regular correspondents, and whose co-anchors appear live
and chat about the stories after each report.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, news magazines were looked upon by
network executives as useful filler _ respectable programs that
could be plugged into a schedule where a sitcom or drama had
failed, but unplugged as soon as something else came along.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Neufeld, Shapiro and their CBS counterparts are considered
integral members of their network's prime-time programming team,
directing crucial sectors of the network's strategic game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is invited to Burbank each spring to screen pilots of
dramas and sitcoms, offer his opinions, and get an idea of what
shows will lead into ``Dateline'' on the NBC schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a courtesy,'' he said. ``A way of saying you're a
player in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, as big a player as such drama producers as Dick
Wolf, Steven Bochco or the prolific Kelley.

A CAMP OF HOPE AND FEAR FOR KOSOVO REFUGEES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIER, Albania _ In a place called Fier, pronounced fear, there
is a camp called Hope, and the Americans who are building the camp
hope that thousands of Kosovo refugees will come to safety here
until they can return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the refugees' fear of coming this far south seems to
be winning out over hope.
</P>
<P>
   The first 2,500 of an estimated 20,000 refugees who are supposed
to resettle in Camp Hope have moved into large green military tents
erected by an American company under a contract with the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are not the refugees who have clustered near the
Kosovo border in northern Albania and whom relief agencies had
encouraged to relocate here. Rather, most are like Bali Muza, who
moved here last week from an old chicken farm nearby, where he had
been living in squalid conditions for several weeks since fleeing
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions there were horrible, and gangsters come over
every day to start trouble,'' said Muza, 66, who comes from the
village of Jashanica in western Kosovo. ``When they told me I could
come here, I said yes right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to persuade
people who settled in and around the northern Albanian city of
Kukes to relocate for their own safety have by and large failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been very successful,'' said Ray Wilkinson, an
agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kukes was supposed to be a temporary transit point for refugees.
About 300,000 refugees have passed through the city on their way to
more secure destinations farther from the often-tense border with
Yugoslavia, just over 10 miles from Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 100,000 refugees have put down roots in Kukes and
remain there in increasingly desperate conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many are reluctant to leave the border area either because they
expect _ unrealistically _ to return to Kosovo soon, or because
they continue to wait for family members to cross. Others say they
will not leave because they have not been given enough information
about where they will be taken.
</P>
<P>
   The area is dangerous, in part, because Kosovo rebels have set
up operations there, and several Serbian rockets have already
landed nearby. And the longer the refugees remain in Kukes, the
more determined local Albanian officials become to force them out.
Water is getting scarce, and the decrepit city of 20,000 residents
is unable to cope with the burden of caring for so many refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Albanian special policemen armed with automatic weapons
have gone through one camp frightening the refugees and ordering
them to move.
</P>
<P>
   After that episode, the U.N. refugee agency persuaded the
government to suspend such aggressive actions and to give the
agency time to encourage the refugees to leave on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But after several information campaigns, and a day spent flying
refugee leaders to new destinations and then bringing them back to
Kukes to brief others, few refugees who are already in camps in
Kukes have voluntarily agreed to uproot themselves again.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. policy is not to force refugees to leave, and they do
not want to close the camps at Kukes because the flow of refugees
continues. At the same time, the U.N. policy is not to keep
refugees within 50 miles of a contentious border. And, the flow
continues, including 1,000 men who came over on Saturday and Sunday
after being released from Serbian prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only want to be here. We don't even want to look at any
other camps,'' a refugee leader named Rahim Ymeri said at a news
conference that the refugees organized in Kukes recently.
</P>
<P>
   With estimates that it may take as long as two years before all
refugees can return safely to Kosovo, the relief agencies are
forced to confront the reality of long-term stays. Unlike the
northern camps, most of Camp Hope has been designed as an
all-weather, year-round camp, although the bulk of the tents will
not be erected for several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of the refugees to move again underscores some of
the problems that have plagued relief organizations _ and in
particular the United Nations _ since NATO began bombing Yugoslavia
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee agency ``has not taken the leadership role that it
normally would have taken in a situation like this,'' said Barbara
Shenstone, a program manager with CARE International, which is
running Camp Hope. ``It seems like they've always been behind the
wave, never in front.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that they want the United Nations to lead
relief efforts, CARE and other agencies have said the scale of the
crisis here appears to have overwhelmed the High Commissioner for
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not been as strong on the ground as they should have
been,'' said John Sargent, a spokesman for Oxfam, an international
aid agency. In part, he said, ``The U.N. appears to have been
sidelined by individual agencies setting up operations outside of
their control.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other refugee crises, like those in Africa, this one
has been very visible. Because it has taken place right in Europe,
it was much easier, and much more politically rewarding, for nearby
governments and agencies to come in on their own, said Wilkinson,
the refugee agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Italian government established its own camp at a
prominent spot on the only road leading from the border crossing at
Morina to Kukes. It is a first-class camp, with tents, water and a
clinic, and the refugees who settled there have been reluctant to
leave it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the camps are almost too good,'' Sargent said. ``They
use too many resources, and if everyone did the same, it all would
collapse.''

   The Greek government also established a well-organized camp near
Kukes, and the United Arab Emirates has built a large camp that
includes a field hospital and a mosque, in a show of Muslim
brotherhood with the largely Muslim Albanian-speaking refugees from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After about a month, the Italian and Greek governments pulled
out and left the operation of the camps to relief agencies. CARE
International now runs one of two Italian camps and tries to
encourage refugees there to move to Camp Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Individual agencies, including Doctors Without Borders, have
established their own camps in Kukes. In many cases, negotiations
were conducted directly with the government of Albania and local
landowners, and not through the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Relief efforts have been hampered by land-ownership problems in
Albania. When the Communist government collapsed in 1990-91, all
land was in state hands. But since then, conflicting land claims
have made negotiating leases a nightmare. Camp Hope is situated in
an isolated salt marsh near the Adriatic Sea because it is one of
the few large parcels with clear title: The Albanian government
still owns it.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee agency concedes that it did not bring in enough
people at the beginning of the crisis to coordinate the activities
of all the camps and the more than 100 individual relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Money has been a problem. For weeks, the United Nations has been
saying the costs of moving refugees and feeding them have exhausted
all of its reserves, while only half of a $140 million emergency
appeal for additional funds has been met. Raising money has been
difficult in this crisis because traditional U.N. donors are also
being solicited by the other aid agencies working in Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the presence of NATO has presented yet more
challenges in terms of communicating needs and coordinating relief
efforts. NATO trucks have at times gone back to Tirana with
supplies, planning to bring refugees back south, but have returned
empty because the relief agencies were unable to gather refugees at
the time or place NATO needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delays, Chris Sykes, a CARE coordinator, is certain
that refugees will come to Camp Hope. ``One way or another,'' he
said, ``this camp will be filled.''
</P>
<P>
   Agron Lama moved into the camp a few days ago after having lived
in five previous camps across Albania, most recently in the city of
Fier.
</P>
<P>
   Lama speaks some English, and one of the first things he did
after arriving here was to use smooth river stones to spell out the
camp's name, Hope, in English at the entrance to the tent where he
now lives with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands for the camp,'' he said, ``and also our hope for a
better future.''

 &HT;    Ted Turner feels partly responsible for school violence
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Maybe it's time to find a new nickname for Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Captain Outrageous'' actually was something closer to
courageous here Saturday night, refusing to follow the example of
so many others in the entertainment and media business by dodging
questions about the recent spate of school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Turner brought up the subject himself in accepting the
Denver Press Club's fifth annual Damon Runyon Award. Days after the
shootings at Columbine High School near Denver, Turner said, CNN
and Time Magazine asked 500 teenagers about possible causes. While
availability of guns ranked No. 1, the amount of violence in
television, movies, music and the news followed close behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to feel partly responsible for that,'' said Turner,
the founder of CNN and now vice chairman of the Time Warner
multimedia empire of which CNN is a part. ''I've never made any
gratuitously violent movies, but I'm certainly in the news
business, and we show a lot of violent stuff on the news,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke two days after the shootings at Heritage High School
outside Atlanta _ ``my hometown,'' he sighed _ and 10 hours after
Columbine's graduation ceremony was carried live on CNN. The Damon
Runyon dinner was originally scheduled just three days after the
Columbine shooting but was postponed largely at Turner's
suggestion, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been extraordinarily generous with his time,'' Denver
Post columnist Chuck Green said of Turner, who flew in just before
a hailstorm raked Denver on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Denver Mayor Wellington Webb declared Saturday ``Ted
Turner Day'' in that city, despite Turner's ``tearing the baseball
heart out'' of the region last year by making Atlanta Braves of
popular Colorado Rockies players Andres Galarraga and Walt Weiss. A
local a capella quintet performed ''Sailing,'' in honor of Turner's
1977 America's Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the press club bent its own rules in giving Turner
the Runyon Award, which usually goes to newspaper writers such as
Jimmy Breslin and the late Mike Royko and which is named for the
long-ago Denver journalist whose fiction about a lovable group of
gamblers spawned ``Guys and Dolls.'' The press club began in 1884
as a floating poker game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Turner is a writer, but not in the traditional sense,''
said Green. ''He writes the course of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's colorful speech traced his own roll-the-dice news
broadcasting career, from the early days at TBS when an announcer
simply read newspaper headlines aloud at 3 a.m. to the glory days
of CNN. But he frequently touched on current events, as when he
called for NATO to stop bombing Yugoslavia. Among his many reasons:
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People watch CNN all over the world,'' Turner pointed out as
his audience roared with laughter. ''So when they bomb 'em, they're
bombing my customers!''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rocky Mountain News reporter and dinner organizer John
Ensslin: ``He's definitely the most Runyonesque character around
today.''

AS YELTSIN GOES ON VACATION, RUSSIANS WONDER WHERE THE POWER
RESIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Having fired a government, squelched an impeachment
drive and installed a colorless but loyal police commander as prime
minister and potential successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
headed south Friday for what his aides described as a well-deserved
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   As for ordinary Russians, they were left _ once again _ out in
the cold, and in the dark. If the extraordinary events of the last
11 days proved anything, it was that Russia's fledgling democracy
is as secretive, and arcane, as the Communist regime it replaced
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion of the silent majority _ that is at least 77
percent of the population which does not want to see upheavals _ is
ignored,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, head of the Poliika Foundation,
a political think-tank. ``The authorities and public opinion have
in the past week been acting totally at cross purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the name of stopping a purported Communist comeback,
spearheaded by former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's popular if
inactive government, the Kremlin has reverted to form. Now it's
back to the days of `cadres' (an old Soviet term for personnel) and
clans, of backroom deals and hidden agendas, of rumors and oblique
hints.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politics have never been free of intrigue, but the
eight-month tenure of Primakov, whose coalition Cabinet included
Communist ministers and was backed by Yeltsin's Communist
opposition, did mark the first attempt by the Yeltsin
administration to rule not by confrontation, but consensus.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last. ``The consensus model of government suited an
overwhelming majority of the population, and an overwhelming
majority of the elite,'' said Nikonov. ``But it sidelined the
president's administration, and reduced its ability to play the
decisive role in deciding who would be Yeltsin's successor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kremlin's view, Primakov's coalition government had
overshot its role as a guarantor of stability, and was rapidly
becoming a launching pad for the Communist party's long-term
ambitions _ first as a source of financial support for coming
parliamentary elections and for Primakov's own anticipated
candidacy in the June 2000 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Primakov's firing, Yeltsin's advisers
took pains to depict the power struggle in Manichean terms. On the
eve of the government shake-up, one top Kremlin official described
the prime minister as ``strategically dangerous,'' a man who if
allowed to govern Russia until 2000, would emerge as a ``cross
between (Communist party leader Gennadi) Zyuganov and Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Primakov out of power, some Kremlin advisers are
talking about grooming his successor, Sergei Stepashin, a
47-year-old veteran of Russia's security services, as Yeltsin's
latest heir, an alternative not only to the Communists but also to
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential aspirant.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Luzhkov was in good favor with Yeltsin. Now, after
failing a number of loyalty tests, he is again feeling a cold wind
blowing from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's success hinges on his ability to survive the coming
year, until the eve of presidential elections scheduled for June
2000. In that time, he must negotiate the passage of tough fiscal
legislation required to ward off Russia's default on foreign loans,
and navigate parliamentary elections due in December.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he must survive the whims of an emotional and jealous
president who could at any moment overturn the best of strategies.
Among the wild cards now said to be under consideration is a
popular referendum to unite Russia with Belarus, its western Slavic
neighbor, in a union that would throw Russia's political calendar
wide open because it would create a new entity in need of a new _
or old _ president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Stepashin manages to stay and be the last premier before
the elections, he has a very good chance to become a presidential
candidate supported not only by the Kremlin _ which is important,
but not that important _ and the regional elite which is more
important, and key political forces,'' said Alexander Shokhin, a
former minister and centrist Duma deputy. ``So far, he has a
chance, provided he is not fired in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's credentials for his new role are still obscure. His
record as head of Russia's domestic intelligence service was
blotted by a disastrous performance in the early days of Moscow's
conflict with the breakaway republic of Chechnya. His views on
economics are pretty much a blank but his loyalty to Yeltsin _ with
whom he began his national career _ is absolute.
</P>
<P>
   As one recent poll indicated, many Russians are ready for a
law-and-order candidate, and Stepashin holds the rank of colonel
general in Russia's interior forces. Others look to Stepashin, son
of a naval officer from St. Petersburg, as an example of a new
generation of more mild-mannered, urbane politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we voting for Sergei Stepashin?'' asked Vladimir
Zhironovsky, Russia's most virulently anti-Communist nationalist,
during the debate that ended last Wednesday with Stepashin's
overwhelming confirmation as prime minister on first try. ``Simply
because we are sick and tired of people from the sticks. For the
first time in the past 100 years, someone from St. Petersburg will
head the government.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stepashin learns the ropes, who is running the country these
days?
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious answer is Yeltsin himself. After a winter of
hibernation, the 68-year-old president roared back to center stage
in the spring, despite an apparent _ but officially unconfirmed _
physical relapse. In recent appearances, his step has been
unsteady, his speech labored, and even slurred, and his
off-the-cuff comments confused.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, stands a tiny group of Kremlin insiders who include
top members of his administration as well as his daughter Tatyana
Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   This group, known here simply as the ``Family,'' has became the
conduit for a remarkable comeback by two of Russia's most
politically unpopular figures _ Anatoly Chubais, a liberal reformer
and former privatization czar, and if press reports are to be
believed, Boris Berezovsky, a multibillionaire financier with
irrepressible political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais has all but openly admitted his role in the decision,
made late on May 11 at the Kremlin , to fire Primakov and replace
him with Stepashin. Interviewed by Newsweek magazine, Chubais, now
head of the national electric utility company, called the
appointment of Stepashin ``a strategic and reasonable step by
Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Kremlin strategies are not always smoothly executed, as
became embarrassingly apparent on May 12, the day that Primakov's
firing was announced.
</P>
<P>
   First, Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the
parliament's lower house, told deputies that he had had a call from
the president, informing him that the next prime minister would be
Nikolai Aksyonenko, a little-known railways minister (since
promoted to become Stepashin's first deputy prime minister).
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Seleznyov again interrupted the proceedings with
the news that a letter from the Kremlin had arrived, nominating
Stepashin as prime minister. Seleznyov smiled, and shrugged. ``I
came to work today with clean ears, and my telephone is working,''
he said, as the deputies roared with laughter. ``The president told
me Aksyonenko, which is what I told you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian politicians, journalists and analysts are convinced
that the president's confusion may not have been accidental. As the
haggling over Stepashin's Cabinet appointments moves into full
swing, the newspapers have been full of reports of a struggle
between Chubais, and Berezovsky, who reportedly backed the
Aksyonenko nomination.
</P>
<P>
   How much real influence is wielded by Berezovsky is difficult to
gauge since his Kremlin access reportedly goes directly through
Mrs. Dyachenko, the youngest of the president's two daughters and
his political counselor since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin Yumashev and Alexander Voloshin, the Kremlin's former
and current chief of staff respectively, each have ties to
Berezovsky. A master of intrigue who is said to have taken care of
the Yeltsin family finances, Berezovsky is also a master of
illusion, and of the well-planted leak designed to suggest _
without proof _ that his political comeback is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is the most notorious of the so-called oligarchs who
made fortunes in the early days of Russia's chaotic privatization.
As long as Primakov was in power, Berezovsky was on the defensive,
targeted by a series of well-publicized corruption probes that
threatened to creep into the Kremlin itself.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov was fired, Berezovsky _ then in France _ lept back
into the limelight with a statement that portrayed the decision as
a triumph of good over evil. ``Primakov's dismissal is not just a
replacement of one person to the post of prime minister for
another, it is ``an abortion of an attempt for a Communist and KGB
revenge in Russia,'' Berezovsky told the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stepashin, the financier's praise was lukewarm.
``Stepashin doubtless shares the president's ideology and will
doubtless follow the course of reforms,'' he said.

CHRISTOPHER COX: THE RENAISSANCE CONGRESSMAN WHO PRESIDED OVER SPY
INQUIRY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He is something of a closet Renaissance man in the
House, one who speaks Russian, savors Ayn Rand and seeks out the
latest translation of Omar Khayyam. For a hobby, he reads book
after book on mathematicians. And so Rep. Christopher Cox may seem
the perfect prospect for presiding over the House's arcane and
ultra-secret investigation of suspected espionage by China.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a man who raced through three years of college at the
University of Southern California, then pursued twin degrees in law
and business in the next four years at Harvard ought to be able to
manage one of the most complex and technical, not to mention most
intensely reviewed, redacted and rewritten reports of recent
congressional vintage: the House's tome detailing China's years of
relentless espionage, which will be released to the public Tuesday
morning in its unclassified version.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Ground Hog Day will be over,'' Cox exulted in his office,
saying that after repetitiously renegotiating every jot and tittle
of the report with the administration, he felt like the Bill Murray
character who had to relive a day in Punxsutawney, Pa., over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two months we were nowhere,'' said Cox, a California
Republican who headed the House's eight-member select committee
that completed its full Top Secret China report last January, only
to find the task compounded in the negotiations with the White
House over the declassified version. The struggle was
understandable, for the panel's mandate was to delve into President
Clinton's controversial decision to waive export controls over
advanced space technology to China. Beyond missile technology, the
highly sensitive inquiry had subtexts of political fund raising
abuses and global economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially the guts of the report were blacked out,'' said
Cox of White House vettings that required numerous rewritings by
the committee until some acceptable public ground was laboriously
reached.
</P>
<P>
   For all that success, the real achievement by the 46-year-old
chairman may be that his committee conducted its job with
absolutely none of the partisan bombast and political firefights
that have marked five years of congressional investigations of
Clinton by the Capitol's Republican majority. Almost eerily, the
Cox committee stands brickbat free as it quietly moves off stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our report was unanimous because we stuck to the facts,'' said
Cox, carefully praising the committee's minority Democrats, led by
Norman D. Dicks of Washington. ``Things about which we disagreed we
simply left on the cutting room floor because there was so much
that was incontrovertible fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks still sounds amazed. ``There we were, Republicans and
Democrats functioning together in the middle of impeachment,'' he
said. ``Chris Cox has been a man of his word: There were no leaks
during the election. Chris played it straight.'' The Democrat said
that the panel's unusual creation of a joint investigating staff
and even a unified press office set a precedent for cooperation
that will be dearly needed when legislation is proposed to remedy
the security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report was worth the wait,'' concluded Cox, exuding a
quiet satisfaction that, whatever public furor may ensue, critics
will be hard pressed to dismiss the report as merely another
partisan salvo. It was as if Cox, a politician ambitious enough to
have vied unsuccessfully for the speakership during last fall's
Republican meltdown, understood that the clever way to stand out in
his China task was to buck the noisy, partisan routine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says his only real escape from the job lately is
sinking into books about mathematicians. ``It takes me completely
away from work,'' he explained, smiling apologetically at his
six-year binge of math reading. ``A crime novel would only get me
thinking about the crime bill.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an off-handedness to Cox's manner that is belied by his
resume. He sped through the U.S.C., shifting his major to English
after cramming on math. At Harvard he edited the law review. He
eventually was hired as a counsel by the Reagan Administration as a
kind of aberrant whiz kid _ an openly pro-Reagan Harvard man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I actually ever discovered an appetite for
politics,'' said Cox, who was elected to the House in 1988 after he
suddenly decided to enter a primary that already included 13 other
Republicans. ``It was merely impulsive,'' he explained. ``The
Reagan Administration was ending and I needed a job.'' He proved to
be no slouch as a candidate, enlisting the conservative heroes
Robert Bork and Oliver L. North to campaign for him.
</P>
<P>
   His earliest ambition was to be a sports car racer like his
father, a printing executive who competed on the national auto
circuit with his adoring son in tow. ``Eventually it dawned on me
that an abnormal number of my boyhood heroes were deceased because
of that sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox had his own brush with mortality as a law clerk when he
broke his back in a (non-competitive) auto accident. He was
paralyzed for three weeks, an experience that he finds has left him
ever appreciating how wayward life can be in its risks but also its
blessings.
</P>
<P>
   For the latter, he and his wife, Rebecca, who is a vice
president of Continental Airlines, have three children. The
lawmaker celebrated the Cox clan in the Congressional Record last
year, saluting his parents, Marilyn and Charles, on their 50th
wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Twain once remarked that he spent $25 to research his
family tree, and then he had to spend $50 to cover it up,'' the
congressman orated happily, taking time out from the China inquiry.
``Not so the Cox family.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a new book, former Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali lashes out at what he perceives was a betrayal by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the Clinton
administration for denying him a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who was America's U.N. representative at the time,
comes in for the harshest treatment, not only for diplomatic
double-face but also for what Boutros-Ghali sees as her lack of
diplomatic skills.
</P>
<P>
   She campaigned to oust him from his job, he says, ``with
determination, letting pass no opportunity to demolish my authority
and tarnish my image all the while showing a serene face, wearing a
friendly smile and repeating expressions of friendship and
admiration.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that her efforts to remove him from the post made him
recall ``what a Hindu scholar once said to me: There is no
difference between diplomacy and deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The central thesis of Boutros-Ghali's book _ titled
``Unvanquished: a U.S.-U.N. Saga'' (Random House) _ is that Clinton
felt obliged to deny him a second term early in the 1996
presidential election campaign because Sen. Bob Dole, the leading
Republican candidate, was accusing the administration of putting
the United Nations in charge of the American military by giving the
secretary general a veto over air strikes against the Serbs in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mocking pronunciation of my name _ Boo-trus, Boo-trus _
sounded like a jeering mob, and his claim that American troops
served under my `command' invariably aroused his audiences,''
Boutros-Ghali, a former Egyptian foreign minister, wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only once in every two decades did a U.N. and the U.S.
presidential election fall in the same year,'' he added. ``I knew
that the U.N. decision might get caught up in American politics. It
did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the book also makes clear that Boutros-Ghali believed
passionately in the independence of his office and that this led to
frequent disagreements with Albright and the Clinton administration
over issues ranging from the administration's distaste for the
Bosnia peace plan put together by former Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance and Britain's Lord Owen, its refusal to intervene more
forcibly to stop the genocide in Rwanda and America's failure to
pay its United Nations dues.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros-Ghali is scathing in his assessment of Albright's
diplomatic skills.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to have, he writes, ``little interest in the
difficult diplomatic work of persuading her foreign counterparts to
go along with the positions of her government, preferring to
lecture or speak in declarative sentences, or simply to read
verbatim from her briefing books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed to assume,'' he continues, ``that her mere
assertion of a U.S. policy should be sufficient to achieve the
support of other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   He also found her unusually sensitive to criticism, saying,
``She tended to react to discussions of problems between the United
Nations and the United States as if they were criticisms
specifically directed at her performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boutros-Ghali admits he underestimated her as an opponent.
When Joseph Verner Reed, an American who was an under secretary
general, reported hearing her say, ``I will make Boutros think I am
his friend: then I will break his legs,'' he dismissed the story as
``ridiculous,'' only to conclude later that he had been naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortune is a woman, Machiavelli said, and should be treated
roughly,'' he wrote, ``but in this case it was the woman who was
rough, and fortune favored her.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the book, Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, who
said he discussed the issues with her, defended her treatment of
the former secretary general and added that Albright had acted not
only in the best American interest but also in the interest of
American political support for the United Nations. ``She did what
she thought was right, and she thought she did it effectively,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He laid the blame for Boutros-Ghali's ouster with the former
secretary general himself. ``It was always unfortunate that
Boutros-Ghali did not have the skills to successfully manage the
most important relationship for any secretary general, which is
smooth cooperation with the United States,'' Rubin said. ``It led
to his downfall, so it is not surprising that he is bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Boutros Ghali envisioned a ``grandiose role'' for
himself at the United Nations, which the Clinton administration
could not support.
</P>
<P>
   He also called it ``ironic'' to hear that Boutros-Ghali thought
Albright was unduly sensitive to criticism, given the tone of his
remarks in the book. He said she ``always viewed him as intelligent
and thoughtful, and wishes him well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Boutros-Ghali strongly criticizes the Clinton
administration's legacy at the United Nations and its performance
in key areas, like Bosnia during its 1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   When the United Nations was allowed to do its work without
substantial U.S. involvement, as in Mozambique, the operation
succeeded, he says. The world body also did well, he says, when the
United States needed its help, as in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   But when the United States ``wanted to appear actively involved
while in reality avoiding hard decisions, as in Bosnia, Somalia and
Rwanda, the United Nations was abused, or blamed by the United
States and the operations failed, tragically and horribly,'' he
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   During their campaign to block his re-election, Boutros-Ghali
says that neither Secretary of State Warren Christopher nor
Albright would tell him why they were doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Kofi Annan's election in his stead, Boutros-Ghali
wrote, Albright was studiously vague on the subject. At their final
dinner together in the secretary general's Sutton Place residence,
Albright would only say that he symbolized the United Nations,
which was unpopular in Congress and was ``blamed for trying to
control American military power'' through the ``dual key''' system
that gave him veto power over NATO air strikes against the Bosnian
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros-Ghali vainly protested that she knew perfectly well it
was the commanders of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the ground in
Bosnia who opposed air strikes, fearing they would turn the Bosnian
Serbs against their soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But he glumly concludes: ``It was useless to pursue the subject.
She had no intention of telling me the truth behind Washington's
decision. I changed the subject again.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal appeals court based in Richmond, Va.,
has quietly but steadily become the boldest conservative court in
the United States in the view of scholars, lawyers and many of its
own members who say the court has issued some remarkable rulings
and taken a striking tone on several issues.
</P>
<P>
   The court, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers
five mid-Atlantic and Southern states, has in recent years evolved
into the kind of bench that staunch conservatives had hoped to
create at the Supreme Court but never quite achieved despite 12
years of Republican appointments under Presidents Ronald Reagan and
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit, which is one level below the Supreme Court, is
by far the most restrictive appeals court in the nation in granting
new hearings in death-penalty cases, according to several
statistical studies. It is highly receptive to efforts by states to
restrict abortion, and it has blazed new trails in striking down
laws that a majority of its judges say improperly enhance federal
power at the expense of the states.
</P>
<P>
   The court stunned both conservative and liberal scholars in
February when it cited an obscure 1968 statute in declaring that
federal law-enforcement officials need not follow one of the
best-known Supreme Court decisions of this century, Miranda vs.
Arizona, under which criminal suspects are notified of their legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 4th Circuit has moved forcefully and boldly on some of
these issues,'' said Jesse Choper, who teaches constitutional law
at the University of California at Berkeley Law School. ``In some
cases, they've gone out of their way to reach these decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, some of the Republican-appointed
judges who hold the majority on the 13-member court proudly assert
that they are part of an effort to reshape large areas of federal
law and constitutional interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions on the court have produced sharp debates behind
the scenes among judges who present a public face of courtesy and
courtliness. But its conservative majority has engaged in an
extraordinary degree of maneuvering to ensure that decisions on
important cases come out as the majority prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Harvie Wilkinson III, the chief judge of the 4th Circuit, said
in an interview that the circuit was ``involved in a revival of
constitutional limitations that were there all along but have been
greatly neglected for a very long time _ the extent of federal
power vis-a-vis the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said the circuit court's majority was doing its best
to follow signals sent by the Supreme Court in recent rulings,
particularly those involving new limits on federal power.
</P>
<P>
   He cited several Supreme Court rulings, especially a 1995 case,
United States vs. Lopez, in which a 5-4 majority ruled that
Congress had overstepped its bounds in 1990 by imposing extra
penalties for gun possession near a school. The Supreme Court
majority said Congress did not have the authority to regulate such
public-safety issues under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution,
which allows a federal role in interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit has taken the principles from that ruling into
new areas. It has ruled that some Clean Water Act regulations
exceeded Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.
</P>
<P>
   And it has struck down the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act,
which prohibits states from selling their rosters of registered
drivers for profit. The judges said that the law had ``offended our
system of dual sovereignty'' by telling the states what they could
and could not do with their drivers' records. The Supreme Court
agreed last week to review that case.
</P>
<P>
   An even more telling test may come later, when the Supreme Court
decides whether to hear an appeal of another 4th Circuit ruling
earlier this year, which said that the Violence Against Women Act
is unconstitutionally based on the Commerce Clause. The case
involves a former student at Virginia Tech who tried to use the law
to sue two football players who she asserted had raped her.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit, in a majority opinion by Judge Michael Luttig,
offered a ringing defense of states' rights, saying the law
``simply cannot be reconciled with the principles of limited
federal government upon which this nation is founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges on both sides of the philosophical divide at the 4th
Circuit expressed anxiety and curiosity about how the Supreme Court
would treat the case. More than half of the 4th Circuit's active
judges were interviewed for this article, although most asked that
they not be quoted directly or by name.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Supreme Court has approved of the rulings from
the 4th Circuit. In an address at the 4th Circuit's annual
conference last June, Chief Justice William Rehnquist made a point
of comparing the court favorably with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which covers California and several Western states.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, also divided along discernible philosophical
lines but with a generally liberal cast, at times seems to be in
combat with the Supreme Court, which has reversed a higher
percentage of that circuit's cases than any other. In contrast,
Rehnquist noted, the Supreme Court infrequently finds fault with
the rulings of the 4th Circuit.

<P>
   Conservative Core Wields Its Majority
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 13 active judges in the 4th Circuit, the
conservative-minded members like Wilkinson and Luttig, appointed
principally by Reagan and Bush, only slightly outnumber the judges
who were put on the court by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a core of about seven judges on this court who
generally share a common view about many of these issues,'' said
one of the judges in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative majority on the court has not been reluctant to
wield its majority forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   That has resulted in an especially troublesome dispute among
some judges on the circuit. On a handful of occasions, judges and
former law clerks say, the conservative majority has successfully
prevented the release of judicial opinions that displeased them.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling example occurred last July, as described by
judges on both sides of the philosophical divide, former judges and
law clerks. A federal trial judge ordered the Commonwealth of
Virginia not to begin enforcing a law requiring underage women to
obtain the consent of one parent before securing an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The state quickly sought to have the ruling reversed, and
applied to Luttig, who agreed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Several judges confirmed that the abortion rights lawyers then
quickly asked for a three-judge panel to reconsider the case. The
two judges chosen randomly to make up the panel with Luttig were
Judges Clyde Hamilton and Dickson Philips Jr. They wrote an opinion
overturning the Luttig order.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Luttig quickly requested that the case be considered by
the full court. In the meantime, the chief judge ordered that the
ruling by the three-judge panel be withheld from the public.
Eventually the full panel unanimously upheld Luttig.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law
School who has studied the appeals courts, says the 4th Circuit
regularly overrides decisions made by three-judge panels by quickly
having the whole court consider the cases, a procedure known as
``en banc.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conservative majority on the full court, and if
they see a panel decision they don't like, they just take it en
banc and reverse it,'' he said. ``No other circuit enforces
majority rule the way the 4th Circuit does. It's gotten to the
point that if there is a 2-to-1 liberal panel decision, you can
predict with almost perfect certainty that it will go before the
full court and be reversed. Liberal panel decisions are not allowed
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some judges said in interviews that they objected to the
frequency with which the conservative majority resorted to the en
banc procedure to overturn three-judge panels. ``There have been
some really nasty fights within the court over that issue,'' one
judge said.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Emory Widener Jr., who has been on the 4th Circuit
since 1972, said in an interview that while the abortion case had
produced ``many ruffled feathers at the court, I don't think there
is any real cause for complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the procedures were followed properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to confidential memos circulated among the judges,
Luttig has occasionally told his colleagues that he thinks the 4th
Circuit is involved in ground-breaking work in its rulings, and he
has frequently referred to the court's behavior as ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A Decided Shift in Philosophical Bent
</P>
<P>
   The circuit, one of 12 regional appeals courts, covers Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas, and its rulings are
theoretically binding in only those states. For years, the 4th
Circuit, which was at the heart of the civil rights battle, was
considered a fairly liberal court. But by the time Reagan was
elected in 1980, many of the judges were nearing retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reagan and Bush allowed committed conservative aides to
take over the task of selecting judges. Wilkinson, as a Justice
Department official in the Reagan administration, helped pick
judges, as did Luttig, who was a Justice Department official in the
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., also played a role in shaping the
court. Helms has blocked President Clinton's efforts to fill two
seats historically allocated to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Helms had urged that one of the vacancies be filled with a
longtime associate, Terry Boyle, a judge on the district court.
After that did not happen, the senator blocked all other
candidates, administration and Senate officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   And although the five states covered by the 4th Circuit have a
higher percentage of blacks than any other regional circuit, it
remains the only federal appeals court never to have had a minority
member.
</P>
<P>
   Little Hope for Appeals in Death Penalty Cases
</P>
<P>
   Among its other notable rulings, the 4th Circuit has rejected
complaints from gay rights advocates who challenged the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals in
the military. The court also ruled that the Food and Drug
Administration did not have the power to regulate nicotine as a
drug, a victory for tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the 4th Circuit is literally death on defendants
in death penalty cases. James Liebman of the Columbia University
Law School said a study to be published soon shows that the 4th
Circuit ``by far, gives the least relief of any circuit in the
country that has a sizable number of death penalty cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebman's study shows that in recent years, federal appeals
courts nationwide have granted new hearings for death-row inmates
in about 40 percent of all habeas corpus cases. The 4th Circuit did
so less than 4 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conservative outlook of the judges is usually the defining
factor in these kinds of case,'' he said, ``and it's especially
dramatic in the 4th Circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   John Blume of the Cornell University Law School, who represents
death-row prisoners, principally in South Carolina, said state
prosecutors were almost disdainful of district court judges who
grant habeas petitions because they know they will win on appeal to
the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This circuit is the black hole of death penalty cases,'' he
said. ``In the last 26 cases in which the death-sentence petitioner
prevailed at the trial level, the circuit reversed. How can the
district judges be wrong every single time?''

   JAZINCE, Macedonia _ There are moments when the pure
exhilaration of being here leads Dr. Jennifer Walser to wish she
did not have to return to New York. But there are also moments when
her efforts to alleviate are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the
tragedy unfolding before her.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Dr. Walser, a 31-year-old doctor who has been
finishing her residency in a hospital emergency room in the Bronx,
left New York to volunteer in refugee camps in Macedonia. Her spur
of the moment decision, which was sparked when she read Elie
Wiesel's invocation of the biblical dictum to ``not stand idly by''
in a magazine article, was chronicled in The New York Times on
April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month later, Dr. Walser is in Macedonia _ more alive,
she says, than she has ever been. And she has extended her stay for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why everyone doesn't do this,'' she said, as she
gunned a Toyota Land Cruiser down dirt track covered with goat
manure in this remote village a half mile from the Kosovo border.
``It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walser says she is satisfying her desires to help people
while experiencing a grand adventure. She has fallen in love with
the people of Kosovo and is being exposed to the joys and
frustrations of aid work. It is a craft where the ability to see
immediately the impact of easing pain and suffering can be
intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   She has also learned the limits of her work, the inability to
end the cause of the misery. Even so, Dr. Walser said, the work has
been enormously fulfilling. She wants to find a way to make refugee
medical work a regular part of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is that I have so many loans that I have to go
get a job to pay them off,'' she said. ``I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other American doctors volunteering here for the same medical
nonprofit group, the International Medical Corps, said they too had
found the work extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Todd Mydler, a 38-year-old pediatrician from Kansas City,
Mo., a graduate of Holy Cross College, said a Jesuit philosophy
``to do for others'' brought him to Macedonia. And Dr. James
Kleiwer, a 49-year-old family practitioner from Killeen, Texas,
said he was galled to see ``the strong taking advantage of the
weak'' in Kosovo and did not want to live a ``a life of excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walser, an indefatigable woman with boundless energy, seems
well-suited for the work. Tall and athletic, she is a chatterbox, a
whirlwind of sound and motion who _ dressed in a white physician's
vest _ attracts a gaggle of children whenever she walks through a
camp or village. Sometimes, she passes out kites she had her sister
ship from the United States. Other times, she gives a child a
sticker.
</P>
<P>
   After less than a month, she speaks surprisingly good Albanian
and warmly greets Albanians teen-agers with the phrase ``merdita,
baby'' _ a combination of the Albanian word for ``good day'' and
New York slang.
</P>
<P>
   Initially Dr. Walser went to work in the 14,000-person Stenkovec
refugee camp five miles from the Kosovo border, a sweltering, dusty
maze of tents erected on a former military air base.
</P>
<P>
   Living with other doctors in an apartment in nearby Skopje,
Macedonia's capital, she worked a 24-hour shift every other day
during her first two weeks. Her main activity, and most haunting
experience, was caring for thousands of ill and exhausted refugees
flooding into the camp by bus.
</P>
<P>
   Entering each bus with an interpreter, she typically found a
victim of beating, elderly people been expelled from their homes
without their heart or high blood pressure medicine, and several
dehydrated and exhausted people.
</P>
<P>
   She particularly remembers the 10-hour-old baby passed to her by
a pale young mother still bleeding from giving birth. And the boy
whose badly broken arm she had to splint with scrap wood and a bag
of rocks. Or a hysterical woman who had seen her husband and father
killed hours before.

<P>
   The ill and exhausted were taken by stretcher to a medical tent
where Dr. Walser and other doctors stabilized them. Over all, the
drugs and equipment here are limited but good, she said, and she is
able to do her job well. She has experienced only one death, an
elderly man who died one night, while sleeping in his tent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the treatment involves psychology. Calming the woman who
said she had witnessed the killing of her husband and her father,
Dr. Walser gave Valium and repeated over and over, ``You are safe,
you are safe, you are safe.''

</P>
<P>
   The shock and injuries are not as troubling, Dr. Walser said, as
separating herself from her patients. In the Bronx, she distanced
herself from shooting victims, for example, by telling herself that
something the person did may have contributed to his fate. While
not necessarily fair or true, this eased the haunting questions
that arise when dealing with illness and death, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the scale of Kosovo's refugee crisis is so great, she said,
that it is difficult not to feel touched by it. In Kosovo's
Albanians, she sees herself and her own family. ``They're like you
and me,'' she said, ``and someone just walks in their house and
shoots someone.''
</P>
<P>
   She admires the intense family bonds among the Albanians and the
qualities she says are embodied in a 12-year-old boy she befriended
here. The boy, whom she knows only by his first name, Arian, helped
Dr. Walser and other staff erect a new, better equipped field
clinic in Stenkovec. During the project, he worked ceaselessly,
digging trenches for water lines or erecting tents.
</P>
<P>
   As the weeks have passed, Dr. Walser has learned that the work
here involves more than just just helping. It involves making very
difficult decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, any refugees who can get Dr. Walser to write a
diagnosis requiring their immediate evacuation for medical reasons
could be on the way in days with their families to new lives in
Western Europe. Horrified at first by conditions in the camp, Dr.
Walser said she initially wrote diagnoses for whoever wanted to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   But after officials complained, Dr. Walser began having to say
no. Ugly confrontations erupted where she, and she alone, had to
tell families they would have to wait in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come in with their entire family,'' she said, a
drawn look coming over her usually bright face. ``Needless to say,
they were very, very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bowman, an administrator for the International Medical
Corps who has been working in the Balkans since 1994, said those
decisions took the highest toll on aid workers. ``When I've cried
it's not because I'm doing good,'' she said. ``It's because I've
been forced to make horrible choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Those difficult moments, and a slow-down in the number of
refugees arriving in Macedonia, prompted Dr. Walser to volunteer to
work in a clinic in Jazince, a remote village near a border
crossing. Here, she has examined refugees who trek over 4,000-foot
passes to flee Kosovo, attracted a new gaggle of children, cared
for a horse that stepped on a land mine, and spent her evenings
watching NATO bombs explode a few miles away inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to come to Macedonia, Dr. Walser said, was one of
the best she ever made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part about it, the most frustration and the most
likely thing to burn me out is just the magnitude of the things you
see here,'' she said. ``But I also feel that to a tiny, almost
imperceptible extent, I am part of a force helping improve the
situation, albeit a small one.''

GERMANY ELECTS RAU, LONGTIME SOCIAL DEMOCRAT, AS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Johannes Rau, a moderate Social Democrat, was elected
Sunday to be Germany's eighth postwar president, a largely
ceremonial post whose chief significance lies in its influence on
the nation's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Rau, 68, won on the second round of voting in the Federal
Convention, a body of 1,338 members made up representatives from
the parliament and regional assemblies in Germany's 16 states. He
will replace Roman Herzog, a conservative from the opposition
Christian Democratic Party, on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the federal republic's 50-year history,
the election took place in the Reichstag, whose reopening last
month heralded the government's move to Berlin later this year. The
setting of the vote reflected the historic shifts taking place in
Germany that may give Rau a more important role than his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, presidents have spoken out at times of intense
national questioning to calm spirits and encourage reconciliation.
For example, Herzog has done much to promote understanding between
Germans of the east and west, and his predecessor, Richard von
Weiszaecker, pressed Germans to deal openly with the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the major issues in the country include how to
revive the model of the ``social-market'' economy that served
Germany well in the postwar years but has proved unable to create
jobs in the 1990s, what role Germany should play in a Europe at
war, and how to reconcile an onerous past and ambitious aspirations
in the new capital Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   In an opening speech, Wolfgang Thierse, the speaker of the
parliament, thanked Herzog for his five years of service and said
the presidency expresses ``what binds us as Germans and also how we
will be seen in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rau's qualities as a conciliator are widely recognized. He ran
Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, for 21
years, doing much to turn the area into the country's economic
powerhouse and earning the title of ``the patriarch.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Protestant pastor, he is deeply religious and is
sometimes referred to in the press as ``Brother Johannes.'' He has
a penchant for speaking in deferential riddles rather than forceful
terms, a style that has insured he has few enemies but that could
prove inadequate if Germany's economy falters further and the
national mood turns sour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the election _ whose outcome was clear because of
the large Social Democratic majority _ whether he would run for a
second term in 2004, he said, ``We must never say tomorrow I will
do this or that, but accept God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberal weekly Die Zeit suggested that Rau might be too much
of a middle-of-the-road president for a country in need of new
ideas. The paper said he was not the man to push Germans toward
``the uncomfortable reforms that the country needs.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trauma of World War II, Germany's postwar development
was heavily based on an economic model that encouraged solidarity
and provided extensive social insurance. This model has safeguarded
the country from the extremes of social tension that were the
backdrop to Hitler's rise, but has of late appeared rigid, tired
and costly.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder came to power
seven months ago promising to revive an economy that has left more
than four million Germans _ or over 10 percent of the workforce _
unemployed, but has so far been unable to come up with effective
new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from economic issues, Rau may be called upon to give some
guidance on the increasingly disputed and embarrassing question of
a large Holocaust memorial in Berlin that has been planned for a
decade without a decision being made on what should be built.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Rau has expressed skepticism over the current
plan, which calls for a conference center, a museum, a wall of
books and a field of over 2,000 stone columns to be built on a vast
site next to the Brandenburg gate. The Reichstag is to vote on the
project, which is backed by Schroeder, later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rau, who will become Germany's eighth postwar president and only
the second Social Democrat to occupy the post, defeated Dagmar
Schipanski, 55, from the opposition Christian Democratic party and
Uta Ranke-Heinemann, 71, a theologian whose candidacy was backed by
the leftist Party of Democratic Socialism. He won a clear majority
of 690 votes in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his role as moral arbiter, the president's functions
include representing Germany abroad, pardoning convicted criminals,
naming senior officials and magistrates, and approving the
nomination of the chancellor and government ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The new president is married to Christina Delius, the
granddaughter of Germany's third postwar president, Gustav
Heinemann, the only other Social Democrat to have held the office.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ As NATO enters its third month of air
attacks, the Serbian military is sending fresh troops into Kosovo
to shore up its positions near the border with Albania, NATO
officials said Sunday. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The mood in the city. It is
weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism. The
citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week, feel
they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame at
what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the
obvious. By Stephen Erlanger.

   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE (Newnan, Ga.) _ The members of the Coweta County
Board of Education are not naive enough to think that they
vanquished school violence two weeks ago when they voted to
prohibit students from carrying bookbags unless the bags are
transparent or made of mesh. But at least it is something, they
say. And their attitude is not unique: In the month since the
shootings at Columbine High School, school boards, county
commissions and state legislatures all across the country have
proposed and enacted a broad series of measures aimed at attacking
the youth violence problem at the margins. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Undated) _ After decades of flops, $100 billion
in costs and sharp rises in the political stakes, the Pentagon is
trying again to build a system that can defend America against
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   EMBRYO-RESEARCH (Undated) _ A presidentially-appointed ethics
panel has decided to recommend that the federal government begin
paying for some research on human embryos. A draft report of the
decision to be announced next month concludes that the moral cost
of destroying embryos in research is outweighed by the social good
that could come from the studies. By Nicholas Wade.

   APPEALS-COURT (Washington) _ The Federal Appeals Court based in
Richmond, Va. has, in the view of scholars, lawyers and many of its
own members, quietly but steadily become the boldest conservative
court in the nation, setting remarkable new precedents and adopting
a striking tone on several issues. By Neil A. Lewis.

<P>
   NEWNAN, Ga. _ The members of the Coweta County Board of
Education are not naive enough to think that they vanquished school
violence two weeks ago when they voted to prohibit students from
carrying book bags unless the bags were transparent or made of
mesh.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it is something, they say. And after last month's
deadly attack in Littleton, Colo., and now Thursday's shootings in
Conyers, school officials and political leaders here and around the
United States feel an urgency to do something, to do anything
really, that will ease the anxieties of students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   In such a frantic atmosphere, the pressure to act is
increasingly winning out over concerns about privacy and
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to let the kids know who's in charge of the schools,
and if that means we're infringing on somebody's individual freedom
of expression, then so be it,'' said Michael Sumner, a Newnan
lawyer who is chairman of the school board in Coweta County, about
45 miles southwest of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some criticism that, well, where does it end? And
my point would be that I don't know where it ends, but it's sure
going to begin with book bags. Just because we can't do everything
to make our schools absolutely safe doesn't mean we shouldn't take
the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Sumner's attitude is far from unique. In the month since the
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, school boards,
county commissions and state legislatures across the country have
proposed and enacted a broad series of measures aimed at attacking
the youth violence problem at the margins.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the proponents acknowledge that their actions are
not cure-alls and that a more enduring solution will require
sweeping reassessments of today's youth culture and its countless
corrupting influences.
</P>
<P>
   But with six random shooting sprees at American schools in the
last 20 months, few parents and school administrators have the
patience to wait for that Utopian moment. And so they are putting
together a patchwork strategy and praying that incremental changes
will ward off the next tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to eliminate hiding places for weapons, proposals
to require mesh book bags have become commonplace. For the same
reason, some school districts are discussing the removal of student
lockers. Here in Coweta County, the school board is already
thinking about amending its new policy by banning book bags
altogether and buying each student two sets of books, one for home
and one for school.
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts also are considering dress codes that
would require students to tuck in shirts, so that weapons could not
be hidden in waistbands. An increasing number of public school
districts are discussing mandatory uniforms for students, at least
partly because officials think uniforms deter gang activity and
help administrators determine who belongs on their campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools, even in the most pastoral settings, are beefing up
security by installing locks and buzzers on doors, positioning
surveillance cameras in hallways and placing two-way intercoms in
classrooms. Budgets are being reconfigured to find money for metal
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   At meetings with faculty, parents and students on the day after
six students were shot at Heritage High School in nearby Conyers,
Donald Peccia, the superintendent of that district, discussed the
possibility of banning opaque book bags, removing lockers,
installing metal detectors and imposing a strict dress code.
</P>
<P>
   In Lexington, Ky., the Fayette County school board set aside
$125,000 after the Littleton shootings to buy a surveillance camera
and door buzzers for each of its 54 schools. John Toye, the
district's director of law enforcement, said the security plans had
been discussed before the April 20 attack, but money was
appropriated only afterward. ``It got everybody's attention,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Littleton shootings, Georgia's state school
superintendent, Linda Shrenko, renewed her call for increased
security financing and suggested that school boards be given the
authority to allow principals to carry Mace, pepper spray or stun
guns.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, where there were 42 bomb threats at schools
in the three weeks after the Littleton shootings, the state school
superintendent, Michael Ward, has proposed significantly increasing
the penalties for making such threats. ``This was driven almost
entirely by Columbine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the school shootings that preceded those at
Columbine, the public schools in Boston last week joined several
other systems that have anonymous toll-free hot lines for tips and
warnings about threats of violence. Kathleen Johnston, the system's
school-safety coordinator, said school officials recognized that
the tip line could be abused by students.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a chance you take,'' she said. ``But people very much
want this type of outlet. People are becoming more aware of what's
going on around them, what people are saying, what people are
writing, what people are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the recent shootings have had a direct impact on
gun-control legislation being debated _ and passed _ in Congress,
and they have prompted any number of governors to promise
disciplinary crackdowns in schools and to propose study commissions
on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   But the shootings also have led to legislation aimed at curbing
what minors can view on the Internet, in video games and in rock
concerts, all of which are said to have influenced the two
teen-agers who killed 12 classmates and a teacher at Columbine
before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, state Rep. Michael Carrell, a Republican who is
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill after the
Littleton shootings that would make it a misdemeanor for anyone to
provide information about bomb-making _ either through the Internet
or through the sale or loan of a book _ to a minor who then builds
a device that injures someone.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, state Rep. Perry Hooper Jr., R-Montgomery, has
introduced a bill that would ban the sale of violent video games to
minors and would give the state's attorney general the authority to
determine which games fit that definition. Hooper acknowledged that
such a ban would pose First Amendment concerns. ``You've got to
weigh constitutional rights with what's best for the state and its
citizens,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Taking an almost parental approach, the Senate in Louisiana
passed a measure on May 12 that would require elementary school
students to address teachers and school administrators ``by using
the respectful terms `yes, ma'am' and `no, ma'am' or `yes, sir' and
`no, sir.'''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed by a 34-5 vote, was proposed by
Gov. Mike Foster, a Republican, who conceived of the bill before
the Littleton shootings, said his spokeswoman, Marsanne Golsby. But
the bill's sponsor in the Senate, Donald Cravins, D-Lafayette, said
the shootings had influenced the timing of the bill's introduction,
and Ms. Golsby said the Colorado incident probably expanded its
margin of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court precedents allow modest restriction of students'
speech and give school officials significant leeway to conduct
random searches. But the American Civil Liberties Union has grown
concerned in recent weeks about several of the measures taken in
reaction to the Littleton shootings, particularly stringent
disciplinary actions against students for wearing or saying things
that school officials deemed inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilmington, N.C., a high school student spent three days in
jail this month after being charged with communicating a threat,
because he wrote the phrase ``The end is near'' on his computer's
background wallpaper. And in Brimfield, Ohio, 11 high school
students were suspended after contributing to an off-campus Web
site about the gothic subculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a violent or tragic incident, the first
reaction of public officials is to scapegoat civil liberties,''
said Nadine Strossen, president of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Houston, the executive director of the American Association
of School Administrators, agreed that there had been some
overreaction. But he said he understood the instinct of school
officials and politicians to respond to the fears of students,
teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same world as it was before,'' Houston said.
``It's finally come home that these things can happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the rash of school shootings began, that is certainly the
reality here in Newnan, a sleepy town that likes its distance from
the big-city problems of Atlanta. Its high schools now feature
security cameras, on-campus police officers, lock-down drills and
random searches by contraband-sniffing dogs and investigators
wielding hand-held metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   When a dog became particularly interested in a book bag during a
recent search at Newnan High, school officials were relieved to
find only a soggy chicken biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing by a different set of rules now,'' said Alan
Wood, the principal. ``To serve and protect has become our motto.
It used to be on the sides of police cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most students at the school object to the new
policy on book bags, which will take effect next year. Karen
Hembree, a senior, said that the mesh book bags, which cost about
$15, will do little to impede a determined gunman, will impose on
privacy, will pose a financial burden on some students and will
fail to protect books and papers in rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Flynn Tracy, this year's valedictorian, said she
felt much the same way until Thursday's shootings in Conyers, about
an hour's drive away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would make much difference,'' Ms. Tracy
said. ``But now after what happened in Conyers, whether they take
minor steps or major steps, schools should do anything they can to
make themselves safer.''

LAWSUIT REVIVES QUESTIONS ABOUT HANCOCK
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, the John Hancock Mutual Insurance Co. had been
steaming smoothly toward a major reorganization that would permit
the sale of shares to the public, raising the likelihood of nice
bonuses for policyholders and considerable wealth for some top
executives.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, a Massachusetts appeals court reinstated a
lawsuit that dredges up an old scandal in which the company was
charged with illegally bestowing gifts _ dinners, tickets to shows
and sports events and outings to resorts _ on more than two dozen
Massachusetts legislators in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation revives questions about the integrity and
management of John Hancock, one of the nation's largest life
insurers, at a time when the company has been doing everything
possible to enhance its attractiveness to potential investors. The
dispute's ultimate damage, insurance industry analysts said, will
depend on how it plays out in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit strikes at the core of the company. In it, one of John
Hancock's seven million policyholders _ the formal owners of the
mutual company _ contends that the top executives and directors
``participated in, or approved, the illegal lobbying'' and saddled
the company with expenses of more than $4 million in fines, legal
fees and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, John Hancock acknowledged that its lobbying, on a range
of issues including legislation permitting the company to
reorganize and sell stock, violated Massachusetts law. The company
paid $1.01 million in fines. About a dozen state legislators,
including, Paul Cellucci, who is now Governor of Massachusetts,
also paid small fines.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit, the policyholder, Loretta Harhen, is demanding
the resignations of John Hancock's highest executives _ Stephen
Brown, the chief executive, and David D'Alessandro, the president,
as well as E. James Morton, a former chairman, who like the others
is on the board. She also wants them and two former employees _
Raeburn B. Hathaway, who headed the government relations department
as the scandal unfolded, and a former chief lobbyist, F. William
Sawyer _ to repay the company the $4 million. Ms. Harhen is not
seeking direct compensation for herself.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock says in court papers that the decisions by its
executives were ``entirely appropriate.'' But in a 38-page
decision, three appellate judges concluded that that contention
should be tested at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The legal assault could not have come at a more delicate time
for John Hancock, a company with assets of $67 billion and revenue
last year of more than $13.6 billion. It has been trimming and
polishing its operations in hopes of drawing top dollar when it
begins selling shares. With other mutual insurers also preparing to
issue shares, competition for investors is intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, John Hancock agreed to pay $350 million to settle
a class-action suit asserting that the company, like many other big
life insurers, who were also sued, had misled customers into buying
policies they did not need.
</P>
<P>
   On guard against anything that could rekindle memories of the
past scandals, D'Alessandro reacted quickly to the disclosure
earlier this year of corruption among the organizers of the Olympic
Games, which John Hancock has sponsored for years. He yanked the
Olympics logo from all the company's promotions and suggested that
unless the games regained their sterling image, John Hancock would
be gone as a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The integrity and quality of John Hancock's leadership will be
particularly important as the company presents specific plans in
coming months for the reorganization and the distribution to
policyholders of at least $3.3 billion in accumulated profits. The
plan, which for the first time will make executives eligible for
stock options, is subject to approval by both policyholders and the
Massachusetts insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   How this will all play out is unclear. ``Any litigation against
a company is not good news and particularly any litigation in which
the company has lost an appeals decision,'' Patrick Finnegan, a
senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said. ``But in order
to assess the impact of this, one would really have to wait to see
how much of the company's resources have to be used and whether it
brings real pressure on the executive officers to step down. This
could be a fly in the ointment or it could very well be a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Burgay, the chief spokesman for John Hancock, said the
company still expected the reorganization to be completed early
next year and did not expect the offering price of the stock to
suffer. No one, he said, planned to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This matter was thoroughly investigated years ago by the U.S.
Attorney, the FBI, a federal grand jury and the state ethics
commission,'' he said. ``None of these investigations found senior
management to be involved in improprieties.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock's adversary in the lawsuit, Jason Adkins, the
founder of the Center for Insurance Research in Cambridge, Mass.,
said the criminal investigation did not address ``management's
responsibility to the owners of the corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. attorney was looking out for the citizens of the
state and the taxpayer,'' Adkins said. ``This suit is about
protecting the rights and interests of the policyholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgay says the suit is ``all about publicity and trying to
squeeze the company'' as the offering nears.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock will most likely try to settle the suit swiftly.
Indeed, Burgay did not discourage that line of thought. ``We're
considering all our options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the lawsuit develops into a courtroom brawl, analysts
said they expected that the opportunities for personal enrichment
for policyholders, investors and top executives would keep the
company rolling toward a stock market destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unusual for a policyholder's suit to derail a
process with so much momentum,'' said Eric Berg, an insurance
analyst at CIBC World Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Should the lawsuit succeed, Burgay said John Hancock's corporate
liability insurance would be expected to pay any obligation
assigned to the executives. But Robert Mescal, a specialist in
initial public offerings at the Institute for Econometric Research
in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said the executives would not necessarily
need insurance. They could simply pay, he said, ``and make sure the
options on the IPO would be sufficient to cover the cost.''

CLINTON URGES UNEMPLOYMENT FUNDS TO GIVE PARENTS TIME TO CARE FOR
CHILDREN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAMBLING, La. _ Seeking to expand one of his most popular
programs, President Clinton said Sunday he would direct the Labor
Department to explore ways to allow states to use surplus
unemployment insurance funds to subsidize parents who take time off
to care for a new child.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced the proposed expansion of the Family and
Medical Leave law during a commencement address at Grambling State
University, a historically black school in north-central Louisiana.
Clinton used the speech to discuss the growing strains faced by
working parents and to offer a few nuggets of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's working parents too often feel enormous stress and
bring that stress home with them,'' the president said Sunday
morning under a roasting sun in Grambling's football stadium, as
thousands fanned themselves with commencement programs. ``Unless we
act now, this problem will get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that states should be permitted to broaden
the definition of unemployment to include those parents who
voluntarily take time off to care for newborns or newly adopted
children. Many new parents do not take advantage of the unpaid
leave offered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
because they cannot afford to live without their wages even for a
few weeks after a child is born.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the states are running surpluses in their
unemployment accounts and several are looking at ways to return the
payments to employers who finance the systems or to pay for new
benefits. Four states _ Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont and
Washington _ have asked the federal government to approve the use
of those excess funds to expand benefits to new parents who want to
take time off work.
</P>
<P>
   Surpluses in states' funds for the jobless and in their medical
accounts for children and the indigent are overflowing because of
low unemployment and reductions in welfare and health care
benefits, sparking a classic liberal-conservative political debate.
The president and Democratic lawmakers believe the money should be
devoted to expanded benefits. Business groups and many Republican
lawmakers say the money should be returned to employers and
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed allowing federal employees to use
their accumulated sick leave to care for seriously ill family
members, a modest expansion of current benefits that would cost the
government about $60 million a year, a White House aide said. The
proposal potentially affects 10,000 federal workers, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited a new study by the White House Council of Economic
Advisers that says that American parents are working longer hours
and spending less time at home with their families. The longer work
hours and the growing number of women in the work force has cost
the typical American parent 22 fewer hours a week with his or her
children, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found that because more and more parents are working
outside the home, they have less and less time with their
children,'' Clinton told the Grambling graduates. ``I believe it is
imperative that your country give you the tools to succeed not only
in the workplace but also at home. If you or any American has to
choose between being a good parent and successful in your careers,
you have paid a terrible price, and so has your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's commencement address at Grambling (Motto: Everybody is
Somebody) is the first of three he plans to deliver this spring. In
June, he will speak at the Air Force Academy and at the University
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was delighted to leave the political warfare and
second-guessing on Kosovo in Washington to spend the morning here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a town where everybody thinks they're
somebody,'' Clinton said. ``I wanted to come to the place where
everybody is somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The 500 graduates and thousands of family members cheered
heartily.

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Bringing new accounts of atrocities and
worsening conditions inside Kosovo, more than 14,000 ethnic
Albanians have surged across the border here over the last two
days, with possibly thousands more behind them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 7,000 people fled into Macedonia, continuing the
largest exodus of refugees from Kosovo in more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the new arrivals crossed the border Sunday, U.N. refugee
officials were busy processing an equal number of Kosovo Albanians
who entered Macedonia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, who came carrying possessions and children and
with dismay and exhaustion etched on their faces, told of mass
expulsions, random killings, and men who were separated from their
families.
</P>
<P>
   They said that robbery was being carried out systematically by
Serb forces and that food supplies in the southern Serbian province
were dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees also reported that Serbian forces continued going
door to door Sunday in neighborhoods in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, and in the town of Urosevac, ordering Albanians to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the new round of expulsions were not clear.
Refugees arriving over the last several days said they had received
no explanation from soldiers and police officers who ordered them
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the final effort to clear some neighborhoods'' in
Pristina, said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee
agency. ``They're once again getting serious about expelling
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arrived Sunday on about 20 buses as well as a train
that had originated just south of Pristina. The train was packed,
and refugees reported that several hundred people were unable to
board in Urosevac, Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that as many as 300 people filled each car and that
one elderly man died during the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said there appeared to be more people than usual
requiring medical aid among the new arrivals, particularly elderly.
</P>
<P>
   With roughly 2,000 refugees being flown from Macedonia each day
to the United States and Western Europe, there is room for the new
arrivals in the once-crowded refugee camps here, Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that if the influx continued, the camps would
quickly be at capacity again, increasing fears of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two more days of this,'' he said, ``and we'll be shoe-horning
people into these camps again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Serbian forces have steadily expelled Albanians from various
parts of Kosovo since just before NATO bombing began on March 24.
But they have opened and closed the border at random intervals, at
times trapping thousands of displaced people inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western officials have speculated that the expulsions may
correspond with the needs of Serbian forces, clearing Albanians
from an area to separate the population from the Kosovo rebel army,
or variously clogging or clearing roads depending on NATO air
attacks and the movements of Serb military convoys.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new arrivals said they were expelled from their
homes weeks ago, but were then blocked from crossing the border.
They have spent the intervening time hiding in abandoned homes in
Pristina or in remote villages waiting for the opportunity to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees said the climate of fear was so intense and food was in
such short supply that some Albanians had readily fled upon hearing
news that the border was open.
</P>
<P>
   Fehmi Krasniqi, a 44-year-old teacher who arrived from Pristina
on Saturday, said he hid his 18-year-old son in his attic each of
the three times Serbian soldiers came to his home to rob them. The
fourth time was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five soldiers came the day before yesterday,'' he said,
explaining his decision to leave. ``I was afraid they wanted to
take him.''

 &HT;    GORE HEADED TO TEXAS, WITH FAITH-VALUES STOPOVER IN ATLANTA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) political categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore makes his first fund-raising
foray into Texas this week as part of a three-day swing through the
Bible Belt in which the one-time divinity student will speak of
religious faith in ways seldom heard from Democratic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Texas, politically, is indisputably a Republican
state, as well as the home of George W. Bush, the state's popular
governor and overwhelming front-runner for the Republican 2000
presidential nomination, Gore is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be competitive everywhere,'' Gore spokesman Roger
Salazar said Sunday. ``We're not taking anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians go where the money is. And while it is nearly
impossible to subtract Texas from the Republican column in the
mathematics of presidential politics, it is as important a source
of campaign funds for both parties as is California, New York or
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on Tuesday, while Gore's wife, Tipper, will be hosting
a Gore 2000 fund-raising luncheon in Austin, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, the vice president's sole opponent for the
Democratic 2000 presidential nomination, will be raising campaign
funds in El Paso and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself will appear at campaign fund-raisers in Dallas and
Houston on Wednesday. The success of those events will indicate how
important Texas is going to be in the vice president's future
fund-raising efforts. ``We'll know soon enough,'' said Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also will lead a conference on empowerment zones in McAllen
on Tuesday, and, with his wife, discuss school safety in Dallas on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the top-billed event of Gore's three-day trip through
Florida, Georgia and Texas is a speech on faith and values the vice
president plans to deliver Monday afternoon at a Salvation Army
cafeteria in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   (Upon his arrival in Atlanta, Gore will be greeted by fire
fighter Matt Mosely, whose daring crane rescue made international
headlines last month.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the only one of the 13 presidential candidates who has
attended divinity school, is expected to call for partnerships
between the federal government and faith-based organizations to
address problems of juvenile crime, poverty, violence, drug
addiction and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The speech appears, in part, to be an attempt to build the
momentum resulting from Gore's dramatic tie-breaking vote to pass
gun control legislation in the Senate last week.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's camp, however, denies the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's vote ``was not about politics _ it was about protecting
America's kids,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation came in response to the killing of high
school students in Littleton, Colo., a month ago, and was passed
within hours of the wounding of six students at a high school some
25 miles east of the Salvation Army cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a divinity student at Vanderbilt University in 1971, has
occasionally invoked Biblical passages in speaking of the Littleton
tragedy. He also has spoken openly of his own religious faith,
something few Democratic politicians do.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has ``a large, secular constituency of
nonreligious people who don't react particularly well to religious
language,'' said John C. Green, a political science professor at
the University of Akron who studies the relationship between
politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore's interest in getting the government working with
faith-based groups to address social ills has raised some concerns
in organizations that have come into existence to oppose
initiatives of the Christian Coalition and other religious
conservatives with close ties to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the organization
from which many of Gore's ideas come, contends that turning to
faith-based organizations to provide social services will be more
efficient than the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all approach.
</P>
<P>
   Local institutions and charities ``are a true hope'' for people
in need, said David Kuo, a DLC associate.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Just one of those days
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When our oldest son was 5, he had to undergo
surgery. A dear friend brought him a book in the hospital, Judith
Viorst's ``Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad
Day.'' It's been one of my favorites ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's day begins badly when he gets out of bed and gum is
stuck in his hair. It only gets worse. His teacher doesn't like his
picture of an invisible castle. His mother forgets to put dessert
in his lunchbox. He goes to the dentist with siblings and he's the
only one with a cavity. His mom makes lima beans for supper and he
hates lima beans. In every respect, it was a terrible, horrible, no
good, very bad day. Alexander wants to move to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   We've had a few of those days through the years. Take a recent
Friday, for example. We returned home from a day trip to find a
crew of workers finishing up our new roof. This was good _ until
the crew boss informed us the skylight we ordered was too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it be too small?'' we asked incredulously. ``We
ordered the size you told us to get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry. It's too small. You need a larger one.''
</P>
<P>
   We stood there helplessly, looking up at the 4-foot by 4-foot
hole in our newly shingled roof as storm clouds gathered ominously
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we can put a piece of plastic over it for you,'' the
crew boss said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, thank you so much.
</P>
<P>
   As the roofers strung the equivalent of a big trash bag over the
hole, we jumped into our van to go to the building supply store to
look for a larger skylight. My husband turned the ignition key and
. . . click, click, click. We looked at each other. We had just
traveled some 200 miles in this car. What could possibly be wrong
with it?
</P>
<P>
   Click, click, click.
</P>
<P>
   I dropped my head into my hands as my husband went to get
another of our vehicles to try to jump-start the engine. Click,
click, click. Nothing. We went to our last hope, the old Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   With jumper cables draped haphazardly from one car to the other,
I watched as the engine did nothing more than click, click, click.
It didn't work. Maybe it wasn't the battery. Maybe it was something
major that would cost thousands of dollars. Maybe I would just go
to bed at 4 in the afternoon and not get up until the next day.
Maybe I would move to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   We got in the Toyota and went to the store to ask about the
skylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What size?'' the clerk asked with amazement. ``Well, I don't
think they make them that size, but I can call the wholesaler on
Monday and try to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you so very much.
</P>
<P>
   We went home and stretched the heaviest tarp we could find over
our gaping syklight hole, anchoring it with our son's barbell
weights. That was the weekend, of course, when we had several
sudden downpours. Each time, we scaled our kitchen table and gently
poked the tarp upward with a broom handle so that water wouldn't
collect and come cascading into our kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   This day was not over yet. My husband went out to change the
bulb in one of our porch lights, and the side glass panels slipped
from their tracks and crashed to the porch.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the noise, I went out to see what had happened. There we
stood, shards of glass around our feet, a loose end of the tarp
flapping above our heads and two of our vehicles sitting useless in
the rain. ``I never wanted to own a home, or a car,'' my husband
muttered under his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' I said. ``They own us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. But, as
Alexander's mom reminded him, some days are just like that. Even in
Australia.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Trading apartment din for yard noise
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Sometimes at night, I still find myself
listening for the tumbler.
</P>
<P>
   The tumbler lived in the apartment above mine. She was 10 or so
and took gymnastic classes. A good somersault, from the point of
view of someone living beneath it, begins with a thud of initial
impact followed by a short string of lighter taps as the
somersaulter wheels the length of the room, and ends up, I assume,
in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   THUMP-thud-thed-thed-thed-bom. Ta-dah!
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks, I hardly thought twice about it. A budding
young gymnast, on the scale of apartment noise-sources, is far
superior to a metal-head, a dissolving romantic relationship or any
high-strung dog.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I traded the communal existence of an apartment
dweller for the open spaces of house life. I like doing laundry
without going outside. I miss the Coke machine, though. People told
me I was moving to a quieter existence, but mainly I traded one set
of sounds for another.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a temperamental neighbor. I am skilled at the art of
ignoring. Civilized society, after all, rests on our ability to
tune each other out. I'm doing my part for civilization, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished sleeper, I have blissfully snoozed through
nearby parties, motorcycle tune-ups and criminal disorder. My
greatest moment of oblivious tenancy came many years ago when I
slept through an attempted murder in an upstairs apartment, which
had been followed by ambulance and police sirens, scampering
paramedics and shouting police.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow tenants pitied me for missing the drama and
excitement. Each resident was happy to fill me in on all the
ghastly details.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was a fight between roommates, that much was the same
in everyone's account. The two young men pounded each other with
objects they found around their home until one of them was
unconscious and the other hauled away by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``In handcuffs, like on TV,'' said the woman the next floor up.
</P>
<P>
   As The Guy Who Missed the Attempted Murder in Apt. 102, I became
something of a celebrity in the building. I was welcomed by all and
sought after by those who wanted to give their account of the
battle without fear of being contradicted by other witnesses.
Nothing cramps a storyteller's style like competing versions of
reality. And a story this strong must be told.
</P>
<P>
   Not having my own version to peddle, then, I was much in demand.
I was the only disinterested audience in the building. In filling
this role, I got to chat with people whom I would not otherwise
have met. People fed me. They handed me beers.
</P>
<P>
   I have been a good listener ever since. There is no better
training for journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Now I live in a house with a yard. It's a whole different group
of sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone within an earshot is so quiet I hardly notice them. I
haven't seen many of them since the time the guy down the street
cut down a tree and ended up knocking down a power line. (The
lights went out for half a block. Everyone came out to stare. It
was almost a block party.)
</P>
<P>
   I also haven't heard an attempted murder for ages. Any nearby
metal-heads must be in hiding. My ceiling stays silent, even though
I half-expect the small gymnast to reappear on my roof.
(THUMP-thud-thed-thed-thed-bom. Ta-dah!)
</P>
<P>
   In their place, I am awakened by leaf-blowers, lawn mowers,
edgers and small, two-stroke engines powering lawn-and-garden tools
beyond my understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I can hear easy-listening music played loudly
somewhere. Playing mellow music at high volume is an act that
strikes me as deeply, maybe pathologically, contradictory. But,
hey, no metal-heads are powering their speakers near my plumbing,
so I wouldn't dream of complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Not about the music, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'd gladly pick a second-floor gymnast over a leaf-blower
if I could choose my wake-up sound. Leaf-blowers are evil. They are
often operated by early risers.
</P>
<P>
   Late sleepers are the sure sign of an advanced and civilized
people. We are persecuted both in house and apartment. It's hard to
say where it's worse. Regardless, though, we still follow our
dreams.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Laws alone can't solve problems of our violent
society
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The following is an excerpt from an NRA ad:
``The gun came to America on the Mayflower. The right to own it
didn't. That right came with the blood and bravery of countless
patriots, whose valor now bestows it at birth upon every U.S.
citizen.'' It reminds us that weapons played an important part in
man's ``rise to freedom from oppression, and the sweet victory of
liberty over tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   True. All of it.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago our forefathers also needed guns to hunt
for food and keep wild animals at bay. Today the wild animals are
carrying the guns and the rest of us feel like ducks in a shooting
gallery. Is this what happens to an armed society when there are no
longer any common causes to rally around? We shoot each other?
</P>
<P>
   There were no guns in my parents' home. The first gun I ever saw
was the one my new husband, the airline pilot, brought with him
when we married and moved into an apartment on the west side of
Chicago. Although I can't quote caliber and make, I do remember it
was big, heavy, and lived in the night table drawer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``big gun'' and I were never on intimate terms. I watched my
husband clean it a few times but the only occasion I ever had to
handle it was during the weekly dusting.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and I had been married less than a year. He was on a
three-day trip to somewhere, and I was home alone. The night was
dark and creepy, and so was our cavernous old apartment. The
bedroom was a long, dim hallway away from the front door. I was
propped up in bed, wearing a pair of my husband's pajamas, and
reading one of the spy novels he collected, when I heard someone
tampering with the front door lock. It was decision time.
</P>
<P>
   In silent slow motion, I threw back the covers and slid open the
night table drawer. The gun felt cold in my hand. As I slipped
soundlessly out of bed, I heard the front door squeak open. My
right hand awkwardly held the gun - while the left one clutched at
the waist of the too-big pajama bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   As I tiptoed down the hall an ugly idea occurred to me - what if
there was no shell in the chamber? What if in the next fraction of
a second I was going to be facing down an armed breaker-and-enterer
with an unloaded gun? I transferred the gun to my left hand and
reached for the slide with my right. And then it happened. My pants
fell down.

   Epiphany. Suddenly I knew that if I were going to shoot this bad
guy, I would have to do it with pajama bottoms around my ankles.
Helluva choice.
</P>
<P>
   But at that moment, the hall light clicked on. Not ten feet away
stood a handsome (but at that moment rather pale) guy in a uniform.
His trip had cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   Gently, he pried my fingers off the gun and laid it on the
telephone table, grinning as he eyeballed the heap around my feet
his pajama pants had become. ``Jeez, lady,'' he said, ``you almost
widowed yourself.'' I made a joke about collecting big on the
insurance - and then threw up all over his shiny shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost 40 years later, my emotions are still mixed. I truly
wish guns had never been invented - EVER - but I can't believe that
legislation and regulation will make the whole bad scene go away.
The trouble with our violent society runs much deeper than a
problem that can be solved by registration and waiting periods.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Charlton Heston needs to give up moonlighting as president
of the NRA, and go back to his day job as Moses. Maybe he needs to
haul those stone tablets back up the mountain and speak to us one
more time about all of those ``Thou shalt nots'' we've become so
careless with lately - particularly that fifth one - the one that
reads, ``Thou shalt not kill.''

PROTECTING THE PUBLIC TRUST WITH WEB CAMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps just as likely to encourage vandalism as
it does to protect against it, the latest thing that teams or
cities like to do on their Web sites is point a camera at a
ballpark, stadium or arena under construction and let fans with
computers watch in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, you become the security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The site's intent is to promote the new building and somehow
have people get excited as they watch it progress. But, in
actuality, how much is going to happen in a week, let alone a day?
The only time these kind of things make news is when a fire breaks
out, as it has in a new Miami arena and one recently at the Staples
Center in Downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Of the half-dozen Major League Baseball ballparks going up as we
speak _ with more in the planning stages _ the San Francisco Giants
and Seattle Mariners have come up with what amounts to the two best
hard-hat sites.
</P>
<P>
   On the Giants' site (http://www.sfgiants.com/
PACBELL(underdash)PARK/LIVECAM/livecam.html), there's an Internet
video system in place that updates the picture so fast, it's as if
you're watching a live shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' site (http://www.mariners.org/), after directing
you to Microsoft's Seattle Sidewalk (http://seattle.sidewalk.com/
safecofieldwebcam), doesn't update the picture quite as quickly,
but the up-to-the-minute updates are still turning over faster than
most.
</P>
<P>
   Of the others, Web cameras on the sites for Milwaukee
(http://www.milwaukeebrewers.com/news/millcam.html), Detroit
(http://www.detroittigers.com/) and Houston
(http://houston.sidewalk.com/ballpark) are pretty standard fare.
But they do allow for mischief to be spotted and, if the clicker is
so inclined, notify the team that their project is going up in
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's site (http://piratesball.com/PNCPark/index.html)
doesn't have its camera up yet. And San Diego's site
(http://padres.com/) has only a model of the proposed new ballpark.
So you can watch to see if the glue comes loose.
</P>
<P>
   _Online voting for the July 13 Major League Baseball All-Star
Game in Boston can be found at several places, but most easiest at
baseball's site (http://allstarvote. majorleaguebaseball.com),
which is specifically designed for this event.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, online balloting accounted for more than a
half-million votes. This year's online balloting ends June 27.

YUGOSLAVIA SENDING FRESH TROOPS TO ALBANIAN BORDER
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ As NATO enters its third month of air
attacks, the Yugoslav military is sending fresh troops into Kosovo
to reinforce positions near the border with Albania, alliance
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The move suggests that the Yugoslav military is still able and
determined to maintain its hold on Kosovo and to continue its
battle to drive armed ethnic Albanian rebels from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Serbs are being battered by round-the-clock air
strikes, which NATO leaders insist are disabling the Yugoslav
military, the dispatch of reinforcements apparently reflects a
decision by President Slobodan Milosevic to try to ride out the
bombing in hopes of negotiating better terms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic still seems bent on being able to get a diplomatic
deal that enables him to declare victory to his people rather than
yielding directly to NATO's demands and withdrawing his forces from
Kosovo, where more than 1 million ethnic Albanians have been driven
from home since NATO began bombing on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no sign of withdrawal,'' said NATO's military
spokesman, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz of Germany. ``The contrary is
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The border region where NATO officials have observed
reinforcements has been the scene of intense fighting between the
Serbian military and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the force of
ethnic Albanian partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces have been trying to seal the border with
minefields and troops to prevent the rebels from sending men and
supplies into Kosovo from their bases in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There are between 6,000 and 10,000 Albanian partisans inside
Kosovo, according to allied intelligence. The rebel fighters hide
out in mountainous regions in north-central and south-central
Kosovo. Recently, they took the village of Produc near the town
Podujevo in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs' campaign of driving ethnic Albanians from their
homes and then burning hundreds of villages has deprived the Kosovo
Liberation Army of its base of popular support and left them short
of supplies, including food.
</P>
<P>
   That has made it all the more important for the Kosovo
Liberation Army to keep open supply lines into Kosovo from Albania.
Aside from an incident in which allied warplanes on Friday bombed a
Yugoslav army border post captured by the rebels weeks earlier,
NATO's air strikes appear to have helped the rebels keep those
vital lines working.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official relationship between NATO and the Albanian
partisans, but rebel leaders have said their men provide NATO with
information on Serbian positions. Allied air strikes against
Serbian armor, artillery and troops have worn down the Serbs'
ability to strike against the rebels, and forced them to dodge air
strikes by hiding hardware, and thus eased the pressure on the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the alliance plans a series of meetings to decide
whether to prepare a force totaling some 50,000 troops to go into
Kosovo to keep a negotiated peace. Within three weeks, alliance
officials have said, NATO will face a decision about whether to
prepare a ground force powerful enough to invade the province and
return the hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to Kosovo
before the onset of the harsh Balkan winter.

`STAR WARS' FANS GIVE `MENACE' A LITTLE LESS FORCE THAN EXPECTED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ That George Lucas film, in its first five days,
broke a box office record or two and performed just fine. But
expectations were dashed that what is perhaps the most eagerly
awaited movie ever made would somehow turn into a bonanza that
would crush every previous blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' has turned into,
pardon the expression, just another successful movie.
</P>
<P>
   In its opening days the long-awaited Lucas prequel, which has
become a cultural and media happening, took in a five-day record
$102.7 million at the box office, according to 20th Century Fox,
the distributor. But the movie failed to top the three-day weekend
record set by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' which reached
$72.2 million over the Memorial Day weekend in 1997. ``The Phantom
Menace'' grossed an estimated $61.8 million over this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But there were expectations among rival studio executives that
Lucas' 130-minute, $115 million science fiction epic could reach
$120 million or $130 million in its first five days and start
zooming toward breaking the box office record for James Cameron's
``Titanic'' (1997). That film, which has grossed $600 million
domestically and $1.8 billion around the world, is not, based on
the early evidence, expected to be surpassed by ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of the Exhibitor Relations Co.,
which monitors box office performance, said, ``Despite expectations
that had hugely inflated numbers, the numbers that came in are
quite amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Tom Sherak, chairman of the 20th Century Fox Domestic
Film Group, which released the movie, said Sunday: ``This was never
about setting records. It was about getting fans in first, followed
by families. It was planned that way. And that's what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he in any way disappointed? ``Absolutely, positively,
unequivocally no,'' Sherak said. ``People are crazy who say it's a
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before the film opened, studio executives said its
box office success was review-proof. But the negative reviews of
many critics may have hurt the box office figures a bit, even in
the film's opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the dazzling critical response to the first
``Star Wars,'' which opened almost 22 years to the day before
``Menace,'' many reviewers of the current film praised the action
sequences and special effects, but found the acting wooden and the
plot confusing and said there was a lack of emotional involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disappointment,'' David Ansen said in Newsweek. ``A big
one.'' In The Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan called the film ``a
considerable letdown,'' and Todd McCarthy in Variety said it was
``easily consumable eye candy, but it contains no nutrients for the
heart and mind.'' Anthony Lane in The New Yorker called it
``childishly unknowing and rotten with cynicism.'' But Janet Maslin
in The New York Times said it ``offers a happy surprise: it's up to
snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Radley, president of Lucas Film, discounted the general
impact of critics. ``The wonderful thing about movies is it's a
people's medium,'' he said. ``The only critic that counts is the
individual moviegoer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherak said: ``People say the movie is review-proof. I say:
`Hey, it's ``Star Wars.'' It's only a movie. Have fun.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas will, by all accounts, have the most fun. As the creator
and financier of the film, he could earn as much as $2 billion of
profit as a result of his royalties from not only the movie but
also the toys, books, video games, plastic figurines, toothbrushes
and whatnot. ``Phantom Menace'' is only the first part of a
trilogy. Lucas has already begun working on ``Episode II,'' set for
2002. ``Episode III'' is scheduled for 2005. Twentieth Century Fox,
in releasing ``Menace,'' expects to earn about $100 million as its
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   One Hollywood executive, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the huge sum assured to Lucas was dismaying because
the studio system would not benefit from it. With blockbusters like
``Titanic'' or ``Jurassic Park,'' the hundreds of millions of
dollars earned were plowed back into their studios for more films.
By contrast, Lucas takes his fortune to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Radley, the Lucas Film president, insisted that no one at the
company was consumed with setting box office records. Nonetheless,
the promotion machinery for the film has accelerated nonstop in
recent weeks, and the normally reticent Lucas has gone out of his
way to discuss the film on television and in newspapers and
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said the studio had actually spent less promoting
``Phantom Menace'' up to its opening day than other recent
blockbusters like ``Independence Day'' and ``Titanic.'' The reason?
Newspapers, magazines and, mostly, television provided
extraordinary coverage.
</P>
<P>
   It cost about $30 million to open a blockbuster like
``Titanic.'' Fox executives said the promotion of the new ``Star
Wars'' had cost about $15 million so far. There was surprisingly
little paid advertising in large newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla around the movie may have hurt it a bit, Fox
executives said. Some adults seem to have stayed away from theaters
showing ``Phantom Menace'' because of all the news reports about
large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Radley said he was not especially disappointed that Loews
Cineplex Entertainment had decided not to play the film at its
theaters in Manhattan because of a longstanding dispute over not
paying a ``floor,'' or minimum percentage of the box office, to the
studio. A result was that ``Phantom Menace'' failed to appear at
some of Manhattan's choice theaters, including Sony's Lincoln
Square, the nation's top-grossing movie house.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Phantom' opened on a nonholiday weekend,'' Radley said,
``and we didn't put it in every possible theater we could. It was
about presentation and ultimately creating an experience that
people could enjoy together.''
</P>
<P>
   What was Lucas' reaction? He is taking a vacation with his
children and writing the sequel to ``Phantom Menace.''

PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION EXPECTED TO ENDORSE ONE FORM OF RESEARCH
USING EMBRYOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mary., Wis.) (rk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six months of deliberation, a presidential commission is
close to recommending that scientists supported by federal grants
should be allowed to conduct a specific kind of research on
abandoned human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is also likely to urge that Congress not block
such research, as it has done for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The research would be limited to deriving from the embryos the
primordial cells, known as embryonic stem cells, from which all the
tissues and organs of the body develop. The embryos, which consist
of a tiny blob of cells a few hours after fertilization, are
created in a fertility clinic procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, known as the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission, is stepping into a turbulent side issue of the abortion
debate. Researchers and patients' advocacy groups have argued that
the study of these cells will lead to substantial medical benefits,
possibly including the direct implantation of the cells to replace
the tissues lost in Parkinson's and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of abortion, including many members of Congress,
object to the federal financing of any research that requires the
destruction of a human embryo. The commission's decision, likely to
be made at a meeting next month, was first reported Sunday in The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells were first isolated from embryos last
November by James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin. Thomson's
research was legal because he used private funds. Congress,
however, has barred the use of federal funds for any research in
which an embryo is destroyed, and most biomedical researchers
receive all or much of their support from the National Institutes
of Health, a federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The question then arose as to whether federally financed
researchers could make use of Thomson's cells even though they are
prohibited from deriving them. President Clinton, prompted by
Thomson's advance and the creation of a human-cow hybrid cell,
asked the commission to review the use of embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Harriet Rabb, general counsel of the Department of
Health and Human Services, issued an opinion that it would be
permissible for researchers to work on human embryonic stem cells,
although not to derive them. She said that because the cells could
not by themselves develop into a human being, they could not be
considered embryos and so did not fall under the congressional ban.
</P>
<P>
   That position did not sit well with opponents of abortion.
Members of the House Pro-Life Caucus declared that the general
counsel's decision ``would violate both the letter and spirit of
the federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   The President's bioethics commission also seems to have been
uncomfortable with the idea that using the cells could be
acceptable if deriving them was not. Eric Meslin, the commission's
executive director, said Sunday that the commission ``has
considered the ethical arguments that would distinguish use from
derivation, and my sense is that they are not yet fully persuaded
that an ethical distinction can be drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is therefore likely to recommend that federally
supported researchers be allowed both to derive and to use the
embryonic stem cells, even though it ``has not taken a position on
the specifics of what any recommendation would be,'' Meslin said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission discussed only the derivation of stem cells and
has not considered other possible kinds of research on human
embryos, Meslin said.
</P>
<P>
   Background documents prepared by the commission's staff, but not
yet endorsed by the commission itself, suggest that in their
discussions members have seen an irreconcilable difference between
the holders of two ethical views: those who regard an embryo as
having moral rights equivalent to those of a person, and those who
respect the medical values of health, prevention and research.
</P>
<P>
   Though consensus may be impossible, the commission's background
documents argue that a reasonable compromise would be to let
stem-cell research proceed under safeguards that embody respect for
the embryo. The documents argue that the congressional ban has
discouraged the development of a coherent public policy on embryo
research.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the commission decides at its June meeting to permit the
derivation of stem cells from embryos, opponents seem likely to
pursue their case in Congress, which must approve the ban each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Doerflinger, associate director for policy development
at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that the
probable decision ``is hardly unexpected, since I don't think there
is any member of the commission that shares the Catholic
conference's view about the moral status of the embryo.'' But, he
added, ``There are people in Congress who do.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health is preparing guidelines
covering the use of Thomson's cells and of similar cells derived
from fetal tissue by John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University.
Federally supported researchers cannot use either until the
guidelines are approved.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear if the National Institutes of Health will
proceed to issue its guidelines if Congress should again attach its
ban to the agency's annual appropriations bill.

   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The mood in the city. It is
weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism. The
citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week, feel
they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame at
what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the
obvious. By Stephen Erlanger.

throne, is 75. At a time when leaderships are changing and passing
to a younger generation elsewhere in the Middle East, the prospect
of a continuing gerontocracy is beginning to provoke open concern
among businessmen, politicians and even members of the royal family
and Saudi Arabia's allies. By Douglas Jehl.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Teens, teachers and the last days of school
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This column is for readers without any
teenagers of their own. So that no one feels left out of the annual
``school's almost out'' frenzy, I shall generously share my kids
with you. I have 60 of them and they're all in the 8th grade. I
teach English. It's not a pretty job, but somebody's gotta' do it.
</P>
<P>
   It's Monday morning. My partner and I are working the day watch
out of . . . . Sorry. Scratch the Dragnet scenario. It happens
every year at this time when teachers and reality threaten to part
company. I'll try again.
</P>
<P>
   It's Monday morning. My colleagues and I are working the 'shorts
watch' here in Gibsonburg Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   The handbook insists no shorts will be worn before their time,
May 1st, and when they are, they will be mid-thigh. This is tricky
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bitsy, you and your too-short shorts are excused to the
office.'' That's me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?'' That's Bitsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mid-thigh is the rule, and unless your thighs have risen
during the night, you're out of compliance. Go see the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   She will not go quietly into the hall. Instead she huffs and
whines, ``How come teachers never send any guys to the office? Why
don't they ever get
</P>
<P>
   picked on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at these guys,'' I explain. ``Can anyone spot a thigh?
Heck, for all we know, they don't even have knees.'' Denny, a
squarely-constructed brute of a lineman on the middle school
football team, breaks into a big grin. I use him as an example
because he can take it. ``Look at Denny. Check out those shorts.
They're pup tent size with a drawstring waist. Could I send
something that pitiful looking to the office?''
</P>
<P>
   Denny and his ``cool'' buddies think that's pretty funny, but
Bitsy shall not be assuaged. She mutters something about dress
codes being dumb and she doesn't understand why we have to have
them anyway. I'm tempted to tell her the truth (to ensure kids
without good sense don't gross us out by coming to school with
various, and possibly pierced, body parts blowing in the wind).
Instead I give her the same answer I gave last week, and the week
before that. ``Teachers love the raw power of being able to bust
kids for absolutely no reason at all.'' Bitsy flounces out.
</P>
<P>
   As I linger a moment over attendance sheets, Bobby who has been
kicked-back on the old plaid sofa comes to life. ``Can't we just
have a fun day today, Ms. Schuett?'' One of his seat-mates chimes
in explaining that since there are only 12 days of school left,
kids should be allowed to stop work now so they can rest up for
summer vacation. Says he thinks he read it somewhere in the
handbook.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them they can rest when they're old but in the meantime
they have essays due. Groans all around and Danny accuses me of
being the meanest teacher in the building. I remind him it was my
major in college.
</P>
<P>
   So, in spite of balmy breezes and sunny skies, it's business as
usual. Rough drafts are pulled out of folders and propped up next
to humming computers. Soon the clack of the old keyboards assures
me learning is taking place. I slip a Mozart disk into the CD
player and for a brief moment, I feel like the conductor of a
finely tuned symphony orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's wail snaps me back to reality: ``Ms. Schuett, my mouse
has no ball. I can''t write.'' I remind him there's always pen and
paper. Miraculously, the mouse ball re-appears. Probably from his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Bitsy's back wearing baggy sweats and an attitude. She's made a
decision. She's not going to finish her essay, and as soon as she
turns 16 she's going to quit school and become a professional beach
volleyball player. I tell her that's a great idea and ask if she's
made plans for when she outgrows her bikini. She glowers.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, I double-check my desk calendar. It's still 12
days.
</P>
<P>
   It's Monday. My partner and I are on day watch out of....

AFTER POISONOUS OVERFLOW IN SPAIN, TOXICITY IS MOVING THROUGH THE
FOOD CHAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   AZNALCAZAR, Spain _ Jose Antonio Alvarez tours his domain, his
voice breaking as he recalls the poisonous black mud that surged
from the river and rolled across his farm in an unstoppable tide.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the land that produced peaches, plums and
vegetables was inundated with an acid sludge, heavy with cadmium,
lead and arsenic. ``Everything is now dead or ripped out,'' he
said, walking the terrain that is now barren. ``We're forbidden to
grow anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one year since the waste reservoir of a nearby zinc mine
burst open and more than a billion gallons of toxic slurry poured
through the breach into the Guadiamar River, flooding hundreds of
farms, including that of Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   The noxious flow skirted the wetlands of Coto de Donana, on the
coast of southern Andalusia, one of Europe's most important
wildlife reserves. Spain has no acute environmental conscience, but
the sight of the trail of destruction cutting through the landscape
and threatening Donana was treated as a national disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup crews have hauled away 12 million tons of the noxious
mud, along with topsoil and dead fish and fowl, and dumped the mess
in an unused quarry. The mine, owned by Boliden Ltd. of Canada, has
spent more than $52 million cleaning up, repairing damage and
reimbursing farmers for lost crops. The 20-mile-long flood area
looks fairly clean, except for the black mud stains marking walls
and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But a toxic chain has spread through nature that is less visible
and may be difficult to break down. High levels of heavy metals are
still embedded in soil and water and have found their way into the
wildlife. Some scientists say it may take years for nature to
return the area to normal.
</P>
<P>
   One trouble spot is the nearby Donana reserve and its buffer
zone, a kind of European Everglades that is cherished by many
nature buffs. In this mixture of swamps and woodlands, 300 species
of birds breed, feed or stop over on their migratory route between
Northern Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hastily built dikes stopped the toxic flood from entering the
reserve, but the contaminated water cut through the buffer zone,
and frogs, eels, lizards and insects have fed there. Those in turn
have been eaten by birds like storks, flamingos and ibises.
</P>
<P>
   A study of local geese, published in April, said 44 percent of
the sampled birds had high levels of lead and cadmium. In 22
percent of the birds, the contamination was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these geese don't die, they will have health problems,''
said Cesar Nombela, director of the Council for Scientific
Investigations, which did the study. ``It will affect their immune
systems and their young.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of the geese is seen as an illustration of the far
wider problem throughout the food chain. ``Geese are eaten by
eagles and lynxes _ it's a big part of their diet,'' said Miguel
Ferrer, a biologist at the Donana reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the contamination, Spain has advised the Scandinavian
countries to put a temporary ban on hunting of the geese, many of
which fly north for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But even that may not halt the toxic trail. Biologist said
predators far from Spain, maybe as far as Northern Europe and West
Africa, were likely to eat migrant birds contaminated in Donana.
</P>
<P>
   Such worrying about the wildlife angers the local farmers, who
feel they have a more immediate problem. They cannot cultivate the
once fertile flood plains that used to brim with orchards, rice
paddies and cotton and sunflower fields. Catching fish or river
crabs is also forbidden. Farmers want to know more about the future
of their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most troublesome is the arsenic residue,'' said Nombela,
discussing the most recent soil studies. ``We know very little
about how to remove it.'' Biologists are experimenting with
chemical treatments and hope to use plants to absorb the
contamination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the river valley, around the farming town of Aznalcazar, a
confrontation is brewing. The Andalusian regional government has
said it wants to turn the affected areas into a 70-mile-long
``green belt,'' plant trees to halt the erosion and create riding
and biking trails.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will cost $160 million, of which Andalusia hopes
one-third will be paid by the European Union. The regional
government has just announced that it will expropriate 10,000 acres
of farmland for its plan, which will affect 400 families. But the
farmers around Aznalcazar said they will fight the plan in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not moving,'' said Alvarez, whose land is on the
expropriation list. ``I'll keep the land fallow as long as it
takes. But I won't give it up. They're offering less than half the
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Moraira, a local farmer who is coordinating the protests,
said the ``green belt plan'' was a ploy to get money from the
European Union. ``The government's new love for the environment is
phony,'' she said, pointing to piles of garbage on public land.
</P>
<P>
   Eight towns dump their untreated sewage into the Guadiamar
River. ``Even as children we could never swim here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Upstream, the zinc mine has just reopened. The board of the
Donana reserve wanted to keep the mine shut. But the village of
Aznalcazar has lobbied hard to open it. The village depends on the
mine and its 500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A local judge is still deliberating who was responsible for the
spill, the Canadian mining company or the previous Spanish owner,
who built the waste reservoir that broke. And what was the role of
the government inspectors who annually approved what appears to
have been a faulty reservoir?
</P>
<P>
   The judge has made little headway. To reach a decision, the
court needs an independent technical report. But at last count, the
court said there was no money to pay for investigators.

ORACLE TAKES AIM AT TWO SMALL SOFTWARE RIVALS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investors, analysts and customers of the Oracle
Corp. have grown accustomed to hearing its executives make caustic
remarks about competitors. Usually, they aim their sharpest
invective at giants like the Microsoft Corp. and IBM or top
executives at those companies.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman and chief executive of
Oracle, and his lieutenants have directed their scorn at two
little-known neighbors in Silicon Valley: Siebel Systems Inc. and
Ariba Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Oracle, the No. 2 software company in the world behind
Microsoft, directed shots at two tiny rivals?
</P>
<P>
   In a word, growth.
</P>
<P>
   In its third quarter, Oracle reported that sales of its
applications, which big companies use to manage accounting,
personnel and manufacturing processes, grew 5 percent, down from 19
percent in the second quarter. Sales of Oracle data base software,
which keeps track of all of an enterprise's transactions like
sales, inventory levels and records, grew 10 percent, down from 26
percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, Siebel, which has seized the lead in
software for managing sales staff and service operations, had an 81
percent surge in revenue. At Ariba, a leader in procurement
software, which big companies use in purchases of goods and
services, sales were up more than 10 times, albeit from a
relatively small base.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares closed on Friday at $25.75, up 43.75 cents for the
day, but off by more than one-third from their 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that although Oracle appears well positioned for
the long term _ with strong Internet technology, and with the
recently distracted Ellison apparently re-engaged in daily
operations _ the company is under substantial short-term pressure.
Microsoft's SQL Server continues to eat away at the low end of the
market for Oracle's core data base program, Oracle 8i, which alone
contributes more than 70 percent of company revenue. At the high
end, International Business Machines' powerful DB2 data base
software has taken the lead over all, according to a March report
by Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley is also rife with rumors that Raymond J. Lane,
president and chief operating officer of Oracle, is about to leave.
Executives close to Lane have said that he is at the top of a short
list of candidates to succeed Lewis E. Platt as chairman and chief
executive of the Hewlett-Packard Co. after it spins off its test
and measurement business later this year. Lane joined Oracle in
1991 from the consulting firm Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, where he had
headed the information technology consulting group.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say that executive meetings previously run by Lane are
now run by Ellison or by Gary L. Bloom, an executive vice
president, who many believe is being groomed for the president's
job. Lane's departure would disturb Wall Street, which credits him
with saving Oracle as the company faced financial disarray in 1990.
Soft-spoken and direct, Lane has been viewed as the perfect balance
to Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was not available for comment, and other Oracle officials
declined to discuss his potential departure.
</P>
<P>
   Just before gathering at Oracle headquarters earlier this month,
several analysts cut their earnings estimates for the company's
fourth quarter, which ends on May 31. They said after the meeting
that they had heard nothing to change their views. ``Oracle
completely dodged questions regarding the current quarter and
probably successfully refocused people on the future,'' said
William Epifanio of J.P. Morgan. ``They're very cautious. They are
very uncertain about what's going to happen in the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   At recent analysts' meetings and user group conferences, Ellison
has said that his company will ``kill'' Siebel and Ariba the way it
``killed'' Sybase, Informix and Peoplesoft, each of which has
indeed suffered from a combination of Oracle's aggressive
competition and self-inflicted wounds. A new ad campaign that takes
aim at Siebel is reminiscent of a 1980s ad that portrayed an aerial
dogfight in which Oracle sent the Ashton-Tate Corp., maker of
dBase, flaming to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that with sales of Oracle's traditional back-office
applications, like those for accounting and personnel slowing, the
move to front-office programs, like sales-force automation, is
logical. Along those lines, SAP of Germany, the leading producer of
back-office software, with application sales several times
Oracle's, has announced a new suite of front-office programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle has been rolling out a mixture of homegrown and
acquired front-office products since 1995 with little to show for
it. And early evaluations of Oracle's latest
customer-relationship-management software, released this month, say
it does not measure up to competitors' products. Oracle customers
with long memories may remember other category-killer announcements
that did not pan out, like Oracle Documents, which was positioned
as a Lotus Notes killer, and Oracle Power Objects, which was
supposed to kill Powersoft, a popular product, now owned by Sybase,
that is used by programmers to create applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Oracle's offerings differed from those of Siebel
and other vendors by their breadth and integration and by their use
of Internet technology. Oracle offers a suite of programs covering
everything from acquiring customers to managing service calls, and
they can all be operated from a simple Web browser, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only ones in the world with a complete CRM suite,''
Ellison said of customer-relationship-management software. ``Just
as SAP unified the back office with a suite of products, we will
integrate the front office, beat Siebel tactically and beat SAP
strategically.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to a May 7 report by the Gartner Group, Oracle's
products for managing customer relationships ``are too immature and
untested for most moderate and conservative companies, and too weak
for aggressive companies.'' Wendy Close, who wrote the report for a
group of 19 analysts, said Oracle was unwilling or unable to
furnish customers to interview who were using the programs in
production. ``Just because you spend some marketing dollars, and
have your CEO talk about it, doesn't mean you have a decent product
or reference-able customers,'' Ms. Close said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison brushed off the report's conclusions. ``The good news is
our front-office stuff is new, all Internet-based; the bad news is
it's new,'' he said. ``We're the only CRM vendor that integrates
Web selling with call-center selling with field-sales selling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas M. Siebel, chairman and chief executive of Siebel,
disputed his assertions. ``Every competent person who has looked at
what they're proposing to ship has concluded that there's nothing
there,'' he said. ``The fact of the matter is, outside of the data
base business and the consulting business, you will not find
anything Oracle has succeeded in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Siebel, a former Oracle executive who founded his company in
1990, said Ellison's attacks had prompted him to start bundling
Siebel's applications with IBM's DB2 data base rather than with
Oracle 8i, and he predicted other companies would follow suit.
``They're alienating all their old partners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Oracle's push into applications would seem to benefit
IBM, which has been heavily marketing its DB2 data base as a
foundation for electronic commerce. Companies like Charles Schwab,
Wal-Mart Stores and Macy's run their Web-based businesses on DB2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationships we have with Siebel, SAP, Peoplesoft and
Baan are very important to us,'' said Janet Perna, general manager
of data management for IBM's software group. ``Oracle competes with
many of these vendors on the application front. It's sure making
DB2 look better to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariba officials were unable to comment because the company is in
a quiet period before an initial public offering. But John
Ramacciotti, vice president for procurement at Cypress
Semiconductor, said he chose Ariba's software after evaluating
Oracle's offering, primarily for its ease of use. Cypress uses
Oracle's data base, financial-accounting program and other
back-office applications. ``The biggest issue with Oracle was the
huge amount of training needed to get anybody, even my procurement
experts, up to speed,'' he said. ``Their Web-based solution was
just a semi-friendly face on the same old bill of goods. It was so
difficult to use that even the people doing the demo couldn't use
it effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some analysts say it is still too early to count
Oracle out in front-office applications. Though its current
offerings may not be world class, it has substantial resources to
throw at the problem, and it has one asset that all the other
application vendors lack: its data base software. Analysts say
Oracle 8i remains an excellent data base management program that
has been thoroughly updated to work over the Internet, and indeed
it is the engine behind such high-traffic sites as Amazon.com and
Dell.com. By owning the data base platform upon which its
front-office applications run, Oracle has an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle, to win, does not really need to sell front-office
applications,'' said Curt A. Monash, president of Monash
Information Services of Cambridge, Mass. ``Oracle needs a big wave
of automation of front-office functions running on the Oracle data
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cameron of Forrester Research says Oracle has all the
technical tools needed to make great applications: the data base,
which does all the heavy lifting of transaction processing and
record-keeping; network computing, which shifts computing tasks
from the desktop to central servers, a must for Web-based programs;
support for the Java programming language that makes browser-based
applications possible; directory services, to keep track of
everyone using the system, and security, to protect the data from
prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is excellent,'' Cameron said. ``The question is
whether the people creating the applications will use all of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As companies shift their businesses to the Internet, he said,
there is a bigger opening for a new approach than for incremental
improvements. ``The challenge for Oracle is not to build a better
mousetrap to beat Siebel,'' Cameron added. ``The challenge is to
leapfrog Siebel and be part of the next round.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms will erupt over portions of the Northeast
Monday as an unusually strong low pressure system forges eastward
across southeast Canada. Initially, a round of steady rain with
embedded thunderstorms will sweep through the central and northern
Appalachian Monday morning, reaching the New England coast by
midday.
</P>
<P>
   After the rain ends, intervals of sunshine will develop over the
eastern Middle Atlantic states. As the sun heats the ground, and
overlying moist air, the stage will be set for severe thunderstorms
to form Ascending currents of air, enhanced by a jet stream
disturbance will cause a narrow line of strong thunderstorms to
ignite during the middle and late afternoon. Some of the storms
will produce damaging winds and hail. The region at highest risk
for severe weather will stretch from North Carolina to eastern
Virginia and southeastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, blustery and unseasonably cool weather will
plague the central and western Great Lakes Monday. Residual
moisture in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere will promote
plenty of clouds and spotty sprinkles across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Offshore breezes will cause unseasonably warm and sunny
conditions to persist in the Pacific Northwest Monday, though much
cooler air will arrive Tuesday behind a cold front. Meanwhile, a
pocket of cold air aloft near 15,000 feet will cross the
southwestern states, renewing the risk for spotty mountain
thunderstorms. Elsewhere, low clouds will obscure portions of the
California coast early Monday morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Rare Thunder
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, peals of thunder echoed across portions of
southern California, a very unusual occurrence during the month of
May. On average, May thunderstorms are observed at Los Angeles once
every 10 years. Thunderstorms are sustained from the instability
that results when air temperature decreases rapidly from near the
ground to high altitudes. Cold low pressure in the middle
atmosphere set the stage for the thunderstorms on Sunday. Monday,
the same low pressure system will progress slowly east, bringing
the threat for additional thunderstorms to Arizona and Nevada.

   Canon U.S.A., which has been nipping at the heels of the Xerox
Corp. in the market for expensive, high-speed copiers, is now
trying to bite chunks out of Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and Lexmark in
the market for slower, cheaper printers.
</P>
<P>
   After introducing four new printers with list prices well below
$15,000 three weeks ago, Canon plans this week to announce deals
with Ingram Micro Inc. and Pinacor Inc., two huge distributors of
computer-related products, to stock those printers and ship them to
dealers as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Canon says the move is for the sake of its own dealers, which
would otherwise have to keep the products in stock. ``The
distributor's markup is always less than the cost of maintaining
inventories and shipping products,'' said Tracie Sokol, a Canon
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is just the latest of Canon's steps to blow its
once-closed dealership system wide open. In February it stopped
granting dealers exclusive territories for selling its high-speed
digital copiers, opening the market for any dealer _ or for Canon's
direct sales force _ to sell and service the complex products
anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by using distributors that maintain huge warehouses of
products and can economically ship a few printers to a tiny store,
Canon is automatically expanding its dealer network to include
small dealers and retailers. Since the new printers do not need
installation or servicing, that list includes hosts of dealers that
were simply ill-equipped to handle Canon's more complex printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distributors can make Canon's products more widely available,
and that will help it be a major player in this arena,'' said
Edward Lee, a senior analyst at Lyra Research.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Canon's products nor its distribution represents new
ground for the industry. Hewlett-Packard and Xerox have been
flooding the market with products at every point in the price
range. They sell the expensive, sophisticated devices through
direct sales or authorized dealers, and they push the cheaper,
plug-and-play products through distributors. Canon's entry is not
scaring them much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distributors won't ship Canon products until customers start
asking dealers for them, and the dominant brand in the marketplace
is still H-P,'' said Tim Haney, a Hewlett-Packard general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Even Xerox, which commands less than 5 percent of the
small-printer market, is sanguine. ``You've got to spend millions
on advertising, direct mail and promotional pricing to get that
distributor's phone to ring,'' said Kevin A. Shea, a Xerox senior
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Canon may have a more delicate problem: Hewlett-Packard is its
main customer for printer engines. Canon may want to use its best
engines in its own branded products. And it will want to sell its
own brand of toners and cartridges, the most profitable products in
the printer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canon will be in a position to undercut H-P's prices on
toner,'' Lee of Lyra said.
</P>
<P>
   From Canon's standpoint, ``there is enough business out there
for everyone to happily coexist,'' Ms. Sokol said. But Haney, of
Hewlett-Packard, was a bit more caustic. ``Our printers come with
software and an ability to connect to a network,'' he said, ``and
those are a lot more important than the engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street mavens doubt that Canon's entry will alter the
pecking order in the printer market. ``It will not substantially
change its status in this industry,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no analyst dismisses Canon lightly. ``Canon has staying
power, and this will turn into a cat-and-dog fight,'' said Jack L.
Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

A BELGIAN FILM WINS THE TOP PRIZE AT THE CANNES FESTIVAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ Accepting his award as best director Sunday
night at this year's Cannes International Film Festival, Pedro
Almodovar (``All About My Mother'') thanked his fellow filmmakers
Atom Egoyan (``Felicia's Journey''), David Lynch (``The Straight
Story''), Jim Jarmusch (``Ghost Dog'') and Arturo Ripstein (``No
Letter for the Colonel''). Somebody had to do it, and this year's
jury was not about to. The jury was headed by David Cronenberg, who
at an early news conference had avowed a desire to favor offbeat
films. But the judges, including Holly Hunter, Jeff Goldblum and
the director Andre Techine, chose two simple, bleak films about
suffering as the year's big winners.
</P>
<P>
   The Palme d'Or, the festival's top honor, went to the quietly
devastating Belgian film ``Rosetta.'' It was directed by the
brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, whose only previous drama
was ``La Promesse,'' about a moral crisis surrounding the death of
an African worker in Belgium. Their work in documentaries is
apparent in ``Rosetta,'' which watches a stony, impoverished young
woman fighting furiously to get and hang onto a menial job.
``Rather than narrating the events, we tried to find the essential
movements of the character,'' Luc Dardenne has explained.
</P>
<P>
   Emilie Dequenne, an 18-year-old actress in her first film role,
was voted best actress for playing Rosetta with utter immediacy.
She shared that award with Severine Caneele of ``L'Humanite,'' a
film by Bruno Dumont that was the wild card this year.
``L'Humanite'' also won a best actor award for Emmanuel Schotte,
who plays a slow, saintly character responding profoundly if
cryptically to the world around him. Dumont, whose first and
comparably grim film was ``The Life of Jesus,'' also won this
year's Grand Prize (or second prize) for his relentless
``L'Humanite.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn and disturbing as ``L'Humanite'' is, its selection as
one of the big winners here came as evidence of how capricious such
awards can be, and how the pre-eminence of the festival seemed to
founder this year. Sunday night's ceremony was presided over by
Kristin Scott-Thomas, with Val Kilmer as Hollywood's main emissary
and the French actress Sophie Marceau so rambling that she barely
managed to present the Palme d'Or. Hollywood and European film
luminaries alike were otherwise engaged, just as the major studios
have been even less of a presence here than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other awards presented were a technical prize to Chen
Kaige's visually ambitious ``Emperor and the Assassin'' and a
writing award to the screenplay of Aleksandr Sokurov's ``Moloch.''
The jury prize was presented to ``The Letter'' by 90-year-old
Manoel de Oliveira, who accepted his award from Geraldine Chaplin
and seemed greatly moved.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira's name also came up earlier, when the French actor
Michel Piccoli jokingly tried to award him the Camera d'Or. That
prize is actually for a first-time filmmaker.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After decades of flops, $100 billion in costs and sharp rises in
the political stakes, the Pentagon is trying again to defend the
United States against missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' dream of zapping enemy warheads with orbiting
lasers, which President Reagan championed, is long gone. Instead,
the military leaders of the Clinton administration have seized on
an older, less controversial approach that is nonetheless proving
to be diabolically hard.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, if all goes as planned, a launcher on a 10-wheeled
truck is to fire a 20-foot interceptor missile from a test site in
the New Mexico desert. The goal is for the interceptor to speed
above the earth, pinpoint a mock warhead, zero in with a ``kill
vehicle'' on its radiated heat and smash it to bits by force of
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Since this approach was first proposed in 1976, it has been
tested a total of 16 times. Fourteen times it failed, most recently
in March. In two tests, in 1984 and 1991, the interceptors
succeeded in hitting targets. But congressional sleuths later found
that the tests had been quietly made less challenging and that some
results had been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say this record suggests the idea will never be
practical. But this would-be weapon still stars in a push to shield
the United States from enemy warheads. ``It's not an impossible
task,'' Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles of the Air Force, director of the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, insisted in an
interview, saying improvements in the program will prove the
critics are wrong. ``We just need to make sure we take all the bugs
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year North Korea fired a missile over Japan, helping stir
the current defensive push. But Republicans have also seized upon
anti-missile defense as an issue. In March, after the White House
yielded to pressure and dropped long-standing objections to
anti-missile deployments, the Senate and House voted overwhelmingly
for the United States to build a defensive system based on what are
known as ``hit to kill'' interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday the House reiterated that stance, approving a bill
passed by the Senate in March that calls for deploying the system
as soon as technologically possible. President Clinton is expected
to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether there is any reason to think the
weapon can actually work reliably and, if so, when a system might
be built. Congress is pushing for an anti-missile force to be set
up as soon as 2003 or 2005, and the Pentagon says that such dates
may be feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Lyles and other Pentagon leaders say that the run of testing
flops has forced major overhauls, and that in coming months feats
of interception will prove the weapon's feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say political considerations, including a Democratic
desire to deprive Republicans of a campaign issue, are triumphing
over scientific truth. They are concerned that with deployment of a
missile system, Washington might abandon the proven approach of
diplomacy and arms control in favor of a potentially false sense of
security backed by a faulty defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us feel good,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a senior
associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``But
it's just the illusion of protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the United States has sunk about $110 billion
into anti-missile arms and research. Successes have been rare.
</P>
<P>
   In March, in the New Mexican desert, the Theater High-Altitude
Area Defense, or THAAD, the most advanced interceptor the Pentagon
is testing against targets, was fired toward a mock warhead. The
6-foot ``kill vehicle'' missed its target.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Pentagon claimed success in 16 of 17 test goals,
though weeks later it sheepishly admitted that two of four was a
more accurate portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   This Tuesday, the same balky interceptor is to be fired again
from the White Sands Missile Range, probably to the accompaniment
of hundreds of crossed fingers. To date, since the early 1990s,
THAAD has cost taxpayers $3.9 billion. Its main contractor is
Lockheed Martin Corp., which was fined $15 million for the failure
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled system is but one of a small army of similar
defensive arms undergoing development. The culmination is to be a
large interceptor meant to shield the nation _ not just soldiers,
ships and battlefields _ from enemy attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Claims of Success, Series of Failures
</P>
<P>
   The hit-to-kill effort grew out of the realization, decades ago,
that a defense system based on nuclear warheads would do more harm
than good. Fiery blasts from interceptors tipped with nuclear arms
might destroy even distant enemy warheads, but they would also
produce huge bursts of electromagnetic energy that, like a riot of
lightning bolts, could disable electronic devices on the ground,
crippling the nation and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1976, the Pentagon sought interceptors so
extraordinarily precise that nuclear fireballs would be
unnecessary. The key was to be destruction by impact, just as when
two cars collide. Interceptor and warhead would hit at blinding
speeds and destroy each other.
</P>
<P>
   The rub was how to guide the racing interceptor. Ground controls
were too slow. So final guidance had to be done by the defensive
weapon itself, working autonomously.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's solution was to have the interceptor zero in on
heat emanating from enemy warheads. An infrared seeker and a tiny
computer would fire small jets, steering the hurtling mass of metal
toward sure destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The first test was in February 1983. A mock enemy warhead was
launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Thousands of
miles away in the South Pacific, at Kwajalein Atoll, an interceptor
of the Homing Overlay Experiment blasted off. Unfortunately it
missed the warhead by a wide margin. New tests in May and December
of that year also failed.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1984, however, an interceptor smashed a mock target to
bits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We successfully `hit a bullet with a bullet' for the first
time,'' Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson of the Air Force, head of the
Pentagon's anti-missile program, told Congress. The interceptor, he
added, had worked by zeroing in on ``a warhead with its inherent
heat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon had actually raised that heat artificially so
the test was easier, investigators at the congressional General
Accounting Office reported years later. The doctoring was done by
heating the mock warhead before launch to 100 degrees. And in
flight, the long warhead was instructed to fly sideways, exposing a
greater surface area to the distant heat seeker.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional team bluntly noted that dozens of public
statements by Defense Department officials had failed to mention
``the steps taken to enhance the target's signature.''
</P>
<P>
   The next hit-to-kill test, in January 1991, was also touted as a
major success. It not only demolished a mock warhead but was said
to have succeeded in ignoring two inflatable decoys. The ability to
ignore false targets is considered crucial in anti-missile warfare,
as foes are expected to scatter decoys and chaff around warheads in
hopes of confusing and defeating any defense.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators from the congressional accounting office
reported later that the two decoys had been tethered to either side
of the dummy warhead, and the interceptor's computer had been
programmed to pick out the target in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 another interceptor blasted off, only this time the
system was allowed to try to freely distinguish between a mock
warhead and a decoy. It missed both.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, all other tests of such hit-to-kill interceptors
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said John Pike, head of space policy for the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington
skeptical of missile defenses. ``If you talk about clean,
unambiguous, hit-a-bullet-with-a-bullet kinds of tests, they still
haven't done it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A $28 Billion Shield or an Empty Shell?
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the reliability crisis prompted the Pentagon to appoint
a panel headed by Larry Welch, a former Air Force chief of staff.
Its blistering report, issued in February 1998, found the failures
rooted in poor design and fabrication, lax management and lack of
rigorous government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Managers tended ``to trivialize the causes of these costly
failures,'' the panel said, adding that aggressive new test
schedules had joined with such callousness to produce a ``rush to
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, the next flight test of THAAD failed. So did its
next experiment, on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say the misses seem to be rooted in different
kinds of breakdowns, the diversity of which they call worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lyles of the anti-missile program said the
failures had been traced to things like dirty optics, broken wires
and empty fuel tanks. But a quality-control revolution, he
asserted, would soon end the troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard business,'' Lyles said. ``But I'm confident we can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's anti-missile program is soon to test the large
interceptor now envisioned for national missile defense. Its kill
vehicle weighs just 121 pounds and is less than 4 feet long _
smaller, and perhaps trickier, than THAAD's.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning around August, a 45-foot interceptor is to try to
smash mock warheads in a total of four separate tests before June
2000. The Clinton administration then plans to make a decision on
whether to respond to the congressional call and actually deploy a
network of at least 20 and perhaps as many as 200 interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of such a force has been estimated at up to $28
billion. Its interceptors, possibly needing to fly far to hit enemy
warheads, would be 55 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in an election year, with the White House eager to deny
the Republicans any chance to look stronger on national defense,
the decision is widely expected to be a green light. Construction
work at aerospace industry plants would also mean big money for
vote-rich states like California.
</P>
<P>
   The interceptors, based in North Dakota or Alaska, or both, are
to be able to destroy warheads launched by rogue nations like Iran
or North Korea, both of which are developing long-range missiles.
The system is also to have some effectiveness against an accidental
launching from China or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say any version of the plan would clash with the 1972
anti-ballistic missile treaty, which limits defenses in hopes of
discouraging costly new arms races. Washington and Moscow might
agree to an initial deployment in North Dakota, experts add, since
Russia already has a small defensive force. But a second deployment
in Alaska, they say, would require more extensive treaty
modifications to which Moscow might object.
</P>
<P>
   But many critics fear the costly project will be little more
than an empty shell. Even if the interceptor can be made to destroy
dummy targets, they say, an enemy might challenge it with real
warheads and feints of unexpected design.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Garwin, a physicist and anti-missile foe, said North
Korea _ long suspected of working on biological weapons, in
particular smallpox, a deadly scourge _ might load a missile with
hundreds of bomblets filled with lethal germs. The bomblets would
be impossible to hit, he said, and could be widely dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a clue about how to deal with that,'' Garwin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also note that enemies can always sidestep any
anti-missile defense by simply avoiding the use of ballistic
missiles. Boats, trucks, airplanes or cruise missiles could deliver
weapons of mass destruction to U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   The best way of dealing with all the dangers, critics say, is to
deter foes with the threat of swift and massive retaliation _ a
policy, they note, that has worked for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts, including some military officials, worry that
deterrence might fail in the future, especially with rogue states.
A backup, they argue, is increasingly needed and can be made to
work, despite the rash of testing failures.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Mark, the Pentagon's top scientist, recently gave what
appeared to be the administration's strongest thumbs-up to date. In
March he told the American Physical Society that there was ``no
question'' that the United States could and should build a
nationwide defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``By definition,'' Mark said, ``this is feasible.''

SOME SAUDIS PUSH FOR A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ The king of Saudi Arabia, long ailing, is
78 years old. His designated successor, the crown prince, is 76.
The defense minister, seen as next in line for the throne, is 75.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when leadership is changing and passing to a younger
generation elsewhere in the Middle East, the prospect of a
continuing gerontocracy is beginning to provoke open concern among
businessmen, politicians and even members of the royal family and
Saudi Arabia's allies.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that the monarchy's unusual system of fraternal
succession _ adopted by King Abdelaziz al-Saud before his death in
1953 to avoid violence among his 44 sons _ could weaken the kingdom
in what are sure to be difficult years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelaziz unified the kingdom in the early part of the century,
and power to date has remained among his sons, with Saud, Faisal,
Khalid, and now Fahd taking their turns in order of age.
</P>
<P>
   Many more brothers still await their turns. But age is catching
up with them, prompting many people in this secretively ruled,
male-dominated kingdom _ including even members of the royal family
itself _ to ponder whether Saudi Arabia needs to adopt a different
rule of succession in which power would pass vertically, from this
generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is consensus among the sons of Abdelaziz,''
Prince Talal bin Abdelaziz, 68, one of those sons, said in a rare
interview here. ``The real problem will come among our sons _ the
next generation _ if matters are not arranged now.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, Saudi Arabia could be ruled by a rapid
succession of septuagenarians at a time when oil prices have
foundered and the prosperity that has served to cushion political
dissent since the 1970s has shriveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you'd have is a bunch of leaders who, even if they had
lots of determination and heart, would just be plain old,'' said a
Western diplomat, showing that the succession worries the Saudis'
allies, too.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that more Saudis have begun to talk about succession
is a widening recognition that the era of King Fahd, who became
king in 1982 at age 61, has essentially passed. Since November
1995, he has survived several strokes and major surgery and now
moves about in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   People who have met with him recently say that he is in better
health than he was a year ago, when he underwent emergency gall
bladder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not stood up for more than a year, according to
Western diplomats, who say that his crippled knees can no longer
bear his considerable weight. They say he still responds politely
to conversation, but that some recent visitors have come away with
the impression that he is not fully engaged.
</P>
<P>
   And though Fahd still receives important foreign visitors, the
diplomats say most meetings are nothing more than courtesy calls
and that the real business is conducted with Crown Prince Abdullah,
who they say has been Saudi Arabia's effective decision maker since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Attention on succession has also intensified following the death
in March of Fahd's eldest wife, Princess al-Anoud, after a long
illness, and the recent deaths of King Hussein of Jordan and Sheik
Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa, the emir of Bahrain. Both of those Arab
leaders have been succeeded by their sons, in an example of the
generational change for which many Saudis seem to yearn.
</P>
<P>
   In recent conversations, at least six Saudi businessmen in four
cities independently compared the situation that their country
might face to that of the Soviet Union of the early 1980s, when
power was passed from one aging, infirm leader to another, and the
country was left with almost no direction.
</P>
<P>
   Across Saudi Arabia, people spoke guardedly, at first, about the
power sweepstakes that seem to lie ahead. Many noted that the
succession is the preserve of a royal family that acts prudently,
on the basis of consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Once assured of anonymity, some Saudis launched seamlessly into
analysis of the pros and cons of potential future kings, drawing on
the mixture of fact and rumor that swirls through informal personal
networks, rather than on the fawning and tightly controlled state
media.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the royal family, some senior princes are saying
this may be the moment for the family to agree on when and how
power should pass to the next generation. ``In the final analysis,
it will be practicality and realism that determines decision
making,'' said one such royal.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone in Saudi Arabia now seems to believe Crown
Prince Abdullah, still in good health, will be the next to take
power.
</P>
<P>
   And though he is not obliged to do so, Abdullah is widely
expected to name as his heir Prince Sultan bin Abdelaziz, the
75-year-old defense minister who has held that post since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   A full brother of Fahd, Sultan is said by associates to want
very much to become king. He has two elder brothers, Musaid and
Bandar, but neither holds government office and neither is seen as
a viable candidate. Since 1982, Sultan has held the title of second
deputy prime minister, ranking him behind Abdullah in the
governmental hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   What might happen next is far less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five of Abdelaziz's sons are still alive. Some are seen
as having removed themselves from the path of succession, but
others, including some not much younger than Abdullah and Sultan,
are believed to see themselves as contenders, still entitled to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   They include Prince Abdel Rahman, 68, the deputy minister of
defense, and Prince Nayef, 66, the minister of interior, although
neither man reportedly commands much popular support.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the names listed by prominent Saudis and Westerners
as attractive future kings tend to be those of younger men, who are
seen as better equipped to guide the country through what could be
difficult economic times.
</P>
<P>
   Those most often mentioned are Prince Salman, 62, a son of
Abdelaziz who has been governor of Riyadh since 1962; Prince Saud
bin Faisal, 58, a grandson of Abdelaziz and son of the late King
Faisal who has been foreign minister since 1975; and his brother,
Prince Turki bin Faisal, 54, who has been head of the Department of
General Intelligence since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Others seen by some as viable candidates in coming years are two
other grandsons of Abdelaziz: Prince Khalid bin Faisal, 68,
governor of Asir since 1977, and Prince Bandar bin Sultan, 49,
ambassador to the United States since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But Saudi culture places a premium on seniority. And in the
history of Saudi succession, it is only when elder brothers have
stood aside _ as one of them did in 1975, for example, to allow
Fahd to become crown prince _ that exceptions have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles in the way of the grandsons, who number in the
hundreds, are even more complex. As made explicit in a basic law of
government issued by Fahd in 1992, a Saudi king has the unilateral
right to designate and dismiss his heir, with the only criteria
being that he be a son or grandson of Abdelaziz, and that the
future king be ``the most upright'' among the candidates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That means that Fahd could, conceivably, designate one of his
own sons as heir, just as King Hussein did in Jordan earlier this
year, less than two weeks before his death.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, Saudis say, every member of the royal family
knows that such rash action could lead to bitter, even violent
division within the family, whose power is widely spread, with
various members controlling different provinces, armies and the
internal security service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prospect of passing the monarchy to the grandsons of
Abdelaziz raises questions of who should have preference.
</P>
<P>
   Should it be the sons of King Saud _ who was Abdelaziz's eldest
son, became Saudi Arabia's second king in 1953 and was formally
deposed in 1964 by his brother Faisal? Saud died in exile in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Or should the first choice be among the heirs of King Faisal,
who was assassinated in 1975 by a deranged nephew and whose sons
are held in particularly high regard?
</P>
<P>
   Should the chosen be the sons of King Khalid, who died in 1982,
after a relatively brief seven-year reign? Should they be those of
Fahd, who, after Abdelaziz, is now the longest-serving of the Saudi
leaders? Or should they be those of whichever future king decides
to reach to a new generation?
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is not clear enough,'' said Prince Walid bin
Talal, the billionaire Saudi businessman, whose father, Prince
Talal, is not seen as a candidate to become king, in part because
his open calls for limited democratization in Saudi Arabia have
long made him a dissenting voice in the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Prince Walid also said he had no political
aspirations. But he was also among a handful of members of the
royal family willing to say publicly that the system of succession
should be made more clear.
</P>
<P>
   He said of a future King Abdullah: ``I think he should
institutionalize and formalize the process of the transfer of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Without political and economic reform, many prominent Saudis and
Westerners fear, dissatisfaction with the royal family will grow.
</P>
<P>
   Since his debut as a leader, when Fahd temporarily transferred
full powers to him, the crown prince has earned admiration from
Western diplomats, who say that early worries that he may be less
friendly to the West than his brother appear to have been
overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Abdullah made a low-profile world tour that included
stops in France, the United States and China. At home, he has
enhanced a reputation of probity, in part by ordering other members
of the family to pay their utility bills, a first step toward
reining in chronic overspending.
</P>
<P>
   Many Saudis and Westerners regard Prince Sultan as an able,
experienced leader, but others complain that he has demonstrated no
capacity for financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
   When promised anonymity, many Saudi businessmen say their choice
to succeed Abdullah would be Prince Salman, the 62-year-old Riyadh
governor, whose hard-working habits are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Abdullah or Sultan, they say, a King Salman could
reasonably hope to rule for a decade or more in good health,
providing the kind of continuity they believe necessary to guide
the country through difficult times. By age alone, however, Salman
ranks just 16th in seniority among Abdelaziz's surviving sons, and
most people say he will almost certainly have to wait some years
for his turn.

GUESTS WILL JUMP FOR JOY WHEN SERVED FROGMORE STEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no frogs in Frogmore Stew. Good thing, too, or this
one-dish meal would create more of a mess than a mud-rassling match
atop Martha Stewart's coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, if Martha Stewart decided to serve Frogmore
Stew, she might have to saw a hole in the table and install a
bucket underneath. That's what they do in some restaurants in the
Gullah district of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A retired Navy officer, Al Wood, lives near St. Helena Island,
which was dubbed Frogmore by early inhabitants. We met Wood far
from his South Carolina home, on a cross-country skiing trail at
Jasper, Alberta. He seemed to sense that the author of a cookbook
called ``Gluttony Without Guilt'' would be a candidate for the
Frogmore Stew Appreciation Society.
</P>
<P>
   Essential equipment at a Frogmore Stew feast includes at least
two rolls of paper towels as napkins, a galvanized bucket and a
large appetite. Here is Wood's recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Frogmore Stew
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds unshelled medium shrimp (40 to 50 per pound)
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter pound of butter
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds of mild Hillshire Farm sausage cut in slices
</P>
<P>
   5 ears of corn, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds of medium new red potatoes, diced in large pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, diced in large pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   You could probably substitute any good brand of kielbasa or
other precooked sausage in the recipe. One bag of crab boil might
also be substituted for the Old Bay seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   What you do is to half-fill your largest cooking pot with water.
Add the butter, salt, crab boil, the pieces of sausage and the
onion. Bring this mess to a boil, then add the corn and potatoes.
Continue to boil for four minutes, then add the unpeeled shrimp and
stir-cook four to six minutes, or until the shrimp rise to the top
of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Turn stove off and let the ingredients sit for four minutes, or
as long as it takes you to hum two choruses of ``Carolina Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   With a perforated serving spoon, transfer the ingredients of the
pot into a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Furnish five guests with melted butter or seafood sauce as a
dip. Then let everybody attack the contents of the bowl. The shrimp
shells and corncobs go into the bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Wood says the above recipe is widely circulated in his part of
the country. The same is true of the following gut-busting dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I encountered it, the dessert was described as
``Bear Bryant's favorite mud pie,'' in reference to the late, great
Southern football coach.
</P>
<P>
   The same recipe, with different names, has appeared in two or
three community cookbooks we have acquired. Like Frogmore Stew,
this dish is awfully easy and awfully good. So don't put away those
paper towels quite yet. We can make a meal out of Frogmore Stew
and:
</P>
<P>
   Pudding Cake for a Bear
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   one-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   two-thirds cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   one-half cup milk
</P>
<P>
   one-half cup chopped walnuts
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons melted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Pudding topping (recipe below)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup boiling water
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour with the baking powder, salt and cocoa. Stir in
the sugar. Add the milk, walnuts, butter and vanilla. Mix
thoroughly, then plop this sludge into an ungreased, 8-inch-square
glass baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the topping over the cake mixture. Pour 1 cup boiling
water over all, and DO NOT STIR!
</P>
<P>
   Shove the dish into a preheated 350-degree oven for about 40
minutes, or until the pudding cake is slightly crusty on top. Let
sit for a while, then serve warm with whipped cream on top. Feeds
four to six.
</P>
<P>
   For the topping
</P>
<P>
   Mix together:
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter cup white sugar
</P>
<P>
   half cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   You can also throw any leftover pudding cake into the galvanized
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Except there won't be any leftovers.

WOMAN'S FASCINATION WITH INTERNATIONAL FOODS RESULTED IN A
COOKBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY ROBERTS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In northeast Seattle, Georgia Lord Watanabe discovered
the Mexican cactus specialty nopales on a store shelf on Lake City
Way.
</P>
<P>
   She found the Philippine fish sauce bagoong on 125th Street, and
on 80th Street, sweet slices of the Middle Eastern snack halvah.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's South End, she browsed through Southeast Asian
produce marts stocking fresh, 20-pound jackfruit and malodorous
durian the size of footballs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Beacon Hill neighborhood, she checked out lamb's tongue
and chicken feet.
</P>
<P>
   She spotted the Salvadoran herb lorocco in a refrigerator case
in Bellevue, the Lebanese flatbread lavash in a shop huddling next
to an Exxon station in Edmonds, Wash., and sheets of seaweed _ for
wrapping norimaki sushi _ in a big, Korean-Japanese grocery in
Federal Way, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, after visiting 100 stores or so, it really did
become an obsession,'' Watanabe said. ``It still is.''
</P>
<P>
   Watanabe has turned her fascination with international foods
into a book, ``Puget Sound Culinaria _ A Cook's Guide to Ethnic
Markets.'' The paperback, self-published from White Paw Publishing
in 1998, sells for $17.95 in area kitchen-supply shops and
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   In its 269 pages, ``Puget Sound Culinaria'' lists 92 ethnic food
markets in and around Seattle, from big, modern stores like
Uwajimaya in the International District, to its tiny, time-warped
neighbor, Yick Fung &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Listings are grouped by location, from Edmonds to Tacoma and on
both sides of Lake Washington, and each entry includes a brief
description of the appearance and inventory of the store.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband, Louis, a former software developer who now
manages the Northwest Asian American Theatre in Seattle, Watanabe
scoured the region for ethnic food stores.
</P>
<P>
   Her market compilation includes African, Mexican, Italian,
Scandinavian, Russian, Middle Eastern, Latin American and all
manner of Asian markets, from Pakistani to Filipino, Chinese to
Japanese to Korean and on through the cultures of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find out how diverse our community, in markets,
is,'' Watanabe said. ``I wanted to make sure I included as many
peoples as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   There are kosher markets, which observe Jewish dietary
regulations, and there are halal markets, which sell meats
slaughtered under Islamic law. For good measure, Watanabe included
37 ethnic bakeries, a dozen cooking-supply stores and some 30
recipes gleaned from cookbooks and family members.
</P>
<P>
   The most direct genesis of the book was a 1995 free-lance
writing assignment to cover a cooking class. Watanabe wondered
where the instructor bought some of the exotic ingredients. She
researched the sources and ultimately wrote an article about ethnic
markets in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting the focus to Seattle, where she lives, and expanding
the concept to a book were logical extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the roots of ``Puget Sound Culinaria'' go back much further.
Watanabe's father, Bill Lord, spent his career in the Army, and the
family lived in France, Germany and different cities in the United
States. Everywhere they moved, the Lords explored the local culture
and, most memorably for Georgia, its food.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers shopping with her mother in a French village,
bargaining for green beans, baguettes, cheese and fish. On Sundays,
the Lords would sightsee in Paris, where her father would treat the
kids to jambons, sandwiches of thin-sliced ham on crusty bread.
</P>
<P>
   Food acquired a significance for Watanabe. After earning a
degree in home economics from Cal State-Northridge, she worked in
research and development for food-processing companies in
California. She has taught cooking classes for children and now
demonstrates kitchen appliances part time at malls and department
stores in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always curious about what I haven't seen or smelled yet,
or cooked,'' she said. ``I'm intrigued by how the ingredients are
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get really excited just walking up Jackson Street (in the
International District) and seeing all that fresh produce. I want
to start grabbing it and squeezing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is very sensual. The sights and shapes and aromas are
irresistible to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watanabe, 50, and her husband moved to Seattle five years ago
when Louis was transferred here by the computer company he worked
for. Although Louis grew up in Southern California, his father was
raised in a Japanese American farm family in Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Louis, too, is an accomplished cook, his wife said, and together
they turn out an array of ethnic dishes: gnocchi pasta, pot
stickers, enchiladas, pancit and adobo from the Philippines,
Japanese shabu-shabu and teriyaki chicken, samosas from India,
couscous and tabbouleh from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent relocations of Watanabe's childhood meant more, she
said, than simple exposure to diverse cultures and cooking styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you grow up in the Army, you're always one of the new
kids,'' she said. ``I spent my childhood being a newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to know about people: where they came from, how
they came, how they adjust,'' she said. ``I feel a little affinity
with people who come from another place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of ritual around food, and how it's prepared,
and how it's served,'' Watanabe said. ``When people come here, they
bring that with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that that's going to be lost.''

 &HT;    Braves clubbed by Cubs again 5-1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Change all the locks. The Cubs just left.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves completed a brief but excruciating season series with
Chicago Sunday, again falling behind immediately in an eventual 5-1
loss that gave the Cubs three of four weekend games at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with a 1-2 series at Wrigley Field last weekend, the
Braves wound up 2-5 against Chicago for the year, the first time
since the franchise relocated in Atlanta that the Braves haven't
won at least three from the Cubs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played us great, I guess,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox
said, before the club embarked for Wisconsin and a four-game set
with Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Chose any part of the Braves' anatomy and the Cubs kicked it
over the previous 10 days, when Chicago out-hit (65-54),
out-homered (12-7) and outscored (40-23) them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taking advantage of every time they got runners on
base, when they would execute,'' said Gerald Williams, who played
right field for Brian Jordan, sidelined with a mild ankle sprain.
``They had timely hitting and played solid defense. That's how you
play winning baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mulholland out-pitched Atlanta too, allowing just five
singles and just two runners past first base before leaving with
two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it look easy,'' said Cox. ``That's the way we normally
do it, but we haven't been doing that lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Odalis Perez (2-2, 5.54) did nothing to improve his
portfolio, giving up back-to-back home runs to Jose Hernandez and
Sammy Sosa (his 14th) in the first inning and then a two-run shot
to Henry Rodriguez in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he was hurt again in the first inning, putting the
Braves behind 2-0 before they ever got to the plate. Of the 25 runs
Perez has allowed this year, nine have come across in the
opponents' first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got down five again today and that's hard to bounce back
from every day,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have followed up on a dreary 3-9 road trip with a
disappointing 4-3 homestand. Moreover, they lost five of seven to
the Cubs, who are just two games over .500 against the rest of the
National League. Mulholland faced three over the minimum through
the seventh and a crowd of 48,782 spent more time exhorting the
visiting team than the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened to us last season too,'' said Andruw Jones,
recalling a 3-6 record against the Cubs in 1998. ``In the playoffs,
we beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not by performing like this.
</P>
<P>
   TODAY'S GAME
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: Brewers
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 8:05 p.m.; County Stadium in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (3-4) vs. RHP Steve Woodard

 &HT;    BRAVES NOTEBOOK: Jordan sits out, may play tonight
 &HT;    
 &HT;    THOMAS STINSON
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian Jordan hopes to be back in the lineup in Milwaukee tonight
after sitting out Sunday with a tender right ankle. He chased a
ball deep into the right-field corner Saturday night, came out of
it lame and only therapy will tell if the Braves' most productive
hitter will miss more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty good,'' club trainer Dave Pursley said. ``We
expect to get him back out there. It's not swollen.''

   Jordan told manager Bobby Cox he was available to pinch-hit
Sunday but was moving slowly with a high ankle sprain and a sore
left Achilles' tendon. He was injured in the third inning of
Saturday night's game, when the Cubs' Lance Johnson sent a liner
into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan set up to field it off the wall, but when it kicked to
the right, his left ankle collapsed. He remained in the game for
four more innings, until the leg tightened and he asked to come
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball bounced off the wall, I rolled my ankle and it
popped back real quick,'' Jordan said. ``I kind of kick-saved the
ball and as the game went on, it felt like my Achilles' started
tightening up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday marked the second game Jordan has missed with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Cat sighting?
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez, who has kept in close contact with Andres
Galarraga, said the club's wayward first baseman hopes to visit the
team in two weeks and may even accompanying the Braves to Boston on
June 4-6 for their first interleague series of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling good, sounds good, the same Big Cat,'' Perez
said. ``He'll be here before the Boston trip and then wants to go
to Boston, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is over halfway through chemotherapy treatments for
lymphoma in his hometown of West Palm Beach, Fla. Other than two
visits during spring training and a brief encounter at the Florida
Marlins, the Braves have not seen Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   Re-arming
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz threw for the first time Sunday since being placed
on the disabled list last Monday. The half-hour session was really
an elaborate game of catch in the bullpen, interspersed with
conversation with pitching coach Leo Mazzone. Smoltz reported no
discomfort in his right elbow but was only throwing at 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing fell off,'' Smoltz said. ``My brain's still intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step comes Tuesday, when he will attempt to throw hard
in a full side session. Smoltz also hopes to test his arm with a
session of live batting practice, before the decision is finalized
to bring him off the DL for his next scheduled turn May 31 against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a super-complicated thing, but it's not an easy thing
either,'' he said. ``You don't throw for seven days and then you go
out there and try to regain your form.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker is quietly putting together a strong second month as
he evolves as the club's closer. Despite Cox's first inclination
that the would finish games by committee, Rocker has found steady
work in the ninth inning in May, recording five saves in six
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 appearances this month, he has been charged with one
earned run and four hits in 10 1/3 innings, while striking out 13.
He lost a May 7 game in San Diego by giving up three consecutive
hits, but otherwise has been spending his time well as an
apprentice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I produce over a long, long stretch,'' Rocker said,
``I'm still getting comfortable with my ability to get in the ninth
inning and get three guys out. But until I save games for a long
stretch, that's what really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker enters the Milwaukee series at 2-2 with a 2.55 ERA with
six saves and two blown saves.

MACROMEDIA PLANNING A NEW INTERNET STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The multimedia software publisher Macromedia
plans to introduce an Internet entertainment strategy on Monday
based on a ``media player'' program, similar to player software
developed by Real Networks, Microsoft and Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia has already popularized Shockwave and Flash as
multimedia formats that are widely used by a variety of commercial
World Wide Web sites for adding animation and sound to graphics.
Now the company plans to introduce a free Shockwave ``remote''
version that will enable individual computer users to locate and
play games, view animation and otherwise make use of various
multimedia material on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also developed a $19.99 Shockmachine player
software program with more features, including a larger format
display. Starting next month, both the remote and the player
versions will be available for downloading from a new Macromedia
site, shockwave.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the next natural step for Macromedia,'' Robert K.
Burgess, the company's chairman and chief executive, said.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess said that the Shockwave.com Web site would offer
original cartoons, comics, music and games, as well as material
from movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans on Monday to announce a number of content
partners including Time Warner's Comedy Central cable channel and
Warner Brothers studio; the Fox Interactive unit of the News Corp.;
Hasbro Interactive; Marvel Enterprises, and Mplayer.com, an online
gambling company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to step up what entertainment on the
Web can be,'' Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shockmachine player will use the Shockwave and Flash formats
for playing cartoons and interactive comics that can be downloaded
from the site. For video clips, though, the player will employ
Apple's Quicktime multimedia format.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of the company's existing multimedia tools,
Macromedia has grown significantly in the last year. Revenue for
the fiscal year, which ended March 31, rose 33 percent, to $149.8
million, from a year earlier, and profits grew to $19.8 million
from a loss of $6.2 million in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which was trading at less than $13 a share in August,
reached a 52-week high of $50 in mid-April. On Friday, the stock
closed at $49.50, up $4.1875 for the day.

 &HT;    Shooting victim's mom tells Satan to back off
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The mother of a victim of last week's shootings at
Heritage High School told Satan on Sunday to back off because he
can't win against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is mad at us and he is after our children, but I just want
to say that he is a lie and he is not going to get them,'' Felecia
Cullins said to a rousing standing ovation at the Church in the Now
in Rockdale County. Her daughter, Cania, shot in the knee during
the Thursday incident, sat in a wheelchair at her side and nodded
enthusiastically as the room exploded in clapping.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage shootings were the topic of church sermons and
after-service discussions throughout Rockdale on Sunday. Residents
used the time to thank God that the injuries were not more serious,
and to pray that no additional harm will come to their children as
they return to classes today for the first time since the incident.
</P>
<P>
   At a ``service of comfort'' Sunday at Ebenezer United Methodist
Church, clergy suggested the congregation tie red and white ribbons
around their car antennas today to show support for the students.
The service, which was attended by more than 200 residents of
different denominations, initially was planned to offer spiritual
support for residents trying to understand the war in Kosovo, the
shootings at Columbine High School and the recent spate of
tornadoes in the Mid-West.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear by their sniffles, tightly held hands and
comforting hugs that the incident in their own backyard was of more
concern to those congregated at Ebenezer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Martha Wright, Ebenzer's minister of pastoral care,
said at first she wondered where God was during the shootings. But
then she realized he was with Heritage Assistant Principal Cecil
Brinkley, who disarmed the alleged 15-year-old gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Father John Keiran, pastor St. Pius X Church of which the gunman
was a member, told his congregation that now was the time for
residents to reach out and help one another.
</P>
<P>
   Around metro Atlanta, one minister took the occassion to discuss
school shootings for the second time in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Randy Mickler, pastor of the 5,400-member Mt. Bethel
United Methodist Church, told church members trying to make sense
of the Heritage students that they must ask if they share part of
the blame. Church members across the nation, he said, haven't
reached out to people with problems and emphasized Bible-based
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are searching for affirmation, a sense of purpose
and direction,'' Mickler said. ``Who best to do that but church
people? (But) our witness is weak because of who we have become _
fat, lazy pew-sitters.''

ADVERTISING COLUMN: COCA-COLA'S FORMER AD PHILOSOPHER NOTES
MARKETING CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers might not have guessed, but the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales, had a profound effect on the marketing of
Coca-Cola in the days that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, New Coke was not the total disaster it has been
made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   And another thing: if the goal is to get people observing
Ramadan to drink their share of Coca-Cola, even though they are
fasting during the day, try marketing to them at night.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of insights offered up by Sergio Zyman, the
frenzied former marketing chief at Coke, the man both respected and
feared across the advertising industry as the ``Aya-Cola'' and
``Attila the Hun,'' in a newly published book, ``The End of
Marketing As We Know It'' (HarperCollins, $26).
</P>
<P>
   Zyman was one of the highest-paid executives at Coca-Cola and
was credited with revitalizing the company's formerly fusty image
when he left the company in March 1998 after a four-and-a-half-year
stint, his second with Coke. (The first ended in 1987, shortly
after New Coke was taken off the market.) At the time, he said he
would work as a consultant to Coke, write a marketing textbook, and
spend more time with his daughters, who are in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the book is a fait accompli. Zyman is a consultant
or director for more than half a dozen companies, including Cemex,
a large Mexican cement company, the Newspaper Association of
America and the American Tennis Professionals tour. Other clients
are Internet-based recent phenomena like Computerjobs.com and
Deja.com. (He yearns to become a consultant to the French
government, he added.) And the family life component _ well, ``The
End of Marketing As We Know It'' is dedicated to his wife and
daughters, ``for hanging in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone hoping to find the secret formula for Coca-Cola, either
the syrup or the stock performance, embedded in the book's 247
pages is in for a letdown. But Zyman does take the reader on a
whirlwind tour of his own marketing philosophy, which seems to be
an amalgam of the corporate and profit-oriented _ ``Never forget
that marketing is about selling stuff'' _ and the practically
devil-may-care, as in ``I'll try anything once.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ego book; it's not a telltale book,'' Zyman said
last week, between bites of a Cobb salad in the restaurant at the
Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan. He seemed much more relaxed than
in the Coca-Cola days, and politely batted away questions about
Coke, which, arguably, has had some marketing issues of its own
since he left last year. Zyman really wanted to talk about the
book, which he hopes will come to be regarded as a textbook, in the
tradition of David Ogilvy's ``Ogilvy on Advertising,'' for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The basic message centers on Zyman's belief that marketing is
the name of the game, whether the game is tennis or selling soft
drinks. ``The conventional view of looking at marketing today is
gone,'' he said. ``It is too important to be left to the
marketers.'' The book includes a discussion of how he wrested
control of Coca-Cola's marketing away from its principal
advertising agency, McCann-Erickson, because he thought Coke
executives ``need to be the ones driving the strategy and making
the decisions.'' He hired different agencies to handle various
campaigns, and insisted on paying them fees, rather than the
commissions that were the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing requires hard work, not alchemy, Zyman writes.
Marketers have become too absorbed with what he calls ``the glitz,
the award presentations, the jetting off to `do a shoot' on some
tropical isle, and they have forgotten that their job is to sell
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   To hide their failings, they make marketing into a mysterious
enterprise, when all it is, Zyman writes, is a science, with a
strategy. ``Spending on marketing is an investment that pays
returns,'' he writes. ``If you think that marketing is just making
eye-catching commercials and occasionally goosing up volume with
rebates and promotions, you're fried. You will never succeed.'`
</P>
<P>
   He looks to politicians for inspiration _ ``They are the
ultimate marketers'' _ and thinks children, as marketing targets,
are both highly impressionable and unreliable. ``They are the most
disloyal consumers we have today,'' he said. ``They will abandon
you in a nanosecond.''
</P>
<P>
   And he offers a spirited defense of New Coke, widely considered
the biggest new-product flop in modern business history. ``It
turned out to be a roaring success for Coca-Cola, because it
rekindled the relationship between the American public and Classic
Coke,'' he writes in the book.
</P>
<P>
   And he adds that he did not leave Coke after the New Coke
debacle because he was fired. Rather, he sensed the environment was
not going to permit more experimentation. ``I rejoined Coke in 1993
because Roberto C. Goizueta and M. Doug Ivester, who were then
running the company, decided they were ready to start moving ahead
again,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Good marketing includes keeping track of a market's mood _ at
election time, during holidays, and in times of upheaval or grief,
he believes. To wit, when Diana died in a car crash in Paris in
1997, he commissioned some quick research to find out what it was
that caused the outpouring of sorrow in Britain and elsewhere.
``She was the ultimate example of balance,'' he said, recalling his
conclusions. ``She was the jet setter who cared about the land
mines, and the adulteress who cared about her kids. She had the yin
and the yang.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to that research, he writes, ``We didn't run big ads
that said, `Drown your sorrows in Coca-Cola.''' Instead, ``we
adjusted our mix of ads to send a balance of basic messages, ones
that celebrated life and ones that suggested comfort and
dependability. The changes we made were subtle, but the important
thing was that we were looking, and listening, and learning, and
acting. And it worked.''

MUCH OF FEDERAL MONEY EARMARKED FOR EMPOWERMENT ZONES NOT BEING
SPENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Md., Mich., N.J., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly five years after the Clinton administration
chose parts of Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx as a special
target for economic development, the project has ground to a
virtual halt, with millions of dollars going unused. Federal money
is being spent at a similar rate in the six other cities _ Chicago,
Detroit, Baltimore, Camden, N.J., Philadelphia and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of an ``empowerment zone'' in New York's South
Bronx, Washington Heights and Harlem, heralded as one of the city's
most important urban-renewal efforts in years, has been paralyzed
by a cumbersome approval process and spotty support from state and
city officials, zone and local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   They say the problems are discouraging businesses from working
with the zone and may make future administrations reluctant to
invest in New York's inner city.
</P>
<P>
   When the zones were awarded in 1994, New York alone received
matching public money from the city and state. Pressed to show that
the zones had local support, the six other cities instead turned
mostly to private investment.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, have had problems with bureaucracy and politics.
Among them, according to federal figures, Baltimore has spent $18
million and Chicago $13 million, compared with $10.4 million in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials say it is private investment that best
measures a zone success. Detroit's zone, for example, which federal
officials rank as one of the most effective, has spent about as
much federal government money as New York. But a consortium of
banks there has also invested $1 billion in the zone, keeping a
promise it made to help the city win the designation. The auto
industry there has also played an active role.
</P>
<P>
   New York has leveraged far less private investment. Its most
visible effort is an $11.9 million loan to the developer of Harlem
USA, a mall rising on 125th Street that will create 500 jobs and
bring stores like Disney and HMV to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a lack of data, it is unclear to what extent
businesses in any of the nation's zones are using the tax credits.
Zone officials in New York say that some bigger businesses have
taken advantage of them, but that smaller businesses have had a
hard time maneuvering through the complicated paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
who championed the empowerment zones as an assistant secretary,
said he was pleased with the rate of spending, pointing out that
more projects have been approved but not yet financed. He said he
expected the pace to pick up in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has wonderful potential,'' said the Rev. Calvin
Butts III, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church and a community
leader in Harlem, where most of the New York zone lies. ``I can't
see a lot of what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   When the federal government began the program in 1994, it
promised New York and the five other zones (Camden and Philadelphia
are operated jointly) $100 million each over 10 years for loans,
grants and job training programs, plus $250 million each in tax
incentives for companies that set up in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   To help win the competitive designation, New York City and state
each promised to contribute $100 million, for a total of $300
million.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly halfway into the five-year program, just over $26
million of the city's share has been spent on projects, plus $9
million in administrative costs. The process is so slow that city
officials say they have spent no money for the zone this fiscal
year, which began last June 30.
</P>
<P>
   While the city can rebudget its own funds, it will lose the
state and federal contributions if it does not spend them within
the 10-year limit.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the program has floundered even as Harlem and the
South Bronx are on the upswing _ a turn credited to a strong
economy and to community development organizations that have
rehabilitated housing and lured back retail business and private
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Major zone officials, showing unusual candor about the program's
difficulties, said that such renewed interest by private enterprise
makes the zone's situation especially troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better get on with investing this money to meet the
business cycle that's here today, or were going to lose it,'' said
Deborah C. Wright, the president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment
Zone, the local development corporation that manages the project
for Harlem and Washington Heights. Ms. Wright is leaving her post
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of money has been frozen largely because each proposal
requires the approval of officials in three levels of government,
whose views often differ. And memories of past urban-renewal
programs _ in which buckets of money seemingly disappeared down a
black hole _ have resulted in what some say is almost paralyzing
caution this time.
</P>
<P>
   Zone officials attribute many of the delays to Rudy Washington,
the deputy mayor for Community Development and Business Services,
who holds the city's seat on the New York Empowerment Zone's board
and has begun demanding the right to approve every loan or grant
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials wonder if the city's caution masks its reluctance
to spend millions of dollars on neighborhoods that promise little
political capital for a mayor considering a run for higher office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been times we've scratched our heads and asked each
other, does the city want this to fail?'' said one official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing
neighborhood projects.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington said that that was not the case, and that he was
simply being careful with taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, the picture is complicated by complex and sometimes
volatile politics _ the layers of Congress and City Council
members, the different generations and classes, and the competing
ethnic and immigrant groups all vying for a piece of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to entrepreneurs trying to do things and I tell
them to contact the empowerment zone,'' said Richard D. Parsons,
the chairman of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. ``They say,
`God save me from the empowerment zone _ you get bogged down in all
that political foolishness.'''

 _ XOOM  
 Xoom Helps to Hatch the Peacock Portal  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Sometimes, Internet mergers can be stranger than fiction.
<P>
   Chris Kitze, chairman of San Francisco's Xoom.com, was hunched
over a conference table in midtown Manhattan late May 8, hammering
out a top-secret deal with NBC executives to create the mother of
all Web portal sites. One floor down, another hush-hush event was
in progress: Monica Lewinsky was rehearsing for her surprise guest
appearance on that night's ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Suddenly during the marathon negotiations, overhead TV
monitors flashed images of Lewinsky with a President Clinton
look-alike in a white robe. It is a common ritual at NBC to
broadcast dress rehearsals of the venerable comedy show throughout
Rockefeller Center on the evening of a performance.
</P>
<P>
   While some slack-jawed suits gave the boob tube a double take
and others chortled, Kitze _ undeterred by the negotiations and
history's most infamous intern _ plowed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro,'' Kitze says a
few days later in his San Francisco office, borrowing the words of
one of his influences, gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was hallucinating,'' chimes in Xoom.com spokesman
Roger Maes, shaking his head. ``The whole scene was otherworldly,
surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   But not bizarre enough to stop Kitze, NBC executives Tom Rogers
and Marty Yudkovitz and a herd of financiers from forging an online
juggernaut by 5 a.m. the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Internet (NBCi) _ to be based in San Francisco and headed by
Kitze _ is an amalgam of news and entertainment content from NBC;
Xoom.com, an e-commerce and community site; and Snap.com, an
NBC-Cnet virtual venture for searches and directories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; By combining all three services under the Snap.com name, NBCi
hopes to convert TV viewers into online users. It will offer them
everything from digital video clips of ``Seinfeld'' and other
``Must See TV'' shows to breaking financial news reports and free
e-mail and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the venture is the first to meld a major
broadcast network and a popular Internet site, a powerful
combination. An estimated 92 million American homes tune into NBC
at some point each week. America Online, the world's most popular
online service, reaches 18 million paid subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Xoom.com has quickly built its own database of nearly 8 million
users because it was one of the first sites to offer an appealing
mix of free e-mail, Web-building tools, chat rooms and online
shopping. NBC would dearly like to tap into those subscribers and
millions of other Internet users to sell them NBC merchandise and
garner additional advertising revenue. Think of it as the Peacock
Portal, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xoom.com has done an amazing job of building a huge database
of users without extensive marketing. Now with a huge TV ad
campaign and NBC's name, they'll be in people's living rooms
regularly,'' said Catherine Skelly, Internet analyst at BlueStone
Capital Partners in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first example of convergence of TV and the
Internet,'' she added. ``It will turn Snap.com and Xoom.com into
household names.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of Lewinsky cavorting with an ersatz President Clinton
seemed as unlikely a few months ago as say, little Xoom.com
becoming a linchpin in No.1 TV network NBC's Internet strategy.
Industry watchers peg the value of the new company _ which will be
the seventh-largest on the Internet _ at upward of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest imagination did I believe that NBC would
be our partner,'' the 40-year-old Kitze said.
</P>
<P>
   Xoom.com, one of the few popular commercial Web sites not yet
acquired, had spent the previous few months talking with a long
list of corporate heavyweights _ CBS, Microsoft, Amazon.com, AtHome
and AOL _ about a merger or partnership, according to Kitze.
</P>
<P>
   NBC was a late entry after Cnet co-founder Halsey Minor
suggested to Kitze that Xoom talk to the peacock network.
</P>
<P>
   Xoom.com, formed in late 1996, quickly grew into one of the
Web's most visited sites as a so-called people portal. Its nearly 8
million members use a variety of free services, such as Web-page
building tools, chat rooms and digital greeting cards. Consumers
also can buy goods off the site, ranging from Beanie Babies to DVDs
and software. Xoom.com went public in December 1998 and now has a
market capitalization of $901.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't tell by touring Xoom.com's pedestrian
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Kitze's spartan office typifies his corporate mantra: ``Make
money, don't spend money.'' There is a sizable tear in the shag
carpet near his $100 metal desk and a lovely view of some vents and
steam pipes outside his third-floor window.
</P>
<P>
   The only concessions to materialism are the lime-tinted iMac and
Lava lamp perched on his desk. His office's mostly bare walls are
undisturbed _ save for a pair of paintings of movie stills. Robert
Mitchum glowers over Kitze's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Seaside Hotel,'' Kitze cracks. ``I have good
taste; I just don't want to spend it here. This is not the Taj
Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Need further proof? Then saunter down the hallway of the
converted Bank of America offices to what used to be an executive

<P>
   Fortunately, NBCi doesn't share Kitze's frugal disposition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The new venture plans to pour $380 million into TV ads (all
on its parent network, of course) promoting its Internet service
during the next four years, including a marketing blitz during the
network's coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia. Pepsi, by comparison, spent $150 million on TV ads last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC's strategy is to do everything to have a major position in
the Internet,'' NBC chief executive Bob Wright said the day of the
deal. ``This (new venture) is a great way to pull (broadcast and
online services) together and hopefully get a great service
position in the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitze is more direct. ``This  &LR; is  &LR; NBC's Internet strategy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NBCi, which will employ 350 to 400 people in San Francisco,
marks Kitze's largest venture to date.
</P>
<P>
   The serial entrepreneur has started and sold three interactive
companies: Point Communications, a reviewer of Web sites; Aris
Entertainment, a publisher of interactive CD-ROM titles based in
Marina del Rey (Los Angeles County); and Creative Multimedia,
another CD-ROM-maker in Portland, Ore. Kitze also was vice
president of marketing at portal company Lycos, which acquired
Point Communications in a stock deal in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Xoom.com's association with NBCi that will touch most
Americans, according to Kitze.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the winners on the Internet will be the
ones with the strongest brand-name recognition,'' Kitze said.
``There are billions of dollars in brand equity tied into the NBC
name. You'll see a peacock at the bottom of every Web page on our
site.''

 DSL Beats Cable in Net Speed  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
When it comes to getting on the Information Superhighway, the phone
company may provide a faster on-ramp than the cable company.
<P>
   In an independent test performed by an Internet consulting firm,
Pacific Bell's digital subscriber lines provided a slightly faster
pipeline to the Internet &UR;  &LR; than a cable connection from AtHome Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote Systems in San Mateo tracked the two high-speed Internet
services and found that during peak traffic hours, DSL users were
able to access the Internet faster than those with cable modems.
Cable modems were faster during the day, but that's when fewer
people are trying to access the Internet, so those results have
less significance for home-users.
</P>
<P>
   DSL allows users to connect to the Internet over traditional
telephone wires at speeds up to 50 times faster than a traditional,
dial-up modem. DSL uses a special digital modem and requires a
visit from the phone company to install service.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modem service from AtHome transmits data via cable TV
lines at speeds up to 100 times faster than traditional modems. In
the Bay Area, customers get the AtHome service through TCI Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Both DSL and cable modems cost about $40 per month.
</P>
<P>
   The Keynote study found that in the evenings, when most people
are tooling around on the Net, Pac Bell's DSL service was 11
percent faster than AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither technology operated anywhere near their
advertised maximum speeds, said Gene Shklar, vice president of
marketing for Keynote.
</P>
<P>
   Using a DSL line in the evenings, Shklar said, Keynote was able
to download Web pages in an average of 3.55 seconds. With a cable
modem, the average was 3.97 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that cable modem service did perform more
quickly than DSL during business hours. But in the evening when
usage peaks, ``our figures showed that cable modem service got 8
percent slower,'' Shklar said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slowdown is that cable modems share access.
Instead of a dedicated line per user, as with DSL, hundreds of
cable modem customers can access the Internet using the same line
or ``node.'' The more people on the node, the slower the service
goes. The number of people watching cable TV doesn't affect the
speed.
</P>
<P>
   One reason cable was faster during the day is that cable modem
service is used primarily by residential customers, not businesses.
Many businesses don't get cable and don't have cable modems. The
cable pipe largely is unused during the daytime when people are at
work. In the evenings, when more people log on, it slows down.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies are working on ways to upgrade their systems so
that shared access is not as much of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although DSL outperformed cable in this test, industry watchers
said it should not signal the demise of cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are pretty good, and there's going to be an ecosystem
where multiple technologies _ DSL, cable, wireless, are all going
to coexist,'' said Jeannette Noyes, a researcher with International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said that while speed is important, what's going to drive
consumers to one technology over the other in the short term is
availability.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody can get DSL or cable modems yet. Cable companies
are in the process of upgrading their cable lines to handle
high-speed data. About 41 communities in the Bay Area can get
AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   DSL has distance limitations that restrict who can get the
service. A customer must be within three miles of the phone
company's central switching office to get DSL. By the end of the
year, about 5 million Californians should be able to get DSL from
Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only one is available, that's what a customer is going to
choose. After that, you get into issues like price, performance and
content,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Her research shows that by 2002, there will be about 4.5 million
residential DSL users and 8 million cable modem users.
</P>
<P>
   Shklar said both are viable technologies and a good choice for
consumers who want fast access.
</P>
<P>
   He said one reason why neither reaches its maximum advertised
speed is that the data being transmitted hits bottlenecks as it
travels to and from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the slowdown is not due to the quality or peak
capacity of your modem, but rather all the infrastructure behind
it,'' Shklar said. ``Both of these are incredibly good deals that
consumers should take advantage of.''

 Lawmakers Ponder Limits On Y2K Suits  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
When Andersen Consulting designed a computerized inventory control
system for Boston clothing retailer J. Baker Inc. 10 years ago,
both companies knew it might have a potential Y2K problem but
didn't think it was urgent.
<P>
   So J. Baker, which operates the Casual Male Big &AMP; Tall retail
chain, gave Andersen the contract to install the system and each
side dotted the I's and crossed the T's.
</P>
<P>
   But in June 1998, lawyers representing J. Baker threatened to
sue Andersen if the management consulting giant didn't pay the $3
million that it cost to fix the system's Y2K problem. Andersen
called in its own legal team and sued J. Baker.
</P>
<P>
   That case, said Andersen Consulting's Eric S. Jackson,
epitomizes the legal quagmire surrounding the Y2K problem. It also
illustrates why Congress is debating legislation designed to stop
frivolous Y2K lawsuits from clogging the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives on May 12 approved the Year
2000 Readiness and Responsibility Act. Backed by the computer
industry and business groups, the legislation would limit punitive
damage awards to $250,000, make plaintiffs wait 90 days after a Y2K
failure before they can file a suit, encourage mediation instead of
litigation and limit the ability of lawyers to file broad,
class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups like Consumers Union, Public Citizen and the
U.S. Public Interest Research Group are protesting the bill, saying
it would harm consumers who have legitimate Y2K claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was supposed to consider a similar bill last week,
but the debate was delayed by the more heated gun control issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said legislation is needed to prevent the court system
from being overwhelmed by Y2K cases like Andersen vs. J. Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some organizations that absolutely should be held
accountable for what they didn't do, but this should not be a
windfall for lawyers,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen and J. Baker agreed to drop their claims in December
after an independent mediator found Andersen had met its
contractual obligations. Still, Andersen racked up thousands of
dollars in legal bills and hours of staff time on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andersen is not directly involved in Y2K consulting
work, the company is using the case as a warning for its clients to
make sure they do everything possible to prevent Y2K foul-ups. That
includes fixing internal computer systems and determining which
vendors and suppliers may not be ready so that contingency plans
can be in place.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Reed Kathrein, a San Francisco attorney who
helped defeat two bills in Sacramento that also would have limited
Y2K-related lawsuits, said if companies follow those simple
guidelines, existing civil tort laws are enough to protect them
from frivolous Y2K suits.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrein, a partner with the law firm Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &AMP; Lerach, said companies should spend less time worrying
about their potential legal liabilities and more time trying to
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; Help for Small Business
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a ``Y2K
jump-start kit'' designed to help small businesses. The package is
available through the agency's Y2K Center for Small Business at
(800) Y2K-7557 or at  &LR; www.y2khelp.nist.gov. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are other Y2K-related Web sites for small business owners:
</P>
<P>
   _Small Business Administration,  &LR; www.sba.gov/y2k &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   _Telecommunications Industry Association's Year 2000 (Y2K)

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FALLING BEHIND
</P>
<P>
   A new survey last week showed America's biggest companies were
falling behind on their Y2K work. About 74 percent of large
companies surveyed by Cap Gemini America LLC said they expected to
have more than half their software codes tested and Y2K compliant
by January 1, yet only 55 percent had actually met that goal.
</P>
<P>
   About 72 percent of the companies had already experienced a Y2K
problem, mostly due to software programs that miscalculated
financial data for 2000 or beyond, according to Cap Gemini, which
specializes in technology and management consulting. And 85 percent
were planning to build Y2K command or crisis centers.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate Gallup poll, eight out of 10 consumers were
confident that they will be able to use their ATM and debit cards
after the New Year, while 79 percent expected Y2K to have little or
no impact on their personal finances.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THE LOW GROUND
</P>
<P>
   A company called HighGround Systems Inc. of Marlboro, Mass., has
launched a Y2K marketing campaign for software that manages data
backup storage. The company's public relations PR agency sent
journalists an official HighGround condom, along with a printed ad
with a picture of one that has sprung a leak.
</P>
<P>
   Among HighGround's list of Y2K clients: Siemens.

 ON TECHNOLOGY/BENNY EVANGELISTA  &HT;     How a Frog in a Blender Made My Computer Croak 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Serves me right for being a sadistic slob, for reveling as a
computerized blender churned an animated frog into a disgusting,
screaming swirl of green and red.
<P>
   That frog, sent via e-mail, also was the likely carrier of the
dreadful Chernobyl computer virus that melted down my home PC on
April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, computer experts said the virus hardly caused a sneeze
in the United States. Chernobyl inflicted far more damage in other
countries, hitting about 300,000 computers in China alone.
</P>
<P>
   But antivirus software-maker Network Associates Inc. estimated
that 11,000 U.S. computer users were Chernobyled, 80 percent of
whom were home computer users like me. So for us, the frustration
and anger of wasting precious hours and spending sleep-deprived
nights fixing the damage was all too real.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a chance that strains of the virus, which can delete
some or all data on a hard drive, could strike again this Wednesday
or on the 26th of every month following.
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl is ``one of those viruses that sits around and you
don't know you got it until the date arrives,'' said Yogesh Gupta,
a senior vice president for Computer Associates International Inc.,
which makes corporate-strength antivirus software.
</P>
<P>
   I feel especially foolish because four days before Chernobyl,
officially known as the CIH virus, was programmed to strike, I
received fair warning from Gupta's company and other computer
security experts that everybody needed to keep their antivirus
software updated.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was the nasty work of Chen Ing-hau, a 24-year-old
Taiwan resident who told authorities that he was trying to exact
revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Chen currently is serving in that country's military.
Personally, I hope he pulls latrine duty for the duration of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was timed to hit on April 26, the 13th anniversary of
the Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown in the former Soviet Union.
Strains of the CIH virus are triggered on the 26th of every month,
but experts say those versions pose a lesser threat to the public
because they had less time to spread.
</P>
<P>
   CIH affects Microsoft Windows operating systems and is passed by
executable files from floppy disks, e-mail attachments, internal
network servers and the Internet, according to the Computer
Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the virus overwrites the computer's system BIOS,
an expensive problem for laptop owners who have to replace internal
circuit boards, said CERT spokesman Bill Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most common file that spread the CIH virus was
frog.exe, known as the ``frog in a blender'' joke. The animated
program allows you to select various blender levels for an
obnoxious frog, all the way up to frog puree.
</P>
<P>
   I received the frog joke from a family member, so I didn't even
consider that it could be infected. I had antivirus software on my
computer but didn't keep it up to date because the free-upgrade
period for the software had expired.
</P>
<P>
   And part of me believed that those same software-makers who were
the object of Chen's ire were using another scare tactic to sell
their wares.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Melissa virus, which automatically sent itself
out to 50 e-mail addresses found in a PC user's files, was
contained fairly quickly after it was identified in March. A few
folks I know, including my boss, sent me Melissa-infected files
here at work, but The Chronicle's antivirus software stopped the
virus each time.
</P>
<P>
   So, lulled into a false sense of security, I forgot all about
Chernobyl until about 10 minutes after midnight on April 26, when
my PC crashed and would not reboot. A wave of panic splashed over
me like a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a tech head, and to me, my computer is like my car. I
can add oil to the engine but don't ask me to change the timing
belt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, during the next few days, I tried remedies suggested by
friends and colleagues, including an off-the-shelf crash-recovery
program. Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   I eventually had to wipe everything off the hard drive and start
fresh, including the time-consuming task of rebuilding the
operating system version by version, starting with the ancient DOS
6.2.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, important files like bank records were on a second hard
drive, which wasn't wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Even Computer Associates' Gupta, whose company now is offering a
free consumer version of its corporate antivirus software, once was
bitten by a computer virus.
</P>
<P>
   To recover, he said, ``it took us a whole weekend. I was working
until the wee hours of the morning. It's one of those things that
until it hits you, you don't really think about, and once it hits,
it's much harder to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I have my computer running again, I will try to keep my
antivirus program fine-tuned to hunt down any future bugs.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe one of these days, I'll get around to checking to see
if my computer is Year 2000 compliant.

YUGOSLAVIA SENDING FRESH TROOPS TO ALBANIAN BORDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds sixth graph giving Yugoslav troop strength and 600-word
addend regarding effects of bombing, involvement of Montenegro,
mobilization efforts and the surge in refugee numbers.)  (jw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ As NATO enters its third month of air
attacks, the Yugoslav military is sending fresh troops into Kosovo
to reinforce positions near the border with Albania, alliance
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The move suggests that the Yugoslav military is still determined
to maintain its hold on Kosovo and to continue its battle to drive
armed ethnic Albanian rebels from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Serbs are being battered by round-the-clock air
strikes, which NATO leaders insist are disabling the Yugoslav
military, the dispatch of the troops appears to reflect a decision
by President Slobodan Milosevic to try to ride out the bombing in
hopes of negotiating better terms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic still seems bent on being able to get a diplomatic
deal that enables him to declare victory to his people rather than
yield directly to NATO's demands and withdraw his forces from
Kosovo, where more than a million Albanians have been driven from
home since NATO began bombing on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no sign of withdrawal,'' said NATO's military
spokesman, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz of Germany. ``The contrary is
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO says there are about 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers and Interior
Ministry police officers in Kosovo. Jertz said he was not able to
estimate the precise number of fresh troops being sent in, but he
suggested that they were being used to replace soldiers killed in
allied air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The border region where NATO officials have observed
reinforcements has been the scene of intense fighting between the
Yugoslav military and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Kosovar
Albanian rebel group fighting for independence for their province.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have been trying to seal the border with
minefields and troops to prevent the rebels from sending men and
supplies into Kosovo from their bases in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There are 6,000 to 10,000 Albanian partisans inside Kosovo,
allied intelligence officials estimate. The rebels hide in
mountainous regions in north-central and south-central Kosovo.
Recently they took the village of Produc near the town Podujevo in
northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs' campaign of driving Albanians from their homes
and then burning hundreds of villages has deprived the rebels of
their base of popular support and left them short of supplies,
including food.
</P>
<P>
   That has made it all the more important for the Kosovo
Liberation Army to keep open its supply lines from Albania. Aside
from an incident on Friday in which allied warplanes bombed a
Yugoslav Army border post captured by the rebels weeks earlier,
NATO's air strikes have helped the rebel effort to keep those vital
lines working.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has no official relationship with the Albanian partisans,
but rebel leaders have said their men provide NATO with information
on Yugoslav positions. Allied air strikes against Yugoslav armor,
artillery and troops have worn down the Serbs' ability to strike
against the rebels and forced the Serbs to dodge air strikes by
hiding hardware, thus easing the pressure on the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the alliance plans a series of meetings to decide
whether to prepare a force totaling some 50,000 troops to go into
Kosovo to keep a negotiated peace. Within three weeks, alliance
officials have said, NATO will have to decide whether to prepare a
ground force powerful enough to invade the province and return the
hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to Kosovo before the
onset of harsh Balkan winter.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO has relied on air power alone, and allied
officials continue to insist that that approach is working. Touting
their two months of bombing raids, officials said Sunday that NATO
planes had directed 14,000 missiles and bombs, 10,000 of which were
precision guided, against targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO says the attacks have destroyed one-third of the Serbs'
heavy military equipment in Kosovo: more than 550 tanks, artillery
pieces and trucks. The bombing raids, NATO said, have also
destroyed half of the Serbs' ammunition storage sites in Kosovo and
11 command posts.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from targeting the Yugoslav military in Kosovo, the
alliance says it has destroyed more than 100 Yugoslav combat
aircraft in raids across the country. It has also pounded and
destroyed many of Serbia's bridges, rail lines and roads,
repeatedly assailed its oil refineries and often interrupted power
and water supplies to large parts of the republic.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to send in fresh recruits indicates that the
Serbs are not yet ready to give up. The move contrasts with the
reports of desertions, which allied officials cited last week as a
sign of weakening Serbian morale.
</P>
<P>
   The new recruits, from Montenegro, are stationed near Pec, a
town close to the northern part of the the Albanian-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been careful to limit its bombing strikes against
Montenegro, Serbia's sole remaining partner in the Yugoslav
federation, a much smaller republic whose leader has distanced
himself from the Kosovo campaign waged by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military, which has several important installations
in Montenegro, has sought to take advantage of this restraint, not
only by sending troops in from that republic, but by stationing
aircraft and radar equipment there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yugoslav recruits arrived in Pec without their
armored vehicles and heavy military equipment, an indication of the
difficulty that convoys have experienced in moving along Kosovo
roads in the face of allied air attacks, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recruits are not the only troops that have been sent, allied
officials said. The Yugoslav military has also dispatched elements
of a special operations unit to near the western Kosovo town of
Junik _ a Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold fiercely contested
since last year _ to replace soldiers killed in allied bombing
raids, Western officials say.
</P>
<P>
   To organize additional forces, President Milosevic has been
mobilizing reservists, a move that has led to some scattered
political protests and demonstrations in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of people coming back home, everybody is being called
up,'' said Jamie Shea, NATO's chief spokesman. ``The Yugoslav Army
is now trying to mobilize an increasing number of reservists who
don't want to be mobilized.''
</P>
<P>
   As the war drags on, the Serbs have also continued their
campaign against Albanian civilians. There has been a dramatic
surge in recent days in the number of civilians who have been
forced out of Kosovo or who have fled because of fear and hunger.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, some 14,000 refugees crossed into Macedonia, the
largest exodus since early May.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a sharp increase in flow of refugees to
Albania: 3,650 arrived on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They included 583 men who had been imprisoned near the northern
Kosovo town of Mitrovica. NATO said the men were not members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army but had been mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all handcuffed,'' Shea said, ``until shortly before
they reached the border.''

 SF CHRON   The Controversy Over Bioengineered Crops 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Around the corner from the biotech trade show I attended last week
in Seattle, counterculture activists staged their own tiny
gathering, ``Biodevastation.'' Guys with Rastafarian hair and women
in hemp skirts gathered in a church to proselytize against
bioengineered crops.
<P>
   The short walk between those two shows encapsulated the yawning
gulf between the believers and naysayers in agricultural
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The division has been most evident in Europe, where authorities
in several countries have slowed or halted the import of
genetically modified seeds or foodstuffs for fear of health or
environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy also flared in the United States last week after
scientists at Cornell University reported on a laboratory
experiment involving a strain of corn that has been modified to
carry certain insecticide genes. The study showed that pollen from
the plants could be toxic to Monarch butterfly larvae.
</P>
<P>
   The leading biotech trade group, the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, returned scientific fire, noting that lab experiments
don't equate to the real world, where Monarch caterpillars don't
normally habituate cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   And so these arguments go, each side touting its science and
accusing the other side of myopia. But the butterfly spat and the
broader controversy in Europe aren't about science or safety as
much as they are about two wholly incompatible views of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   I caught a whiff of the counterculture view at the Seattle
church where the biodevastated spread their literature on blankets
and card tables. Author Brewster Kneen was there selling
``Farmaggeddon'' (New Society Publishers, British Columbia), his
new polemic linking bioengineered seeds with mechanized
agriculture, world trade and other bugaboos of those who wish for a
time when farming was less an industry than a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, I spent that night with a friend who tracks
sales of farm equipment, seeds and agricultural commodities for
Wall Street. We talked about how genetically modified crops and
computer-driven farm machines are just two of the factors driving
the trend toward fewer, larger farms that produce more food with
less labor. Farmageddon's worst fears turn out to be Wall
Street's &UR;  &LR; fondest wishes.
</P>
<P>
   In this agricultural clash, genetically modified crops become a
convenient flashpoint. They're new enough to cause suspicion, even
among people who don't normally get political about the food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   But I doubt that Americans are ready to question a system of
agriculture that has produced the cheapest foodstuffs in the world.
As a society, we've pretty much said goodbye to the land and hello
to the supermarket and warehouse checkout line. We like our food
shrink-wrapped and on sale, and if that means genetic seed,
million-dollar tractors and Brobdingnagian farms, my bet is a
majority would opt to sacrifice the occasional butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, however, the vote might tilt the other way. At last
week's industry trade show in Seattle, I sat through two hours of
the dullest seminar I've ever endured just so I could hear European
industry, government and environmental experts explain why people
on that side of the pond seem so exercised about this genetic
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   If I heard correctly, attitudes in Europe have far less to do
with science or safety than with national pride and economics. Many
European countries still subsidize small farmers. Suspicion of
genetic crops is bound up with a certain resentment of
American-style agriculture. Even the way Europeans buy food is
different. The French, for instance, still favor local markets even
if they charge higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   All of this suggests that the resistance to bioengineered foods
in Europe is unlikely to become popular in the United States. The
ground here just isn't as fertile, you might say. Likewise, I
suspect that European acceptance of such crops will depend on
gradual changes in the whole food economy, starting with the
farmer, under pressure to compete with his efficient American
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions are always influenced by experience, so perhaps I
should make a confession. I'm a reporter with a past. Once upon a
time, I lived in the woods and harbored dreams of self-sufficiency.
A silly move, to be sure, for a kid raised in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, after I've doubled back on a metropolitan path, I
harbor quaint notions. Just before I flew up to Seattle, I finished
planting a small corn bed in my back yard.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the Sunday before the show spading the soil into rows
and carefully transplanting the sprouts that I'd raised from seeds.
No, not the genetically engineered variety, but heirloom seeds in a
pretty package.
</P>
<P>
   Even as I enjoyed the warm sun on my neck and the moist soil in
my fingers, I knew I was performing a foolish and uneconomic act.
Why that whole day's work surely couldn't yield the same rate of
return as if I'd made a five-minute phone call, adjusting the asset
allocation in my 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   Still, in September, if all goes well, I might harvest a bushel
of corn. Meanwhile, I'll derive whatever pleasure comes from
watching butterflies land.

 THE NET FILES/JON SWARTZ  &HT;     Online Cuts Burn Indie Booksellers 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Bookmark last week's price-slashing of best-seller books by online
merchants as another sad chapter in the plight of independent
booksellers during the digital age.
<P>
   Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Borders.com and
Booksamillion.com said they will offer discounts of 50 to 55
percent on best-sellers on the New York Times list to consumers.
The moves should increase online traffic at each site and, more to
the point, drive up their already inflated market capitalizations.
Amazon.com, which has yet to turn a profit in its four-year
history, is valued at $21.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In their dogged pursuit of market share and sales at the expense
of profits, the online merchants have made it clear that they are
willing _ almost eager _ to hemorrhage millions of dollars in the
short term to woo consumers to their Web sites. The theory is that
with a broad audience, online retailers will be able to set premium
advertising rates, auction items and sell commodities besides
books, such as videos and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Calculated? Perhaps. Brazenly insensitive to the financial
health of indie booksellers? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a lot of book clubs around the country will begin to
order their books online while they are still on the (best-seller)
list rather than wait for them to come out in paper,'' said Jeremy
Potash, a founding member of the 26-year-old Oakland Women's
Literary Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial Web sites constantly preach community, but what
they're really pushing is sacrificing good business sense for
market share,'' said Charlotte Cook, co-owner of Sunrise Bookshop
in Berkeley. ``Why don't they just send books to consumers along
with $10?''
</P>
<P>
   Although shoppers may love this novel giveaway, their enthusiasm
could be short-lived. Membership in the American Booksellers
Association has dwindled to 3,300 from 5,200 in 1992, leaving
consumers with fewer choices _ save for chain stores at the local
mall. That's hardly encouraging news for generations of readers
reared on quaint bookstores with quirky titles.
</P>
<P>
   For those stubborningly seeking solace in dirt-cheap prices,
consider this: As online book merchants grow in influence, don't
expect them to continue to offer steep discounts. If anything,
expect price increases.
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet age, a billboard in Mill Valley best sums up the
sentiments of book lovers everywhere: ``Think globally, shop
locally.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CLARK'S LAW: Net entrepreneur Jim Clark is almost the human
embodiment of Moore's Law. That's the theory in which Intel
co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors
the industry would be able to place on a computer chip would double
every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   With each successive venture, Clark has established a shorter
time period between starting a company and building it into an
enterprise worth billions of dollars. The cycle took 10 years at
Silicon Graphics, almost three years at Netscape Communications and
two years at Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   At this pace, we expect Clark's latest brainchild, MyCFO, to be
a billion-dollar enterprise before the clock strikes midnight this
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Historical note: In 1995, Moore amended his prediction to once
every two years. He probably didn't have Clark in mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHERE IMAC CUSTOMERS SHOP: A few years ago, Macintoshes were
second-class citizens at most computer retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our products were displayed horrendously,'' said Mitch
Mandich, Apple senior vice president of worldwide sales. ``They
were dusty, buried in the darkest corner of a store's PC section.
It made you sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the surging computer pioneer inked a deal with Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. to further remedy its distribution blahs: Starting
Memorial Day weekend, the largest U.S. department store chain will
carry the rainbow-hued iMacs at 825 locations.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, the news was far more bitter. Apple concentrated
its retail efforts on CompUSA _ the nation's largest PC retailer _
and deep-sixed agreements with Sears, Circuit City Stores Inc.,
Best Buy Co., Computer City and Office Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the high-water mark of the company's revenues, in the
mid-1990s, Apple tried to saturate the market by offering Macs in
every conceivable place,'' said Stephen Baker, senior hardware
analyst at PC Data Inc. in Reston, Va. &UR;  &LR; ``Unfortunately, they
didn't have compelling consumer products to sell and their models
were overpriced. That seems to have changed with iMacs.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot-selling iMacs have helped polish Apple's brand name
among the coveted Generation Y crowd and computer novices. Nearly
half of the 1.15 million units sold so far were purchased by
first-time buyers or Windows converts. Apple's pact with Sears
should make the Internet machines a lot more accessible to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sears is an optimum distribution network in nonmetropolitan
areas, and half of its PC shoppers are first-time buyers,'' Mandich
said. ``They fit our retail profile perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being relegated to the dustbin of computer stores,
Apple now is picking and choosing its distribution partners,
according to Mandich.
</P>
<P>
   Apple scotched a potential deal with Best Buy last month because
the Minneapolis chain insisted on carrying only the top-seller
``blueberry'' iMac flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DOT.COM MERGER MANIA: Northern California is ground zero for
virtual king making in the United States, accounting for a fourth
of all Internet mergers and acquisitions since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 43 deals, worth a whopping $11.5 billion, were
inked in the Bay Area, including 17 in San Francisco, according to
Web Merger Watch in San Francisco ( &LR; www.webmergers.com &LR; ). The
report covered 178 transactions valued at $19 billion during the
past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend will continue _ indeed, accelerate _ as long as
stock valuations, or overvaluations, of Internet companies
persist,'' said Tim Miller, president of New Media Resources in San
Francisco, which published the quarterly report.
</P>
<P>
   Putting their paper currency to use, Web companies spent nearly
twice as much on mergers during January 1999 ($11.5 billion) as
they did in 1998 ($6 billion). A pair of monster deals _ At Home's
$6.7 billion purchase of Excite, and Yahoo's $4.6 billion buyout of
GeoCities _ ignited the steep rise in spending.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Healtheon and WebMD confirmed that they are tying the
knot in a stock deal worth about $9.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is that by using their overinflated stocks to buy
other companies, firms like Yahoo and AtHome further inflate the
value of their own stocks,'' Miller said. ``Eventually, this
self-perpetuating cycle has to end.''

FRESNO GUN SHOW DRAWS A QUIET SUNDAY CROWD
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ It was a perfect day for rifle shopping. A
lazy, hazy Sunday, when the gun show inside a building at the
County Fairgrounds would be cool and dark and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Barber and his 9-year-old son, Billy, made it to the gates
of the fairgrounds at 9 a.m. sharp. They knew that by noon the
crowds could make the gun show feel like a Christmas season mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy is already a great shot,'' said Barber, a farm supplies
salesman, mussing his son's blond bowl haircut into a frenzy. ``We
shoot skeet and he can pretty much shoot wherever he aims.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few fathers and sons made it to the Fresno Gun Show
Sunday. So did quite a few mothers and sons, fathers and daughters,
brothers and sisters, husbands and wives. Hunting buddies came in
threes and fours, families in three generations, dates holding
hands and new parents holding babies.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to see the wares of 90 dealers selling everything from
antique ammo to Winchester rifles was $7 for adults, with children
under 13 free. And anyone who would ask why on earth anyone would
bring children to a festival of arms and ammunition would be
immediately branded as one of The Other Kind. To people in and at
this show, it was pretty clear that there are two kinds of people
in this world: gun people, and the other kind, who just do not get
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see any gun nuts here, do you?'' said Charlie Brady,
a carpenter and lifelong backyard target shooter. His T-shirt,
stretched over his belly, read, ``I Get Enough Exercise Pushing My
Luck,'' which was about the zaniest thing anyone here wore. One or
two people came in camouflage, or with rifles slung over their
shoulders. But at a time when gun shows have become a major target
of lawmakers in Washington pushing for new restrictions, the most
striking thing about this one is how benign it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   This could be because California already has strict laws
governing gun sales at these events. In a way, the Fresno Gun Show
could be the future of gun shows everywhere. The laws here are as
strict as those proposed in the Senate bill that passed last week,
in some ways stricter. Buyers must be 21 years old. They must take
a safety test. And guns purchased are held for 10 days, for a
background check. Armed security guards stand at the doors and long
laundry lists of rules are posted on the doors. (No trading
firearms, for example.)
</P>
<P>
   No one was going to walk out of the Fresno Gun Show with a
handgun, unless they brought it with them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are testy times for gun dealers here, same as
everywhere else. A lot of them spend a lot of time going up and
down the state to these shows, hauling their arms and children and
dogs in motor homes with mini-satellite dishes. They sounded tired
of defending themselves against criticisms that their livelihood is
at least indirectly responsible for most of the mayhem in society.
Several dealers declined to be interviewed, and one, who dealt
mostly in handguns, was openly hostile, continually telling other
dealers that they should not grant interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Padgett, who runs the Fresno show and others in eight
cities throughout California, said dealers blame the media for many
of their problems. When California passed its strict gun show laws
in 1992, at a time of random shootings and a crack epidemic, the
shows were blamed for those maladies. Now, he said, he thinks gun
shows and dealers are becoming scapegoats for all of society's
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raised three children and have four grandchildren and
they've all been around guns,'' Padgett said. ``I always watched my
kids, taught them about the seriousness of guns, and I never had
any problem. Evidently, my kids are doing the same with their kids.
I think it all starts at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Richards, a retired landscape surveyor who was selling decoy
ducks he had carved himself, along with some ammunition and a gun
or two, was one of several dealers who echoed the sentiment. ``When
I was a kid,'' Richards said, ``I was taught how to use a gun. Our
guns were kept in a corner. I knew the guns were always in the
corner, and I knew I was not supposed to take a gun unless I had
permission. We never had an incident, never had anyone shoot
anyone. Of course, we didn't have TV or movies like we do now,
either. I, at 78 years old, turn off my TV because of what's on.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the two dozen people interviewed said they were not gun
fanatics; the show was just something to do. Fresno, (population:
about 350,000) is a sleepy city, though the almond and berry farms
collide with sprawling housing developments. True, the city has an
urban center, but even a casino smack in the middle of it has not
brought back the life that fled downtown for highway strip malls.
The gun show and the swap meet right across the street were a way
to round out a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark and Mary Trujillo brought their three children, 9-year-old
twin girls and a 6-year-old boy. While Trujillo looked at rifles,
Mrs. Trujillo and the children looked over stuffed toy animals made
with real animal fur.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see too many vegetarians at these shows,''
Mrs. Trujillo said with a laugh. She watched her son, his eyes as
big as plates, find his dad aiming a rifle. ``I want my children to
know how to use guns,'' she said, ``because I learned how to use a
gun when I was a kid. It's more American than apple pie.'' &QL;

 Macromedia Will Unveil a Shocker  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista

<TEXT>
Macromedia Inc., which makes software widely used by Web and
multimedia designers, now wants to become a household word with
average Internet consumers.
<P>
   A pioneer of San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch, Macromedia today
cq monday  &LR;  will launch a new company called shockwave.com,cq on

   The free ``shockmachine'' player also will play back online
versions of cartoons like the edgy ``South Park,'' along with music
and interactive comics created with Macromedia's Flash and
Shockwave software. The player also can be used to create animated
e-mail greetings and to play MP3-encoded files.
</P>
<P>
   An expanded version of the shockmachine with more storage will
sell for $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia has lined up several well-known entertainment
companies to provide content, including Comedy Central, Fox
Interactive, Hasbro Interactive, GT Interactive Software, Warner
Bros. Online, Mplayer and ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia chief executive Rob Burgess called the new venture
the ``logical next big step'' in the evolution of Macromedia, which
has shifted from making multimedia software for CD-ROMs to tools
for Web publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the company's ShockRave, an interactive gaming
site started as a showcase for Macromedia products, ``showed us
people were ready for an entertainment experience on the Web,''
Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts favored the move and said the new company has potential
to become another hot ``dot com'' Internet stock. Burgess said an
IPO is a possibility down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a clever strategy,'' said Seamus McAteer, director of Web
technology strategies for Jupiter Communications. Macromedia
``would be leaving competitors such as Adobe in their wake.''
</P>
<P>
   In shockwave.com, Macromedia is borrowing a page from the
playbook of RealNetworks Inc., the Seattle company that sells
streaming audio and video software. As RealNetworks has done with
RealPlayer, Macromedia wants to distribute shockmachines as widely
as possible, which would, in turn, help increase sales of
Macromedia's Web authoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, this is a real departure,'' said Harley Manning,
research director for Forrester Research Inc. ``It leverages their
core strengths in a way they've never done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia's Flash and Shockwave players reach about 77 percent
of all Web users. Flash has been included with Microsoft and Apple
operating systems, Netscape's Navigator and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a fabulous job of seeding the market over the
last year or so,'' Manning said. ``Having seeded the market,
they're ready to harvest something. They're trying to see what can
be a cash crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're thinking like a consumer products company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new shockwave.com will start as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Macromedia and will have about 80 workers by the end of the year, a
mixture of new hires and existing Macromedia employees. The
headquarters will be down the street from Macromedia's Townsend
Street building.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia closed at $49.50 on Friday, up $4.19.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Farallon Gives Wing to Home Networking  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Farallon Communications is neither the first nor the largest
company to offer home-networking products, but it has a unique
twist: Farallon is first to market with a solution that works with
Apple Macs as well as Windows PCs.
<P>
   The San Leandro company's new HomeLINE products will let family
members on two or more computers participate in multiplayer games,
share files and printers and get online simultaneously via the same
Internet account and modem.
</P>
<P>
   Because HomeLINE uses existing phone wiring and jacks to connect
the computers _ without interfering with voice traffic _ no new
wires are needed.
</P>
<P>
   All this also is true of phone-line networking products already
available from Intel, Diamond Multimedia and several smaller
players. But those offerings work only on PCs, while Farallon's can
create networks of multiple Macs, multiple PCs or a mixture of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   A HomeLINE Starter Kit for connecting two machines will cost
$139, while a Single Pack for adding another system will be $79.
Both packages include PC and Mac software, plus circuit boards that
have to be plugged into a PCI slot inside the computer. Most
desktop PCs and Macs manufactured in recent years have such slots.
</P>
<P>
   But the iMac, the all-in-one model that's helped Apple grab back
a growing share of the consumer-computer market, doesn't have any
slots. Farallon said it plans to release an external HomeLINE
connection device for iMacs this summer. That product also will
work with at least some of Apple's PowerBook laptops.
</P>
<P>
   PC notebooks also lack PCI slots, but according to Farallon,
they can be connected to a HomeLINE network by using an Intel
product called AnyPoint, one version of which attaches to PC
printer ports. Both Farallon and Intel, as well as other vendors,
have based their products on a new standard developed by a trade
consortium called the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Farallon said, its PCI cards are manufactured by Intel
and its Windows software is based on Intel's.
</P>
<P>
   The software enabling HomeLINE users to share files and printers
between Mac and PCs works for only three hours per session. Users
who want an unlimited version can upgrade for about $100.
</P>
<P>
   As of a year ago, more than 18 million U.S. households had more
than one personal computer, according to Dataquest research cited
by Farallon. Between 3 million and 4 million of those had both Macs
and PCs, even though the survey was conducted before the
hot-selling iMac was released.
</P>
<P>
   Farallon was founded in 1986 to market local-area networking
products developed by Mac enthusiasts at the University of
California at Berkeley. The original company gradually shifted its
focus to Internet hardware and software, and in 1987, it changed
its name to Netopia Inc. But last year, Netopia spun off a separate
company, under the old Farallon name, to market and develop some of
its local-area products.

SABRES, WITHOUT HASEK, TAKE A 1-0 LEAD ON THE MAPLE LEAFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A much-discussed feature of the new Air Canada Center
is the corridor by the locker rooms, where fans from the rink-level
seats can gather to see players walk to and from the ice. When
visiting players are angry or fans are heckling, it creates some
tension. And when a star player is out of uniform, unexpectedly, it
generates a buzz of gossip that shoots like an electric current
from the ground floor to the highest seat in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case Sunday in the hour before the Buffalo Sabres
took the ice to defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by 5-4 in Game 1 of
the four-of-seven game Eastern Conference finals of the Stanley Cup
playoffs. The Sabres played without Dominik Hasek, generally
considered the best goalie in hockey in the 1990s. Hasek had
re-injured his groin during the previous series against Boston and
he said it got worse during the five days off before Sunday. The
Sabres kept the secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I didn't want to expose,'' said Sabres Coach
Lindy Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's backup, Dwayne Roloson, stopped 28 of 32 Toronto shots
to earn the victory. Hasek said he would return to Buffalo tonight
while his teammates remained in Toronto for Tuesday's Game 2. There
will be more tests and treatment, but Hasek seemed discouraged when
asked about his health and state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very worried,'' said Hasek, 34, who won both the Hart and
Vezina trophies in both 1997 and 1998 as the most valuable player
and the best goalie in the National Hockey League. Again this
season, he is one of three finalists for both awards. ``I'm not
able to make a butterfly,'' he said, referring to a shot-blocking
technique that involves dropping to the knees and spreading the leg
pads. ``I cannot go up and down. It never healed. Unfortunately, it
did not get better. It got even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's absence, if prolonged, could have a significant effect
on the series. Roloson, although 29 years old, never started a
playoff game before Sunday. He appeared in 18 regular-season games
this season and in one in the post-season, when Hasek was hurt.
Although he is from nearby Simcoe, Ontario, Roloson said he did not
call his family on Saturday night to let them know he was playing.
His relatives were on vacation, at their cottage, for the long
Victoria Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to call them, wreck their weekend,'' Roloson
said. ``I wanted them to relax and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Toronto goal, Curtis Joseph gave up five goals on the
first 19 Buffalo shots. Also a finalist for the Vezina, Joseph was
not at his sharpest Sunday, but few players for either team were.
Although the game had many exciting moments, it was loosely played,
filled with the turnovers and other mistakes that could have been a
sign of opening-game nervousness, bad ice conditions or of new foes
trying to figure out each other's styles.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto scored three of its four goals on power plays and held a
3-2 lead, briefly, during the second period. Buffalo pulled ahead
for good in the third period, going up by 5-3 before Steve Thomas
scored for the Maple Leafs to cut the final deficit to one goal.
Vaclav Varada, Dixon Ward, Stu Barnes, Curtis Brown and Geoff
Sanderson scored for Buffalo. Barnes' goal, on the power play, was
his first as a Sabre in 28 games since being traded from
Pittsburgh. Mats Sundin scored twice for the Leafs and Bryan Berard
got the other. Sundin's first was at even strength, 9 seconds after
Varada had opened the scoring at 4 minutes 23 seconds of the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Hasek has been injured in the
playoffs. In 1997, he played only three games before sitting out
with a knee injury. There was much debate then about the
seriousness of the injury and about its connection to Hasek's
deteriorating relationship with Sabres Coach Ted Nolan, who was
fired after the season. This time, there seems to be no doubt about
the injury. Hasek missed 12 games during the season because of the
groin injury and traveled to Germany for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said after the game: ``Don't say he doesn't want to play.
Because of the pain, he can't. It's possible that the area has
become inflamed. We'll approach it on a day-to-day basis.''
Roloson's teammates seemed to take it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, one of the goal-scorers, said: ``I was excited for Rolie.
He got an opportunity he deserved and wanted and he was waiting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs did not seem too discouraged. They also lost the
opening games of the first two rounds, against Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh. The winner of this series will play Dallas or Colorado
in the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't go the way I wanted it to,'' Joseph said.
``We've lost the first game in the last two rounds and overcame it.
We're looking to do the same thing.'' &QL;

JERKENS, MASTER OF UPSETS, HAS MOUNT IN BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Allen Jerkens, a trainer with a history of
springing upsets, reared his head again Sunday at Belmont Park when
his colt Best of Luck won the Peter Pan Stakes in the mud and
thrust himself into the Triple Crown path of Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Best of Luck is a 3-year-old son of Broad Brush who ran second
in the Wood Memorial in April and second in the Withers in May
while Charismatic was winning the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness.
Jerkens has kept him clear of the Triple Crown wars _ until now.
But Best of Luck is a long-striding horse who runs from far back
and then makes his move late and long in the homestretch, a style
well suited for the rigors of the Belmont Stakes and its distance
of a mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   And he gave a perfect performance in the Peter Pan, trailing by
15 lengths before cranking up his power in the final quarter of a
mile and winning by one length over Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he acts OK, we'll take a shot at the Belmont,'' Jerkens
said. ``He seems to really be coming into his own. His style of
running, coming from far behind, isn't conducive to winning a lot
of races. But it looks like it will be a slower pace in the big
one. And he should be able to go the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Going the distance was no problem Sunday. Best of Luck, running
on a muddy track for the first time, went the mile and one-eighth
in 1:47 4/5, just one-fifth of a second slower than Adonis ran
while winning the Wood Memorial on a fast track. But in the
homestretch he gathered momentum on the outside, flew past the
leaders and crossed the finish line a length in front of Treasure
Island, who had a length and a half on Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Farther back in the pack came several other colts with somewhat
equal betting appeal: Unbridled Jet, fifth; Successful Appeal,
winner of the Withers, seventh, and The Groom is Red, an
acknowledged mud-runner from Nick Zito's barn, eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But if Best of Luck took some long strides on his road to the
Belmont Stakes, which is June 5, several of his rivals came to the
end of their Triple Crown hopes. Shug McGaughey said that Treasure
Island might run in the Dwyer on July 11 or the Ohio Derby on July
24, but not in the Belmont. Bill Mott, the trainer of Unbridled
Jet, said that he was not certain where his colt would run next but
that it would not be in the Belmont. And Zito said The Groom Is Red
``looked great and trained great, but he didn't run great,'' and
added that he had no agenda right now for his horse.
</P>
<P>
   Best of Luck ran his usual suspenseful race, breaking eighth in
a field of nine and hanging ninth after half a mile while Barry
Schwartz's colt David set the pace.
</P>
<P>
   As they passed three-quarters of a mile, Best of Luck was
eighth. David was starting to soften up in the stretch, but
Treasure Island was right at his heels in second place, where he
had been running from the start.
</P>
<P>
   But Best of Luck followed the Jerkens script faithfully. With
Jean-Luc Samyn riding, he turned for home five-wide, shot forward
from the outside and ran past the herd, buying himself a ticket to
the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Best of Luck, in earning $90,000 with his third victory in eight
starts, returned $9.20, $4.60 and $3 for a $2 bet. Treasure Island
paid $10.80 and $5.80 and Lemon Drop Kid was $3.30 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Lemon Drop Kid, said later that he
was still planning to run in the Belmont, but added, ``He ran good,
but a better horse beat him.'' &QL;

SAMPRAS IS PREPARING FOR THE RED-CLAY WARS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Never say never. That's the mantra Pete Sampras takes
into the only Grand Slam event to defy him. Sampras' aversion to
the French Open's red clay is reminiscent of Ivan Lendl's terminal
allergy to Wimbledon's grass, and it's an aversion Sampras shares
with a couple of unlikely soul mates, top-ranked Martina Hingis and
13th-seeded Andre Agassi. Like him, they have found Slam
gratification every place but here at the clay-court marathon that
represents the missing link in their Grand Slam biographies.
</P>
<P>
   On this, his 10th attempt to solve Roland Garros, a feat fellow
Americans and former No. 1s John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors never
did master, Sampras can catch Roy Emerson's career record by
capturing his 12th career Grand Slam title on June 6. But that
seems a tall order. If the French Open, which begins Monday, were
played in hermetically sealed conditions, Sampras, a fuss-budget
and perfectionist, no doubt would have won it years ago. But the
French is anything but climate controlled, and the second-seeded
Sampras is anything but in his heyday.
</P>
<P>
   As the defending champion, Carlos Moya of Spain, pointed out
Sunday, every day at the French ``is going to be like war.''
According to Moya, Sampras may be ``the greatest player ever,'' but
not for these two weeks. Moya listed the 1997 champion Gustavo
Kuerten, Chile's Marcelo Rios, and anybody with a Spanish passport
as his 1999 French Open sure shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a whole 'nother animal,'' Sampras said about his
struggles here, where he is 22-9 and his best effort remains a
semifinal finish during an uncommon balmy spell in 1996. ``I'm a
bit of a dark horse,'' he said of his attempts to cope with the
ever-changing temperament of the French.
</P>
<P>
   On picturesque sunny days, trekking through a match is a bit
like a forced march across the Sahara: grit gets in the eyes and
mouth and paints tennis whites brick red, and unless a player has
some grit in the back of his mind, he probably won't survive for
future rounds.
</P>
<P>
   On cold and clammy days, players slog away on a surface that
resembles red quicksand. Rain or shine, there are no cakewalks
here, and nobody buys a free pass to the final on the strength of a
bullying serve and whiz-bang volley.
</P>
<P>
   Better to own a sly drop shot, a ton of topspin, and a physique
that understands the hidden meaning of go-with-the-flow: anybody
too tense to slide and glide gets blisters instead of results.
</P>
<P>
   The French Open is the dirtiest Slam event to win, but there is
an elusive art to negotiating it. In the recent past it has
thwarted the likes of McEnroe, Connors, and Stefan Edberg,
versatile stars who managed to master all three other Slam events
before closing the curtain on their careers. Sampras is not the
obsessive sort, but he knows that selective greatness, like his
five Wimbledons, won't put him on equal footing in the record book
with the icons Don Budge and Rod Laver: it's going to take a French
Open victory to round out the resume.
</P>
<P>
   After being hissed off the court two weeks ago at the Italian
Open, where he fell to Fernando Meligeni, 6-3, 6-1 in the second
round, Sampras, who skipped the Australian Open and had played just
10 matches through the first four months of 1999, described himself
as ``rusty'' and ready to ``go back to the drawing board.''
</P>
<P>
   The most formidable player on clay of late has been Kuerten, the
Brazilian who seemed to be airlifted off a surfboard and out of
anonymity and dropped into the 1997 finale. Patient, resilient, and
seemingly tireless, he is the consummate clay-court animal. A
``monster,'' Moya observed.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 French Open was Kuerten's first career title, and since
then he has collected three more on clay, two this spring while
compiling an 18-3 clay-court record (second only to Rios' 20-4)
with victories at Monte Carlo and the Italian Open. At Rome,
Kuerten defeated Patrick Rafter in a final that denied the
Australian the chance to become his country's first No. 1 since
John Newcombe in 1974. In Paris, no fewer than five men _ Sampras,
Rafter, Kuerten, Richard Krajicek and Tim Henman _ have a chance to
snatch the No. 1 ranking from the 1996 French Open champion,
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who plays the 1989 Roland Garros champion,
Michael Chang, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, the 18-year-old Hingis, who commandeered
every Grand Slam tournament but the French in 1997 and has never
forgiven herself that lapse, has serious designs on the only major
missing from her trophy case. Hingis hit Paris on the heels of a
title at the German Open, where she sent the French Open's
defending champion, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, a 6-4, 6-0 tennis-gram
in the semifinals. Sanchez Vicario, who contemplated wrist surgery
in December, has admitted she will be relying on adrenaline, not
fitness, as she begins her title defense Monday against Mirjana
Lucic. Hingis, in contrast, claims all systems are go to make
restitution for last year's semifinal loss to Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about my game and my fitness level right now; the
past few years I've always lost in Berlin and then lost at Roland
Garros, so I hope that this year will be a good omen for me,''
Hingis said. Her 13-1 clay-court record, and two titles on clay,
are the envy of everyone except archrival Venus Williams, who
compiled a 9-1 record courtesy of titles at the Italian Open and
Hamburg. If the draw unfolds to form, Hingis and Williams will find
themselves in a quarterfinal collision.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said: ``I feel much more intelligent on the court this
year; I understand the game more, and I'm going into the French
with the ability to take the title.'' Williams, who joined the
circuit at age 14, turns 19 next month, and needs to hurry if she
wants to gild her phenom label with a Grand Slam championship
before she ceases to be a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 28-year-old Sampras and the 29-year-old Agassi, they
simply want to complete their Slam laurels with a Roland Garros
title before they cease to be players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to go after it and do it,'' said Agassi, who
hasn't won a Grand Slam title since the 1995 Australian Open. He
faces a harsh first-round test Monday from Argentina's 39th-ranked
Franco Squillari, who upset Moya in Rome and won Munich. Agassi
admits to feeling like a starving man at this time of year, ``When
it's the one you've never won, it always makes you hungrier,'' he
said. &QL;

THE LAUGHS FOR `MAD ABOUT YOU' WERE FEWER AS THE YEARS WENT ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In assessing the sociological implications of the seven-season
run of ``Mad About You,'' let's remember two key points. One, it
was no ``Seinfeld.'' Two, it never tried to be, which is why the
media hubbub that accompanied the denouement of ``Seinfeld'' a year
ago isn't reaching similar heights of dizziness for ``Mad About
You.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the swan song of ``Mad About You'' on Monday
night is virtually free of hubbubbery. Some say it's because the
show should have bowed out last season, and that it stuck around
for another year only because NBC paid big money to keep from
losing it and ``Seinfeld'' at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't uncommon for a series to depart a year or two or three
past its prime. But no series in recent memory went from must-see
to musty as dramatically as ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, ``Mad About You'' was as lively a romantic
comedy as there was on network TV. It was funny, fresh and full of
promise. Like about 20 million other American males, I was in love
with Helen Hunt. So was my wife, and at least one of my sisters.
Hunt has a universal appeal that made Paul Reiser's mannered
performance style tolerable. She was attractive to men,
non-threatening to women _ a killer combination on and off the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   And even though NBC treated the series as warmly as a contagion,
changing its time slot as often as Reiser would say ``I'm just
saying,'' it often was as well-written as ``Frasier'' (which
started a season later) and as smart as ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   But ask a group of TV-watching friends if they've seen ``Mad
About You'' recently, and the most prevalent answer will be
something like: ``You know, I used to watch it, but I stopped a few
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Me too.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it changed. And even though change is supposed to
be good for us in the same way as fiber, greens and humble pie, we
really don't like change. When the boss announces that paychecks
will be issued every other week instead of weekly, we hate it. And
then when the boss says the company is going back to the old way of
distributing paychecks, we hate it. The only time we want change is
when we have to feed a parking meter or we're face to face with a
soft-drink machine that doesn't take dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   The change in ``Mad About You'' can be traced to 1996. In the
fourth-season finale, Paul and Jamie Buchman came close to
splitting up after each flirted with a dangerous liaison. Neither
succumbed to temptation, and their rapprochement was sealed by the
news that Jamie was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, Jamie got her third set of parents, played this
time by Carol Burnett and Carroll O'Connor, and despite promises
from Reiser that Jamie's pregnancy wouldn't be the focal point of
the season, Jamie's pregnancy was the focal point of the season,
culminating in maternity in that season's finale in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the season that Reiser and Hunt got more involved in
the creative process, and the reason I started to lose interest.
The one-time romantic comedy had become an aimless ensemble piece
featuring an array of big-name guest stars who won a trunkful of
Emmys but did little to fulfill the show's early promise. It was
like a bad marriage: The dynamic of Paul and Jamie's relationship
ceased to be interesting, and their lives were defined not by what
they brought to the union but by what was happening to them and
around them.
</P>
<P>
   This is painfully evident in Monday night's one-hour series
finale. Hunt directed it, and at times it is charming, poignant,
even instructive. But it's not very funny. It also moves too
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo stars as Paul and Jamie's daughter, Mabel,
speaking to us as an adult. Through her narration we learn what
happened to Paul and Jamie after 1999. For instance, they
discovered they were never legally married because the city utility
worker (Lyle Lovett) who officiated at their ceremony wasn't an
ordained minister, as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out to be an unfortunate metaphor for the series. What
was advertised in 1992 _ a smart romantic comedy _ ended up not so
smart and not so funny.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with the latter. A show like ``Sports Night,''
though cloaked as a traditional comedy, is intentionally unfunny
much of the time. Its fans expect it to be trenchant and
occasionally caustic. But ``Mad About You'' changed channels
halfway through the program, expecting viewers to follow along as
if nothing had happened.
</P>
<P>
   But something had happened, probably because the people who
worked on the show day in and day out were feeling the creative
paralysis that's almost inevitable in a long-running series. To
avoid the ``been there, done that'' trap, they took a left turn and
changed the show, making it star-driven instead of story-driven.
</P>
<P>
   Bad move. Better to take a lesson from ``Seinfeld,'' which
retained most of its audience because the story was king, no matter
how bizarre or insignificant. Sure, they had the occasional
big-name guest on ``Seinfeld,'' but more often it was the other way
around: An appearance on ``Seinfeld'' was a springboard to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes in ``Mad About You,'' Hunt has always been a
joy to watch. Compare Jamie Buchman with other sitcom characters
and Hunt's enormous talent is something to cherish. But ``Mad About
You'' is not, because it lost direction on the way to syndication
success _ and that's maddening.

 &HT;    Labonte gets wheels of fortune
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concord, N.C. _ When Jeff Gordon pulled onto pit road for the
final time Saturday night, crew chief Ray Evernham noticed rookie
Tony Stewart's crew was changing only two tires.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham changed his mind and replaced only right-side tires,
too, but he apparently forgot about Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte's crew exchanged all four tires on his No. 5 Chevrolet,
allowing him to blow past Gordon and Stewart in the final 10-lap
shootout of The Winston, NASCAR's annual all-star race at Lowe's
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who finished third in the second 30-lap segment, lost
track position because of the longer pit stop and started the final
dash fifth. But he caught Gordon for second in only three laps, and
then passed Stewart three laps later for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The correct pit decision gave Labonte his second victory in The
Winston, joining Gordon, the late Davey Allison and Dale Earnhardt
as the event's only multiple winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys had to work on the car on pit road,'' Labonte said.
`` We were lucky right there. Some of the guys just got two tires
and we got four and gave up some track position, but it paid off
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who started the race 21st after winning the Winston
Open earlier Saturday, finished second. Gordon was third, followed
by Earnhardt and Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should have taken four tires,'' Gordon said. ``The
car wouldn't turn in the corners at all. It really, really shoved
the nose. We've won this thing on four tires before, and this time
we got beat by somebody who took four.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR ruled that Gordon jumped the start for the final segment,
so the first restart was waved off. When the green flag finally
flew, Stewart blew by Gordon on the high side of the 1.5-mile oval,
but Labonte passed him on the backstretch three laps later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gamble (changing only two tires),'' Stewart said.
``Everybody is rolling the dice. It's a 10-lap dash and this is the
only place you do it. I still am not disappointed. I think we did
the right thing. We just got caught out by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second was all we could do. I could have told you the two-tire
stop wasn't the right move as soon as I saw Terry in my mirror.
When the guy's coming that hard, it's an obvious tell-tale sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stewart and Gordon were around a lot longer than Dale
Jarrett, Jeff Burton, Bobby Labonte and Mark Martin, who all were
eliminated in two pileups during the first 12 laps.
</P>
<P>
   On the 12th lap, Labonte's No. 18 Pontiac wasn't up to speed
after a restart, and he started falling back in the field. Martin
caught his bumper when Ernie Irvan spun out on the top side of the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's No. 36 Pontiac collected Labonte and Martin, and seven
other cars were damaged before it was over. Rusty Wallace, the
winner of The Winston in 1989, also was knocked out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the restart, it just wouldn't go,'' Labonte said. ``I got a
little loose coming off turn 2. I kept trying to get out of the
way, but I just kept getting hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Jarrett, Burton and Ricky Rudd were knocked out when
Bobby Hamilton's No. 4 Chevy appeared to tap the rear of Jarrett's
No. 88 Ford. Jarrett spun high and collected Burton's car when it
came back across the track.

CONGRESS TO WEIGH WHAT A PRESIDENT IS WORTH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the job were offered in the help wanted
advertisements, it might not sound very attractive:
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive needed to oversee bureaucracy of millions.
Seeking inspiring leader and practical problem-solver. Long hours
and constant criticism. Fringes include large, well-furnished
house, but no pay raise regardless of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the job is president of the United States, there is never
a shortage of applicants, even though the pay has not gone up in 30
years, since Brooks Brothers sold suits for $100 and a spacious
apartment on Manhattan's East Side rented for $250 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress is weighing whether to make the next president the
first to get a raise since Richard Nixon in 1969. The House
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight will take up a
proposal on Monday to double the president's salary, to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten phone calls already from people objecting,''
Russell George, chief counsel and staff director of the panel's
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology,
said last week. ``They're really revved up about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the complainers were under the mistaken impression that
President Clinton would get a raise if the House and Senate
approved the proposal and Clinton signed it, George said.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution says a president's pay may not be increased or
lowered in the term for which he was elected, so it would not be
Clinton but whoever replaces him at noon on Jan. 20, 2001, who
would draw a salary of $400,000 _ assuming that Congress acts in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee will hear from several former White House
chiefs of staff and experts on government and management who favor
raising the chief's pay. But at least one witness will take an
opposite view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's salary is adequate as it stands,'' Gary
Ruskin, director of the watchdog Congressional Accountability
Project, said last week in a preview of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   And no one disputes that the presidential compensation package
includes a lot of fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The president gets an annual travel allowance of $100,000, an
expense allowance of $50,000, round-the-clock security, jet planes
and helicopters and a good-sized house where he does not have to
cook for himself. His retirement benefits are generous. And he
never has to pick up his own dry cleaning or hunt for a parking
space.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential perquisites might be worth $500,000 a year, Lloyd
N. Cutler, chairman of a special panel that studied government
salaries, estimated back in 1989. His commission recommended
increasing the president's salary in 1993 to $350,000, plus a
cost-of-living adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ignored the recommendation. But last week a House
Appropriations Committee panel with jurisdiction over White House
spending included a future presidential pay raise in its
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is the hearing before the Government Reform
subcommittee, headed by Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif. George, the chief
counsel, said the subcommittee would ponder the fact that $200,000
in 1969 would be the equivalent to at least three times that in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the relationship of the president's salary to the
salaries of other high officials. The vice president, the chief
justice of the United States and the speaker of the House get
cost-of-living adjustments, unlike the president. Their salaries
are now $175,400, not quite 88 percent of the president's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the vice president, chief justice and speaker made 31
percent of what the president made, the Congressional Research
Service of the Library of Congress has told the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet officers and the majority and minority leaders in
Congress make $151,800, about 76 percent of what the president
makes. In 1969, they made 30 percent of what the president made.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Congress make $136,700, about 68 percent of
what the president is paid; in 1969, they made 21 percent of what
the president made.
</P>
<P>
   If the president's salary stays at $200,000 and other high
officials get adjustments of, say, 3 percent a year, the chief
justice and the vice president would be paid $3,400 more than the
president in January 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing their pay or giving them only tiny raises could lead to
what the Congressional Research Service calls ``pay compression,''
a situation in which not only the highest government officials, but
subordinates on down the line, would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is crucial. If Congress does not raise the
president's pay this year, it is unlikely to revisit the issue in
2000, an election year. In that case, the earliest a presidential
raise could take effect would be Jan. 20, 2005.  &QL;

PACERS ELIMINATE SIXERS AND THEN PRAISE THEM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ No one on the Indiana Pacers brought out a broom
to signify a sweep over the 76ers Sunday afternoon, or made any
kind of motion that they had just cleaned house in the First Union
Center. There was no strutting or boasting or chest-thumping.
</P>
<P>
   The cool, purposeful, veteran Pacers had won again, by the skin
of their teeth, 89-86, to take the Eastern Conference semifinal
series by four games to none. But afterward, the Pacers expressed
nothing but admiration for the more youthful, dogged Sixers, who
came back to take the lead by 4 points with just three minutes left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a six- or seven-game series,'' said Reggie
Miller, the Pacers' shooting ace, who led his team with 23 points.
``They could've gone south Sunday when we went up by 17 points in
the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that when Philadelphia's Allen Iverson, the league's
leading scorer, went out in the second quarter with a thigh injury,
it added to the Pacers' optimism. ``But then Allen returned'' _
after a minute-and-a-half on the bench _ ``and brought them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said: ``Every time they got down, they showed a lot of
poise. They got great shots, and played great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have now won each of their seven games in the
playoffs, having swept the Milwaukee Bucks in three games in the
opening round. They will face either the Knicks or the Atlanta
Hawks in the conference finals. New York leads that series by 3-0
after a 90-78 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The three biggest plays down the stretch Sunday were clutch
shots by Miller and Chris Mullin, and a defensive play by center
Rik Smits on Iverson which, Iverson believed, should have resulted
in a whistle.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sixers ahead by 83-79 and 3 minutes 17 seconds
remaining in the game, and the home sellout crowd of 20,844 waving
white handkerchiefs and shouting itself hoarse, Mullin hit a
3-point shot to draw the Pacers within a point. Iverson missed a
jump shot and Miller came down and hit a running one-hander off the
backboard to return the lead to the Pacers. Smits added 2 more
points on a layup, and the Pacers were ahead by 86-83.
</P>
<P>
   With 41 seconds to go, the 6-foot Iverson took a 3-point shot
from the corner with a chance to tie the score. The 7-foot-4-inch
Smits left his post near the basket and flew at Iverson, getting a
piece of the ball, which fell short of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson thought he had been fouled. ``But we should never have
let it come to that,'' he said. ``We just can't let ourselves get
down so far in a game so early. It takes such energy to get back in
the game that it's tough when you need all the legs you can get for
every shot at the end of the game, and you need to jump another
inch higher on every rebound, and it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers had enough left that they shook the arena with a
remarkable run to start the fourth quarter. They outscored Indiana
by 17-4 to snatch the lead. They were helped considerably by the
Pacers' stunning inability to make a shot from the field in that
time. The Pacers went 0 for 13 _ over 12 minutes without a basket,
going back to late in the third period _ before Mullin sank his
crucial 3-pointer with two minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the resilience of the Sixers, another obstacle for the
Pacers was their usually dependable bench, which finished with just
11 points. The starting team, however, showed particular balance,
each player scoring in double figures: Miller's 23 were followed by
Mullin with 16, Smits with 15, Mark Jackson with 14 and Dale Davis
with 10. And Jackson, the point guard, finished with a game-high 13
assists, an indication of how he controlled much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson led all scorers with 25 points, making 11 baskets on 28
shots. Matt Geiger, the 76ers' center, who did not pull down a
single rebound in Friday's 97-86 Game 3 loss, grabbed 13 Sunday, to
tie Davis for the game high. He also scored 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams would have packed it in,'' said Larry Brown,
the Philadelphia coach, referring to his team's dismal first
quarter. ``But our guys didn't. We were behind in each game in the
series, and we battled back every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Pacers' next playoff opponent, Pacers Coach
Larry Bird said: ``It doesn't matter who we play, but I know that
some of the players hope it's the Knicks. Reggie gets fired up for
them, and so do some of the other guys. But if we play like we have
so far in the playoffs, we'll do fine against anyone.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal appeals court based in Richmond, Va.,
has quietly but steadily become the boldest conservative court in
the United States in the view of scholars, lawyers and many of its
own members who say the court has issued some remarkable rulings
and taken a striking tone on several issues.
</P>
<P>
   The court, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers
five mid-Atlantic and Southern states, has in recent years evolved
into the kind of bench that staunch conservatives had hoped to
create at the Supreme Court but never quite achieved despite 12
years of Republican appointments under Presidents Ronald Reagan and
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit, which is one level below the Supreme Court, is
by far the most restrictive appeals court in the nation in granting
new hearings in death-penalty cases, according to several
statistical studies. It is highly receptive to efforts by states to
restrict abortion, and it has blazed new trails in striking down
laws that a majority of its judges say improperly enhance federal
power at the expense of the states.
</P>
<P>
   The court stunned both conservative and liberal scholars in
February when it cited an obscure 1968 statute in declaring that
federal law-enforcement officials need not follow one of the
best-known Supreme Court decisions of this century, Miranda vs.
Arizona, under which criminal suspects are notified of their legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 4th Circuit has moved forcefully and boldly on some of
these issues,'' said Jesse Choper, who teaches constitutional law
at the University of California at Berkeley Law School. ``In some
cases, they've gone out of their way to reach these decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, some of the Republican-appointed
judges who hold the majority on the 13-member court proudly assert
that they are part of an effort to reshape large areas of federal
law and constitutional interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions on the court have produced sharp debates behind
the scenes among judges who present a public face of courtesy and
courtliness. But its conservative majority has engaged in an
extraordinary degree of maneuvering to ensure that decisions on
important cases come out as the majority prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Harvie Wilkinson III, the chief judge of the 4th Circuit, said
in an interview that the circuit was ``involved in a revival of
constitutional limitations that were there all along but have been
greatly neglected for a very long time _ the extent of federal
power vis-a-vis the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said the circuit court's majority was doing its best
to follow signals sent by the Supreme Court in recent rulings,
particularly those involving new limits on federal power.
</P>
<P>
   He cited several Supreme Court rulings, especially a 1995 case,
United States vs. Lopez, in which a 5-4 majority ruled that
Congress had overstepped its bounds in 1990 by imposing extra
penalties for gun possession near a school. The Supreme Court
majority said Congress did not have the authority to regulate such
public-safety issues under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution,
which allows a federal role in interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit has taken the principles from that ruling into
new areas. It has ruled that some Clean Water Act regulations
exceeded Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.
</P>
<P>
   And it has struck down the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act,
which prohibits states from selling their rosters of registered
drivers for profit. The judges said that the law had ``offended our
system of dual sovereignty'' by telling the states what they could
and could not do with their drivers' records. The Supreme Court
agreed last week to review that case.
</P>
<P>
   An even more telling test may come later, when the Supreme Court
decides whether to hear an appeal of another 4th Circuit ruling
earlier this year, which said that the Violence Against Women Act
is unconstitutionally based on the Commerce Clause. The case
involves a former student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University who tried to use the law to sue two football
players who she asserted had raped her.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit, in a majority opinion by Judge Michael Luttig,
offered a ringing defense of states' rights, saying the law
``simply cannot be reconciled with the principles of limited
federal government upon which this nation is founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges on both sides of the philosophical divide at the 4th
Circuit expressed anxiety and curiosity about how the Supreme Court
would treat the case. More than half of the 4th Circuit's active
judges were interviewed for this article, although most asked that
they not be quoted directly or by name.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Supreme Court has approved of the rulings from
the 4th Circuit. In an address at the 4th Circuit's annual
conference last June, Chief Justice William Rehnquist made a point
of comparing the court favorably with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which covers California and several Western states.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit, also divided along discernible philosophical
lines but with a generally liberal cast, at times seems to be in
combat with the Supreme Court, which has reversed a higher
percentage of that circuit's cases than any other. In contrast,
Rehnquist noted, the Supreme Court infrequently finds fault with
the rulings of the 4th Circuit.

</P>
<P>
   Conservative Core Wields Its Majority
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 13 active judges in the 4th Circuit, the
conservative-minded members like Wilkinson and Luttig, appointed
principally by Reagan and Bush, only slightly outnumber the judges
who were put on the court by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a core of about seven judges on this court who
generally share a common view about many of these issues,'' said
one of the judges in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative majority on the court has not been reluctant to
wield its majority forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   That has resulted in an especially troublesome dispute among
some judges on the circuit. On a handful of occasions, judges and
former law clerks say, the conservative majority has successfully
prevented the release of judicial opinions that displeased them.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling example occurred last July, as described by
judges on both sides of the philosophical divide, former judges and
law clerks. A federal trial judge ordered the Commonwealth of
Virginia not to begin enforcing a law requiring underage women to
obtain the consent of one parent before securing an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The state quickly sought to have the ruling reversed, and
applied to Luttig, who agreed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Several judges confirmed that the abortion rights lawyers then
quickly asked for a three-judge panel to reconsider the case. The
two judges chosen randomly to make up the panel with Luttig were
Judges Clyde Hamilton and Dickson Philips Jr. They wrote an opinion
overturning the Luttig order.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Luttig quickly requested that the case be considered by
the full court. In the meantime, the chief judge ordered that the
ruling by the three-judge panel be withheld from the public.
Eventually the full panel unanimously upheld Luttig.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law
School who has studied the appeals courts, says the 4th Circuit
regularly overrides decisions made by three-judge panels by quickly
having the whole court consider the cases, a procedure known as
``en banc.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conservative majority on the full court, and if
they see a panel decision they don't like, they just take it en
banc and reverse it,'' he said. ``No other circuit enforces
majority rule the way the 4th Circuit does. It's gotten to the
point that if there is a 2-to-1 liberal panel decision, you can
predict with almost perfect certainty that it will go before the
full court and be reversed. Liberal panel decisions are not allowed
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some judges said in interviews that they objected to the
frequency with which the conservative majority resorted to the en
banc procedure to overturn three-judge panels. ``There have been
some really nasty fights within the court over that issue,'' one
judge said.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Emory Widener Jr., who has been on the 4th Circuit
since 1972, said in an interview that while the abortion case had
produced ``many ruffled feathers at the court, I don't think there
is any real cause for complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the procedures were followed properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to confidential memos circulated among the judges,
Luttig has occasionally told his colleagues that he thinks the 4th
Circuit is involved in ground-breaking work in its rulings, and he
has frequently referred to the court's behavior as ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   A Decided Shift in Philosophical Bent
</P>
<P>
   The circuit, one of 12 regional appeals courts, covers Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas, and its rulings are
theoretically binding in only those states. For years, the 4th
Circuit, which was at the heart of the civil rights battle, was
considered a fairly liberal court. But by the time Reagan was
elected in 1980, many of the judges were nearing retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reagan and Bush allowed committed conservative aides to
take over the task of selecting judges. Wilkinson, as a Justice
Department official in the Reagan administration, helped pick
judges, as did Luttig, who was a Justice Department official in the
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., also played a role in shaping the
court. Helms has blocked President Clinton's efforts to fill two
seats historically allocated to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Helms had urged that one of the vacancies be filled with a
longtime associate, Terry Boyle, a judge on the district court.
After that did not happen, the senator blocked all other
candidates, administration and Senate officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   And although the five states covered by the 4th Circuit have a
higher percentage of blacks than any other regional circuit, it
remains the only federal appeals court never to have had a minority
member.
</P>
<P>
   Little Hope for Appeals in Death Penalty Cases
</P>
<P>
   Among its other notable rulings, the 4th Circuit has rejected
complaints from gay rights advocates who challenged the Clinton
administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals in
the military. The court also ruled that the Food and Drug
Administration did not have the power to regulate nicotine as a
drug, a victory for tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the 4th Circuit is literally death on defendants
in death penalty cases. James Liebman of the Columbia University
Law School said a study to be published soon shows that the 4th
Circuit ``by far, gives the least relief of any circuit in the
country that has a sizable number of death penalty cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebman's study shows that in recent years, federal appeals
courts nationwide have granted new hearings for death-row inmates
in about 40 percent of all habeas corpus cases. The 4th Circuit did
so less than 4 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conservative outlook of the judges is usually the defining
factor in these kinds of case,'' he said, ``and it's especially
dramatic in the 4th Circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   John Blume of the Cornell University Law School, who represents
death-row prisoners, principally in South Carolina, said state
prosecutors were almost disdainful of district court judges who
grant habeas petitions because they know they will win on appeal to
the 4th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This circuit is the black hole of death penalty cases,'' he
said. ``In the last 26 cases in which the death-sentence petitioner
prevailed at the trial level, the circuit reversed. How can the
district judges be wrong every single time?''

YOUNG PUBLISHER GIVES VOICE TO THE `YOUNG AND MIXED AND PROUD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Matt Kelley reads media accounts about
interracial people, he often feels as if he has entered ``The
Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Hi, My name is Matt. My mother is Korean. My father is
white.... I'm sooooo proud,' '' he says, mocking the tone of quotes
in those articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more to us, to our experience, than that!''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than knock the media _ for using lame quotes or
portraying multiracial people as exotic or hip _ he has become the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has created Mavin, a new magazine that gives voice to a
growing but under-served market of readers: young people from
multiracial backgrounds as well as children who are adopted by
parents of a different ethnic background than their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were so starved for this,'' Kelley says, sipping a
glass of water in the small apartment _ World Headquarters! he
jokes _ where he edits Mavin. The second issue of the glossy comes
out next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This magazine fills a big void,'' he says, his eyes growing
big.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley looks like your run-of-the-mill, 20-year-old publisher
and editor-in-chief. He sports a clean-shaven face and a buzz-cut.
His speech is edgy and whip smart, like a hip-hop rapper who aced
his SAT verbals. When he gets excited, he peppers his sentences
with ``yada, yada, yadas.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is well-read and can lecture like a grad student on how
Christianity helped to preserve African culture among slaves in
Cuba. A plastic yellow bag he was carrying one recent afternoon had
three magazines: The New Yorker (``I enjoy the writing style'');
XXL (``It's about hip-hop and they've got an interesting layout'');
and Cigar Aficionado (``Well, it's not for the cigars!'')
</P>
<P>
   It would not be a slam to call him a grandmama's boy because,
well, he is; he has dinner with his 82-year-old grandmother up to
five times a week. But when it comes to Mavin, Kelley is
bareknuckled and all business.
</P>
<P>
   As deadlines loom, he spends up to 100 hours a week editing,
assigning stories and calling photographers. ``I just go into
another state of mind,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The number of general-circulation publications for multiracial
people can be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, on a few fingers,'' says Candy Mills, who edits and
publishes three of the most widely recognized magazines on
interracial issues _ Interrace Magazine, Raising Black and
Bi-Racial Children, and Interrace Singles.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who is black and married to a white man, is regarded as a
pioneer. She started Interrace in 1989 while in college, then
created the other two magazines to leave a legacy for her children.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly Interrace reaches 25,000 people, despite facing
hurdles such as skittish advertisers and the long hours it takes to
produce each issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a labor of love,'' Mills explains. ``(Matt) should stick
in there. It is tough. But the rewards will come. There is a
population out there to get at.''
</P>
<P>
   Census numbers point to a vast pool of potential readers.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down
the nation's last anti-miscegenation laws, the number of
black-white marriages has multiplied sixfold, from an estimated
51,000 in 1960 to more than 330,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account white-Asian couples and other interracial
pairings, the number of mixed-race marriages is estimated to be
more than 1.4 million. And for each interracial couple, there is a
broader extended family of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, whose mother is Korean and father is white, had seen
publications _ some now defunct _ created by adults in interracial
relationships. Many of those publications, he said, failed to
tackle issues faced by the offspring of those unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have to integrate both experiences in a way their
parents cannot fully understand,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to have enough foresight to see a market
niche among the burgeoning population of biracial youths.
(Estimates put the number of biracial people nationwide at between
2 million and 5 million, though exact figures are hard to come by
because of how people choose to identify themselves.) It is an
entirely different matter to have the moxie to make a magazine for
readers of any race in a nation already flooded by more than 18,000
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of
America, a New York-based trade group, said he had never heard of a
magazine for multiracial kids. But Mavin does draw his interest.
``I'm the father of multiracial children,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kummerfeld said Kelley is wise to target young people because
teens and young adults are one of the fastest growing segments of
the $25 billion-a-year magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mavin can grasp its target audience the way other niche
magazines have, focusing on pig farming or hip-hop music, will be
determined by the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so hard to launch a magazine,'' Kummerfeld says.
``Launching is the easy part.''
</P>
<P>
   Survival depends on securing a solid subscription base, rallying
good advertisers, getting a printer you can trust and handling
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley says he's up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm young,'' he shrugs. ``And when am I ever going to have
another opportunity like this? Anyway, I always do best when I'm
overextended.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people appreciate his cool confidence and professionalism.
Victoria Namkung, a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who
contributes to Mavin, said Kelley has ``more going for him at 20
than some magazine publishers twice his age.''
</P>
<P>
   The praise and attention are blossoming. The story of the
magazine _ and the young man behind it _ has drawn the interest of
reporters from local Korean newspapers to national newspapers to
Japanese radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz has not gone to Kelley's head, even though just a few
years ago he was a typical kid on Bainbridge Island, Wash., running
his own gardening consulting business and finishing up at Seattle's
prestigious Lakeside School, where he had an ``A-minus'' average.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year, however, he had a ``life-transforming''
experience. He and a friend made a prank call to the home of a
classmate who had applied to Brown University. The friend, who used
a phone at Kelley's house, pretended to be a Brown admissions
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Unnerved, the classmate traced the call to Kelley's house. When
Lakeside officials found out, they asked Kelley for his
collaborator's name. He refused, though he says he apologized to
the classmate.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Brown, where Kelley also had applied, learned
about the misrepresentation. Kelley said the school notified Brown
but Lakeside officials said they learned about it after the
classmate notified Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, Kelley's first-choice school, rejected him. Although no
one knows whether the prank played a role in Brown's decision,
Kelley feels Lakeside nuked his chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very tough,'' he recalls, shaking his head.
``There were incidents much more serious at the school that got
others a slap on the wrist ... I felt as if I was not valued as a
student of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung, Kelley went on to another highly regarded school,
Wesleyan University in Connecticut. There, he plunged into creative
arts, edited The Ankh, a literary magazine for students of color,
and organized campus gatherings for multiracial students.
</P>
<P>
   Fate then stepped in. One day Kelley wrote a poem about his
part-time work in Seattle at Childhaven, an agency for abused and
neglected children. The poem, which touched on his bond with the
kids, many of whom were minorities, unleashed deep emotions inside
him _ emotions so powerful he became emboldened to be more
expressive on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Kelley was sitting in front of a computer terminal
at college. His heart still burned over the Brown rejection. But he
resolved to take such negative experiences, tap into positive ones
_ like his work at Childhaven _ and channel it all into a forum for
others to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I did have a love for journalism, expressing
myself,'' he says. ``I was very excited to create a forum to
write.''
</P>
<P>
   He left Wesleyan after his freshman year to give Mavin its
wings.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's first issue came out in January, touting itself
as a celebration of the mixed-race experience. It featured articles
on ``hapas,'' the Hawaiian term for people of partial Asian
descent; portraits of the mixed-race people; and an essay about
being black and biracial in a world that likes to categorize
people.
</P>
<P>
   The masthead proclaimed: ``We're here and we're intelligent,
creative, talented and beautiful.... we're redefining what it means
to be young and mixed and proud and loud and subtle and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming second issue is 64 pages _ 18 pages bigger than the
first. There will be 7,000 copies of the issue which will deal with
a broader array of topics, including Kelley's dispatch from his
visit to Cuba and an interview with Amy Hill, the half-Japanese,
half-Finnish comedian who played the grandmother in the short-lived
sitcom, ``All-American Girl'' in the mid-1990s. For levity, there's
a spoof: ``Mulatto for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley says he does not see Mavin as a manifesto, though he
realizes some people may perceive the magazine as having a
political agenda. It's not about politics, he says, it's about
people.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is a family affair. His older sister, Joanna Lee, a
fashion designer in New York City, serves as Mavin's creative and
managing editor. His parents _ mom is an accountant, dad a
stockbroker _ are supportive from the sidelines. And there is an
extended family of photographers and writers who give true meaning
to the free in free-lance. By using volunteers, he is able to keep
Mavin's cover price down to $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Each issue costs about $15,000 to print. Kelley said he covers
costs with financial support from friends and family, in addition
to subscriptions and ads.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine can be found in Vancouver, B.C., Los Angeles, New
York and several other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley plans to keep Mavin going, but he wants to go back to
school this fall and publish from a house near the Wesleyan campus.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Kelley was invited to Lakeside to speak about his
foray in magazine publishing.
</P>
<P>
   He could not make it _ not for reasons of the past, he says, but
because of the future. He had to take care of baby Mavin, which
means in Hebrew-Aramaic, ``one who understands.''

WATSON ENDS CAREER ON PGA TOUR WITH BIRDIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tom Watson left his final interview at a PGA
Tour event yesterday and walked toward a flock of fans waiting for
an autograph. As he considered his future on the Senior PGA Tour,
he summed up his 29 years as a regular tour player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a nice run,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it has.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who turns 50 in September, only has the major
championships _ the U.S. and British Opens and possibly the PGA
Championship, if he gets an exemption _ left on his schedule. He
came to the MasterCard Colonial to defend his title, and in the
process reminded fans what they were losing.
</P>
<P>
   On his last hole, the 427-yard, par-4 No. 18, the 42-time winner
recorded a birdie, getting him to even-par 280 for the tournament.
Touchingly, Watson, who has won eight major championships and more
than $9 million in career earnings, ended his PGA Tour career the
same way it started. In 1971, he birdied his first hole as a pro,
recording a 4 on No. 1 of the PGA National Golf Course in Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started with a birdie,'' Watson said. ``It's nice to end
with a birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty more in between, but one of Watson's most
memorable birdies came at Colonial during last year's final round.
Forced to play from an awkward stance out of the fairway bunker at
the par-4 No. 9, Watson hit it over the water hazard and onto the
green, then made the putt that sparked his victory.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, he had the same shot yesterday, except the ball
was plugged in the bunker. This time, he didn't reach the green,
hitting his ball in the water hazard. But in dramatic fashion, he
took his penalty stroke, dropped behind the hazard and promptly
chipped it in for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do it again,'' Watson said. ``I just had a bad
lie in the bunker. But it was a great four!''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Watson will take his exemption as a
past champion and return to Colonial in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a chance,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   And what would clinch it?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had won, then maybe I could say for sure,'' Watson said.

 &HT;    The pride of Zoo Atlanta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Zulu, and I'm an 8-year-old African lion who lives at
Zoo Atlanta. You might remember my 1 1/2-year-old cub, Kariba, who
was in News For Kids a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever touched the rough tongue of a pet cat? My tongue
is like that _ after all, lions are big cats _ but much bigger,
rougher and
</P>
<P>
   stronger. I use it to clean my fur and to pull meat from bones.
I could take the skin off a human hand with two licks. (Which is
one reason they keep me in a secure pen at the zoo!)
</P>
<P>
   Here's more about me:
</P>
<P>
   My scientific name: Panthera leo.
</P>
<P>
   What I eat: Meat. At Zoo Atlanta, it's fed to me. If I were in
Africa, I'd eat gazelles, zebras, crocodiles and many other
animals. Sometimes lions even eat animals as big as hippopotamuses!
</P>
<P>
   How lions live: In the wild, we live in ``prides,'' or groups of
four to more than 30 lions, sharing food. Female lions usually
catch the animals we eat. They stalk their prey until the last
second, then try to run it down in a sprint. Many times the animal
gets away, and the lioness must try again. Male lions like me don't
hunt very much, but we protect the pride from outsider lions.
</P>
<P>
   How long lions live: In the wild, many lions die as cubs, and
adults often perish by age 10, from attacks by people, other lions
or prey animals. In zoos, where they're protected from such
attacks, they can live to 25 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   A cool thing about me: My roar, which in Africa would help me
communicate with my pride and scare away other lions, can be heard
up to five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Another cool thing: In captivity, lions have sometimes mated
with tigers. The cub of a male lion and a female tiger is a called
a ``liger.'' The cub of a female lion and male tiger is called a
``tigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental note: Lions aren't endangered species, but our
numbers have declined because people have taken over many of the
places where we used to live.

   SCHOOL VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Teen wounds 6 students
</P>
<P>
   A student opened fire in a Georgia school last week, exactly one
month after the attack at Columbine High School in Colorado. Police
said a 15-year-old boy wounded six of his classmates at Heritage
High School in Conyers, about 20 miles east of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The student brought two guns into the school and began shooting
before the first bell. Friends said he was upset because his
girlfriend had broken up with him. He was charged with aggravated
assault and will probably appear in court today.
</P>

   New leader elected
</P>
<P>
   Israelis last week elected Ehud Barak to be their new prime
minister. Now he has 45 days to bring together members of the
Israeli parliament to support his programs. The members who agree
to support Barak's policies will make up his multi-party, or
``coalition,'' government.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he wants a coalition ranging greatly in beliefs.
``When there is a broad government, the public can more easily
accept decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to make peace in the area. Israel is a Jewish
nation, which has fought for years with surrounding Arab countries,
whose residents are mostly Muslim.

   MOTORCYCLE MANIA
</P>
<P>
   Daredevil jumps canyon
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle daredevil Robbie Knievel jumped 228 feet over a
sliver of the Grand Canyon last week. He broke his own world record
for a motorcycle jump by 5 feet. Fireworks erupted and a crowd of
several hundred cheered as he soared over the 200-foot-wide gorge
at 90 mph on an ordinary 500cc motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   If he failed, Knievel could have plunged 2,500 feet to the
canyon floor.
</P>
<P>
   Knievel was going to attempt the jump on April 29, but it was
canceled at the last minute because of wind and cold. Knievel said
his daredevil father, Evel Knievel, had wanted to jump the Grand
Canyon but never got the chance.

<P>
   Trees with a past
</P>
<P>
   Kids across the country can own a descendent of one of the last
trees planted by Johnny Appleseed.
</P>
<P>
   Appleseed, whose real name was John Chapman, planted many trees
in the early 1800s. He died in 1845 at age 71.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Meyer took cuttings from the wood and roots of an Ohio tree
planted by Appleseed before its recent death. In his greenhouse, he
grew thousands of saplings from the cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   You can get one of the saplings for $35, plus shipping, by
calling 800-320-TREE or by surfing to www.americanforests.org. The
proceeds go to American Forests, a nonprofit group that promotes
tree planting and preserves historic trees.

   SUIT COMPLICATES OFFERING PLANNED BY JOHN HANCOCK
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Insurance has been moving smoothly toward a
reorganization that would allow it to sell shares to the public,
but a Massachusetts appeals court has reinstated a lawsuit by a
policyholder that dredges up an old scandal in which the company
acknowledged that its lobbying violated state law.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation revives questions about the integrity and
management of John Hancock, one of the United States' largest life
insurers, at a time when the company has been doing everything
possible to enhance its attractiveness to potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY FEUD ANNOYS WALL STREET
</P>
<P>
   Although the feud between Walt Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner
and his former lieutenant Jeffrey Katzenberg has had little effect
on the public's perception of the company, Wall Street is not happy
watching Disney air its dirty linen in public. The company's stock
has been depressed for months, primarily because of disappointing
earnings, but some analysts think the lawsuit has also been a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   MACROMEDIA ADDS FUN AND GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia, the multimedia software publisher, plans to
introduce an Internet entertainment strategy on Monday that will be
based on a media-player program similar to software developed by
Real Networks, Microsoft and Apple Computer. The company plans to
set up a Web site and introduce versions of its Shockwave format
that will enable computer users to find and play games, music and
material from movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLESOFT TO NAME NEW PRESIDENT
</P>
<P>
   Peoplesoft, a leading seller of business management software,
plans to announce Monday that Craig Conway, a former Oracle
executive, will become its president and chief operating officer.
He joins a company that has seen its growth slow as big
corporations delay buying software because of possible Year 2000
computer problems.

   CANON CHASES LOW-END MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Canon, which has been nipping at the heels of Xerox in the
market for expensive high-speed copiers, is trying to bite chunks
out of Hewlett-Packard, Xerox and Lexmark in the market for slower,
cheaper printers.
</P>
<P>
   TV NEWS SHOWS FORM PERSONALITIES
</P>
<P>
   While skeptics said that the networks had stuffed too many news
magazines into their schedules and that the genre would become
either puffy or stale, all the magazines did reasonably well for
the season, and almost all were renewed for the fall. Producers and
executives say that the news magazines, which cost less to make
than other shows, have developed individual personalities, although
there is some overlap.
</P>
<P>
   SEARCH FOR HARPER'S BAZAAR EDITOR
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen Black, the president of Hearst Magazines, caused a
fracas recently after approaching Bonnie Fuller, the editor in
chief of Glamour magazine, to see whether she wanted to run
Harper's Bazaar, which was edited by Liz Tilberis until her death
last month. Ms. Fuller declined, but the commotion has drawn
attention to an important editorial race. Ms. Black's choice of a
new editor will affect the company's cultural direction.

<P>
   COPYCATS SEEK TO EMULATE EBAY
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming popularity of the online auction giant Ebay _
with a $22 billion market value and millions of daily visitors _
has inspired a convoy of copycat sites hoping to ride on its
success. Whether Ebay's success can be duplicated is anyone's
guess, but it has clearly stumbled onto something that has never
been seen before.

 &HT;    The pride of Zoo Atlanta
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My name is Zulu, and I'm an 8-year-old African lion who lives at
Zoo Atlanta. You might remember my 1 1/2-year-old cub, Kariba, who
was in News For Kids a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever touched the rough tongue of a pet cat? My tongue
is like that _ after all, lions are big cats _ but much bigger,
rougher and
</P>
<P>
   stronger. I use it to clean my fur and to pull meat from bones.
I could take the skin off a human hand with two licks. (Which is
one reason they keep me in a secure pen at the zoo!)
</P>
<P>
   Here's more about me:
</P>
<P>
   My scientific name: Panthera leo.
</P>
<P>
   What I eat: Meat. At Zoo Atlanta, it's fed to me. If I were in
Africa, I'd eat gazelles, zebras, crocodiles and many other
animals. Sometimes lions even eat animals as big as hippopotamuses!
</P>
<P>
   How lions live: In the wild, we live in ``prides,'' or groups of
four to more than 30 lions, sharing food. Female lions usually
catch the animals we eat. They stalk their prey until the last
second, then try to run it down in a sprint. Many times the animal
gets away, and the lioness must try again. Male lions like me don't
hunt very much, but we protect the pride from outsider lions.
</P>
<P>
   How long lions live: In the wild, many lions die as cubs, and
adults often perish by age 10, from attacks by people, other lions
or prey animals. In zoos, where they're protected from such
attacks, they can live to 25 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   A cool thing about me: My roar, which in Africa would help me
communicate with my pride and scare away other lions, can be heard
up to five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Another cool thing: In captivity, lions have sometimes mated
with tigers. The cub of a male lion and a female tiger is a called
a ``liger.'' The cub of a female lion and male tiger is called a
``tigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental note: Lions aren't endangered species, but our
numbers have declined because people have taken over many of the
places where we used to live.

   SCHOOL VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   Teen wounds 6 students
</P>
<P>
   A student opened fire in a Georgia school last week, exactly one
month after the attack at Columbine High School in Colorado. Police
said a 15-year-old boy wounded six of his classmates at Heritage
High School in Conyers, about 20 miles east of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The student brought two guns into the school and began shooting
before the first bell. Friends said he was upset because his
girlfriend had broken up with him. He was charged with aggravated
assault and will probably appear in court today.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the sixth mass shooting at an American high
school or middle school since October 1997.

WITH PITCHING UNSETTLED, METS CALL UP ISRINGHAUSEN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to bolster a starting rotation hit by
injuries, the New York Mets recalled Jason Isringhausen from their
Class AAA farm club Sunday and said he would start Monday night
against the Pirates in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets said that Al Leiter would probably not start again
until next Sunday because his left bicep is still sore as he had
overcompensated for a ligament strain in his left knee. Bobby
Jones, who has had a string of poor outings, will miss at least one
start with shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen, a 26-year-old right-hander who has not pitched in
the major leagues since undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery
after the 1997 season, is 3-1 with a 2.53 earned run average with
47 strikeouts in 461/3 innings for the Norfolk Tides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's built up enough of a foundation to come up here and
pitch,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, one member of the Mets' front office suggested that
Isringhausen might remain with the team instead of going back down
to Norfolk after one start. He would presumably shift to the
bullpen when Leiter and Jones are healthy again. But Jones, who has
allowed 20 earned runs in 132/3 innings over his last three starts,
might be in line for a stint in long relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``That remains to be seen,'' Phillips said. ``Jason will make
one start. Then we'll see how Bobby feels and how Al feels and
we'll piece it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was re-examined by Dr. David Altchek, the team physician,
during Sunday's game at Shea Stadium. He will not pick up a ball
for four or five days to see if the tendinitis in his shoulder
calms down. ``And if it's not better by Thursday, I'll have to
undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said that Jones probably would not pitch
again for eight or nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, meanwhile, was preparing to toss batting practice
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he thought he had identified something from
videotapes that might be hampering Leiter's velocity. ``We all know
Al is rather violent in his delivery,'' Valentine said as he
demonstrated the difference in Leiter's follow-through with tapes
from last season and from Leiter's start on Thursday. ``But now it
looks like he gets shot, like his delivery is short-circuited.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes show that Leiter has lost the exaggerated kick of his
back leg on his follow-through, which might be causing Leiter to
overcompensate with his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like his back foot is tied to the pitching rubber
and then it can only go so far before it stops,'' Valentine said.
The Mets feared that could lead to something more serious than the
bicep soreness Leiter has been experiencing since his May 10 start
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's troubles began on April 28 against San Diego, when he
strained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee. In both
that start and his previous start, he allowed one earned run. But
in the four starts since then, Leiter _ who signed a four-year, $32
million deal during the off season _ has allowed 35 hits and 24
earned runs in 22 innings, an e.r.a. of 9.82.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Leiter is 2-4 with a 6.38 e.r.a. in nine starts,
after going 17-6 with a 2.47 e.r.a. last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was trying to throw where I didn't feel my knee as
much,'' Leiter said. ``But it looks like somebody shot my leg on
the left side and it's just dragging through. I've been using my
upper body to compensate. I want to be able to get that explosive
feeling off the rubber back, without feeling sore the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will have Leiter tape his knee the way a football
player might and then see if he can throw freely in the bullpen
against hitters before he starts again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put him at risk, and we can't allow Al to put himself
at risk in May because of an `I'm the guy' mentality, an `I've got
to right this wrong' attitude, and `the team needs me' stuff,''
Valentine said.

PONCIANO HELPS DAY CATCH ON WITH RAIDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Donnell Day has an NFL contract, and much of the
credit goes to Ron Ponciano, Cal State Northridge's head football
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Day, an All-Big Sky Conference defensive back last season as a
senior, went undrafted in April and hadn't had any free-agent
feelers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Ponciano acted. He called Bruce Lemmerman, the New
Orleans Saints' director of college scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmerman, a former CSUN player, scanned the rosters of every
NFL team and noticed the Oakland Raiders had a habit of signing
smaller cornerbacks; Day is almost 5-foot-9 and about 180 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano connected Day with the Raiders. Day, who had three
interceptions and 32 tackles last season, signed after an
impressive free-agent minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Raiders) were really pleased,'' Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   So is Ponciano. Day is the second CSUN player from the 1998 team
to sign a free-agent contract this spring; wide receiver Mike Ogas
signed with the St. Louis Rams last month.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely power: Home runs were the story for the softball team
in the first two days of the NCAA regional playoffs at UCLA,
whether the Matadors were hitting them or giving them up.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising shot came from senior second baseman Katrina
Nolletti, who hit a three-run homer Friday in the Matadors' six-run
second inning in their playoff-opening 7-3 win over Missouri. It
was only the second homer of Nolletti's CSUN career, and she didn't
hit any over-the-fence home runs in four years at Fresno's Bullard
High.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Nolletti's parents, Vince and Marianne, said
they could remember Katrina hitting only ``four or five'' homers in
her softball career, including on all-star traveling teams.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the future: CSUN's athletic department may be facing an
$800,000 deficit, but there isn't a lack of talent on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball team re-established itself as the top college
source for local talent; CSUN signed two of the City Section's top
pitchers _ Granada Hills' Kameron Loe and Sylmar's Ivan Hernandez _
as well as a top shortstop, Moorpark's Wes Rasmussen.
</P>
<P>
   Taft High's Marquis Brignac, a football signee, won the
Northwest Valley League title in the 100 meters May 14 and also ran
a leg on the Toreadors' record-setting 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Men's basketball recruit Craig Calloway, a senior guard at Long
Beach Jordan High, was a Long Beach Press-Telegram all-star
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a contract: A three-year contract between California
State University administrators and faculty, which was tentatively
agreed upon May 10, was good news for CSUN head baseball coach Mike
Batesole.
</P>
<P>
   Interim athletic director Sam Jankovich indicated two weeks ago
that the faculty labor dispute put his contract negotiations with
Batesole in limbo. Batesole's contract ends in June and he is
seeking a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   The new union contract, which gives professors more control over
merit raises, must be ratified by union membership and Cal State's
Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Kopita leaving: Ron Kopita, CSUN's outgoing vice president of
student affairs who had a rocky run as the overseer of the
university's athletic department, announced May 13 he accepted a
similar job at Wichita State.
</P>
<P>
   Kopita, 55, was a central figure in the cutting of four men's
sports in 1997. He also was criticized when then-women's basketball
coach Michael Abraham was arrested on campus last November on
drug-trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN President Blenda Wilson stripped Kopita of his
responsibilities with the athletic department after Abraham's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he gets to Phoenix: Danny Phillips, a junior
outfielder who led the Matadors in home runs (16) and RBI (61) this
season, works out for the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a
pre-draft camp.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who went undrafted last year after playing at Pierce
College, said he's taking a different approach to the pro draft.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he waited by the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking off for a few days,'' he said. ``My sister is going
to be a secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   Other CSUN players anticipating a call for the two-day draft,
which starts June 2, are junior outfielder-pitcher Darryl Grant,
junior catcher Jeremy Sickles, junior first baseman Adrian Mendoza
and senior second baseman Kevin Patrick.

   CHICAGO _ Yes, its front lawn is newly filled with jumbo
sculptures by Keith Haring. But no, the Museum of Science and
Industry _ Chicago's special hometown blend of Barnum &AMP; Bailey,
Popular Mechanics, Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Wizard and World's
Fair _ has not suddenly gone arty.
</P>
<P>
   Deep inside the museum, baby chicks are still hatching.
</P>
<P>
   The Haring show, which began this month and runs through Sept.
12, is a graphic reminder _ in red, yellow, blue and green _ of how
the institution on the South Side is trying to reinvigorate itself
and compete for hearts and dollars in the pastime world of
information, entertainment and retailing.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's chick hatchery, a 45-year-old exhibit that has
little to do with science or industry, may be an even more potent
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a paradox faced by science centers nationwide: some
of their biggest attractions are their oldest and least
sophisticated displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exotic can be pre-industrial,'' said Neil Harris, a
professor of history at the University of Chicago and a student of
American cultural institutions, who allowed that ``watching the
chickens hatch was always my favorite.''

   Science centers find themselves in a ``constant struggle'' to
balance nostalgia and novelty, said Ellen Griffee, director of
government and public relations for the Association of
Science-Technology Centers in Washington, which counts 324 members
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, for
example, couples have been engaged and married in the walk-through
human heart. And when the 707 airliner parked outside had to be
removed in 1987 to accommodate a building expansion, the institute
gave a farewell party in its honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do like the comfort level of something you're familiar
with, yet the mind wants to explore something new,'' Ms. Griffee
said. ``Science centers are not the nation's attic.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Kevin Ahlgrim of La Porte, Ind., who returned to
the Museum of Science and Industry this month for the first time in
20 years, with an 11-year-old son in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was curious to see if they still had the coal mine,''
Ahlgrim said. ``I was glad they did.'' The exhibit, which opened in
1933, allows visitors to descend a 50-foot hoist and ride a work
train through what appear to be real tunnels carved from sheer
walls of Illinois coal.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, a 14-year-old from Waukegan, Ill., Jason Keeton, took
a moment off from writing a computer program for a robotic
ball-throwing device in the ``Lego Mindstorms'' exhibit to ponder
what he most liked in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That big heart,'' he said, meaning a thumping, low-tech,
16-foot-high model through which visitors have been circulating
since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she had brought friends from Palm Desert, Calif.,
to watch chicks scramble out of their eggs, Meryl Cohen of Skokie,
Ill., a regular visitor to the museum for more than 30 years, said,
``It's about the struggle for life.''
</P>
<P>
   David R. Mosena, the president and chief executive of the Museum
of Science and Industry, surveyed the crowd around the glass-walled
hatchery. ``The human, emotional draw to this exhibit is
profound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a collection of icons,'' Mosena said. ``Part of our
audience is coming back with fond memories of things that they want
to show their children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosena sees nothing incongruous about 10 Harings frolicking like
anthropomorphic lollipops around the corner from the museum's other
large outdoor artifact: a German submarine captured off French West
Africa in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, congruity has never been a strong suit at the
museum, which was founded by Julius Rosenwald, the president of
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. It is housed in Art Deco galleries built in
the reconstructed shell of the Palace of Fine Arts from the 1893
World's Columbian Exposition; set like a neoclassical tiara across
one end of Jackson Park, eight miles south of the Loop.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.75 million people visit every year _ all on the same
afternoon, it can sometimes seem, to judge from the button-pushing,
lever-cranking, wheel-turning, knob-spinning commotion.
</P>
<P>
   As the lines blur between information, entertainment and
retailing, the Museum of Science and Industry must vie with tourist
attractions such as Navy Pier, where one can shop or ride a
150-foot-high Ferris wheel, and the DisneyQuest virtual ``theme
park'' that is to open near the Loop this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums are in competition for people's leisure time,'' said
Mosena, a Tennessee native who became the museum's president in
1997 after running the Chicago Planning Department, the staff of
Mayor Richard M. Daley, the Aviation Department and the Chicago
Transit Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't attract a crowd, sell them lunch, sell them a
trinket, we're not in business,'' Mosena said.
</P>

<P>
   A family of four can expect to pay $26 just to park and walk in
the door, although school groups always get in without charge and
Thursdays are free for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Before admission fees were instituted in 1991, the museum
estimated attendance at up to 4 million visitors annually. With the
fees, it dropped nearly in half, although the 2 million figure
still made it the best-attended museum in Chicago. When parking was
seriously disrupted by the construction of a new 1,500-space
underground garage, attendance fell further, to 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the garage is open, the number of visitors has begun to
grow again, Mosena said. Sixty percent of the museum's $40 million
annual operating budget comes from admission fees, food and retail
sales and special events. The rest comes from a city subsidy,
fund-raising and earnings on its endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest corporate backers are United Airlines (one of
its 727 jets is cantilevered from the east balcony), the Ameritech
Corp. (sponsor of the communications hall) and Abbott Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, makers of an antiviral drug, supported ``AIDS: The War
Within,'' an exhibit dealing with a realm in which neither science
nor industry have triumphed. ``The AIDS exhibit is not designed to
sell a product, it's designed to educate,'' Mosena said. ``I don't
think the commercial underwriting is blatant commercialization.
It's understated and enlightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking briskly around the 15-acre museum, Mosena makes plain
how eager he is to freshen exhibits like ``Food For Life,'' where
the hatchery sits. The gallery looks like a 1970s rerun with its
mechanical conveyor belt on which plastic facsimiles of servings
from the five food groups rotate endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Mosena plans to turn the hall into a biotechnology exhibit,
focused on DNA, cloning and other advances in genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, on baby chicks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a drive to become a dominant force in the digital
world and take advantage of investor enthusiasm for Internet
stocks, the sprawling media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG is laying
plans to take more of its online operations public.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann is already preparing a public stock offering for
later this week in its online book-selling joint venture with
Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., Barnesandnoble.com. And it has announced plans
to issue shares in its Berlin-based Web site and software design
concern, Pixelpark. But those only presage other Bertelsmann stock
offerings in coming months, according to Thomas Middelhoff, the
company's chief executive and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates, Middelhoff would specifically cite only
Springer-Verlag, a professional book publisher that offers more
than 400 technical and medical journals through an information
service called Link. But the company's Internet operations also
include the music site Getmusic.com and an expanding group of
online bookstores in Europe called BOL.com, for Bertelsmann Online.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its Web push, Bertelsmann, which is based in
Guetersloh, Germany, also hopes to make Internet access more
affordable in Europe, where users complain bitterly about having to
pay not only a charge for connection time but also a separate rate
for use of the underlying telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, Middelhoff said last week, the
company plans to switch to a package of fixed monthly rates for
subscribers of America Online Inc.'s Europe operation, in which
Bertelsmann owns a 50 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff also said that Bertelsmann and Microsoft Corp. were
considering joining in a bid for Deutsche Telekom AG's cable
television operations, so that Bertelsmann ultimately could sell
music titles over the Internet through those high-capacity cable
lines. ``We are having preliminary discussions,'' he said, ``very
preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   With projected revenue of $18.5 billion next year, Bertelsmann
is the world's third-largest media company, behind only Time Warner
Inc. and Walt Disney Co. But it is a private company, so
Bertelsmann has not had publicly traded stock to use as a currency
for deal-making in this age of stock deals.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Bertelsmann had the kind of high profile and brand
recognition that lend instant cachet to a public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this Internet world, we compete with companies that are
public,'' said Middelhoff, who is intent on competing with nimble
rivals like Amazon.com. ``How do we compete with such cash-rich,
aggressive Internet companies? We decided that the only way to
handle that competition is we have to bring our Internet companies
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff discussed the plans in an interview in his 44th-floor
office above Times Square, in the headquarters of Bertelsmann's
U.S. operation, where he typically works at least one week a month.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming chief executive last year, he has been intent on
raising the profile of Bertelsmann, which spans more than 50
countries with almost 60,000 employees in 300 subsidiaries _
including the top trade-book publisher in the United States, Random
House Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's plan to take more companies public in the coming
months is part of a broader corporate trend, according to David
Brodwin, an associate partner at Andersen Consulting, a management
and technology consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in the first wave, one of the pioneers,'' Brodwin
said. ``All the major media companies are wrestling with how to
compete with the Internet and how to compete with start-ups. Most
of these companies are public and they simply can't afford to spend
the kind of money that the competition are able to spend based on
their initial public offerings. They can't afford to do the kinds
of deals that they can for stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ``spin-outs,'' as Brodwin called them, can present
potential problems in large companies. One is that managers in the
parent corporation's core companies may resent the stock options
that managers in newly public companies receive. Another is that it
could heighten tensions and divisions between rival divisions of a
far-flung organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Middelhoff seems ready to take that risk with companies like
Springer-Verlag, in which Bertelsmann acquired a majority stake
last year for $597 million. Springer, which has offices in
Manhattan's Flatiron Building, is seen as having particular appeal
for investors because of its Link advanced electronic network.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff was reluctant to identify other companies that could
be offered to the public, other than indicating they would probably
be Internet plays. He took pains, though, to say the list would not
include Random House, which Bertelsmann acquired last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random House? Never, never, never will this jewel ever be
brought public,'' he said. ``Unthinkable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Middelhoff's comments were interrupted occasionally
by the vibrations of a band performing in a nearby room for
executives from Bertelsmann's music business, whose labels include
Arista, RCA and Windham Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But he pressed on, repeatedly stressing that the company must
move rapidly. ``We have to become No. 1 in all our content
businesses and we have to be No. 1 as far as the media and
e-commerce business is concerned,'' he said. ``Worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's offering of Barnesandnoble.com, he said, is an
example of that new aggressiveness. The two partners are planning
to sell 25 million shares, or about 18 percent of the company. Each
will retain about a 41 percent interest in the new company. (Barnes
&AMP; Noble has a business tie to The New York Times, selling books
through links from the newspaper's Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff is also tending to the political aspects that will
come with owning a publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   He is considering offering some sort of stock options to all
Bertelsmann managers to avoid creating two classes of executives
within the corporation. He is also expanding the seminars offered
through ``Bertelsmann University,'' a business training program
offered in conjunction with Harvard University that seeks to
increase cooperation among the company's various managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to achieve the changes we want is through the
brains of our executives,'' Middelhoff said. ``And they really have
to understand that they're going to have to change their minds. If
you have a corporate culture, which believes that they don't have
to change, then with such a culture we will not survive.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps his most difficult problem is promoting the image of
Bertelsmann, which will be an important part of attracting
investors for the various spin-outs. Bertelsmann may be the
third-ranked media company in the world, but its brand name does
not have the widespread recognition of a Disney or Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're very concerned about their image as Germans,''
said Albert Greco, an associate professor of business at Fordham
University who studies media management. ``There's no brand
recognition. They did that on purpose for a long time and now when
they're thinking of branding the company they have to have a
different strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even as Middelhoff discussed the company's plans for
aggressive expansion, he described what sounded like a
political-style campaign to explain the company's motives so that
its activities are not perceived as threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann has commissioned surveys in Spain, France, Germany
and the United States, for example, to gauge how the company is
viewed. And Middelhoff has been making speeches about the impact of
the Internet and scheduling visits with the editorial boards of
major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   He has also started to dabble in high-profile charities. Last
week the actress Meryl Streep was one of several guests at a
fund-raiser reception held in his Manhattan office for Quality Now,
a women's human rights organization. Middelhoff was supposed to be
the host but had to return to Germany for business and could not
participate. Still, he managed to call Ms. Streep from Germany to
thank her for her participation.

COMMENTARY: CLINTON'S COMPULSION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We have a president who has a problem: he lies when
he doesn't really have to.
</P>
<P>
   This mysterious compulsion is not to be confused with the
rational falsehood. His finger-wagging denial of a sexual
relationship last year was designed to cut off further inquiry, and
he could logically assume at the time he would not be contradicted
by hard evidence. It was a calculated deception by a well-ordered
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptions this year are different. Not only were the
misleading statements made about the weightiest matters _ war and
national security _ no purpose was served in uttering them. That's
the puzzling part.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on March 24, he said: ``I do not intend to put our
troops in Kosovo to fight a war.'' He reiterated that policy time
and again. Vice President Gore dutifully followed his line when
asked in April, ``Are there any circumstances under which you would
support using American ground troops?'' Gore replied: ``That option
is not under consideration ... that option was removed from
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was criticized immediately by Sen. John McCain and in
this space for taking the potential use of troops off the table at
the start. Even Clinton supporters now concede that the president
erred by giving Slobodan Milosevic an assurance against invasion.
When the leader of the Western alliance, Britain's Tony Blair, told
Clinton recently that ground troops must at least be assembled, and
when the NATO commander argued that the bombing alone would not
accomplish the mission, Clinton properly changed his policy.
</P>
<P>
   But he could not bring himself to say forthrightly that the time
had come for such new pressure on Serbia. Instead, he insisted that
he had ``always said ... that we have not and will not take any
option off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just not so, and everybody knows it. Why does he do it?
Does he imagine that nobody will remember what he has been saying
all along?
</P>
<P>
   His diehard defenders explain that his words ``to fight a war''
limited the meaning of ``do not intend to put our troops in
Kosovo.'' Under that parsing, he intended only to put them in a
``permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   That's demonstrably untrue, too. His secretary of state says
that the 50,000 NATO troops might well be used in a
``non-permissive environment.'' (That euphemism for invasion means
``a place where soldiers shoot at you.'' When is NPE Day?)
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the unnecessary lie was his March 19 response
to: ``Can you assure the American people that under your watch, no
valuable nuclear secrets were lost?''
</P>
<P>
   We now know that he had been briefed last November about the FBI
and CIA suspicions, and in January had received the secret Cox
committee report detailing security lapses during the Clinton
``watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carefully rephrased the question: ``Can I tell you that
there has been no espionage at the labs since I have been
president? I can tell you that no one has reported to me that they
suspect such a thing has occurred.'' And again: ``To the best of my
knowledge'' (he wasn't even under oath) ``no one has said anything
to me about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the
labs during my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   A deliberate deception. On NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on May 9,
Tim Russert extracted from Energy Secretary Bill Richardson an
admission that Clinton was ``fully, fully briefed'' on espionage in
``past and present administrations.'' Clinton aides evidently
savaged Richardson for letting the truth be badgered out of him. On
ABC's ``This Week'' Sunday, that vice presidential hopeful threw
his credibility on his sword, telling Sam Donaldson the president
was ``correct'' in his deception. Here's why Clinton inserted ``at
the labs'' and ``against the labs'' in his answers. As Richardson
lamely explained: ``we don't know whether it came from our labs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus does the requirement to cover the president's slippery
prevarications corrupt everyone loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the truth will out, but deeper questions will remain:
Why the Clinton compulsion to pretend he never makes a mistake? Why
the sneaky word games when the truth is sure to come out? What
mental process accounts for his strange habit of unnecessary
denial?

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ When Laurent Kabila's army neared this capital
two years ago to topple the country's long-ruling dictatorship,
Bernardin Mungul Diaka urged residents to wear white armbands, wave
white flags and greet the rebel leader as their liberator.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Diaka, who was a prominent opponent of the former
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, describes his call as the ``biggest
mistake'' of his political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that Kabila's administration is 100 times worse than
Mobutu's,'' said Diaka, a onetime prime minister under Mobutu,
whose 31-year reign is remembered most for its staggering
corruption and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting someone better, and we were handed someone
worse,'' he said. ``So the worse one makes me regret the lesser of
two evils. In short, in two years, I think Kabila has had only
failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after he seized power and 10 months into a rebel
insurgency that is now aimed at overthrowing him, Kabila's
popularity as president is declining rapidly here.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel groups backed by Congo's neighbors control at least half
the country, Africa's third-largest, dividing it into several
pieces. With the help of other neighboring countries, Kabila was
able to avoid defeat at the hands of the rebels last August, but
now those allies are looking for a way out of an unpopular war that
has drawn in troops from seven regional powers.
</P>
<P>
   In Kinshasa, Kabila's perceived weakness has emboldened
opponents to voice their criticisms aloud, even as the government
has stepped up arrests of critics and journalists. A collapsing
economy, punctuated by skyrocketing food prices, gas shortages and
inflation topping 600 percent last month, seems to have eroded
Kabila's standing even further.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to May 17, the day on which Kabila took
power in 1997, reports swirled around the capital that residents
were buying up whistles to blow a symbolic ``fin de match,'' or end
of game, for the president. Whether the reports were exaggerated or
not, the government, clearly nervous, did not bother to find out,
sending in soldiers the night before to man checkpoints all over La
Cite Indigene, the slums where most of Kinshasa's six million
residents live.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'est l'homme qu'il fallait!'' proclaim billboards showing
Kabila's beaming face at several intersections, most of them near
government buildings. ``It's the man we needed!'' But the billboard
at Rond Point de la Victoire, La Cite's busiest corner, was taken
down. Neighborhood residents said people had been mocking the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``With time, we hope there will be a change in leadership,
because the current leaders are the same as the ones in the past,''
said Mbiya Kalondji, 40, who sold fake Nike tank tops on a table in
a market in Masina, a district near the international airport.
``The government is not popular because we don't have food or jobs.
Some people even long for the past. At least under Mobutu, there
was no war and we had food.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Masina jeered at Kabila's passing motorcade last
month. Youths hurled rocks and women bared their bellies to call
attention to food shortages. Even Mobutu loyalists now openly
criticize Kabila. ``Under Mobutu, at least the situation was not as
catastrophic as it is now,'' said Omari Leasisi, a former Governor
in the eastern Kivu region under Mobutu, who died in exile in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is splintered into three or four parts,'' he said,
pointing out that Kabila has paid his allies by giving them access
to Congo's mineral resources. ``To stay in power, does he have to
cede everything to foreigners?''
</P>
<P>
   Berci, the leading polling agency here, showed that Kabila's
popularity spiked in the months after August. But after its monthly
polls showed it has been falling fast since January, government
officials visited the office of its director, Olivier Kamitatu. The
intimidation forced him to cancel his report last month, Kamitatu
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government marked its second year in power this month by
holding a seven-hour parade in a stadium, attended by soldiers and
civilians wearing T-shirts made for the occasion. Kabila did not
address the crowd. But that night, he delivered a televised speech
that played to his people's deep resentment over foreign
intervention in Congo's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer foreigners, big or small, who will, as in the
past three decades, nominate our leaders,'' said Kabila, who was
plucked from obscurity by Rwanda and Uganda to lead a successful
rebellion against Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Mumengi, the minister of information, said there was no
evidence pointing to a decline in the government's or Kabila's
popularity. ``If the head of state were not popular,'' Mumengi said
in an interview, `` there would not have been a parade of seven
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kabila took over the former Zaire, he promised that
elections would be held in April 1999. But the government has put
them off because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In August, rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda began a campaign
against Kabila in eastern Congo and, after flying troops into
western Congo, almost seized the capital. Rwanda and Uganda both
supported Kabila in his war against Mobutu, but he cut off his ties
to them after the relationship made him unpopular among Congolese.
</P>
<P>
   But at the last minute, Kabila won the support of several
neighbors, including Angola and Zimbabwe, whose troops helped him
defeat the rebels in western Congo. Since then, the rebel forces
are said to have advanced westward, even though they are now split
into at least three factions, each holding on to a slice of Congo.
They are also believed to be approaching the diamond-producing
areas in the south that are the government's main source of
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here say it is unclear how much longer Kabila's main
allies, the Angolans and Zimbabweans, who entered the conflict for
their own domestic reasons, will support him.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Kabila's weakening position, he has made a series of
what appear to be concessions in recent months. He has agreed to
meet with the Congolese rebels, after vowing never to talk to what
he called puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. But talks held in various
African nations have led nowhere, despite the frequent
announcements of breakthroughs, because the war has drawn in so
many nations and factions.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the government called for a national debate to which
Congolese political parties would be invited. The idea received a
cold response from opposition leaders, whom Kabila has treated with
open contempt since taking power two years ago, accusing them of
having collaborated with Mobutu. The government has allowed
political parties to organize, but because of a long and intricate
process, no party has been recognized yet.

METS' 5-RUN NINTH STUNS A HARDY SCHILLING
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Curt Schilling, the major league leader in complete
games, completed another one Sunday. But he did not do it the way
he had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the ninth inning with a 4-0 lead, Schilling allowed the
Mets to bat around and emerge with a stunning 5-4 victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies at a rain-soaked Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The last two runs came on John Olerud's two-out single to left
field, one pitch after Schilling (7-2) had grazed Edgardo Alfonzo
with a 1-ball-2-strike 96-mile-per-hou fastball to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pitch to Alfonzo ended up burying me,'' Schilling said of
the pitch that nicked Alfonzo's right forearm, the second batter
Schilling hit in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the game,'' said Schilling, who looked crestfallen and
who sat long in the dugout after the game. ``The pitches I had made
up to that point, I had a chance to get him out. And I didn't want
Olerud up in that spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Lopez and Roger Cedeno scored on Olerud's third hit of the
day as he extended his batting streak to 13 games. Cedeno's
right-foot-first slide just beat catcher Mike Lieberthal's tag
after an outstanding one-hop throw from left-fielder Ron Gant.
Cedeno celebrated by pumping his fists upward as he lay on his back
over home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right guy on second base,'' an ecstatic Manager
Bobby Valentine said after a mad Mets' celebration. ``He's probably
the only guy in the league who could score on that throw. Gant made
a perfect throw. But Roger's a rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are in sole possession of second place in the National
League East after taking two of three games from the Phillies for
the second weekend in a row. Last week, however, they did not face
Schilling in Philadelphia, who Sunday was searching for his
major-league leading eighth victory.
</P>
<P>
   And for eight innings, it looked as if those Mets players who
were grumbling before an almost two-hour rain delay of the start of
the game were right when they said the Mets had the perfect pretext
for calling the game on account of the weather, thereby avoiding
Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets also had ticket sales of 34,950 that they did not
want to lose that gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird game,'' said Valentine. ``We sit around for an
hour and some people started saying, `Should we even play this
game? We should issue an executive edict and miss Schilling and
maybe he'll be in the American League the next time we play them.'
There was a lot of that going around. And if we didn't win that
game, there would have probably been a lot of second-guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, all the second-guessing was faced by Philadelphia
Manager Terry Francona, who did not have his closer, Jeff Brantley.
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Curt was in complete control of the game,'' said
Francona, who had Wayne Gomes and Jim Poole warming up.
``Regardless of who was available, that was his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling _ who threw his fifth complete game (and fourth in a
row) with a season-high 138 pitches _ had made 109 pitches through
the first 8 innings. He had scattered seven hits _ all singles _ as
no Mets runner advanced past second base. Heading into the ninth,
Schilling had retired nine in a row. And even though Schilling
allowed a lead-off single in the ninth to Mike Piazza, he had
registered 96 mph on the radar gun during the at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went 1 for 4 off him,'' said Piazza on the first anniversary
of his first game in a Mets' uniform. ``And I feel like I had a
good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura was next. ``I don't want to hear anybody saying he
lost it,'' Ventura said. ``He pitched nine innings and didn't lose
anything off his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, some control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran a fastball in to Ventura that I didn't get in enough,''
Schilling said of Ventura's two-run home run that cut the lead to
4-2. ``And the balls I threw to Lopez and Alfonzo, I got in too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1-2 pitch from Schilling struck Lopez on the back of the right
elbow, following a one-out single by Matt Franco, the first batter
he had hit in 81 and a one-third innings. Jermaine Allensworth then
provided a run-scoring pinch-hit single between third and short,
and it was a 4-3 game.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno was the next batter. He had struck out looking three
times and was 0 for 4 on the day. On an 0-1 pitch, Cedeno lined a
ball back through the box. Schilling knocked it down and his throw
to second forced Allensworth. But shortstop Alex Arias' alert throw
to third was just a tad too late to catch Lopez off the bag. And
when Cedeno took took second base without a throw by the catcher,
the stage was set for Schilling to hit Alfonzo _ and then for
Olerud to come up with the game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particular pitch I had already fouled off on my first
three at-bats,'' said Olerud of the low and away fastball he lined
into left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you should choke and blow a 4-0 lead,'' said
Schilling, still wondering how he had lost. ``I don't care who you
are.''

PILOTS SAY FAA IGNORES A SAFETY RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States' second-largest airline pilots union is
accusing the Federal Aviation Administration of refusing to enforce
a safety rule because many airlines find compliance too costly.
</P>
<P>
   The rule requires that pilots get at least eight hours of rest
in the 24 hours before the end of their flight duties. The
controversy mainly affects reserve pilots, who, if they are awake
in the day and then are assigned to an overnight flight, may end up
being awake for close to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The union, the Allied Pilots Association, which represents the
9,500 pilots at American Airlines, has asked Kenneth Mead, the
Department of Transportation's inspector general, to investigate
why the FAA has not enforced the 1985 regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of the FAA to enforce current regulations
regarding crew rest is an industrywide problem and a major cause of
pilot fatigue that is seriously compromising aviation safety,''
Richard Rubin, a 767 jetliner captain and a member of the union's
national safety committee, wrote to Mead on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has acknowledged on several occasions over the last
decade that airlines have not been complying with the rule and that
the FAA has not been enforcing it. But Margaret Gilligan, the FAA's
deputy associate administrator for regulation and certification,
said in an interview on Friday that it was not clear whether
airlines were in compliance, because the FAA had not conducted a
formal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly some perception that there may be one or
more programs that are not in compliance,'' Ms. Gilligan said.
Nevertheless, she said she was recently directed by the FAA's
administrator, Jane Garvey, to determine how the agency should
enforce the rule.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a turnabout from what Rubin said was Ms.
Gilligan's position in March. He said she told the Allied Pilots
Association's president, Richard Lavoy, that the FAA would not seek
to enforce the regulation, despite its promises to do so. Ms.
Gilligan said she had not meant to give that impression.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of fatigue has become a growing focus of pilots and
safety experts in all modes of transportation in recent years.
Tired pilots have been blamed for a number of crashes, including
the 1993 crash of a DC-8 cargo plane at the U.S. Naval Air Station
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study concluded that being awake continuously for 20
to 25 hours is equivalent to having a blood alcohol level of 0.1,
well over the legal limit for airline pilots.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the National Transportation Safety Board placed
increased rest at the top of its annual list of recommendations for
avoiding transportation accidents. The board, which has no
regulatory authority, also has expressed frustration that the FAA
has chosen not to enforce the rule for airline pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the American pilots union, the Air Line Pilots
Association, which is the industry's largest union, representing
53,000 pilots at 52 airlines, has also raised concerns about the
issue. On May 13, Duane Woerth, the union's president, wrote to Ms.
Garvey asking her to ``expeditiously enforce'' the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the rule has been simmering for most of
this decade. The Air Transport Association, the lobbying group for
the major airlines, contends that fatigue is not a problem and that
compliance with the rule would cost its members hundreds of
millions of dollars because they would have to hire more pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the major U.S. scheduled airlines give their pilots
ample time off to rest, and none of them has had a fatal accident
attributed to pilot fatigue,'' the association said.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation states that airlines must give pilots at least
eight hours of guaranteed rest in the 24 hours before they finish
their flight duty. The requirement poses no conflict for senior
pilots who fly regular schedules. But thousands of so-called
reserve pilots can spend several days in a row awaiting a call to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current practice at American, United Airlines, Delta
Airlines and other major airlines, a reserve pilot who woke up at 8
a.m. might be called in the late afternoon to fly an evening flight
that would land at 7 a.m. the next day. The pilot would be awake
continuously for 23 hours by the time the flight duty ended.
</P>
<P>
   The few airlines that comply with the regulations, including
Continental Airlines and United Parcel Service, divide their
reserve pilots into groups assigned to rest at different times of
day.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the American captain who has focused on the fatigue
issue, said Continental and UPS had to increase their pilot ranks
by only 2 percent to make the system work. But he emphasized that
cost was not the point. ``The regulation sets this rule as the
standard for safety,'' he said, ``To operate under the regulations
requires this expense, period.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The FAA proposed amending the rule in 1995, promising at the
time to enforce the 1985 rule if no change was made. But after
soliciting the views of pilots, airlines and other interested
parties, the rule was not amended and the agency did not act.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the FAA again promised to ``rigorously'' enforce the
rule if an industry-pilot task force failed to agree on a new
standard. That initiative ended in failure in February, after which
Rubin, a member of the task force, said Ms. Gilligan of the FAA
indicated that the agency would not keep its promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for the FAA to go against the ATA because
it is so powerful,'' he said of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gilligan said that she has now been asked by Ms. Garvey, the
FAA administrator, ``to pursue a vigorous enforcement strategy.''
But she added that the agency first would have to investigate
whether airlines were violating the rule. Then the airlines must be
given time to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we have accepted what they have been doing for so
long,'' she said, ``they need to have an opportunity to make
changes, if that is appropriate.''

HUGE TERN COLONY THREATENS COLUMBIA RIVER'S DWINDLING SALMON RUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICE ISLAND _ The Caspian tern banks and lands on the sand, a
young salmon dangling from its beak.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty as charged.
</P>
<P>
   The tern's feeding, so natural and ordinary, has become a menace
to Columbia River salmon recovery. Caspian terns have built one of
the world's largest tern colonies here, about 20 miles east of
where the river empties into the Pacific Ocean, and are thought to
be gobbling as much as one-quarter of the Columbia Basin's
dwindling salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Though man is largely responsible for the bird's explosive
growth here, he's finding that hard to change. This spring,
biologists are urging the birds to leave, but most of the ingrates
are refusing to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable how many birds are here,'' biologist Ken
Collis muttered last week, as he watched more than 10,000 of the
seabirds stand, sit, squawk and shuffle around on the west end of
this island.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Tern Relocation Project, which Collis advises, aims
to shift the terns downriver to a former nesting spot where they
would eat fewer salmon. The project has wielded bulldozers and farm
equipment, scarecrows and decoys, fencing and guns.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the birds are staying put. Last Friday, about 12,000
terns jammed into a corner of Rice Island, by Collis' estimate.
They loafed, nested, squawked, and feasted on salmon and steelhead
that included threatened and endangered runs. Some even nested next
to a 3-foot-tall wooden scarecrow painted to look like a bald
eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds on Rice Island are a lot more determined to nest
there than we thought,'' says Dan Roby, another biologist advising
the relocation project.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is another illustration of the lengths man must go to
correct problems he causes by messing with Mother Nature. The
lesson keeps cropping up here, in one of the most engineered rivers
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dammed and dredged this river
and its tributaries. When its fish runs started failing, the Corps
put fish ladders on most dams to get adults upriver and built
bypasses and barges to carry young fish downriver.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough. Governments threw up hatcheries to produce
fish where dams, farming, logging or development wiped out spawning
streams. They implanted fish with tags, transponders and radios;
spilled more water over dams; counted and studied fish; and offered
bounties for killing fish that prey on young salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago did federal and state agencies focus on the
little-noticed Caspian terns.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Caspian sea in southern Asia, this largest of the
tern species is found on seacoasts and inland lakes almost
throughout the globe's temperate regions.
</P>
<P>
   The fish-eating birds were first seen nesting in the lower
Columbia River in 1984, on East Sand Island, about five miles from
the sea. In 1986, they also colonized Rice Island, about 20 miles
from the river's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Both islands are artificial creations where the Corps of
Engineers dumped sand dredged from the river. They made excellent
nesting grounds for terns, which prefer bare, open sand near the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Fishery biologists worried as the Rice Island colony grew to an
extraordinary 10,000 nesting pairs. Elswehere a group of 2,000 is
considered a lot. The group on this artificial island became the
largest in North America, researchers said, perhaps the largest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   After aerial surveys found a lot of salmon radio-tags
broadcasting from Rice Island, a study was commissioned in 1997. To
fish managers' dismay, it concluded that the terns were eating an
extraordinary 6 million to 25 million salmon, steelhead and trout _
or about 6-to-25 percent of the run below Bonneville Dam.
</P>
<P>
   To salmon biologists, the birds could hardly have picked a worse
site. Out-migrating young salmon and steelhead run into their first
salt water near Rice Island, and some linger to adjust. They are
easy marks; especially hatchery fish that are conditioned to feed
on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The terns were feasting on a handful of threatened or endangered
runs whose decline threatened to impose costly fixes from
Washington's Methow Valley to Idaho's Redfish Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of upstream salmon fixes latched on to the tern study
to resist demands on water, barging and cheap, dam-generated
hydroelectric power. Instead, they blamed fishing, Caspian terns,
seals and sea lions for the runs' demise.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies and wildlife groups squabbled over what to do. Some
agencies and fishing groups wanted to rid Rice Island of the birds.
But citing the International Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Fish
and Wildlife Service and the Audubon Society came to the terns'
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Under a compromise plan launched last February, an interagency
team tried to make most of Rice Island inhospitable to the terns by
planting winter wheat in the sand. It left an acre unplanted so
that as many as 1,000 pairs of terns could stay to be monitored and
to sustain the population if terns couldn't nest elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team set out to lure the terns to their former
nest site downriver on East Sand Island. Researchers figured the
birds would catch a hefty share of small marine fish there,
reducing their toll on salmon.
</P>
<P>
   With heavy equipment, researchers cleared grass and trees from
part of East Sand Island, which they festooned with tern decoys and
recorded tern calls.
</P>
<P>
   Though cold, wind, rain and coarse sand kept most of the wheat
from sprouting, researchers found another solution. They
criss-crossed the nesting site with 3-foot-high, black-plastic
fencing. It worked. Terns avoided the fences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as of last week, terns were packing into the one acre of
open ground like Manhattan sun-bathers hitting the Coney Island
beach in a heat wave. As more arrived, terns spilled onto nearby
areas where small plants, disturbed by the project, had failed to
resprout. Hybrid western and glaucous-winged gulls made repeated
forays into the crowd of squawking terns, stealing smolts and
burgling nests.
</P>
<P>
   The Rice Island terns behave strangely, according to Collis.
They fight amongst themselves, spook easily and fail to protect
their nests from attack. Similar problems the past two years have
left them with few young, so dispersing the colony should be good
for the birds as well as the salmon, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Local Audubon Society chapters complain that the terns are being
scapegoated. The birds weren't even present while the basin's
salmon and steelhead runs plummeted, they note.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some Pacific County residents fear that
moving terns to East Sand Island will defeat their habitat
restoration effort for salmon in nearby Chinook Creek.
</P>
<P>
   And some locals question the kid-glove handling of the terns. A
few predators on the island would solve the problem, says Rex Ziak
of Naselle. In fact, researchers have trapped raccoons and other
nest predators that they believe people put on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The project is far from meeting the goal of moving 80 percent to
90 percent of the colony from Rice Island. But Collis says that
goal was unrealistic for a seabird transplant that had never before
been attempted.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the project is a success. It has demonstrated that
the terns can be moved, though not micro-managed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, about 1,000 terns were counted on East Sand Island,
and with a few strategic shots from a .22-caliber rifle,
researchers were keeping predator gulls at bay from the new colony.
As crowding and predation continue on Rice Island, meanwhile,
Collis hopes more terns will take the East Sand Island way out.

YOUNG PUBLISHER GIVES VOICE TO THE `YOUNG AND MIXED AND PROUD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Matt Kelley reads media accounts about
interracial people, he often feels as if he has entered ``The
Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Hi, My name is Matt. My mother is Korean. My father is
white.... I'm sooooo proud,' '' he says, mocking the tone of quotes
in those articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more to us, to our experience, than that!''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than knock the media _ for using lame quotes or
portraying multiracial people as exotic or hip _ he has become the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has created Mavin, a new magazine that gives voice to a
growing but under-served market of readers: young people from
multiracial backgrounds as well as children who are adopted by
parents of a different ethnic background than their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were so starved for this,'' Kelley says, sipping a
glass of water in the small apartment _ World Headquarters! he
jokes _ where he edits Mavin. The second issue of the glossy comes
out next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This magazine fills a big void,'' he says, his eyes growing
big.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley looks like your run-of-the-mill, 20-year-old publisher
and editor-in-chief. He sports a clean-shaven face and a buzz-cut.
His speech is edgy and whip smart, like a hip-hop rapper who aced
his SAT verbals. When he gets excited, he peppers his sentences
with ``yada, yada, yadas.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley is well-read and can lecture like a grad student on how
Christianity helped to preserve African culture among slaves in
Cuba. A plastic yellow bag he was carrying one recent afternoon had
three magazines: The New Yorker (``I enjoy the writing style'');
XXL (``It's about hip-hop and they've got an interesting layout'');
and Cigar Aficionado (``Well, it's not for the cigars!'')
</P>
<P>
   It would not be a slam to call him a grandmama's boy because,
well, he is; he has dinner with his 82-year-old grandmother up to
five times a week. But when it comes to Mavin, Kelley is
bareknuckled and all business.
</P>
<P>
   As deadlines loom, he spends up to 100 hours a week editing,
assigning stories and calling photographers. ``I just go into
another state of mind,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The number of general-circulation publications for multiracial
people can be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, on a few fingers,'' says Candy Mills, who edits and
publishes three of the most widely recognized magazines on
interracial issues _ Interrace Magazine, Raising Black and
Bi-Racial Children, and Interrace Singles.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who is black and married to a white man, is regarded as a
pioneer. She started Interrace in 1989 while in college, then
created the other two magazines to leave a legacy for her children.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly Interrace reaches 25,000 people, despite facing
hurdles such as skittish advertisers and the long hours it takes to
produce each issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a labor of love,'' Mills explains. ``(Matt) should stick
in there. It is tough. But the rewards will come. There is a
population out there to get at.''
</P>
<P>
   Census numbers point to a vast pool of potential readers.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down
the nation's last anti-miscegenation laws, the number of
black-white marriages has multiplied sixfold, from an estimated
51,000 in 1960 to more than 330,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account white-Asian couples and other interracial
pairings, the number of mixed-race marriages is estimated to be
more than 1.4 million. And for each interracial couple, there is a
broader extended family of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, whose mother is Korean and father is white, had seen
publications _ some now defunct _ created by adults in interracial
relationships. Many of those publications, he said, failed to
tackle issues faced by the offspring of those unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have to integrate both experiences in a way their
parents cannot fully understand,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to have enough foresight to see a market
niche among the burgeoning population of biracial youths.
(Estimates put the number of biracial people nationwide at between
2 million and 5 million, though exact figures are hard to come by
because of how people choose to identify themselves.) It is an
entirely different matter to have the moxie to make a magazine for
readers of any race in a nation already flooded by more than 18,000
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of
America, a New York-based trade group, said he had never heard of a
magazine for multiracial kids. But Mavin does draw his interest.
``I'm the father of multiracial children,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kummerfeld said Kelley is wise to target young people because
teens and young adults are one of the fastest growing segments of
the $25 billion-a-year magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mavin can grasp its target audience the way other niche
magazines have, focusing on pig farming or hip-hop music, will be
determined by the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so hard to launch a magazine,'' Kummerfeld says.
``Launching is the easy part.''
</P>
<P>
   Survival depends on securing a solid subscription base, rallying
good advertisers, getting a printer you can trust and handling
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley says he's up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm young,'' he shrugs. ``And when am I ever going to have
another opportunity like this? Anyway, I always do best when I'm
overextended.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people appreciate his cool confidence and professionalism.
Victoria Namkung, a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who
contributes to Mavin, said Kelley has ``more going for him at 20
than some magazine publishers twice his age.''
</P>
<P>
   The praise and attention are blossoming. The story of the
magazine _ and the young man behind it _ has drawn the interest of
reporters from local Korean newspapers to national newspapers to
Japanese radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz has not gone to Kelley's head, even though just a few
years ago he was a typical kid on Bainbridge Island, Wash., running
his own gardening consulting business and finishing up at Seattle's
prestigious Lakeside School, where he had an ``A-minus'' average.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year, however, he had a ``life-transforming''
experience. He and a friend made a prank call to the home of a
classmate who had applied to Brown University. The friend, who used
a phone at Kelley's house, pretended to be a Brown admissions
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Unnerved, the classmate traced the call to Kelley's house. When
Lakeside officials found out, they asked Kelley for his
collaborator's name. He refused, though he says he apologized to
the classmate.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Brown, where Kelley also had applied, learned
about the misrepresentation. Kelley said the school notified Brown
but Lakeside officials said they learned about it after the
classmate notified Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, Kelley's first-choice school, rejected him. Although no
one knows whether the prank played a role in Brown's decision,
Kelley feels Lakeside nuked his chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very tough,'' he recalls, shaking his head.
``There were incidents much more serious at the school that got
others a slap on the wrist ... I felt as if I was not valued as a
student of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung, Kelley went on to another highly regarded school,
Wesleyan University in Connecticut. There, he plunged into creative
arts, edited The Ankh, a literary magazine for students of color,
and organized campus gatherings for multiracial students.
</P>
<P>
   Fate then stepped in. One day Kelley wrote a poem about his
part-time work in Seattle at Childhaven, an agency for abused and
neglected children. The poem, which touched on his bond with the
kids, many of whom were minorities, unleashed deep emotions inside
him _ emotions so powerful he became emboldened to be more
expressive on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Kelley was sitting in front of a computer terminal
at college. His heart still burned over the Brown rejection. But he
resolved to take such negative experiences, tap into positive ones
_ like his work at Childhaven _ and channel it all into a forum for
others to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I did have a love for journalism, expressing
myself,'' he says. ``I was very excited to create a forum to
write.''
</P>
<P>
   He left Wesleyan after his freshman year to give Mavin its
wings.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's first issue came out in January, touting itself
as a celebration of the mixed-race experience. It featured articles
on ``hapas,'' the Hawaiian term for people of partial Asian
descent; portraits of the mixed-race people; and an essay about
being black and biracial in a world that likes to categorize
people.
</P>
<P>
   The masthead proclaimed: ``We're here and we're intelligent,
creative, talented and beautiful.... we're redefining what it means
to be young and mixed and proud and loud and subtle and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming second issue is 64 pages _ 18 pages bigger than the
first. There will be 7,000 copies of the issue which will deal with
a broader array of topics, including Kelley's dispatch from his
visit to Cuba and an interview with Amy Hill, the half-Japanese,
half-Finnish comedian who played the grandmother in the short-lived
sitcom, ``All-American Girl'' in the mid-1990s. For levity, there's
a spoof: ``Mulatto for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley says he does not see Mavin as a manifesto, though he
realizes some people may perceive the magazine as having a
political agenda. It's not about politics, he says, it's about
people.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is a family affair. His older sister, Joanna Lee, a
fashion designer in New York City, serves as Mavin's creative and
managing editor. His parents _ mom is an accountant, dad a
stockbroker _ are supportive from the sidelines. And there is an
extended family of photographers and writers who give true meaning
to the free in free-lance. By using volunteers, he is able to keep
Mavin's cover price down to $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   Each issue costs about $15,000 to print. Kelley said he covers
costs with financial support from friends and family, in addition
to subscriptions and ads.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine can be found in Vancouver, B.C., Los Angeles, New
York and several other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley plans to keep Mavin going, but he wants to go back to
school this fall and publish from a house near the Wesleyan campus.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Kelley was invited to Lakeside to speak about his
foray in magazine publishing.
</P>
<P>
   He could not make it _ not for reasons of the past, he says, but
because of the future. He had to take care of baby Mavin, which
means in Hebrew-Aramaic, ``one who understands.''

GEPHARDT VOWS SPEEDY HOUSE VOTE ON GUN BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, vowed
Sunday to press for a House vote this week on the first major
anti-gun bill to clear one chamber of Congress since the
Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. He predicted that GOP
moderates would be wounded politically if they block it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a lot of pressure'' this week, Gephardt
said in an interview. ``Frankly, these measures are modest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, 58, a Missouri Democrat who has led his party in the
US House of Representatives since 1995, was in Boston to address
graduates at Suffolk University's Law School and take part in a
forum on women's issues sponsored by the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, hours after gunfire erupted in a Georgia high school,
the Senate approved legislation that would require safety locks on
new handguns, ban juveniles with a history of violence from buying
a firearm, and stop the importation of large ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have said they will hold hearings this week on
the measure, but have not agreed to a speedy vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt, saying ``the earth is shifting under everybody's
feet on this issue,'' said the Democrats believe the time for
hearings has long since passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who are really troubled by this are the
moderate Republicans,'' who, Gephardt said, risk appearing ``like
they're part of a group that's dominated by'' the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader decided in February that he had a
better chance of becoming the next Democratic House speaker than he
did defeating Vice President Al Gore for their party's presidential
nomination next year. The Democrats need to pick up six House seats
if Gephardt, a House member for 22 years, is to wrest the speaker's
gavel from the GOP when the 107th Congress convenes in January
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats have ``their hands full'' in their
efforts to retain the White House and take back the House. But he
called the recent spate of stories about troubles within Gore's
campaign exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is the front-runner and the front-runner always gets
knocked at by everybody's who after him. That's normal,'' Gephardt
said. ``I think that at the end of the day he will win the primary
and I think he's going to win the general election. He's a good
candidate. He's smart. He's experienced. He's probably the best
vice president anybody's ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense scrutiny now being endured by Gore, said Gephardt,
awaits the Republican presidential front-runner, Texas Governor
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be formidable. But I do think'' Bush ``can be
beaten,'' Gephardt said. ``I think he hasn't been tested at all. He
hasn't been out of Texas. He's going to have his day in the tub.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt ran unsuccessfully for president in 1988 and considered
running again in 1992, but he concluded then that President George
Bush looked unbeatable before an obscure governor from Arkansas,
Bill Clinton, emerged from the Democratic field to unseat an
incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has just written a book, ``An Even Better Place:
America in the 21st Century,'' which includes his diagnosis of what
is wrong with the country and his prescription for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of destruction, which I think has infected the
whole system, is driving voters and ordinary citizens away from
politics,'' Gephardt said. ``People hate it. They hate the
confrontation. They hate the attacks. They hate the endless
investigations. So they're disaffected, cynical, and they don't
participate. It is very worrisome.''

PRESIDENT PUSHES FOR PARENTAL LEAVE BENEFITS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAMBLING, La. _ Calling parents too stressed and overworked,
President Clinton said Sunday he would order a change in federal
regulations that would allow workers to collect unemployment
benefits while on leave to care for newborn or newly adopted
children.
</P>
<P>
   In a commencment address at Grambling University, the president
said the revisions would give states the authority in response to
inquiries from four states, Massachusetts, Maryland, Washington and
Vermont, which the White House said have bills pending in their
legislatures to allow them to use surpluses in unemployment
insurances programs to pay leave benefits to new parents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed greatly expanding the government's sick
leave policy to allow federal workers up to 12 weeks off with pay
to care for seriously ill family members. Neither action, White
House aides said, requires the approval of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the federal government needed to find ``creative
ways to help Americans use benefits they've worked for to finance
the time off they need for their families.''
</P>
<P>
   He said last month's killing of 14 students and a teacher at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., coupled with a recent
spate of hate crimes, underscored the importance of making ``the
bonds that tie parents to children stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a new study by his Council of Economic Advisers that
shows that more parents are working outside the home and have less
time for their children, he said, ``It all begins with family, with
parents who love their children more than life and raise them to
live their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, the percentage of married mothers in the
work force has nearly doubled over the last 30 years, from 38
percent in 1969 to 68 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Because more mothers are working outside the home and the number
of single-parent households has risen, parents now have 22 fewer
hours each week, or 14 percent less time, to spend at home than
they used to, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means by the time a child reaches the age of 18 in
Monday's world those 22 hours a week amount to over two years more
the parents are away from home,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the nearly 500 graduates, ``We as a nation must find a
way to give your generation of parents some of that time back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Family and Medical Leave Act, the first bill he
signed into law as president in 1993, ``just meets a fraction of
the need.'' Too many families, he added, ``can't take advantage of
the law because they can't afford to take the time off because they
can't live without their paychecks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``In our around-the-world, around-the-clock economy,
there just don't seem to be enough hours in the day for parents to
do everything they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton challenged the private sector to follow his lead by
allowing more paid sick leave to employees caring for a spouse,
child or parent with a serious illness like cancer, heart or kidney
disease.
</P>
<P>
   He has directed the Federal Office of Personnel Management to
revise its regulations to allow employees to use up to 12 weeks of
accrued sick leave each year to care for an ill family member.
Currently, most federal employees are limited to 13 sick days a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every company in America that offers sick leave to its
workers adopted the same policy we're adopting Monday, half of all
the American work force would have this important benefit for their
families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials estimated that about half a percent of the
federal workforce would use the option, costing the federal
government about $60 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also directed Labor Secretary Alexis Herman to draw up
the new regulations authorizing the expansion of the unemployment
insurance system.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton aides said it would be up to the states to decide
whether to use the surpluses most have in their unemployment
insurance programs to allow parents paid leave following the birth
or adoption of a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be strictly voluntary,'' said White House spokesman
Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the graduates at the historically black college,
``If you or any American has to choose between being a good parent
and successful in your careers, you have paid a terrible price, and
so has your country.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged school districts to ``unlock those empty classrooms in
the late afternoon, fill them with the sounds of children playing
and learning'' and prodded business ``to do more by helping their
own workers find and afford quality child care.''
</P>
<P>
   The commencement speech was the first of three Clinton will
deliver this spring. He will address graduates at the Air Force
Academy in Colorado on June 2 and the University of Chicago on June
12.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from
Grambling, was also offered a post-White House job by university
President Steve A. Favors, who enticed the president with offers of
Louisiana cuisine, including ``gumbo, jambalaya, crawfish . . .
collard greens, sweet potato pie and ham.''
</P>
<P>
   Favors said, ``We'll even allow you unlimited opportunities to
play the saxophone with the world-renowned Grambling State
University marching band,'' which, in a tribute to Clinton,
performed the song ``Heatwave'' during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``I was getting into this'' before Favors said he
was just kidding. ``I've got a good pension, I can work pretty
cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Favors was not the only one thinking about future jobs. As
Clinton began his speech, telling graduates that this was an
important day in their lives, one student yelled out, ``I need a
job!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied, ``Well, you'll be able to get one now.''

TOUGH-GUY MYTHOLOGY: LIFE IS THE ONLY SCHOOL FOR REAL NOVELISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: This article is part of the occasional series ``Writers on
Writing'' in which writers explore literary themes.)  (jw) 
 By KURT VONNEGUT Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The occasion for this piece is the publication by the University
of Iowa Press of ``A Community of Writers,'' essays and
recollections regarding the university's writers' workshop,
collected and edited by Robert Dana, the poet and retired Cornell
English professor. I taught full time at the workshop in 1965 and
1966 and began writing my novel ``Slaughterhouse-Five'' while
there.
</P>
<P>
   I had gone broke, was out of print and had a lot of kids, so I
needed the job most desperately. So did two other writers who took
up temporary residence in Iowa City along with me, Nelson Algren
and the Chilean Jose Donoso. I would later say of Paul Engle, who
not only ran but personified and electrified the workshop for many
decades, ``The Coast Guard should give him a medal for all the
drowning professional writers whose lives he's saved.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after I got there, Engle rescued an economically drowning
Richard Yates, one of the most excellent writers I ever met, a
second time. Engle, himself a poet, administered CPR in the form of
a salary to poets, too: George Starbuck, John Berryman, Marvin
Bell, James Tate, Robert Dana, Donald Justice and Robert Lowell,
just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And even though that was a third of a century ago, as I write,
the names of students as well are fresh in my mind: Andre Dubus,
Gail Godwin, Barry Jay Kaplan, Rick Boyer and John Irving and John
Casey and David Nilob, again, just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And Tennessee Williams and Flannery O'Connor long before my
time. One wonders what ever became of them.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject of creative writing courses is raised in
company as sophisticated as readers of this paper, say, two
virtually automatic responses can be expected. First a withering
``Can you really teach anyone how to write?'' An editor of this
very paper asked me that only two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   And then someone is almost certain to repeat a legend from the
old days, when male American writers acted like tough guys, like
Humphrey Bogart, to prove that they, although they were sensitive
and liked beauty, were far from being homosexual. The Legend: A
tough guy, I forget which one, is asked to speak to a creative
writing class. He says: ``What in hell are you doing here? Go home
and glue your butts to a chair, and write and write until your
heads fall off!'' Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   My reply: ``Listen, there were creative writing teachers long
before there were creative writing courses, and they were called
and continue to be called editors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times guy who wondered if anybody could be taught how to
write was taught how to write by editors. The tough guy who made
students and their instructor feel like something the cat dragged
in, possibly spitting on the floor after having done so, almost
certainly, like me, handed in manuscripts to his publisher that
were as much in need of repairs as what I got from students at the
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   If the tough guy was Thomas Wolfe or Ernest Hemingway, he had
the same creative writing teacher who suggested, on the basis of
his long experience, how the writer might clean up the messes on
paper that he had made. He was Maxwell Perkins, reputedly one of
the greatest editors of fiction who ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: A creative writing course provides
experienced editors for inspired amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   What could be simpler or more dignified? Or fun?
</P>
<P>
   When I quit a good job at General Electric to become a
free-lance writer 15 years earlier, there were only two
degree-awarding graduate programs in creative writing in which
short stories or poems or novels were accepted in lieu of theses:
Iowa and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   I had attended neither one. To have done so would have been good
for me. Vance Bourjaily, a permanent rather than transient member
of the workshop faculty in my time, said he regretted not having
apprenticed at Iowa or Stanford when he was starting out as a
novelist. That would have saved him, he said, the several years he
wasted trying to find out all by himself the best way to tell a
story.
</P>
<P>
   Much is known about how to tell a story, rules for sociability,
for how to be a friend to a reader so the reader won't stop
reading, how to be a good date on a blind date with a total
stranger. Some are more than 2,000 years old, having been posited
by Aristotle. I paraphrase Aristotle: If you want to be comical,
write about people to whom the audience can feel superior; if you
want to be tragical, write about at least one person to whom the
audience is bound to feel inferior, and no fair having human
problems solved by dumb luck or heavenly intervention.
</P>
<P>
   And let me say at this point that the best creative writing
teachers, like the best editors, excel at teaching, not necessarily
at writing. While I taught at Iowa in the company of literary
celebrities, the most helpful teachers there were two lesser-known
writers named William Cotter Murray and Eugene Garber.
</P>
<P>
   There are now at least 100 creative writing programs in American
colleges and universities, and even in Leipzig, Germany, as I would
discover when I was there last October. That the subject is taught
anywhere, given the daunting odds against anyone making a living
writing stories or poems, might appear to be a scandal, as would be
courses in pharmacy, if there were no such things as drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and our biggest secret about the Iowa Writers' Workshop was
that it was one of the greatest teachers' colleges in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The primary benefit of practicing any art, whether well or
badly, is that it enables one's soul to grow. So the proliferation
of creative writing courses is surely a good thing. Most came into
being in response to demands by college students during the 1960s
that their courses make more use of their natural impulses to be
creative in ways that were not emphatically practical. When I
taught at Harvard for a year, for example, that was because
students had asked for what they called ``a creative track.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuffa, chuffa, chuffa. Choo choo. Woo woo.
</P>
<P>
   When I taught at Iowa, then Harvard, then City College, here is
what I tried to get away with, only in effect, not actually: I
asked each student to open his or her mouth as wide as possible. I
reached in with a thumb and forefinger to a point directly beneath
his or her epiglottis. There is the free end of a spool of tape
there.
</P>
<P>
   I pinched it, then pulled it out gradually, gently, so as not to
make the student gag. When I got several feet of it out where we
could see it, the student and I read what was written there.

SPURS SAY FAREWELL TO LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With precision and ease, the San Antonio
Spurs helped the Los Angeles Lakers turn out the lights at the
Great Western Forum Sunday by flipping the switch on the Lakers'
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan scored 31 points in the first three quarters and
Jerome Kersey came off the bench with eight fourth-quarter points
to lead the Spurs to a 118-107 victory and a sweep of the
best-of-7-game Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs advanced to the conference finals, where they will
enjoy home-court advantage against the winner of the Portland-Utah
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did not go quietly, and Shaquille O'Neal responded to
his big-man challenge with Duncan by scoring a game-high 36 points.
After dominating the series, Duncan seemed to run out of gas and
was held to two free throws in the final period, finishing with 33
points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But San Antonio proved the better team, exploiting personnel
mismatches and better using its bench. The Spurs, with a cohesive
defense and balanced offense, also answered every Lakers run.
</P>
<P>
   The backbreaker came after the Lakers had cut the lead to 86-84
with a furious charge at the end of the third quarter, only to have
San Antonio reel off the first 13 points of the fourth quarter. The
Lakers, swept in last year's Western Conference finals by Utah, now
have team issues to deal with, and not just uniformed personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Will Kurt Rambis, who took over for Del Harris after 12 games,
return as head coach? Will Jerry West, shaken by the Dennis Rodman
episode, remain as executive vice president? And there will be the
inevitable speculation about Phil Jackson, the former Chicago Bulls
coach, replacing both of them.
</P>
<P>
   One replacement is definite: the Great Western Forum, the
playing address for West and Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, will give way to the new Staples
Center in downtown Los Angeles. The Lakers have played at the Forum
since Dec. 31, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The site of six world championships was given a sour farewell.
Game 4 started the way Game 3 had ended, with the Spurs leaning on
Duncan and Avery Johnson and with the Lakers in meltdown mode. San
Antonio led by 11 points midway through the first period.
Desperate, Rambis turned to Tyronn Lue in hopes of shutting down
Johnson, who already had 10 points. Lue, a quick rookie guard from
Nebraska, had not played in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Lue not only made Johnson disappear, he also took charge of the
Los Angeles offense, contributing eight points in his first eight
minutes in the game. But after watching its lead get whittled to
four points midway through the second period, San Antonio used a
pair of 3-point shots by Jaren Jackson to help rebuild the lead to
65-51 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was a foul and free-throw festival. There were 22
fouls called in the first quarter, another 20 in the second. Of 65
first-half points for San Antonio, 27 came on free throws. It was
evidence of the Lakers' futility in trying to stop the Spurs'
offense, most notably Duncan, who led all scorers at the half with
20 points, but was joined in double figures by Johnson (12),
Jackson (11) and Sean Elliott (10).
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, given some room to work when Lue opened up the offense,
led the Lakers with 15 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had their best quarter of the series in the third.
They outscored San Antonio by 12-2 to open the quarter and closed
the gap to 67-63. They did not appear to get discouraged when the
Spurs answered with a run of 10 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 14, the Lakers scored the final 12 points of the period.
O'Neal turned up the physical contact and the Spurs seemed to lose
their composure for the first time in the four games, committing
four turnovers. Los Angeles cashed in each, with Lue hitting a
drive at the buzzer to cut San Antonio's lead to 86-84. &QL;

   KINSHASA, Congo _ When Laurent Kabila's army neared this capital
two years ago to topple the country's long-ruling dictatorship,
Bernardin Mungul Diaka urged residents to wear white armbands, wave
white flags and greet the rebel leader as their liberator.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, Diaka, who was a prominent opponent of the former
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, describes his call as the ``biggest
mistake'' of his political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that Kabila's administration is 100 times worse than
Mobutu's,'' said Diaka, a onetime prime minister under Mobutu,
whose 31-year reign is remembered most for its staggering
corruption and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting someone better, and we were handed someone
worse,'' he said. ``So the worse one makes me regret the lesser of
two evils. In short, in two years, I think Kabila has had only
failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after he seized power and 10 months into a rebel
insurgency that is now aimed at overthrowing him, Kabila's
popularity as president is declining rapidly here.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel groups backed by Congo's neighbors control at least half
the country, Africa's third-largest, dividing it into several
pieces. With the help of other neighboring countries, Kabila was
able to avoid defeat at the hands of the rebels last August, but
now those allies are looking for a way out of an unpopular war that
has drawn in troops from seven regional powers.
</P>
<P>
   In Kinshasa, Kabila's perceived weakness has emboldened
opponents to voice their criticisms aloud, even as the government
has stepped up arrests of critics and journalists. A collapsing
economy, punctuated by skyrocketing food prices, gas shortages and
inflation topping 600 percent last month, seems to have eroded
Kabila's standing even further.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to May 17, the day on which Kabila took
power in 1997, reports swirled around the capital that residents
were buying up whistles to blow a symbolic ``fin de match,'' or end
of game, for the president. Whether the reports were exaggerated or
not, the government, clearly nervous, did not bother to find out,
sending in soldiers the night before to man checkpoints all over La
Cite Indigene, the slums where most of Kinshasa's six million
residents live.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'est l'homme qu'il fallait!'' proclaim billboards showing
Kabila's beaming face at several intersections, most of them near
government buildings. ``It's the man we needed!'' But the billboard
at Rond Point de la Victoire, La Cite's busiest corner, was taken
down. Neighborhood residents said people had been mocking the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``With time, we hope there will be a change in leadership,
because the current leaders are the same as the ones in the past,''
said Mbiya Kalondji, 40, who sold fake Nike tank tops on a table in
a market in Masina, a district near the international airport.
``The government is not popular because we don't have food or jobs.
Some people even long for the past. At least under Mobutu, there
was no war and we had food.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Masina jeered at Kabila's passing motorcade last
month. Youths hurled rocks and women bared their bellies to call
attention to food shortages. Even Mobutu loyalists now openly
criticize Kabila. ``Under Mobutu, at least the situation was not as
catastrophic as it is now,'' said Omari Leasisi, a former Governor
in the eastern Kivu region under Mobutu, who died in exile in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is splintered into three or four parts,'' he said,
pointing out that Kabila has paid his allies by giving them access
to Congo's mineral resources. ``To stay in power, does he have to
cede everything to foreigners?''
</P>
<P>
   Berci, the leading polling agency here, showed that Kabila's
popularity spiked in the months after August. But after its monthly
polls showed it has been falling fast since January, government
officials visited the office of its director, Olivier Kamitatu. The
intimidation forced him to cancel his report last month, Kamitatu
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government marked its second year in power this month by
holding a seven-hour parade in a stadium, attended by soldiers and
civilians wearing T-shirts made for the occasion. Kabila did not
address the crowd. But that night, he delivered a televised speech
that played to his people's deep resentment over foreign
intervention in Congo's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer foreigners, big or small, who will, as in the
past three decades, nominate our leaders,'' said Kabila, who was
plucked from obscurity by Rwanda and Uganda to lead a successful
rebellion against Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Mumengi, the minister of information, said there was no
evidence pointing to a decline in the government's or Kabila's
popularity. ``If the head of state were not popular,'' Mumengi said
in an interview, `` there would not have been a parade of seven
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kabila took over the former Zaire, he promised that
elections would be held in April 1999. But the government has put
them off because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In August, rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda began a campaign
against Kabila in eastern Congo and, after flying troops into
western Congo, almost seized the capital. Rwanda and Uganda both
supported Kabila in his war against Mobutu, but he cut off his ties
to them after the relationship made him unpopular among Congolese.
</P>
<P>
   But at the last minute, Kabila won the support of several
neighbors, including Angola and Zimbabwe, whose troops helped him
defeat the rebels in western Congo. Since then, the rebel forces
are said to have advanced westward, even though they are now split
into at least three factions, each holding on to a slice of Congo.
They are also believed to be approaching the diamond-producing
areas in the south that are the government's main source of
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here say it is unclear how much longer Kabila's main
allies, the Angolans and Zimbabweans, who entered the conflict for
their own domestic reasons, will support him.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Kabila's weakening position, he has made a series of
what appear to be concessions in recent months. He has agreed to
meet with the Congolese rebels, after vowing never to talk to what
he called puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. But talks held in various
African nations have led nowhere, despite the frequent
announcements of breakthroughs, because the war has drawn in so
many nations and factions.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the government called for a national debate to which
Congolese political parties would be invited. The idea received a
cold response from opposition leaders, whom Kabila has treated with
open contempt since taking power two years ago, accusing them of
having collaborated with Mobutu. The government has allowed
political parties to organize, but because of a long and intricate
process, no party has been recognized yet.

Hard-liners, characterized by ``inexperience and incompetence,''
have surrounded Kabila and are stopping him from reaching out to
opponents, Sondji said.

   ``Everything is not lost on the condition that he draws the

A 3-0 LEAD ON HAWKS INSPIRES KNICKS TO ACHIEVE A SWEEP AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the middle of the Knicks' showroom floor of
hot-rod players, with Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby all but
painted with racing stripes, there stood Chris Dudley, like a Chevy
straight from the days of sock hops and soda fountains.
</P>
<P>
   He was all bumpers and bulk Sunday. After Coach Jeff Van Gundy
pulled him off the bench to relieve a ragged Patrick Ewing, Dudley
used his size and strength to push the sharp-edged Dikembe Mutombo
out of position to inflict harm and unearthed a surprising display
of offense beneath his cumbersome exterior to the joy of a Madison
Square Garden crowd that stood in applause when he fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what it has come to for the threadbare Hawks. It was
Dudley, of all players, who brought the Hawks to their knees and
nudged them to the brink of extinction. After 14 years in the
league, Dudley unleashed the playoff game of his life as he scored
14 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and became part of an
overwhelming effort by the Knicks bench that left them with a 90-78
Game 3 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks were left in a desperate state. No team has ever been
down 3-0 and come back to win a series. With Game 4 on Monday at
the Garden, the Knicks can complete the sweep of the Hawks in their
best-of-seven-game second-round series. With one more win, the once
dysfunctional Knicks will meet the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   `'We want the sweep,'' Latrell Sprewell said. `'We have a
beautiful opportunity to close it out in front of our fans. We kind
of let that chance slip away against Miami; so we want to close it
out here at home. There are two big motivating factors for closing
it out. One, we can get some rest. Two, for the fans. They have
been supportive through the ups and down this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, times have never been better. After taking in another
dominating game by the Knicks, who shot 45 percent while holding
the Hawks to 31, the fans rose in unison for the unassuming Dudley.
He had absorbed a whirl of elbows from Mutombo, and at one point,
had outscored the Hawks, 8-6, in the fourth quarter alone in a game
that grew a bit unsightly at the end. Perhaps lulled a bit by the
control the Knicks had of this game, Dudley gave them someone to
focus their energy on.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a guy with a lifelong brain lock at the free-throw
line, yet the fans went bonkers for the 2 of 4 attempts he made.
Here was a player who has been known to get clumsy around the paint
but drew raves for the way he followed up misses with rim-hanging
dunks.
</P>
<P>
   `'Dud was hot, on fire,'' Marcus Camby said. `'I was pumping him
up, like go get `em, Dud. It's been like this for us in the
playoffs. It's always someone who comes up and delivers. Dud came
up big.''
</P>
<P>
   After nudging Mutombo out of range for his crane-like hook
shots, after sealing him off in order to give his teammates room to
wiggle in for layup, Dudley exited upon his sixth foul with 1:06
left in the game. He ambled over to the sideline, and chuckled as
the crowd chanted, `'Dudley, Dudley.''
</P>
<P>
   `'It was a great feeling,'' said Dudley, who helped hold Mutombo
to 2 for 7 from the field. `'More importantly, it was even better
to be up, 3-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are in this position because of the unrelenting
effort from role players like Dudley on a bench that has crushed
the spirits of the withering Hawks throughout this series. This
time, the Knicks outscored the Hawks' bench, 46-22, and
outrebounded them, 27-9.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the bench took over with the game tight at the start
of the second quarter. That's when Camby (15 points) and Sprewell
(17 points) stepped off the bench and provided their usual thrills.
Camby swooped in, stole a pass and was off for a dramatic fastbreak
dunk. That was followed up by Sprewell's driving layup on a
fastbreak that was triggered by a Steve Smith miss. One possession
later, it was Larry Johnson who leaked out on another Hawks' miss
and found himself open for a fastbreak layup.
</P>
<P>
   Swiftly, in the span of 64 seconds, the Knicks turned a tie into
a 6-point lead with 8 minutes left in the first half. They never
trailed again. After Smith began the day with uncanny accuracy
around Allan Houston, Johnson switched to defend him and banged him
for awhile. Then it was Sprewell's turn. By game's end, Smith, who
began 5 for 8, finished 7 for 21.
</P>
<P>
   `'They are using a lot of bodies, a lot of fresh bodies in and
out,'' Smith said. `'We were falling and reaching and trying to
make shots. It's frustrating. I mean, we know we can play better
than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Can they? In each game, the Knicks have been able to wear down
the Hawks and build double-digit leads in the fourth quarter. Game
3 was no different. The Knicks held a 14 point-lead four minutes
into the third quarter and a an 18-point lead with 7:26 left in the
game. Most comforting for the Knicks, they accumulated their
cushions with Ewing shooting just 2 for 12 in a 24-minute
performance that was played with his sore Achilles restricting his
movement.
</P>
<P>
   `'Dud was great,'' Ewing said. ``He played a much better game
than I did. I was hurting but we got the win, and that's the bottom
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are winning these days as Van Gundy reaches into
every corner of his roster and pulls out just the right body at
just the right time. If Houston isn't working, then maybe Sprewell
will. If Kurt Thomas doesn't have it, perhaps Camby does. If Ewing
is off, maybe Dudley is on. The team on the verge of missing the
playoffs is now one win from their first Eastern Conference Final
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   `'We've just started to play better,'' Van Gundy said.
`'Sometimes, people make it out to be more complex. We have started
to play more unselfish and much better, and let's face it, we have
gotten some great breaks along the way. We wouldn't be talking
about this if that ball rolled out in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   But Houston's miracle shot fell in, and the Knicks' lifespan in
the playoffs was extended. Now, they are one win away from facing
the team that eliminated them last season, the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   `'You don't want to go back down to Atlanta, travel down there,
extend the series and allow Indiana to have that rest while we're
still at war,'' Dudley said. `'We really don't want a letdown. We
can't afford one. We've got to come out and take care of
business.''

THE EXECUTIVE WHO CAPTURED TELECOM ITALIA 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ When Roberto Colaninno emerged earlier this year as the
quarterback of Olivetti's plan to buy Telecom Italia, the biggest
hostile takeover ever in Europe, people who follow business in
Italy reacted with surprise, and then, after a quick reassessment
of the man, with total comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise involved Colaninno's record. He had run a midsized
auto parts company and then Olivetti SpA, which was struggling to
master the phone business after failing at computers, and he was
not part of the Italian corporate elite.
</P>
<P>
   The insight that soon followed was that Colaninno was a hard
worker with few of the pretensions that can accompany Italian
corporate leaders and that he had learned the workings of financial
markets early on, both on his own and as an apprentice to Carlo De
Benedetti, one of the great innovators of Italian finance.
</P>
<P>
   Colaninno had worked, until he took on the siege of Telecom
Italia, as chief executive of Olivetti, the company that had
transformed itself from a sleepy maker of typewriters into a
leading European computer company that stumbled over high costs and
low technology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when De Benedetti was chairman of a badly foundering
Olivetti, he brought Colaninno to the company, having decided that
Olivetti's future lay not in computers but in telephones, and most
notably the mobile phone business, which was exploding in Italy in
the mid-1990s. But the rise of Olivetti's phone business was
dragged down by hemorrhaging in other areas. From 1990 to 1996,
when Colaninno stepped in, losses at Olivetti totaled $2.4 billion
and debt was crushing the company. Colaninno's recipe was
relatively simple: He ruthlessly jettisoned money-losing
operations, focusing instead on businesses that promised profit,
and most notably on phones.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, that meant cajoling institutional investors, who at
the time held the majority of Olivetti shares, into a capital
increase, then dumping Olivetti's unprofitable office machinery and
computer businesses into the hands of international partners and
focusing the remaining resources on the telephone venture, into
which Olivetti brought a strong partner, Mannesmann AG of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was perhaps remarkable for a man whose career had
begun at a small Italian auto parts maker, Fiamm SpA, which was
owned at the time by the Turner &AMP; Newell group of Britain. In 1972,
Colaninno became Fiamm's chief executive at the age of 29. In the
following years, Colaninno met De Benedetti and together they
founded a finance company, Sogefi SpA, that first acquired Fiamm
from Turner &AMP; Newell, then transformed it into one of Europe's most
successful auto parts suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   That combination of managerial talent and financial shrewdness
is vintage Colaninno, say bankers who have worked with him. By the
mid-1980s, Colaninno had become a board member at several regional
banks in heavily industrialized central Italy, where he wove links
to young entrepreneurs in one of the nation's most dynamic regions.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, people who know him say, Colaninno may be the
ideal man to take on Telecom Italia. Like Olivetti, Telecom
Italia's performance is dragged down by marginally profitable
businesses, like the Italtel and Sirti equipment units and real
estate and insurance operations, that could better be sold or run
by specialized partners.
</P>
<P>
   Colaninno sold Olivetti's computer-manufacturing business to
foreign investors, who ultimately closed it down, and found a buyer
for Olivetti's computer services arm in Wang in the United States.
He brought the office machine division into a joint venture with
Xerox. He showed negotiating skill at convincing Italian government
leaders and labor unions that bitter medicine was necessary, even
though it cost Italy jobs and what was left of its domestic
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some strong differences in Telecom Italia that
will translate into fresh challenges.
</P>
<P>
   A leading critic of the deal has been De Benedetti, who picked
apart the Olivetti takeover last week in a published interview. De
Benedetti said he advised Colaninno that the takeover could only
yield greater value if Olivetti could bring Telecom Italia bigger
market share, new technology or better management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noted to him,'' De Benedetti said, ``that Olivetti did not
have, as it still does not have, anything to offer Telecom Italia,
except to bring it the debt it would have to incur to acquire
Telecom Italia, and some residual management problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Having garnered only 51 percent of Telecom Italia in the bid
that expired Friday, Colaninno, at a news conference on Saturday in
Milan, said that he planned to ``set up a group of shareholders to
support management's projects and plans'' and assert control at
Telecom Italia. Moreover, Olivetti, which acquired its $33 billion
stake in Telecom Italia through a subsidiary called Tecnost, will
be under pressure from minority shareholders to merge the acquiring
company, Tecnost, and the target, Telecom Italia. At the news
conference, Colaninno said he would ``work to shorten the chain of
holdings.'' Yet some analysts fear that could dilute Olivetti's
control further, to perhaps as little as 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A governmental challenge will probably come as early as this
week when the Minister of Industry, Pierluigi Bersani, will meet
Colaninno and labor union leaders to discuss Olivetti's plans for
Telecom Italia, which will most likely include steep job cuts.
Olivetti's takeover still requires the approval of the government,
which retains a 3.4 percent ``golden share'' with veto rights in
Telecom Italia, though approval is considered certain.
</P>
<P>
   Italian government officials were quick to welcome the outcome
of the Olivetti bid. Colaninno had often argued his case by
insisting that a national asset like Telecom Italia had to be
protected by Italian investors from possible predators abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But a curious twist to this appeal to nationalism, some analysts
note, is that Colaninno himself closed down the remnants of Italy's
computer industry, once also considered a national treasure.
Moreover, by selling control of Olivetti's mobile and fixed-line
phone businesses to Mannesmann, he appears to be placing what many
consider the most unencumbered phone franchise in Italy under
German control.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the spirit of an entrepreneur,'' he said in a
recently published interview, ``you're never finished. You like
new, exciting times. You need it.'' &QL;

ATTACKS ON UTILITIES DARKEN MUCH OF SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In what Yugoslav civilians say is an
attempt to make their lives miserable, NATO completed two months of
air raids Sunday by stepping up attacks on power plants in Serbia,
plunging much of the country into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the capital was without power Sunday, and power
disruption was common across the country. Officials at Belgrade's
Neonatal Institute said that three newborns died when its backup
generators could not immediately provide enough electricity for its
incubators.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents in Belgrade complained Sunday that they were
without electricity or water. One political party here said that
NATO was carrying out ``collective reprisals'' against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's humiliating, as if we were plunged back into the
primitiveness of the Middle Ages,'' the Associated Press quoted
Branka Nikolic, a doctor and mother of two, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A day after bombing a power plant in Kolubara, NATO planes
bombed the Nikola Tesla power plant in Obrenovac, about 20 miles
south of Belgrade. Named after a famous Serbian inventor who
emigrated to the United States, the Tesla plant is the biggest
coal-burning plant in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Like the attack the day before on nearby Kolubara, the dawn
attack on the Tesla plant used conventional, high-explosive bombs.
Previous attacks on power plants have used so-called ``soft bombs''
which explode above ground and release graphite filaments which
short-circuit eletrical transformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do these NATO animals think? They want to crush an entire
nation,'' the AP quoted a pianist, Buco Kovacevic, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional bombs, however, cause material damage that
requires more extensive repair work. In Brussels, a NATO spokesman
acknowledged that the alliance's warplanes are using ``mixed
munitions'' of soft and conventional bombs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes appeared to be flying lower than usual, drawing the
fiercest antiaircraft fire in Belgrade that anyone could remember
in the previous two months.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of NATO planes being downed, and NATO
missiles cut the power lines that run from Obrenovac to the
capital. Priority customers, such as hospitals, bakeries, and water
pumping stations, were receiving power by midafternoon, but many of
Belgrade's apartment blocks, where most of its residents live,
remained without electricity or water.
</P>
<P>
   The Beta news agency reported that NATO bombs had wrecked a
water plant in Sremska Mitrovica, in the northern mostly rural
Vojvodina region, leaving at least 10,000 people without water.
</P>
<P>
   NATO hopes that by racheting up the hardship on ordinary people,
there will be increasing pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to accept a settlement over Kosovo. But most anger here
right now appears to be aimed at NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes continued to pummel Serb forces in Kosovo,
hitting 10 artillery units and nine armored vehicles, according to
NATO officials in Brussels. NATO said it flew 652 sorties in a
24-hour period overnight, 301 of which made missile strikes.

SPORTS COLUMN: HAWKS FIND KNICKS ARE TOO FAST TO HACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Sunday's game at Madison Square Garden,
Atlanta Hawks' Coach Lenny Wilkens suggested an ominous antidote to
the new, high-flying Knicks: rock-'em, sock-'em basketball. Wilkens
recalled a play in Game 2 last Thursday in Atlanta, when a Hawks
player reached in on Latrell Sprewell and lightly fouled him.
Sprewell scored anyway; Wilkens was angry because it hadn't been a
hard foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take his arms off _ you know what I mean, where he can't get
the shot up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens pointed to Marcus Camby's riveting slam dunk over
Dikembe Mutombo in the same game. ``He goes through the lane
untouched,'' Wilkens said. ``Hey, if it's me, I take him down. I'm
not going to be dirty, but I'm going to stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Wilkens' Hawks cannot stop the Knicks. For the third
consecutive game, the Knicks, led by Sprewell, sparked by Camby,
raced past Atlanta Sunday to take a 3-0 lead in the
four-of-seven-game series. The Knicks once again moved too fast to
be hacked, and they are on the brink of their first second-round
triumph in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   What a phenomenal turnabout: a team barely picked to reach the
playoffs is now looking at a sweep and facing the possibility of a
conference championship. But the more drastic transformation,
greater than the Knicks' racing through the second round in
stunning, running style, is the 360-degree turnabout by Garden fans
toward Sprewell and Camby. These new Knicks, blamed at first for
everything from the demise of the franchise to the nation's
crumbling moral infrastructure, have become heroes of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, you might regard this as a turnabout of
hypocritical proportions. But in this world of arenas and sneakers,
muscle and sinew, winning negates consistency; success dulls
conscience. At the beginning of this mutant season, many Knicks
fans and pious media types said they could never root for a team on
which Sprewell played. By gosh, he nearly strangled his coach! And
Camby? Well, he'll never fill the shoes of our beloved Oakman.
</P>
<P>
   Oak who?
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks on the verge of a spectacular sweep, Camby and
Sprewell are now Garden fixtures. Children wear their jerseys;
adults chant their names. They are hailed as the answers to the
Knicks' woes, the reason for the Knicks' heady success. You wonder
what the two of them think. Do they feel like cursing the fans for
their fickleness, or do they simply take it in stride?
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has been reserved. He hasn't embraced the fans as much
as he has respected them and expressed gratitude. ``I appreciate
the response,'' he said. The word that creeps into his answers is
focus. Asked about the drama involving Dave Checketts, Phil Jackson
and Jeff Van Gundy, Sprewell sidestepped, saying that only Georgia
was in his sights: ``Atlanta, man. That's all I've got on my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby, 25, is a bit more effusive, more open and typically
emotional about his and the Knicks' roller coaster ride to respect.
Hurt by the early doubts, he has been buoyed by the support. ``It
was hard for them to see the real me,'' he said. ``In the beginning
there were doubts.'' His teammates have helped him put the fans'
inconsistencies in perspective. ``On the team, we talk about that a
lot,'' he said. ``Especially in the Garden: when it's going bad,
they boo you. We talk about: it's us against the world _ go out
there, please ourselves, go out there and play hard. It feels good
when they're cheering and we're rolling. If they boo, I want to
stay humble and do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Chaney, the Knicks' assistant coach, looks a bit more
cynically at this outpouring of Garden love for Sprewell and Camby.
``At first they said Allan Houston and Latrell can't play
together,'' Chaney said. ``Now they're saying they're a great pair.
They're saying Sprewell's great and he should be mayor, because
he's playing well. Let Sprewell start playing poorly and see what
happens. Same with this team: when we're playing well they cheer
us; when we're playing bad, they boo. What have you done for me
lately?''
</P>
<P>
   In Chaney's view, the cheers have nothing to do with morality or
acceptance of foibles. They're cheers for the moment. ``New York is
about winning,'' he said, ``no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   There is so much at stake right now for so many within the
Knicks' organization, at some level winning may not even matter.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's game, Wilkens made his own contribution to the
Knicks' soap opera when he praised the acquisitions of Sprewell and
Camby, moves made by Ernie Grunfeld, who was since dismissed as
general manager. ``They made some good trades,'' Wilkens said of
the Knicks. ``And they are starting to pay off. Everybody is all
upset, but if you look at Camby, he is a pretty athletic young
player. And he is paying dividends now for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One executive has already lost his job; more losses are likely
to follow. Sprewell may not be here next season. He has become a
highly marketable commodity who might fetch a great prize, or
prizes, on the trade market: a star-caliber forward and a point
guard. Who knows what this team will look like next season?
</P>
<P>
   All the Knicks have to do is look at the dirty dealing in their
front office to know that they work in a place where no one is
safe, conference championship or no. The fans aren't the only
hypocrites: this Knicks organization specializes in fattening frogs
for the snakes. &QL;

DUDLEY AND 30 POINTS MAKE STRANGE BEDFELLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A hobbling Patrick Ewing was figuratively and
literally on ice, playing sparingly and then soaking his tender
left Achilles tendon in a large bucket of ice. Dikembe Mutombo, the
proud and gracious center of the Atlanta Hawks, could do no right
on offense as his team fell into an 0-3 abyss.
</P>
<P>
   This was shaping up to be a lousy afternoon for big men at
Madison Square Garden, the 7-foot veteran series gone terribly
awry. Out West, Tim Duncan and David Robinson were doing the pivot
position proud _ sweeping Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, well, the whole story line was getting muddled.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing vs. Mutombo, remember? That Georgetown showdown was
supposed to be the only reason to tune into the Eastern Conference
semifinal between the Hawks and the Knicks, the only decent subplot
until Reggie Miller arrives in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   And what was this, Latrell Sprewell throwing it down with two
hands on the break, his spindly body squaring up and swishing shots
in mid-air? Marcus Camby taking off from the dotted line with the
ball cocked?
</P>
<P>
   Tiny men, skinny men, darting around all those plodding oafs. No
one to bring honor to the position.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened _ Jeff Van Gundy summoning him from the bench.
The sweats came off in a flash. He started toward midcourt,
shoulders first, that ninth-grade, tough-guy walk announcing his
entrance into Game 3 with 5 minutes 16 seconds left in the first
quarter. ``Chris Dudley replaces Patrick Ewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clump. Clump. Clump.
</P>
<P>
   Free-throw purists covered their eyes. Grade-school coaches told
their players not to look. Parents ran, children hid. So lightly
regarded was Dudley when it came to putting in points that the
Atlanta Hawks simply left him alone and covered everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley, the defensive specialist (re: hack) flexed his forearms,
rubbed his large hands together and prepared for another afternoon
of combat in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   He would not only give Ewing half the day off, he would do so
much more. Like score.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen points. Six made shots out of seven, a playoff
career-high. Two made free throws. That athletic dunk off a missed
basket over the 7-foot-2-inch Mutombo was not a a
computer-generated image.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates were pounding his chest and high-fiving their once
offensively-inept comrade. Fans rose and applauded, giving him a
standing ovation as if it were his last game at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   When he checked out of the game with 1:06 remaining, the chants
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dud-LEE! Dud-LEE!''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked about the last time people stood and chanted his
name. ``You mean, besides my wife?'' Dudley said.
</P>
<P>
   It's finally become clear that the Knicks made an awful mistake
in signing Dudley to a 4-year, $28-million contract; $68-million,
Ewing's take for four seasons, would have been more appropriate
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, of course, did not think that attempt at humor was funny.
But you got to give up for the Big Fella, who has been resting up
for Rik Smits two of the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duds played a much better game than I did,'' said Ewing, who
played 17 minutes in Game 1 and 24 minutes yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful game,'' Ewing added. ``Duds off the bench. And both
he and Marcus and Spree gave us a big lift. This is a team game.
That's the only way you are going to win. Everybody is pulling
their own load, and if somebody gets beat, somebody is stepping in
and taking charge or getting a block. We are just doing what we
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, making the center a viable position in the series
came at one player's expense. Mutombo simply could not find an easy
path to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not tired, but I may be a little bit frustrated,''
Mutombo said. He had finished with seven points and made only two
of four shots. And his main offensive weapon _ that elegant hook
shot in which his entire 7-2 frame is fully extended upon release
of the ball _ was rendered useless.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-11 bruiser, who refused to be backed down into the post,
would not let Mutombo take that shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I am down 0-3, I think that is the way I can
describe the way I am feeling,'' Mutombo said. ``I just have to
find a way to keep my head up and come up with a better answer. I
just can't believe myself losing three in a row. I just have to
find out how to play my own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Down a Garden corridor maybe 30 yards, Ewing's left leg was
numb. ``I was hurting, but we got the win,'' he said. ``That's the
bottom line.'' Asked how he felt, he added, ``Pain is pain.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone had said the Knicks would win a playoff game when
their franchise center scored four points and made two of 12 shots,
you would have laughed that person out of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is clearly a different team and these are different
times, when a fuel-injected bench puts up points in a hurry and the
best center on the floor on any given day can be from Yale instead
of Georgetown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dud-LEE! Dud-LEE!''
</P>
<P>
   And the madness goes on. &QL;

THE DIGITAL FLEA MARKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to being the most important invention since fire,
the commercial Internet is, apparently, the perfect parking lot for
a global flea market.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming popularity of the online auction giant Ebay _
with a $22 billion market cap and millions of daily visitors _ has
inspired a convoy of me-too sites hoping to slipstream on its
success. They range from Amazon.com, branching out from its pure
retail roots with a huge advertising campaign to draw people away
from Ebay, to the online technology site Cnet, which started its
auction site for high-technology products last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the gargantuan success of Ebay can be duplicated is
anyone's guess in today's surreal business environment. But it has
clearly stumbled onto something the likes of which has never been
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of one consultant whose interest in
emerging technologies dove-tailed rather nicely last week with her
fascination for Star Wars mania.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Rosenthal, who is based in Palo Alto, Calif., said that
while at a Target store in Silicon Valley watching collectors line
up to buy Star Wars trinkets, she started talking to a couple in
their early 40s, with infant in tow, who had been returning to the
shelves every 20 minutes. The couple systematically bought up
$4,000 worth of stuff, each buying the maximum items that Target
allowed each customer, then going back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they'd decided that the lowest risk with the
fastest, highest return,'' Ms. Rosenthal said, ``was to buy Star
Wars merchandise, then post it on Ebay for a seven-day auction,
with a reserve'' _ the lowest price they would take _ ``of double
their money.'' Thus, at the end of seven days, they would double
their investment, maybe doing even better, ``or they would return
the merchandise, making it zero risk; their only investment was
their time and running around to buy the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ebay is easing windfalls for creative investors, it is also
inspiring more traditional creators.
</P>
<P>
   Allee Willis, a Grammy-winning songwriter and artist who
abandoned a seven-year foray into multimedia because she could not
get the ``suits'' in Hollywood to invest in her Willisville Web
community project, said Ebay ``honestly inspired a career change
for me, and after seven years of dedicating my life to interactive
and being repulsed by it, Ebay brought me back.''
</P>
<P>
   A fanatical collector of 1950s atomic kitsch and a talent scout
for what might best be called ``outsider art'' and artists, Ms.
Willis found her online home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even the sagas and who I've met,'' she said. ``It's
the system I have going for bidding _ right now, I have three G3
Macintoshes, with three bidding windows opened on each of them _
and what goes on when I want to win. I have a special swivel chair
that I got just to do Ebay, and all I do is spin around from
computer to computer, bang-bang-bang. My final bid goes in three
seconds before the end of the auction, and I knock everyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her discovery of a painter selling his work on Ebay inspired her
to start painting again for the first time in 10 years. ``I thought
if I could make enough money to keep my house I'd be happy,'' she
said. ``By the time I sold the third painting, the bell went off
and I felt like I'd stumbled into what I'm supposed to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday she opened a Web site for her latest find, Bubbles
(www.bubblestheartist.com). But unlike previous discoveries,
Bubbles the artist is Ms. Willis herself. She will sell Bubbles'
paintings, along with matching objets de kitsch (such as Black
Power Afro Picks and dog accessories), matching music (from her
musician friends who have recorded ``really, really horrible''
versions of their famous songs) and outrageous, matching on-site
animations with sound tracks (also for sale, of course), on both
her Web site and on Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, she said, is ``a fantastic interface for doing nothing but
getting people together and getting the business people out of the
way _ it's making a people's medium out of something that today is
just being cluttered by business and technical junk.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ebay is big business, Ms. Willis said, ``you don't
see it _ you don't have to deal with anyone except the person who's
buying or selling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the trend in the next century is working for yourself,''
she asserted, ``Ebay is going to do more for that than any other
interface. It's easy and it's comfortable, and when you do it once
you aren't afraid of it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these do not surprise Larry Downes, a technology
consultant and a co-author of the book ``Unleashing the Killer App:
Digital Strategies for Market Dominance'' (www.killer-apps.com).
Downes, an unrepentant Ebay addict and collector of 1950s vintage
horror comics, finds the auction service to be the perfect example
of a killer application in which the Internet lowers transaction
costs and creates new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Downes is a devotee of Ronald H. Coase, the economist and Nobel
laureate who more than 60 years ago first explored the concept of
transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Coase's transaction costs, which Downes says are still not
considered in most business formulas, include that of buyers and
sellers finding each other, of finding or providing the information
needed to make the transaction, of bargaining and making the
buy-or-sell decision itself, and of policing and enforcing the
terms of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Downes says Ebay virtually eliminates several of these. ``What
Ebay lets you do is find mini-transactions where otherwise people
would never have gotten together,'' he said. ``Because it's so
diffuse, there was a much more liquid market for comics, for
example, than any of us knew. Every year there's a comic book
convention, but otherwise the market was not very liquid. Ebay's
made it a 24/7 bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   On just one day last week, there were nearly 500 active Ebay
auctions just in the category of 1950s horror comics and more than
25,000 for comic books over all.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay and its clones are not without the kind of caveat emptor
problems that plague all flea markets. But on Ebay, at least,
scammers offering nonexistent or fraudulent goods, for example, are
often caught by shrewd buyers who can then post comments about the
sellers, warning off the unwary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting difference between Ebay and other auction
sites is who decides what merchandise is sold,'' Downes said.
``Sites like Onsale.com,'' which sell distressed, surplus or bulk
goods, ``are saying, `Here's what we've got; this is what we'll
auction off.' Ebay says: `We have no idea what you want to buy or
sell. We'll just create the platform and a set of tools and allow
the markets to define themselves.'''

ALLIANCE PREPARING NEXT STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO officials are preparing to meet this week to
determine their next step, amid continuing disagreements over
whether to commit troops for a ground war. A new round of bombing,
meanwhile, destroyed power systems and plunged much of Serbia into
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Sunday that the alliance is united and
that NATO is winning the war in the air. But if Clinton opts to
push the war on the ground, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott,
said Sunday that the Senate would ``absolutely not'' approve such
an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, asked Sunday
whether the war can be won without a credible threat of committing
ground troops, insisted that such talk is premature because ``we
are winning'' in the air. But she did acknowledge that the United
States on Tuesday would ask NATO for an assessment of a possible
ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is that we have asked for an update, and the
president has said that all options are on the table,'' Albright
said on CBS's ``Face The Nation.'' ``But we have also said, and I
repeat, that the air campaign is working.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO must decide soon whether to launch a ground invasion
because it would take months to assemble the necessary forces for
an attack, which officials would prefer to launch before winter
weather sets in.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is pushing for 50,000 peacekeeping troops to
be massed at the Kosovo border, which in theory are to be used only
in a ``permissive'' environment when the war is over and the
refugees return to their homes. A full-fledged invasion force,
however, might require three times as many troops and would be much
more complicated to assemble, both in political and logistical
terms. Still, even the assembly of 50,000 peacekeeping troops might
satisfy the British, who want to prepare for a ground war and may
also send a tougher message to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic about NATO's resolve in ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander in Europe, General Wesley K. Clark,
said the alliance had ``submitted documentation to the North
Atlantic Council which calls for an enhancement to the Kosovo
Implementation Force.'' Given the havoc caused by the Yugoslav Army
and the expulsion of refugees, ``not suprisingly it will take
considerably more forces.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, NATO's air campaign continued, as warplanes for the
second straight day pounded power supply stations inside Serbia,
cutting off electricity for millions of people. NATO said its jets
had made 652 sorties, with 301 hitting their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in an opinion article published Sunday in The New York
Times, said that ``Milosevic's strategy has been to outlast us by
dividing the alliance. He has failed. Instead of disunity in
Brussels, there are growing signs as disaffection in Belgrade.''
Clinton wrote that ``while I do not rule out other options,'' the
air campaign ``has broad and deep support in the alliance and
allows us to meet our objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's view was not shared in some of the other NATO
countries. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that the air
campaign was not enough and that NATO must prepare for a ground
war.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said he did not see a
quick end to the war and was ``very worried'' by NATO's mistaken
bombing of civilians and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in other countries, including Germany, have asked for a
cessation of the bombing in hopes of moving peace negotiations
forward. The issue is likely to come to a head when the NATO
committee meets in Brussels to assess the air war and contemplate a
ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also faced resistance from Lott, the Senate Republican
Leader. Speaking on ``Face The Nation,'' Lott said that the Senate
would not approve the use of US troops for a ground war. ``If
you're in the so-called permissive atmosphere where you taking the
Kosovars back into Kosovo, that would be one thing, but if you're
talking about fighting their way in there, absolutely not,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has repeatedly told the American people that we
would not use ground troops in a combat mode there,'' Lott
continued. ``The American people, I believe overwhelmingly, would
be opposed to that. Now, I hope that the bombing will work.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not share Albright's view that the bombing is
succeeding. ``I worry that the bombing is hurting us and our arms
control activities,'' he said. ``It's hurting our prestige around
the world, and quite frankly, these little boo-boos, where you're
hitting a KLA headquarters, where you're killing innocent citizens,
I think is hurting the image of the military, which is unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments in the Yugoslav conflict:
</P>
<P>
   --About 500 ethnic Albanian men, presumed to have been arrested
by the Yugoslav Army, crossed into Albania and told officials they
have been beaten severely.
</P>
<P>
   --Newsweek magazine reported that the CIA had a plan to train
Kosovar rebels to blow up buildings and cut telephone lines inside
Yugoslavia. The magazine said Clinton had approved a plan for
computer hackers to attack Milosevic's foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   --Serbian deputy premier Vojislav Seselj said foreign troops
would not be allowed on Yugoslav territory, a demand that conflicts
with NATO's proposal for an international peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
   --The president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, accused the
Yugoslav Army of playing into the hands of the ``Belgrade
dictatorship'' as soldiers maintained their stranglehold on the
republic's frontiers, blocking humanitarian aid. Montenegro, like
Serbia, is a republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   --Clark, the NATO commander, said Sunday the alliance had
``broadened and deepened'' its target list and airstrikes were not
over yet. ``The array of targets has been broadened and deepened
and so the air campaign is going to continue,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   --Montenegrin television said Sunday Serbian military
authorities had failed to get 2,000 Yugoslav Army reservists to
return to Kosovo after they had left their positions there without
orders five days ago. Reservists from Krusevac in southern Serbia
returned home from Kosovo last week after hearing of antiwar
protests at home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing's for sure: Bonnie Fuller is a woman with a lot of
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the last two weeks, Cathleen Black, the
president of Hearst Magazines, approached Ms. Fuller, who is the
editor in chief of Glamour magazine, a Conde Nast publication, to
run Harper's Bazaar, the 132-year-old Hearst fashion monthly. The
magazine was edited by Liz Tilberis until her death last month, and
Ms. Fuller has not been long out of the Hearst fold; she left her
job as editor in chief of Cosmopolitan only last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Black was undaunted by Ms. Fuller's new status at Conde
Nast, which is owned by Advance Publications. The two seriously
discussed the possibility of Ms. Fuller's running Harper's Bazaar,
said executives at Hearst and Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast executives said that Ms. Fuller had discussed her
possible resignation in a meeting with S.I. Newhouse Jr., the
chairman of Conde Nast, on Wednesday morning. Steven Florio, the
president and chief executive of Conde Nast, visited Ms. Fuller's
office later that day, and Florio's muffled shouts, Glamour staff
members said, could be heard from beyond the closed door of Ms.
Fuller's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fuller held a meeting at noon Thursday and made a brief
speech as her staff gathered to eat scones and berries from a local
caterer, Mangia. Arriving late, she compared the Hearst dalliance
to a high school flirtation with a handsome classmate. Speaking at
a cocktail party on Thursday, James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial
director, said, ``But we convinced her to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fracas, some of which was reported in The New York Post
last week, has drawn attention to an important editorial race for
Hearst. Under Ms. Tilberis, Harper's Bazaar won two National
Magazine Awards and featured some major cover models, including
Diana, princess of Wales. But it lags behind Vogue and Elle in
circulation and advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Black's choice of a new editor will affect the cultural
direction of the company at large. Does Hearst want to remodel
Harper's Bazaar as a celebrity magazine akin to In Style, or
continue to focus on fashion? Would it become more profitable if it
more closely resembled Marie Claire, a title for younger women?
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at Harper's Bazaar confirmed that Annemarie
Iverson, the fashion news director, had spoken to Ms. Black about
becoming the magazine's editor. Such a move would signal a
commitment to fashion. Ms. Fuller has also expressed interest in
running a fashion magazine, executives at Conde Nast said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Black has also approached Alexandra Shulman, the editor of
British Vogue, and Tyler Brule, the managing editor of Wallpaper, a
lifestyle and interior design magazine owned by Time Warner Inc.,
who would most likely bring more of a lifestyle slant. But Brule
said he declined.

   TV Networks Using Strong-Arm Tactics
</P>
<P>
   The deal-making became so intense inside the war rooms of the
networks assembling their prime-time lineups last week that studio
executives used terms like ``brutal,'' ``bloody'' and ``vicious''
to describe the action. They made it sound as if the process had
become the television industry's version of Verdun.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the networks, under pressure to cut costs and
increase profits, sought concessions from program suppliers in
exchange for choice spots on their time schedules. And for the
first time, that meant not only open demands for ownership stakes
in shows, but also demands for rights to broadcast multiple runs of
shows on whatever new windows of distribution, from digital
channels to Internet sites, open up in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for multiple runs of shows came from ABC, which
dangled its best comedy time periods before producers and studio
executives, seeking both an ownership stake and numerous plays of
every episode of the show.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., asked two
comedies, ``Oh Grow Up'' and ``Then Came You,'' to give the network
a 10 percent stake and four plays of every episode in exchange for
the 9:30 p.m. time slot on Wednesdays after ``Drew Carey.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure tactic incensed several studio executives. The Fox
studio, owned by News Corp., flatly refused to comply on ``Then
Came You''; coincidentally or not, the show wound up on Thursday
night instead of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives at several studios, CBS played a similar
game of aggressive leverage with Sony's Columbia studio, insisting
on getting ownership in every new Columbia show that it intended to
use. (It has two.)
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that CBS threatened to hold up renewing
another Columbia show, ``Early Edition,'' if Columbia did not give
in to CBS demands for ownership in the new series. The two new
shows, ``Family Law'' and ``Ladies' Man,'' are now both co-produced
by Columbia and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, denied using
any undue pressure, saying there had been aggressive posturing on
both sides. But it was well noted in Hollywood that all six new
shows on CBS are co-produced by CBS and studios; Viacom's Paramount
and Seagram's Universal were the others that took on the network as
a partner.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Head of Fox's TV Studio Is on a Roll
</P>
<P>
   The big personal winner when the television networks announced
their fall shows last week was Sandy Grushow, the head of the Fox
television production studio, Twentieth Century Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is: What does he do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   In the scorecard that television studio executives keep, Grushow
was the clear leader on the fall schedules, with Fox landing 22
shows, the best that studio has ever done. It also among the best
that any studio has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup at the Fox studio has been accomplished in a short
time. Three seasons ago, when Grushow arrived, the studio had only
six shows on network schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current successes were already in the works then,
and one particularly important factor has been the seemingly
endless creativity of David Kelley, whose production company is
housed at Fox, a unit of News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For Grushow, the success could hardly come at a better time: He
is in the last year of his contract with the studio.
</P>
<P>
   As for what he does next, a move into the Internet is likely.
Other ideas have come up in recent weeks, including the possibility
of a newly structured position that would keep him at Fox, both
running the television studio and filling some capacity at the Fox
television network.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to happen, it would also be a first: the first time
a studio head also worked directly for a network.

 REVIVING HOPES FOR MIDEAST PEACE  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, May 24:
</P>
<P>
   The election of Ehud Barak as Israel's next prime minister has
created an encouraging new atmosphere for peace talks with the
Palestinians and Syria. Though Barak's negotiating positions are
not that different from Benjamin Netanyahu's, the new leader's more
positive attitude has drawn favorable notices in much of the Arab
world. Netanyahu saw the Oslo peace agreement as an obligation to
be carried out as grudgingly as possible. Barak views carefully
negotiated treaties as ways to make Israel safer and stronger. The
Clinton administration, whose relations with Netanyahu were always
tense, now has a willing partner in efforts to complete the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's campaign was fought less over issues of peace than of
personality, the role of religion and relations between Sephardic
Jews from the Arab world and Ashkenazi Jews from Europe. Barak won
decisively. His supporters in secular center and left parties won
enough seats for a working parliamentary majority, but one
dependent on parties backed by Israel's Arab voters.
</P>
<P>
   Because any new peace agreements will require a broad consensus,
Barak sensibly seeks support from moderate religious and
conservative groups as well. But he has wisely decided first to set
firm policy guidelines on peace terms and relations between
religious and secular Israelis. Only parties accepting these
guidelines will be invited into the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Once assembled, the new government must fulfill the commitments
Israel made last fall for a further West Bank withdrawal. Then it
must move on to overdue negotiations on Jerusalem, boundaries,
water rights, return of Palestinian refugees and the future of
Jewish settlements. On many of these issues a wide gulf separates
Barak's current positions from those of the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat. The hope is that with improved trust and tradeoffs
on some of the most contentious issues, differences can be
overcome. Responsibility for building that trust falls as much on
Arab leaders as on Barak. Arafat, in particular, must keep his
negotiating positions realistic and his rhetoric calming. Another
helpful gesture would be an early visit to Israel by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which has remained on the sidelines of peace negotiations
for the past three years, now signals an interest in resuming
discussions. Israel and Syria need to talk about returning Syrian
land in the Golan Heights and assuring Israeli security as Barak
carries out his promised withdrawal from southern Lebanon. In the
past, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad has held out for settling all
issues at once, including a full return of the Golan Heights. But
if he really wants peace, he must be willing to compromise, a point
Washington should stress to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Though peace was not the main campaign issue, polls consistently
show that most Israelis favor agreements based on trading land for
security. Barak's government will be measured by the progress it
achieves toward this vital goal.

<P>
   Remember Deep Blue, the IBM supercomputer that beat the world
chess champion Garry Kasparov?
</P>
<P>
   Well, two years later, IBM is getting ready to give Deep
Blue-style computing a real challenge _ by trying to make a
business of it.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to announce on Monday the formation of the
Deep Computing Institute, which will have a budget of $29 million,
a staff of 120 IBM research scientists and a nine-person advisory
board.
</P>
<P>
   IBM insists that ``deep computing'' is more than a marketing
term. William Pulleyblank, director of the new institute, says
``deep computing'' is meant to describe the use of extensive
computation and sophisticated software algorithms to tackle
problems previously beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
   Deep computing research has been under way for years within
IBM's Watson Labs. ``But we think now is the time to really use
this kind of scientific modeling for business decision-making,''
said Pulleyblank, who heads the mathematical sciences program at
Watson.

   He cited precision weather forecasting as a current example of
what deep computing can do. Feeding information from the National
Weather Service, local sensors and topographical databases into
supercomputers has now made it possible to make pinpoint forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of saying there's a 40 percent chance of rain tomorrow
afternoon, you can say it will rain from 2:15 to 3:30 p.m.,''
Pulleyblank said. ``And instead of making forecasts for the
standard 30-kilometer grids, we can narrow them to one kilometer.
The storms will be in Queens, but not the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Such precision forecasting could be of considerable value to
utilities, for example, as they plan power-plant use and daily
trading strategies in the spot market for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Deep Computing Institute also plans to announce Monday
that it will give outside software developers free access to the
source code of the company's powerful 3-D visualization software,
called Data Explorer, which is used in supercomputing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing open access to formerly proprietary source code is in
keeping with the so-called open-source movement in the software
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where open source really works is where you build a community
to accelerate innovation,'' Pulleyblank said. ``And we think this
advanced visualization application will attract that kind of
community.''

   Gateway's Concept: Think PC Petting Zoo
</P>
<P>
   The entire personal-computer industry is moving toward the
direct-sales model, which is built on a one-to-one relationship
with customers, build-to-order manufacturing, razor-thin
inventories and higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Much as this might allow the manufacturers to escape having to
share profits with middlemen or share customers with the store
chains, however, many consumers still want to look at a PC, even
touch it, before they buy. A recent study conducted by
Infobeads.com, a research concern, showed that 53 percent prefer
hands-on shopping.
</P>
<P>
   What's a PC marketer to do?
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., which along with Gateway Inc. pioneered the
direct-sales model, made a foray into the retail channel in the
early 1990s but gave up in frustration in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Gateway has also been trying its hand at retail. But
it has taken a hybrid approach, blending retail stores with
direct-marketing methods.
</P>
<P>
   And Gateway opened the doors to its first store in New York last
week, at 4 Columbus Circle, though the ``grand opening'' will be on
June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Gateway stores as computer petting zoos.
</P>
<P>
   They typically have 15 PCs, all connected to the Internet, that
people can try out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the machines are loaded with software and hardware
features intended for children. Others are meant for use by adults
at home, and still others are for small-business owners. Gateway
employees are around to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The stores, called Gateway Country, are designed with a farming
motif _ tractor-style seats at each computer station, a mock grain
silo and murals of Midwestern farm scenery.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a nod to Gateway's roots in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But the stores do not have stockrooms, because they house no
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   A customer can order a computer and pay for it at the store, but
the PC is then built to order at Gateway's factory and shipped to
the customer's home within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has Gateway hewed to the direct-marketing model, even while
building up its own retail chain, with 160 stores in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have thousands of square feet of warehouse space in
our stores,'' said Joseph Burke, senior vice president for business
development at Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Burke said, ``we have avoided having the middlemen
mouths to feed that you would in traditional retail stores.''

NEW RULES WILL UPGRADE `QUALITY TIME'; PARENTS GET INCENTIVE TO BE
WITH THEIR CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CRAGG HINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAMBLING, La. _ President Clinton, moving again into the
``quality time'' debate, authorized new rules Sunday to allow
states to dip into flush unemployment funds to finance leave for
parents of newborns and recently adopted children.
</P>
<P>
   If an American ``has to chose between being a good parent and
successful in your careers, you have paid a terrible price, and so
has your country,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's action was announced in a commencement address
at Grambling State University, the 98-year-old historically black
college in north-central Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said funding to allow parents time off with new
children was needed because a study had found loss of wages was
``the most significant barrier'' to taking advantage of the Family
and Medical Leave Act. The law, initially fought by Republicans in
Congress, was the first major legislation Clinton signed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the law, which mandates up to 12 weeks of unpaid
leave, had been ``a great thing.'' He repeated his call for the
Republican-controlled Congress to allow the law to cover more
workers and ``more parental responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should not have to fear a boss's wrath because they
left work to take a child to the doctor,'' Clinton said. ``They
shouldn't have to call in sick to attend a parent-teacher
conference at the school.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House disavowed any political intent in Clinton's
announcement, but the new paid time-off benefit may be especially
appealing to working single mothers, who have become a major
Democratic constituency. Clinton also set up family leave issues as
a challenge for Republicans who portray themselves as
``pro-family'' advocates.``
</P>
<P>
   ``For all this nation's pro-family rhetoric, the hard truth is
that other countries with advanced economies do a lot more to
support working parents than we do,'' Clinton said. ``We must think
bigger and do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on companies to expand family-friendly practices
such as telecommuting, on-site child care centers and schools at
large work sites.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his return to the issue of parents spending more
time with children was prompted by the school shooting in
Littleton, Colo., as well as incidents of hate crimes, including
the dragging death near Jasper of James Byrd Jr., a black man, and
the beating death in Wyoming of Matthew Shepard, a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking a lot about family lately,'' Clinton said.
He spoke not only of ``the need to make guns less available to
criminals and children'' but also ``the need to raise our children
to respect others who are different from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's move to free unemployment funds does not require
congressional approval, the White House said, but can be
accomplished by the Labor Department adopting new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington _
have legislation pending and other states have expressed interest
about tapping unemployment insurance accounts to fund parental time
off, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   States will not be compelled to use the new program, but they
would have the option of adopting some form of parental time-off
funded by unemployment insurance revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The move to the new rules was eased by the healthy economy,
which has spurred employment and cut claims of the jobless for
unemployment insurance. Clinton said the new time-off program would
not endanger the soundness of unemployment insurance funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate that we have the extraordinary economy that we
can address the challenges employees face,'' said White House
spokesman Barry Toiv. ``It's something you can do more easily when
the economy is prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also ordered new rules to allow federal employees to use
up to 12 weeks of accrued sick leave each year to care for close
family members who are seriously ill. The maximum they can
currently use for the purpose is 13 days annually.
</P>
<P>
   Although limited to federal workers, the move will almost
certainly lead to pressure on private industry to match the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every company in America that offers sick leave to its
workers adopted the same policy we're adopting today, half of all
the American workforce would have this important benefit for their
families,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not mention in the address his earlier call
for federal legislation to combat what the White House says is
employment discrimination against workers with children. Toiv said
the issue remains under study.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton intended, in the Grambling speech
and another at the University of Chicago commencement on June 12,
``to put a human face on the dynamic and prosperous new economy''
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks in Chicago are expected to emphasize the
international economy. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that
Clinton would be ``arguing for the great benefits to America of
free and open trade ... making sure that all people are lifted up
by the positive changes in the global marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   One Grambling graduate had a more immediate request, calling
out: ``I need a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you'll be able to get one now,'' Clinton replied.
</P>
<P>
   Grambling presented Clinton an honorary degree, and the school's
famous marching band rocked Robinson Stadium with a raucous musical
tribute to the president. At one point in the medley, the band
announcer, said: ``Our love for you is like a heat wave,'' an
obvious musical cue, which Clinton greeted with a laugh and an
appreciative wave.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Robinson, who until his retirement was known as the
``winningest coach'' in college football, helped Clinton with his
doctoral degree regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also speak at the Air Force Academy commencement on
June 2, an address expected to center on foreign affairs, including
a further assessment and justification of the NATO campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The president's address Sunday was based, in part, on a new
report by the Council of Economic Advisers analyzing the ``time
crunch'' created by women spending more time on the job, meaning
they have less time to spend with their children.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that over the last three decades, there has been
a 79 percent increase in married women who work outside the home _
from 38 percent in 1969 to 68 percent in 1996. The increase for
single mothers has been less dramatic _ 53 percent to 66 percent
over the same 27-year period.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``virtually all of the increase'' in
families' work hours has come from women going into the labor
market because husbands' hours of paid work have decreased slightly
since the 1960s.

NEW YORK'S HAITIAN COMMUNITY AWAITS BRUTALITY CASE RECKONING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a Pentecostal church in Brooklyn on Sunday,
hundreds of Haitian men and women sang a traditional hymn in Creole
about a clarion trumpet announcing the coming of Judgment Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a dream I heard the trumpet,'' they sang, their voices
rising, their hands reaching upward, their eyes locking on the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   But up front, in the third pew, near the preacher's squirming
grandsons, one man sat perfectly still. His face was a mask of
calm, his presence unremarkable except for the bullet resistant
vest bulging against the soft, gray fabric of his suit.
</P>
<P>
   Abner Louima clasped his hands before his chin. For him _ and
for other Haitian-Americans throughout New York City _ there is an
earthly significance to a hymn about an approaching day of
reckoning. The federal trial of four police officers accused of
attacking him and one officer accused of covering up the attack is
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Louima is riding a wave of expectation that gains momentum with
each day of damaging testimony against the police officer accused
of sodomizing him with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes have been raised by reports that the accused officer,
Justin Volpe, is seeking a plea deal with the U.S. attorney's
office in Brooklyn to avoid a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victorious moment for us,'' said Ketty Fleurimont, who
sat next to Louima for part of Sunday's service. ``It is not every
day that justice is served.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima declined to be interviewed, but he stood and addressed
the church in his native Creole. He asked people to continue
praying for him, and he thanked God for his life and for his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Louima is a familiar figure at the church, Croisade Evangelique
de Pecheurs D'Hommes, or Evangelical Crusade of Fishers of Men, in
East Flatbush. His uncle, the Rev. Philius Nicolas 2d, leads the
church, and his parents are longtime members.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Port-au-Prince and earned a degree in electrical
engineering before coming to the United States in 1990. He lived
unobtrusively, marrying and fathering two children, working as a
security guard. He had never been arrested until August 1997, when
he suddenly became a national symbol for charges of police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, church members have done their best to avoid talking
to him about the specifics of what happened at the 70th Precinct
station house. ``People make a special effort to treat him like you
would anyone else,'' said Ms. Fleurimont.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, again and again church members spoke of Louima in
reverent tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the same as you or me,'' said Jean-Claude Etienne,
47, who is a deacon. ``It is truly a gift from God that he is alive
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The church members said they understood the lies Louima admitted
he told _ most notably his quoting police officers as telling him
``It's Giuliani time'' during the alleged assault. ``For me, it's
such an overwhelming truth,'' said Edwidge Danticat, whose 1988
best seller, ``Breath, Eyes, Memory,'' traces a girl's journey from
Haiti to the United States. ``We're vulnerable to the police, and
in this case you cannot deny overwhelming truth, no matter what
else has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to resume Monday. Regardless of the
verdict, many in this church said they believed their prayers had
already been heard.
</P>
<P>
   They never doubted Louima's account of being attacked. But many
had refused to believe that any officer would back Louima's story
in court, which is why they were surprised to see four officers
offer vivid testimony that supported key aspects of his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were praying that the Lord will let them come out and tell
the truth, because you cannot lie in the presence of the Lord,''
said Elmase Archille, 45.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Karl Napoleon, 22, the officers' testimony has challenged
his perceptions of New York police officers in general, and white
New York police officers in particular. Louima is black, and all
five officers charged in the case are white. Yet the four officers
who testified against Officer Volpe are white, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasant surprise,'' Napoleon said.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, asked Sunday if he would like to say something to the
officers who testified on his behalf, politely replied, ``At this
time, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, his uncle, continued to talk about judgment
day in all its meanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hand of God preserved the life of Abner that night,'' he
told the congregation. ``This same secret hand is acting now. I
don't think they will be able to do anything against the hand of
God.''

BAFFERT'S LACK OF A PLAN CONTINUES TO CONFUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will she or won't she? Her trainer will know first, but he isn't
sure yet.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday is a candidate to oppose Charismatic in the June
5 Belmont Stakes. Maybe she will. Maybe she won't. Then again,
maybe she will. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Her trainer, Bob Baffert, pondered the possibility last week. As
usual, the news media recorded his every utterance and immediately
took them to the headlines and the airwaves. The first reports
indicated the super filly _ a winner of eight consecutive races _
was ``likely'' for the mile-and-a-half Belmont, but that wording
was toned down the next few days when Baffert seemed to waffle
about the idea.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Baffert has been doing more waffling than a
breakfast house. He was sending Excellent Meeting back to
California, and then he ran her in the Preakness. He was running
Silverbulletday in the Preakness, and then he didn't. Prime Timber
was likely for the Preakness and then he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is getting a reputation in some corners as indecisive.
Or maybe not. But actually, that has more to do with training style
than personality.
</P>
<P>
   Some trainers meticulously plot out a schedule for their stakes
horses, months in advance, that is likely to earn the most money
and accolades. These trainers can be determined to make their
horses stick to the agenda no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, on the other hand, flies by the seat of his pants. If
he could fly a plane, he would be a bush pilot with goggles and a
scarf, navigating by the terrain rather than his instruments.
</P>
<P>
   He trains his horses on intuition and feel, not according to a
predetermined schedule. Because of his loquacious nature, he thinks
out loud about races he is considering for his horses. But in the
end, everything depends on the day-to-day physical condition of the
horses, not the other way around. When Silver Charm or Real Quiet
or Silverbulletday show Baffert they are in peak form, he looks for
spots to run them. If they aren't at their best, they stay in the
barn.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was quoted as considering Silverbulletday for the
Belmont for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, she is very fast and could possibly win the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the outcome of the Belmont Stakes could ultimately
determine the horse of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   If Silverbulletday doesn't run, Charismatic could lock up horse
of the year by winning the Belmont and completing the first Triple
Crown sweep in 21 years. But if Charismatic is beaten,
Silverbulletday could stake a claim to the title if she continues
to run well, and especially if she is the one to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday is scheduled for a workout tomorrow at Churchill
Downs, at which time Baffert might decide. Or not. Also on the
workout list tomorrow are Charismatic and Menifee.
</P>
<P>
   Until then and maybe later, Baffert rides the fence. It sounds
as if he is leaning toward not running her, but interpreting his
thoughts can lead to misinterpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her around in the fall,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I
don't want to look back and say, `What the hell was I thinking of?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is in a unique position. Two years ago, he came within a
length of winning the Triple Crown with Silver Charm for owners Bob
and Beverly Lewis. Now the Lewises have another Triple Crown
candidate in Charismatic, only trained by D. Wayne Lukas. And
Baffert could be their biggest obstacle to racing history.
</P>
<P>
   If Silverbulletday runs in the Belmont, she could be the
spoiler, as Touch Gold and Victory Gallop were the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   If she doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just sit back and root for Bob,'' Baffert said.

KITE MISSES AGAIN IN 26TH COLONIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Kite departed the MasterCard Colonial yesterday never having
won the event in 26 professional starts.
</P>
<P>
   But Kite made all 26 cuts in Fort Worth _ a tournament record _
and now heads to the Senior PGA Tour in January. He leaves Colonial
without the lifetime exemption past winners carry but could return
with a sponsor's exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the schedule is with the Senior Tour and
what tournament is opposite this one next year,'' Kite said. ``We
don't play hardly any golf courses of this caliber. If there's not
anything exceptional on the Senior Tour opposite this, I would like
to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   In 26 years, Kite, an Austin native, has never won a PGA Tour
event in Texas. His last chance comes at the Westin Texas Open in
San Antonio, scheduled for Sept. 23-26.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Kite's last Colonial round was under par (1 under) to
finish the four days at 281, 1 over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Colonial, another check,'' he said. ``Not much of one.
I keep finding a way to mess it up a little bit, but at least I got
to play four days.''
No. 18 proves easier
</P>
<P>
   Players completed the 1999 Colonial with a scoring average of
3.979 at the 18th hole, where a signature pecan tree guarding the
left-hand fairway was lost during an October storm. The hole ranked
13th in difficulty during the tournament, down four notches from
its traditional spot among the holes on the Colonial layout.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend scoring averages (3.873 on Saturday, 3.886
yesterday) were among the lowest single-round efforts recorded
during the 1990s. Only twice in the 1990s has Colonial's 18th hole
played easier than it did in 1999, with lower averages recorded in
1998 (3.902) and 1996 (3.974).
Early work stoppage
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended for an hour yesterday morning because of
lightning. Only 11 players were on the course when the horn
sounded, stopping play at 8:20 a.m. The golfers resumed at 9:20
a.m.
Fly like an eagle
</P>
<P>
   Colonial champion Olin Browne's victory could be traced to two
specific holes _ Nos. 1 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   With just two par-5s on Colonial's par-70 layout, taking
advantage and making birdies on those two is imperative. Browne
went one better, recording an eagle on each hole. After starting
the day at 4 under par, he went to 6 under with an eagle on No. 1,
then to 8 under with an eagle at 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two eagles, that doesn't happen to me very often in one
tournament _ much less in one day,'' Browne said.
Maturity prevails
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's victory by Olin Browne marked the 10th consecutive
year that a player over the age of 35 won the tournament. Browne
turned 40 on Saturday. The last under-35 winner of this tournament
was Ian Baker-Finch, who was 29 when he won the 1989 Colonial.
Though Baker-Finch won the 1991 British Open, the Colonial remains
his only PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   The names and ages for the last 10 Colonial champions: 1990 Ben
Crenshaw 38 1991 Tom Purtzer 39 1992 Bruce Lietzke 40 1993 Fulton

1997 David Frost 37 1998 Tom Watson 48 1999 Olin Browne 40
Brooks disappointed
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks finish tied for 65th, his lowest
finish out of the 11 cuts he has made at Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play any good,'' Brooks said. ``I hit it pretty
decent maybe two of the days, but not enough to shoot a good score
early in the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was outspoken during the tournament about the course's
hard fairways, which he said produced too much bounce off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of players probably enjoy hitting a lot of short
irons,'' Brooks said. ``You can see a guy hitting only four drivers
for the day. Normally, I'd probably hit about 10 drivers. The
biggest difference is it's so bouncy.''
Cook is cooked
</P>
<P>
   After each of the first three rounds of the tournament, John
Cook was no worse than fourth on the leader board and looked poised
to win his first PGA Tour event since winning the 1998 GTE Byron
Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Early yesterday, Cook was in contention for the lead after a
birdie on the fifth hole put him at 8 under. But the Toledo, Ohio,
native faltered badly down the stretch, bogeying four of the last
nine holes to finish at 1 over for the day and 5 under for the
tournament, three shots behind winner Olin Browne.
</P>
<P>
   The bogeys came on holes Nos. 10, 12, 14 and 18. Those were the
first bogeys he had on those holes all week.
</P>
<P>
   Cook finished in a 10-way tie for 11th and took home $50,680,
bringing his 1999 earnings to $408,548.

FORMER ORACLE EXECUTIVE TO JOIN PEOPLESOFT

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Peoplesoft Inc. plans to announce on Monday that
Craig Conway will become its president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   He will report to David Duffield, Peoplesoft's founder, who
continues as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Conway, a former executive of Oracle Corp., is joining a company
under pressure. An early leader in applications for managing human
resources and other so-called enterprise resource planning, or ERP,
processes, Peoplesoft has seen its growth slow as big corporations
delay major software deployments because of possible year 2000
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Peoplesoft has also come under direct attack from Oracle, which
has gained share in the market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But Conway, who is 44, said in a telephone interview that he saw
great assets and opportunities at Peoplesoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that has enormous accumulated assets, a very
loyal customer base, and an almost fanatically loyal employee
base,'' he said. ``This is a company that should be very well
positioned to exploit future options in the e-business area. The
No. 1 challenge is prioritizing the opportunities the company has
available to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peoplesoft's shares closed unchanged on Friday at $16.1875 in
Nasdaq trading, but they are down 69 percent from their 52-week
high of $52.12.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting one-time charges, Peoplesoft reported first-quarter
earnings of $7.6 million, or 3 cents a diluted share, down from
$33.8 million, or 13 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Revenue rose 10 percent, to $305.4 million, from $277.7 million in
the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One-time charges of $176.4 million related to the spin-off of
Momentum Business Applications Inc. and $4.4 million related to
layoffs resulted in a net loss for the quarter of $171.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Duffield, who is 58, said Peoplesoft's problems were part of an
industry-wide phenomenon that had also affected companies like SAP,
Baan and Oracle, but he said he thought the worst had passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect pickup before the year 2000. There is more and
more confidence on the part of CIOs that they're OK, they're going
to be fine,'' he said, referring to chief information officers.
``That opens up the opportunity to bring in the next generation of
software packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway was most recently president and chief executive of One
Touch Systems Inc. in San Jose, which was acquired by Hughes
Network Systems and Apollo Group. He was previously president and
chief executive of TGV Software Inc. in Santa Cruz, now part of
Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He was with Oracle for eight years, ultimately as executive vice
president for marketing.

AS YELTSIN GOES ON VACATION, RUSSIANS WONDER WHERE THE POWER
RESIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Politika in third graf) (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Having fired a government, squelched an impeachment
drive and installed a colorless but loyal police commander as prime
minister and potential successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
headed south Friday for what his aides described as a well-deserved
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   As for ordinary Russians, they were left _ once again _ out in
the cold, and in the dark. If the extraordinary events of the last
11 days proved anything, it was that Russia's fledgling democracy
is as secretive, and arcane, as the Communist regime it replaced
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion of the silent majority _ that is at least 77
percent of the population which does not want to see upheavals _ is
ignored,'' said Vyacheslav Nikonov, head of the Politika
Foundation, a political think-tank. ``The authorities and public
opinion have in the past week been acting totally at cross
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the name of stopping a purported Communist comeback,
spearheaded by former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's popular if
inactive government, the Kremlin has reverted to form. Now it's
back to the days of `cadres' (an old Soviet term for personnel) and
clans, of backroom deals and hidden agendas, of rumors and oblique
hints.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politics have never been free of intrigue, but the
eight-month tenure of Primakov, whose coalition Cabinet included
Communist ministers and was backed by Yeltsin's Communist
opposition, did mark the first attempt by the Yeltsin
administration to rule not by confrontation, but consensus.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last. ``The consensus model of government suited an
overwhelming majority of the population, and an overwhelming
majority of the elite,'' said Nikonov. ``But it sidelined the
president's administration, and reduced its ability to play the
decisive role in deciding who would be Yeltsin's successor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kremlin's view, Primakov's coalition government had
overshot its role as a guarantor of stability, and was rapidly
becoming a launching pad for the Communist party's long-term
ambitions _ first as a source of financial support for coming
parliamentary elections and for Primakov's own anticipated
candidacy in the June 2000 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Primakov's firing, Yeltsin's advisers
took pains to depict the power struggle in Manichean terms. On the
eve of the government shake-up, one top Kremlin official described
the prime minister as ``strategically dangerous,'' a man who if
allowed to govern Russia until 2000, would emerge as a ``cross
between (Communist party leader Gennadi) Zyuganov and Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Primakov out of power, some Kremlin advisers are
talking about grooming his successor, Sergei Stepashin, a
47-year-old veteran of Russia's security services, as Yeltsin's
latest heir, an alternative not only to the Communists but also to
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential aspirant.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Luzhkov was in good favor with Yeltsin. Now, after
failing a number of loyalty tests, he is again feeling a cold wind
blowing from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's success hinges on his ability to survive the coming
year, until the eve of presidential elections scheduled for June
2000. In that time, he must negotiate the passage of tough fiscal
legislation required to ward off Russia's default on foreign loans,
and navigate parliamentary elections due in December.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he must survive the whims of an emotional and jealous
president who could at any moment overturn the best of strategies.
Among the wild cards now said to be under consideration is a
popular referendum to unite Russia with Belarus, its western Slavic
neighbor, in a union that would throw Russia's political calendar
wide open because it would create a new entity in need of a new _
or old _ president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Stepashin manages to stay and be the last premier before
the elections, he has a very good chance to become a presidential
candidate supported not only by the Kremlin _ which is important,
but not that important _ and the regional elite which is more
important, and key political forces,'' said Alexander Shokhin, a
former minister and centrist Duma deputy. ``So far, he has a
chance, provided he is not fired in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's credentials for his new role are still obscure. His
record as head of Russia's domestic intelligence service was
blotted by a disastrous performance in the early days of Moscow's
conflict with the breakaway republic of Chechnya. His views on
economics are pretty much a blank but his loyalty to Yeltsin _ with
whom he began his national career _ is absolute.
</P>
<P>
   As one recent poll indicated, many Russians are ready for a
law-and-order candidate, and Stepashin holds the rank of colonel
general in Russia's interior forces. Others look to Stepashin, son
of a naval officer from St. Petersburg, as an example of a new
generation of more mild-mannered, urbane politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we voting for Sergei Stepashin?'' asked Vladimir
Zhironovsky, Russia's most virulently anti-Communist nationalist,
during the debate that ended last Wednesday with Stepashin's
overwhelming confirmation as prime minister on first try. ``Simply
because we are sick and tired of people from the sticks. For the
first time in the past 100 years, someone from St. Petersburg will
head the government.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stepashin learns the ropes, who is running the country these
days?
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious answer is Yeltsin himself. After a winter of
hibernation, the 68-year-old president roared back to center stage
in the spring, despite an apparent _ but officially unconfirmed _
physical relapse. In recent appearances, his step has been
unsteady, his speech labored, and even slurred, and his
off-the-cuff comments confused.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, stands a tiny group of Kremlin insiders who include
top members of his administration as well as his daughter Tatyana
Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   This group, known here simply as the ``Family,'' has became the
conduit for a remarkable comeback by two of Russia's most
politically unpopular figures _ Anatoly Chubais, a liberal reformer
and former privatization czar, and if press reports are to be
believed, Boris Berezovsky, a multibillionaire financier with
irrepressible political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais has all but openly admitted his role in the decision,
made late on May 11 at the Kremlin , to fire Primakov and replace
him with Stepashin. Interviewed by Newsweek magazine, Chubais, now
head of the national electric utility company, called the
appointment of Stepashin ``a strategic and reasonable step by
Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Kremlin strategies are not always smoothly executed, as
became embarrassingly apparent on May 12, the day that Primakov's
firing was announced.
</P>
<P>
   First, Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the
parliament's lower house, told deputies that he had had a call from
the president, informing him that the next prime minister would be
Nikolai Aksyonenko, a little-known railways minister (since
promoted to become Stepashin's first deputy prime minister).
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Seleznyov again interrupted the proceedings with
the news that a letter from the Kremlin had arrived, nominating
Stepashin as prime minister. Seleznyov smiled, and shrugged. ``I
came to work today with clean ears, and my telephone is working,''
he said, as the deputies roared with laughter. ``The president told
me Aksyonenko, which is what I told you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian politicians, journalists and analysts are convinced
that the president's confusion may not have been accidental. As the
haggling over Stepashin's Cabinet appointments moves into full
swing, the newspapers have been full of reports of a struggle
between Chubais, and Berezovsky, who reportedly backed the
Aksyonenko nomination.
</P>
<P>
   How much real influence is wielded by Berezovsky is difficult to
gauge since his Kremlin access reportedly goes directly through
Mrs. Dyachenko, the youngest of the president's two daughters and
his political counselor since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin Yumashev and Alexander Voloshin, the Kremlin's former
and current chief of staff respectively, each have ties to
Berezovsky. A master of intrigue who is said to have taken care of
the Yeltsin family finances, Berezovsky is also a master of
illusion, and of the well-planted leak designed to suggest _
without proof _ that his political comeback is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is the most notorious of the so-called oligarchs who
made fortunes in the early days of Russia's chaotic privatization.
As long as Primakov was in power, Berezovsky was on the defensive,
targeted by a series of well-publicized corruption probes that
threatened to creep into the Kremlin itself.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov was fired, Berezovsky _ then in France _ lept back
into the limelight with a statement that portrayed the decision as
a triumph of good over evil. ``Primakov's dismissal is not just a
replacement of one person to the post of prime minister for
another, it is ``an abortion of an attempt for a Communist and KGB
revenge in Russia,'' Berezovsky told the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stepashin, the financier's praise was lukewarm.
``Stepashin doubtless shares the president's ideology and will
doubtless follow the course of reforms,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET CHAOS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, May 24:
</P>
<P>
   Congress' recent self-destructive budget maneuvering suggests no
one with a guiding philosophy is in command. Last week the
Republican leadership was pushing a budget blueprint that, if
implemented, would slice tens of billions of dollars from vital
domestic programs. At the same time, Republican lawmakers admitted
that they lacked the votes to get these cuts passed in
appropriation bills. Then, while preaching fiscal discipline, they
passed a bloated emergency spending bill that tapped the surplus
for pork-barrel spending that they say they deplore.
</P>
<P>
   In a burst of candor, Dick Armey, the combative House majority
leader, warned that the Republican budget plan would cause
``sticker shock'' among lawmakers, who apparently had no idea how
big the cuts would be when they voted in broad terms to trim the
budget. In the same vein, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader,
admitted that many Republicans senators are already saying, ``Oh,
oh, oh, we can't live up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey and Lott were not trying to get out of making their cuts.
They were simply trying to prepare their troops for what lies
ahead. The plan calls for $26.3 billion in domestic spending cuts,
or 11 percent below the current levels, in such programs as
education aid, housing, job training, health, environmental
protection and basic research. With an expected surplus next year
of more than $100 billion, slashing these programs makes no sense,
except to the right wing of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of an incipient revolt could be seen on Capitol Hill last
week. The two top Republicans on the House and Senate
appropriations committees, Rep. Bill Young of Florida and Sen. Ted
Stevens of Alaska, made it clear they have no intention of living
within the ceilings. They disagree on which spending levels to
exceed.
</P>
<P>
   Few want to admit the obvious, that the Republican budget
strategy is unrealistic. Military spending cannot be raised, taxes
cannot be cut and arbitrary budget ceilings cannot be imposed
without eviscerating domestic programs desired by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone needs to rethink the budget ceilings enacted in 1997.
These caps were put in place when a balanced budget seemed
unattainable. With large surpluses, the caps can be selectively
adjusted without danger of the federal government's plunging back
into red ink. Many lawmakers realize the need, but each party is
hoping the other will jump first.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of legislative hypocrisy is the $15 billion
emergency package to finance the war in Yugoslavia and provide
disaster relief for Central America and American farmers.
Initially, the measure was tightly confined to urgent needs. But
Congress loaded it with pet projects like subsidies for reindeer
ranchers and the Salt Lake City Olympics. The bill also got weighed
down with riders rolling back environmental and wilderness
protections, though the worst of these were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders want to force colleagues to confront the
budget-cutting consequences of their own anti-government rhetoric.
But this is a needlessly damaging way for lawmakers to learn about
the difficulty of translating slogans into laws. It is not too late
for them to take a more sensible course. &QL;

SIR ROBERT JAMES, 66, BRITISH HISTORIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Robert Rhodes James, a British historian and biographer who
had been a Conservative member of Parliament and an investigator of
Kurt Waldheim's war record, died on May 20. He was 66 and lived
near Sandy, in Bedfordshire, England.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert had been ill for some time, a Conservative Party
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert, who was knighted in 1991 for political service, will
be best remembered for his historical work as a writer who focused
largely on British politics in the 19th and 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony Eden,'' his biography of the Conservative who served
as prime minister from 1955 to 1957, was called ``splendid'' by
Gaddis Smith, the Larned professor of history at Yale, in The New
York Times Book Review in 1987. His book ``Gallipoli'' (1965) has
been called the definitive account of the unsuccessful Allied
expedition in World War I whose goals included seizing what is now
Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Sir Robert was described in the Times
Literary Supplement as ``an accomplished contemporary historian and
biographer who wants to vindicate an older method of interpreting
and analyzing politics, in which literary style and human and
political insight are at least as important as the priestly
laying-on of slide-rules.''
</P>
<P>
   On a loftier note, Sir Robert once commented, ``The task of the
historian or the biographer is the pursuit of truth, motivated by a
love of learning for its own sake.''
</P>
<P>
   He was member of Parliament for Cambridge from 1976 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 to 1976 he was principal officer in the executive
office of the secretary-general of the United Nations, who was then
Kurt Waldheim of Austria. Later, when it was alleged that Waldheim
had been guilty of brutality during the Nazi era, Sir Robert said
in a 1988 interview that he ``realized we were dealing with a liar
who must have something very substantial to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert then played a key role in the British investigation
of Waldheim's record.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert was born in Murree, India, the son of an army
officer. He studied modern history at Oxford, and then held posts
at the House of Commons and in academia.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Angela Margaret
Robertson, and four daughters.

ABORTION FOES DRAW NEW ENERGY FROM A STRATEGY OF POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ After years of futile attempts to impose limits
on abortions through protests at clinics and raucous demands for
constitutional changes, abortion opponents in New Jersey have
changed their strategy _ relying as much on petitions, polling and
back-room political negotiations as on blockades and bullhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have definitely gotten smarter about this,'' said Marie
Tasy, the director of public and legislative affairs for New Jersey
Right to Life, the state's largest and oldest anti-abortion
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent victory for abortion opponents came late last
week, when the Assembly Judiciary Committee released legislation
that would require parental notification before a teen-ager could
receive an abortion. Gov. Christie Whitman, in spite of her staunch
support of abortion rights, quickly endorsed the measure, all but
assuring that it would glide through the Republican-controlled
Assembly and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents have played out a similar strategy in
statehouses across the country, confounding their rivals even in
bedrock abortion-rights states like New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a national strategy and it's a state-by-state-by-state
strategy, where they know they can't win on the issue outright so
they hit around the edges and they go after the most vulnerable
first,'' said Chris Korsmo, acting director of government relations
for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ``They go after
those who have no voice because they are poor and need public funds
for abortions; they go after minors because they do not have the
vote; they go after those women with dire medical problems who may
need later-term abortions. But by hitting around the edges, they
are able to limit access to a very large number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-thought-out strategy that has energized abortion
opponents, focused near-constant public attention on the issue and
helped direct the abortion debate toward common-ground issues, like
parental notification, that attract broad support among the public
and politicians alike. And in many cases it has kept supporters of
abortion rights scrambling for a counterstrategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to turn the tide and advance a proactive agenda and
not be put in the position of having to play defense all the
time,'' Ms. Korsmo said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that strategy been more effective in recent years
than in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have consistently shown that most New Jersey residents
back the right of a woman to have a legal abortion, a fact that
until recently had been a political brake on any serious
legislative attempts to limit or reverse abortion rights in the
state. In addition, a succession of recent governors were outspoken
supporters of abortion rights, especially Mrs. Whitman, a moderate
Republican and the state's first female governor.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she braved the wrath of conservatives and vetoed
legislation banning a late-term procedure that opponents call
partial-birth abortion. The Legislature overrode her veto, but a
state court eventually declared the measure unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But people on both sides of the abortion fight agreed that the
debate over the late-term procedure established a beachhead that
made it easier for the parental notification legislation to advance
after a decade of defeats and made it harder for Mrs. Whitman to
continue to oppose an idea that had become common ground for a
majority of New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College Poll taken in March 1998, at the height of
the debate over the late-term abortion procedure, showed that 71
percent of New Jersey residents supported a requirement that
parental consent be given before a girl under 18 years of age could
have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have the right to direct the upbringing and education
of their minor children, which includes being involved in any
medical issues regarding these children,'' Liz Tait, legislative
liaison for Concerned Women for America, a conservative public
policy group that opposes abortion, said after last week's
committee vote. ``Let's hope that this bill will pass quickly
through the Assembly and Senate. Being an intelligent and
reasonable person, surely Governor Whitman will have to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to win broad support for the bill, its proponents,
including anti-abortion activists who testified before the
committee, shaped the debate as a pro-family and parental rights
issue rather than a fight over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proponents of this bill would like to ban all abortions,''
said Lenora Lapidus, legal director for the American Civil
Liberties Union of New Jersey. ``This is not about family
communications; this is about making abortions more difficult for
whatever population they can target one at a time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of parental notification have worked since 1989 for a
law, and every year legislation has been drafted, only to die
without ever making it to a committee for consideration. That
changed this year when, over the course of several days, the
legislation was put on a fast track by Speaker Jack Collins,
catching opponents and the Whitman administration alike off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was right,'' said Assemblyman John Rooney, who
sponsored the bill with Assemblywoman Marion Crecco, a fellow
Republican. ``We had already done the partial-birth bill and laid
the groundwork.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Mrs. Whitman and her own political
predicament. The governor found herself politically exposed,
unwilling to risk rekindling conservative anger over her veto of
the partial birth legislation as she prepares to run for the U.S.
Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ''It has a lot to do with it,'' Rooney said. ``I think she needs
to get closer to the center on social issues, and this could help.
She is very liberal on social issues, but in this one she has moved
a little bit more to the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of abortion rights seemed slow to grasp the changing
political landscape. Even as Rooney was before the committee
introducing amendments that the Whitman administration had insisted
on to soften some of the language in his bill, abortion rights
advocates were still hoping that Mrs. Whitman, who had opposed
previous parental notification bills, would find the legislation
too unpalatable to support, in part because it did not include a
clear-cut exception for abortions in cases in which the woman's
health is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still no health exception, and she has stood firm on
that issue,'' Ms. Lapidus, the ACLU legal director, said during a
break as she pored over Rooney's revised bill. ``The governor, in
the past, has always required that there be a health exception, and
there's no health exception.''

A BEHIND-THE-SCREENS GLIMPSE OF AN INTERNET RETAILER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Head south on Interstate 5 from downtown Seattle and you cannot
miss the huge, terra cotta office tower that commands the horizon
from a nearby peak.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is the new home of Amazon.com, the ever-expanding
Internet retailer that most other Internet retailers worship and
strive to emulate. The Amazon creed is to break the budget on
acquiring new customers _ on the theory that big profits will come
later, once the company's name is established and the Web's lower
operating costs make it impossible for brick-and-mortar competitors
to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   But drive another 20 minutes down the highway from this shrine
to E-commerce, and you come to an undistinguished, low-lying office
park in the industrial suburb of Kent. Here, an E-business with a
very different philosophy is blossoming: rei.com, the Internet
division of the outdoor gear and apparel retailer Recreational
Equipment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Though rei.com is small compared with Amazon.com _ only $50
million in annual sales versus $610 million _ it is similarly
dominating in its market. One of every $100 spent on outdoor gear
this year will pass through rei.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like Amazon's management, the people who run rei.com are proud
of their results and have big plans for the future. But unlike
Amazon, rei.com turns a profit. Recreational Equipment Inc.,
generally known as REI, also operates real-world retail stores,
giving the outdoors company a first-hand basis for comparing the
online to the old-line business models. REI's experiences run
counter to the main assumptions that have grown up around
E-commerce and have contributed to the stratospheric stock prices
of Web retailers like Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the myths, rei.com says:
</P>
<P>
   Running brick-and-mortar stores has turned out to be not a
liability but a huge advantage. The operating costs of the Web site
have consistently gone up _ not down. Whatever the barriers that
Internet technology may pose to potential rivals, that advantage
has been largely offset by the start-up's own, daunting technical
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an inexpensive way to do business,'' said REI's
chief operating officer, Dennis Madsen. ``As most of the pure plays
have shown, there is not a lot of profit in it, and I don't see the
economics changing in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that REI doesn't view E-commerce as an
important part of the company's future. Nor does it mean that
industry experts see REI as a bumbler. ``They are a great
company,'' said Kate Delhagen, a senior E-commerce analyst with
Forrester Research. ``I use them all the time as my poster child
for success.''
</P>
<P>
   As a behind-the-screens look at REI's Web operation makes clear,
the point is simply that online retailing is one tough business.
That is true even for an offbeat company like REI, whose quirks
have offered serendipitous advantages.
</P>
<P>
   REI, which was founded in 1938, is a cooperative, which means
that at the end of each year, 85 percent of its profits are divided
among 1.5 million customers who have paid an annual membership fee.
REI was receptive early on to the Internet, going on line in
September 1996, at a time when most traditional retailers were
still taking a wait-and-see stance.
</P>
<P>
   REI also benefited from the demographics of its active,
outward-bound customer/members _ a whopping 83 percent of whom have
Internet access at home or at work, almost double the national
average. Finally, having a catalog operation that already brought
it more than 5 percent of the company revenue by 1996 gave the
retailer an important head start in warehousing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with these advantages, the effort to build rei.com into
a viable Web business has been far from a cakewalk for the
executive in charge of the Internet start-up: Matt Hyde, a tall,
sinewy 36-year-old mountain climber.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who is now vice president for online sales, has been with
the company since he graduated from Oregon State with a degree in
geology but quit twice, once in his mid-20s to start a business
that ran climbing trips in exotic locales like Afghanistan and
Chile. He compares building a Web site to ascending an oxygen-less
23,000-foot peak: ``You do it because it's a challenge, not because
it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Hyde who is listkeeper for the most common Internet
business myths, and his favorite is the idea that a physical store
is more expensive to run than a Web store.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has been known to brag that
he employs but a third of the staff of his biggest competitor,
Barnes &AMP; Noble, to achieve a proportional amount of book sales.
Internet ventures may have smaller staffs, Hyde concedes, but they
must pay those staff members considerably more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technical people are a lot more expensive than part-time
salesclerks,'' he said. Now, for example, REI's flagship store in
Seattle employs roughly 300 people, while all of rei.com has but
60. Yet Hyde says the payrolls for that store and for rei.com come
out to about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he says, the balance will tilt toward the Web site, as the
cost of the site's payroll rises steadily. Competition for
information-technology expertise is so fierce that every three or
four months Hyde reviews published studies on salaries in the
industry and, if he is lagging, automatically offers raises to his
technical team. The industry average for a skilled technical
position, like programmer or systems manager, is about $80,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also rebuts the notion that operating real stores _ with
four walls, air conditioning, shelves to restock and so on _ is
more expensive than keeping their virtual counterparts running. It
is true that the average REI store costs $6 million, including
everything from building costs to new fixtures, and is remodeled
every 5 to 10 years. Rei.com, in contrast, spent $500,000 for its
original opening, including all machinery and programming. But the
rei.com upgrades have never ceased _ and probably never will,
according to Rod Ketchum, the operation's beefy, pony-tailed senior
Web adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchum said he had ordered four upgrades in the last two
months. The most recent was a $500,000 overhaul by IBM to enable
the system to use its processing power more efficiently. Rei.com
has also rebuilt its Web page from the ground up twice, completely
remodeling such features as the search engine and the graphics, and
will do so again next March. Minor changes will also be made when
rei.com officially links up with Outside magazine's new Web site
next month.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has been cheap. Hyde estimates that he has spent in
excess of $15 million since 1996 on upgrades and remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde, who previously managed REI's adventure travel program
and its direct-mail operation, had expected the technology costs.
Some other expenses have come as a surprise.

UNDATED: as a surprise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In setting up the operation, Hyde thought he could piggyback off
the photographic, distribution and warehousing capacities of the
company's catalog operation. But for displays in its catalog, for
example, REI shoots film, and rei.com managers quickly realized
that digital images worked better for the Web. So Hyde has had to
build three $20,000 stations for digital photography.
</P>
<P>
   The vaunted advantage of a Web site is that it can offer a far
more complete selection of merchandise than a catalog or even a
flagship store. Rei.com keeps 56,000 items in stock. Apparel styles
change twice a year; ``hard'' goods like tents, sleeping bags and
bicycles are redesigned by their manufacturers annually.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains, in other words, why the best-known Internet
merchants sell mainly books and compact disks. Such items are
standardized and do not require the same merchandizing finesse as,
say, REI's Gramicci Serpentine knit cotton shirt or the Dagger
Delta Expedition Kayak. As Bill Curry, an Amazon spokesman, said,
his company ``either scans in the covers or gets the images from
the publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   From kayaks to crampons, rei.com ships 93 percent of its
Internet orders within 24 hours. That is 3 percent better than last
year, but it is still not as fast as Hyde and Koch would like. They
are planning a new ``just in time'' system that would allow them to
process orders within an hour of placement.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike booksellers, which work mostly with a handful of
distributors accustomed to shipping small quantities of their
products at light speed, REI has more than 1,000 vendors. Some have
modern assembly-line operations that can deliver products
overnight. Others, like Metolius Mountain Products, a tiny company
in Oregon that makes rock-climbing harnesses, cannot work as
quickly. Hyde has been bringing his vendors to the warehouse in
small groups to explain the Web business and to help find ways to
operate at Internet speed, but he acknowledges that ``these things
take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Because rei.com is not publicly traded _ and its executives say
it is not likely to go public because they are not interested in
losing control to the market _ it does not have access to a
bottomless well of outside capital. The parent company, which does
$587 million in sales annually, has been supportive enough that the
start-up has had to make few sacrifices. Still, some
belt-tightening has been unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cuts that caused some soul-searching was a recent
decision to give vendors the job of writing the detailed product
descriptions that appear next to the photos on the Web. That was a
distinct departure for a retailer that prides itself on
knowledgeable in-store salespeople who can interpret the baffling
array of capacities and features that high-tech outdoor gear
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while Hyde acknowledges that he envies the venture-capital
or stock-market riches of Internet pure plays, he does not cede
them the online advantage. ``There is a very synergistic role
between online and retail,'' he said. ``It is just a matter of
leveraging your advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing, as expected, is a big advantage. Surveys show that
most REI Web customers already knew the retailer's name before they
logged on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, feared disadvantages like cannibalization _ that is,
that the Web operation would take customers from REI stores _ have
not been borne out.
</P>
<P>
   True, REI estimates that 50 percent of the folks shopping with
them on line are repeat customers. But the company has found that
customers who are ``multi-channel'' shoppers _ using stores and the
Web, say _ spend on average $15O more a visit than single-channel
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about being able to serve our best customers
better,'' explained Shelley Olds, rei.com's marketing manager. And,
presumably, to get them to spend even more.
</P>
<P>
   Some American retailers have talked of using the Internet as a
way to sell globally without opening stores overseas. Today rei.com
plans to open a Web site in Japanese, japan.rei.com. But that is
prelude to, not in place of, opening a Japanese store, as REI plans
to do in Tokyo next April.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde explained that having a real store in Japan would benefit
his entire Web operation, because obstacles like tariffs, exchange
rates and customs regulations can make it costly and cumbersome to
ship overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that within a year rei.com will sell more than any
one of the company's stores. ``If this becomes a lot easier, and
for some reason the technology and operation costs go down, I still
do not think we are going to make a big profit,'' he said. ``I
don't think our customers would let us get away with it, and I
don't think our competition would let us get away with it. For now
we are just trying to eke out a business.''

`MELROSE PLACE,' `MAD ABOUT YOU' MAKE IT EASY TO SAY GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Melrose Place'' sadly approaches its series finale Monday
night. TV viewers everywhere shake their heads and say, ``Is (set
ital)that(end ital) still on?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but only long enough to say goodbye with a typically
tasteful installment called ``Asses to Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   There's talk about a wedding, a funeral and closure for Heather
Locklear. There is no talk about ``MP'' being picked up by PBS for
the fall, though it could mean whole new vistas for ``Masterpiece
Theatre.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox didn't send a preview copy of the series finale for critical
perusal. So after much soul-searching and reflection about the
meaning of this excellent TV series, I've concluded: Screw it,
let's move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About You'' is also crawling and gasping its way to the
finish line Monday night, and ``Home Improvement'' shoves off
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't know about you, but when I think about ``Mad About You,''
I think it's really incredibly generous of NBC to have arranged for
Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt to get $1 million an episode to be in a
dead show.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I would love to perfect a dead show myself, just so
NBC, in another brilliant business decision, could pay me $1
million a week. For $1.99 million a week, I'd eliminate the co-star
and save NBC some bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's finale is an hour long and strives for a
bittersweet mood. It also feels ... very ... weary.
</P>
<P>
   Guest star Janeane Garofalo plays the Buchmans' baby girl,
Mabel, as a young adult in the year 2021. She has just made a film
about the main influences on her life, her parents, and is talking
to us about how wacky they are.
</P>
<P>
   It also turns out that, in that same year 2021, Paul and Jamie
(Reiser and Hunt) split up, in a sort of ``Mad at You'' scenario.
Will they reunite in time for a final smooch? Is Oakland on the
east side of the bay?
</P>
<P>
   Jumping back and forth in the future, the finale in effect shows
us episodes that might have been in seasons to come.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Paul has a vasectomy, but there are second
thoughts. Or, Paul and Jamie keep trying to have the requisite sex
talk with Mabel.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, you'll feel relieved that the show didn't have all those
future seasons. Best to remember them as they were, in 1992, before
constant time slot changes, the passing seasons, overexposure, the
baby and creative fatigue got the best of a once-solid comedy.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Mad About You'' attempts bittersweet, ``Home Improvement''
keeps veering toward maudlin in its own 90-minute series finale
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't enough energy left even to be maudlin. Mainly
it's a clips show _ all those choice comedy bits from seasons past
_ that eventually turns into an outtakes fest. Now that is truly
tired.
</P>
<P>
   The old clips and outtakes are wrapped around a thinly realized
story line involving the end of ``Tool Time,'' the marriage of Al
(Richard Karn) and the Taylors' move from Detroit to a new life in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   A confession. Back in 1991, I saw little hope for a series based
on Tim Allen's stand-up act. It seemed all simian grunts and power
tools, hardly a foundation for a hit show. What happens in the
third week?
</P>
<P>
   But Allen, Patricia Richardson and the show's producers had
their fingers on something real about humdrum middle American life.
</P>
<P>
   It shows in ``Home Improvement's'' astonishing ratings record.
It was TV's most popular show in the 1993-94 season, when it peaked
with a 20.4 rating average. Through April, its average this season
was exactly half of that, 10.2.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, it also shows in Tuesday night's clips from past
years. Amid the pratfalls and kitchen explosions and sex jokes,
there's something meaty and, yes, even touching about the life of a
family and the bond between a husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, at least, ``Home Improvement'' dies old and still
makes an attractive corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's finale seems to go through several concluding stages
before we see the teary cast members taking their final bows in
front of the show's studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's then, finally, that ``Home Improvement'' dishes out its
final gimmick. That full, unconcealed face belongs to Earl Hindman,
otherwise known as the Taylors' philosophical neighbor, Wilson.

NEW YORK STATE COMMISSION AIMS TO ENSURE FREE LIBRARY SERVICE FOR
ALL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON STATION, N.Y. _ In recent weeks, a public commission
has been on the road, studying the future of New York's libraries
and looking for ways to ensure that all state residents have free
access to their services.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission, appointed last year, by the Board of
Regents, has held public hearings in Buffalo, where library users
fear that a regionalization plan will shut down their small
community branches; in Syracuse and Brooklyn, where the panel heard
about the shortage of elementary school librarians; and, most
recently, here on Long Island, where the practice of charging fees
for out-of-towners has run afoul of state law.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread at the hearings has been the need to ensure free
access to basic library services, something that 1.3 million New
Yorkers still do not have, education officials say. Nor do most
elementary schools in the state have a librarian, they say, let
alone a complete library.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the state's 770 public library systems meet
basic standards, many are inadequately prepared for the growing
information needs of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of an information glut, but very few
people have access to it or know how to discern what is viable
information and how to apply it to their daily lives,'' said Martin
Gomez, director of the Brooklyn Public Library and a co-chairman of
the panel, formally known as the New York state Board of Regents
Commission on Library Services.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has until next spring to prepare a report
recommending how to provide a high level of library service to all
New Yorkers. ``Free access to a library, in my view, is an American
right,'' said Frank J. Macchiarola, a commission member from
Brooklyn. ``And it's our job to help make certain this becomes a
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how much it would cost to meet that goal.
``I know that there is no such thing as a free library, just as
there is no free lunch,'' Macchiarola said at last week's hearing
here at the Huntington Townhouse. ``Such service costs money. But
we should be able to find creative ways to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of free access is of particular concern on Long
Island. Most librarians here agree in principle with the state
librarian, Janet Welch, also a commission member, that all New
Yorkers should have free access. But directors of the 98 public
libraries in Nassau and Suffolk Counties say they cannot afford to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   They told the commission that they were bound by their local
charters to serve only the residents of their districts, who pay
property taxes to support a library. To accommodate residents of
nearby towns, though, they have decided that they must charge a
user fee, in some places as much as $300 a family.
</P>
<P>
   Such fees, however, were banned when the state established
public library guidelines 50 years ago. In December, the Regents
warned libraries throughout the state that they would start
enforcing the ban in January.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Regents create a new plan for libraries based on the
commission's coming report, Ms. Welch said, they have asked that
librarians cut out some of their more expensive services for
nonresidents, like the heavily attended story-telling hours or
borrowing best-selling books and videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Welch said the commission was awaiting results of a survey
of state residents on their library use and priorities and are
studying practices in other states. In Georgia, for example,
revenue from a state lottery is designated for providing all
residents free libraries and an electronic research data base, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's final hearing will be held June 3 at the State
University of New York at Albany.

COMMENTARY: WHY `RACIAL PROFILING' WILL BE TOUGH TO FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``racial profiling'' scandal in New Jersey has quieted down
while civil rights lawyers and federal officials mull over how to
discourage state police from targeting and searching motorists
based solely on race.
</P>
<P>
   Black New Jerseyans had complained for years about this practice
and felt vindicated when the Justice Department threatened to sue
if New Jersey did not work on a remedy. After years of stalling,
Gov. Christie Whitman conceded that some state troopers had
deliberately singled out black motorists.
</P>
<P>
   But a plan that discourages profiling will be difficult to
forge. The lesson from Maryland, for example, is that police
continue to target and harass minority motorists even after
high-profile lawsuits and consent decrees have required them to
stop. Agreements hammered out in court could take years to change
the way police officers behave.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment of innocent black motorists has become an issue
in California, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and elsewhere.
But the most instructive case is that of Maryland, which has been
embroiled in this matter since 1992, when state police illegally
searched and detained a black lawyer named Robert L. Wilkins,
violating his constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were following department guidelines that
explicitly singled out black males who drove expensive cars and
carried beepers _ a description that fit doctors, lawyers and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland paid to settle Wilkins vs. Maryland State Police out of
court and agreed to maintain detailed records, beginning in 1995,
of all motorist stops in which the police requested permission to
search vehicles. But discrimination continued along the highways.
The detailed records showed such vivid discrimination that the
Maryland NAACP used them as the basis of a class action lawsuit
that is making its way through a U.S. District Court in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that black motorists account for 17 percent
of the traffic _ and the same percentage of speeders _ along
Interstate 95 in northeastern Maryland. But the data collected by
the police show that 77 percent of the motorists who were stopped
and searched between 1995 and 1997 were minority drivers who were
no more likely to be guilty of anything than were the whites who
were stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland tried to argue that the practice was justified, despite
data showing little overall difference in drug use between blacks
and whites.
</P>
<P>
   The records compiled to satisfy the Wilkins settlement contain a
detailed audit of state police traffic stops and a close portrait
of each officer's behavior. The records show that two officers
named in the class action suit stopped only black motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in a deposition, a senior state police officer
admitted that the brass thought nothing of the numbers and did
nothing to follow up _ even though the department had signed the
consent decree in the Wilkins case.
</P>
<P>
   The class action complaint describes 17 cases of black motorists
who were stopped for no apparent reason. The suit could eventually
include hundreds of other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the named plaintiffs, Gary Rodwell of Philadelphia, was
pulled over and detained for three hours on Interstate 95 in
Harford County. When Rodwell asked for an explanation, an officer
said he ``looked like a drug dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodwell's car was searched twice _ once by hand, then by a
drug-sniffing dog. When the search turned up nothing, the officer
told Rodwell that he was going to arrest him anyway. But instead of
taking him in, the officer gave Rodwell's car to a tow-truck
operator, who declined to return it until Rodwell paid him $80.
</P>
<P>
   Another Maryland trooper has pleaded guilty to robbing black
motorists in addition to searching them.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland state police officers seem to have recorded most of
their data honestly. But accusations of records fraud by some New
Jersey state police officers will make it difficult _ and expensive
_ to document misconduct in the Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   Two state troopers have already been indicted for doctoring
records, and more indictments could be on the way. Investigators
discovered the discrepancies by tracking down motorists listed in
the records and determining that the officers had stopped black
motorists and listed them as white.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities will need to perform these detailed audits not
just in criminal investigations, but also as part of a regular
routine. The auditors also need to be insulated from interference
by the police. Only a constant threat of exposure will prevent
bigots in uniform from acting out their beliefs.

YANKS FIND MAGIC IN THE 9TH AND A VICTORY IN THE 10TH
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Magical. Joe Torre employed the word before Sunday's
game to describe the 1996 season, when the New York Yankees were
not as invincible in winning the World Series as they were during
the phenomenal 1998 season. It was an appropriate day to make the
reference.
</P>
<P>
   Something magical happened at Comiskey Park Sunday as the
Yankees completed an improbable comeback in their 8-7 victory over
the White Sox in 10 innings. It was the type of crazy triumph that
reminded the Yankees of 1996 and 1998 and made them hope that there
is more magic in 1999. Maybe Sunday was the start. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Simas balked in the tying run during a four-run ninth
inning and accused Derek Jeter of shouting ``balk'' from third
base, Chad Curtis' home run off Simas in the 10th vaulted the
Yankees to their third victory in four games. The late-inning magic
did not totally erase the Yankees' earlier sloppiness on a soggy
afternoon, but they headed home for a series with the first-place
Boston Red Sox beginning Monday with the feeling that something was
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of win that can get a team going,'' David Cone
said. ``We've been waiting for a win like that all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The most bizarre action unfolded after the Yankees had already
scored three runs in the ninth, two on Bernie Williams' single, to
trim their deficit to 7-6 with one out and runners on first and
third. Jeter crept off third, hoping that the Yankees would find a
way to nudge him 90 feet for the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   They did not have to. The third base umpire, Tim Welke, called a
balk on Simas, infuriating the pitcher. Simas rumbled off the mound
and pointed at Jeter, accusing him of screaming ``balk'' before
Welke did.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and Welke said Jeter had not yelled anything. Willie
Randolph, the third-base coach, conceded that he called out for a
balk but was not sure if he had done so before Welke. Welke said he
had called the balk first.
</P>
<P>
   It would not have mattered. Jeter can say whatever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   After touching home plate, Jeter snapped at Simas and both teams
streamed onto the field. There was verbal sparring and players
holding each other, but no punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You made me balk,''' Jeter said. ``I didn't
understand how I could make him balk. I wasn't even looking at the
guy. The ump called balk and I clapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jerry Manuel, the White Sox manager, said Welke had told
him that he called the balk first.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Simas was not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people probably think I'm crazy, but I heard somebody
other than the ump yell,'' Simas said. ``After I broke my hands, I
asked the ump why he called a balk and then he called a balk. That
was a bush play.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how Simas felt, the Yankees were relieved. Cone
had failed to hold a 3-0 lead and Jeff Nelson had been bruised for
three runs in the eighth to give Chicago a 7-3 lead, and it looked
like the Yankees would lose their second straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was the slap in the face we needed,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Comebacks can make horrible days seem pristine. The ninth began
with walks to Curtis and Shane Spencer before Chuck Knoblauch, who
was 5 for his last 60, punched a single to right to fill the bases.
With Jeter batting, Simas unleashed a wild pitch to slice the
deficit to 7-4. Jeter finished a marvelous 13-pitch at-bat by
taking a 3-2 pitch to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   After Darrin Jackson made a diving catch on Paul O'Neill's fly
ball in left, Williams singled in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the wackiness with Simas. And in the following inning,
Curtis, who was the first player onto the field to defend Jeter and
who had not homered since April 27, belted a blast to center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the other team is yelling and pointing, winning the game
is the best thing you can do,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   When Cone breezed into the second inning with a 3-0 edge, the
lead seemed safe because he started the game with the best earned
run average in the major leagues at 1.69 and had given up
consecutive hits twice in 531/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But, by the time an aggravating second inning had ended, the
White Sox had scored four runs on three well-placed singles, one
booming triple, a batter nicked in the folds of his jersey and a
groundout. Chicago had help from Knoblauch, who dived for two
grounders and failed to snare what turned into singles.
</P>
<P>
   Cone fired his glove into the dugout after the second inning and
slammed the ball on the mound after rain delayed the game a second
time in the sixth. Rain had also delayed the start.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Yankees rallied, everything seemed a little
brighter. For two innings and one game, it was magical again in
Yankeeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see us make a run and I just wanted get that
feeling,'' Cone said. ``Just because we were behind, we weren't
dead.'' &QL;

CHECKETTS SAYS JACKSON WAS CONTACTED IN APRIL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After denying he had had any contact with the former
Bulls coach Phil Jackson, Madison Square Garden's president, Dave
Checketts, admitted during Sunday's Game 3 that he had used an
intermediary this past April to gauge Jackson's interest in taking
over as coach of the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts did not attend Game 3, but before tipoff, through his
spokesman, he denied Sunday's report in The New York Times, which
disclosed a secret meeting he had with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, that stance was altered. Through the Garden
spokesman Barry Watkins, Checketts said he had no face-to-face
meeting with Jackson but did contact him through an intermediary
before the team's president, Ernie Grunfeld, was re-assigned on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Jackson said he was interested in a position
with the Knicks if Grunfeld and Coach Jeff Van Gundy were
dismissed. Watkins also said Checketts informed him that the former
Charlotte coach Dave Cowens and the former Knick Doc Rivers had
made inquiries with Checketts. It was unclear whether Cowens or
Rivers were seeking interviews for a potential head-coaching
position or the general manager's job that was once Grunfeld's.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Knicks' turbulent season, Checketts maintained he
had not addressed Van Gundy's job with any potential candidates and
said he would wait until the season ended to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Van Gundy's ability to get the Knicks into the playoffs,
defeat the No. 1-seeded Miami Heat in the first round and take a
three-games-to-none lead against the Hawks in their second-round
series, Checketts has issued no vote of confidence. Until he does,
Van Gundy's job status remains an issue that he can't escape. In an
all too familiar position, Van Gundy was asked about his job
status. He would not comment on Checketts' contact with Jackson,
other than to say, ``Just how it is; I'm just worried about
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, who was under extreme scrutiny, did respond when
asked if his uncertain job status crossed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's future with the Knicks may be tied to more than
simply his team's finish this season. Van Gundy has had a difficult
time establishing relationships with Latrell Sprewell and Marcus
Camby. Sprewell has been unhappy with his sixth-man role, while
Camby has been seeking steadier minutes and a more defined role.
Exactly how those relationships factor into Checketts' thinking is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, whose patience has been tested by the power structure
at the Garden, will also have to decide if he wants to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even go there,'' Van Gundy said. `'Let's just talk about
Atlanta.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FOCUSING ON THE GAME, NOT A COACH'S ANXIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The modest office Jeff Van Gundy shares with the
Rangers' coach, John Muckler, has only a television, a telephone
and a desk. There is no nameplate on the door. The room has none of
the warmth of the players' domain across the hall. Its walls are
bare, except for a color photo of Mark Messier scoring in the 1994
hockey finals against the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy's will to win _ man!'' Van Gundy said of Messier,
dodging the obvious question of why he had added no personal
touches, in the manner of a man renting a hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty tough guy,'' Van Gundy said of Messier, firm with his
stonewall. The game, as defined by the ever-stressed Knicks' coach,
is not about ornaments, and certainly not a comfort zone. Forget
Pat Riley. Van Gundy's real mentor was his father, Bill, a grizzled
lifer low on the ladder, at places like Genesee Community College
and Brockport State. ``He's a coach,'' Van Gundy said, embellishing
the statement as if he were sitting at the bar. ``He drove the van,
mopped the floors. He never had a cushy job like I have, where the
biggest worry is the seven steps you take from the bus to the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that easy, professional coaching, and especially when
the mailing address is Madison Square Garden. That's why Bill Van
Gundy was standing in the runway Sunday, waiting to give his son a
hug, for more than a 90-78 Game 3 victory over Atlanta, and a 3-0
Eastern Conference semifinal series lead over the hopelessly
outmanned Hawks. Even tough little guys like Jeff Van Gundy need
emotional support when tales of taller coaches like Phil Jackson
are being told, even as Van Gundy's team marches on relentlessly
toward Indianapolis and the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   So Van Gundy sat in his spartan space Sunday, offering the bare
minimum on the reports that Dave Checketts, the Garden president,
had weeks ago contacted or met with Jackson about becoming coach of
the Knicks. That is not what Checketts told him, Van Gundy said,
dangling the draw-your-own-conclusion of the corporate white lie,
before insisting that it wouldn't be a distraction toward the
series-ending issue of Monday night's fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   His father had taught him to neglect his troubles; think about
the next game. ``Management owns the team,'' said Bill Van Gundy,
63, a survivor of brain tumors, heart attacks and one job
dismissal. ``It has a right to do what it wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Checketts apparently wanted to do was find out what Jackson
was thinking, and why wouldn't he? At the time, Checketts was
staring into the bottom-line abyss of not making the playoffs or
likely elimination in the first round. He has those television
moguls to please, his own job to save. And this is the business of
professional sports, sensing the collapse of your house and lining
up another architect to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Van Gundy admitted that the Knicks _ from the time
Checketts served Ernie Grunfeld his ``reassignment'' papers along
with his last meal _ had reversed field and qualified for the
post-season ``in the nick of time.'' Then Miami happened. Then
Lenny Wilkens showed up in the second round with his playoff junior
varsity. And here are the Knicks, reinventing themselves in
mid-playoff march, perhaps in the process of making an irrelevancy
of whatever happened three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Chris Dudley couldn't get off the bench.
Sunday, he pretty much gave the struggling Patrick Ewing the
afternoon off and with one symbolic play brought the conference
semifinal to a screeching and unofficial halt. With about nine
minutes left in the fourth quarter, Dudley ball-faked Dikembe
Mutombo, two-time defensive player of the year, and laid the ball
in, off glass, albeit with the grace of a coin being jammed through
a slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a 15-point lead against a team incapable of
catching up. The other point was that Dudley, the Knicks' $28
million all-thumbs backup center, was in the process of outscoring
Mutombo, Atlanta's $55 million franchise foundation, 14-7. The
Knicks' bench again buried Atlanta's, this time by 46-22. There was
a second-quarter span when Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby
accounted for 16 of 18 points. The 18 rebounds and 5 blocked shots
by Dudley and Camby had Wilkens raving about them and mumbling to
himself. Perhaps this all looks very different against the Pacers,
but right now, the Knicks have a bench to match up with Larry
Bird's.
</P>
<P>
   Remember early this season when Van Gundy stubbornly resisted
using his long and athletic reserves who were practically begging
to play? Grunfeld, the doomed general manager, didn't help when he
handed his coach new players for a 50-game sprint and never offered
any assurances to Van Gundy that he wouldn't be a scapegoat if the
chemistry didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy embarked on his own survival course, pushing an
out-of-shape Ewing for too many minutes, riding his trusted horse,
until Big Fella broke down. The irony was that Grunfeld was the
subsequent victim of the resulting chaos of conversion, from the
Knicks as Ewing's team to the one now serving as a tribute to
Grunfeld's vision. The moral of the story is that there is more to
managing a team than picking its players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your boss tells you you're going to be there, is your job
going to be easier?'' Bill Van Gundy said to the question of what
should happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's your answer,'' the coach's father said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he slipped into the office where his son was waiting,
mostly for Dave Checketts to come tell him what he deserves to
hear. The room will be half his next year.

 A SERGEANT'S TESTIMONY TURNS A TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in the trial of the Abner Louima case, Marvyn Kornberg _
the pugnacious, streetwise defense lawyer _ exuded the brash
confidence of someone who had everything under control. He assured
reporters that his client, Officer Justin Volpe, would be cleared
of charges of torturing Louima. Louima's internal injuries,
Kornberg said, could have been the result of consensual sex with
another man, and DNA tests would show that this was possible. Just
wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Volpe, the officer's father, summed up the defense
attitude when he said with a wink: ``You're at the beginning of the
movie. Let the movie play.''
</P>
<P>
   But the movie had a stunning plot shift last week, after a
witness gave devastating surprise testimony against Volpe. People
who know Kornberg, a veteran lawyer with a reputation for thorough
preparation, were left wondering how he could have been caught by
surprise on something so damaging, or whether the testimony had
really been a surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Sgt. Kenneth Wernick, said in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn that several hours after prosecutors say Volpe tortured
Louima with a stick in a restroom at a Brooklyn police station,
Volpe boasted that he had thrust a stick ``five or six inches''
into a prisoner's rectum. Wernick said that Volpe then showed the
stick to him and to another officer, Michael Schoer.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg declined to cross-examine Wernick, who held the rank of
officer at time of the alleged brutalization. Kornberg later told
reporters: ``We've changed our position; it's that simple. We've
changed the trial tactic in the case. You'll see why when we finish
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg declined to say when he had first learned that Wernick
would be testifying as he did. But some people close to the case
said Kornberg learned this only last Monday night, when he received
the documents that prosecutors are obliged to turn over to defense
lawyers, documents that contain material like the witnesses'
statements to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   People who have closely followed the case said they did not
expect Wernick's testimony, and lawyers for the three other
officers and a sergeant on trial said they learned of it only a day
or two before.
</P>
<P>
   If Kornberg did indeed learn of Wernick's coming testimony last
Monday, only two days before he testified, then it could mean one
of several things. One is that the sergeant made up the statements
he had attributed to Volpe, and that Schoer also lied when he had
confirmed that Volpe had shown him the stick and had described a
stain on it as human feces. Another possibility is that Volpe lied
to his own lawyer, something defendants have been known to do.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could mean that Volpe, whom another witness described as
having been in an agitated state on the morning that Louima was
reportedly brutalized _ the officer had been punched in the face in
the street melee in which Louima was arrested _ could have simply
forgotten that he had boasted to Wernick of having used the stick
on Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe has rigidly refrained from discussing the case with
reporters, and the usually voluble Kornberg repeated ``no comment''
when asked what his client had told him about Wernick.

BRUINS ARE OKLAHOMA BOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA might not want to admit this, but Sunday's
events at the NCAA softball regional at Westwood were supposed to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Only third baseman Julie Adams said anything to that effect:
``We came into this season to do a job, and part of it is done.''
</P>
<P>
   She referred to the Bruins' 12-5 regional final victory over
second-seeded Missouri that sent top-seeded UCLA (59-6) into the
College World Series for the 19th time (three AIAW, 16 NCAA). The
Bruins will seek their ninth national championship when they open
Thursday in Oklahoma City against DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Adams could speak a bit freely after being named the
tournament's Most Outstanding Player. She homered four times and
drove in 13 runs, best among the six teams competing.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing coaches freely agreed with her. One by one, they
trudged into postgame press conferences and hailed the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri was the last one. In walked Missouri coach Jay Miller,
following the coaches from Alabama, Creighton and Minnesota, and
said basically the same things: UCLA is that good and deserves to
be a favorite to win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, they will win it all,'' Miller declared.
``I'm surprised anyone's given them any trouble. Look at the lineup
they have. They should have no problem. They're just loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   So loaded that:
</P>
<P>
   _Five Bruins made the 12-member All-Regional team.
</P>
<P>
   _The offense outscored the opposition 38-5.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, nine players collected hits, led by Christie
Ambrosi's 3 for 4. Ten different players scored runs and six drove
in runs, led by first baseman Julie Marshall's three. In addition,
all-tournament Stacey Nuveman hit her nation-leading 31st home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be careful I don't slip up,'' said all-tournament
pitcher Missouri pitcher Jennifer Falk (27-13), who gave up 13 hits
and eight earned runs in 62/3 innings. ``They hit the ball, and I
wish them the best of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   _Adams won Most Outstanding Player despite getting all four home
runs and 11 of her 13 RBI in the first two games; she went 0 for 3
Saturday and 2 for 3 with two RBI against the Tigers (41-21).
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they can generate offense, it's tough to beat them,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   _UCLA came within one out of allowing no runs in the tournament
and gave up only one earned run in 28 innings. All-tournament
pitcher Courtney Dale (31-1) won three games. On Sunday, Dale gave
up seven hits with five strikeouts and two hit-batsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with the way this UCLA team played this
week,'' coach Sue Enquist said. ``We had lots of tests this
weekend. You want players to experience pressure, and that's going
to help us in the College World Series. We've had pressure. We've
had adversity, and we've done an excellent job of sticking to our
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The only pressure UCLA encountered Sunday came in the later
innings. The Bruins led 9-0 and were one out away from stopping the
game after six when Dale gave up a three-run home run to Erin
Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towards the end, I got the ball up in the strike zone and it
was making a difference,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So what did UCLA do? It came out in the seventh (the Bruins were
the visitors) and batted around, scoring three more times.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Sunday's outcome wasn't a surprise, because UCLA had
beaten Missouri 9-0 this season in the Fresno State tournament.
Now, the Bruins move on to Oklahoma City, where five Pacific-10
teams await. UCLA won the conference, making them the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Enquist didn't want to hear about the preordained aspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like (it) at all, and my players don't think that
way,'' she said. ``This UCLA team has too much respect for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the opposing coaches was happy to say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they play a bad game and someone plays out of their
heads, they won't have a problem,'' Miller said.

STOPPING VIOLENCE BY SUING THE MEDIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   By KIM COBB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jack Thompson has been spoiling for a fight with the
entertainment industry for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-area lawyer recalls vividly how he stood before the
Time Warner shareholders meeting in 1992 to rail against the
message in rapper Ice Tea's song Cop Killer. He was acting as
torch-bearer for Oliver North's Freedom Alliance, and he was
clearly in unfriendly territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if Time Warner and the rest of the entertainment
industry does not stop dumping its corrosive, harmful entertainment
into the American culture, then eventually the parents of children
harmed by that would successfully turn around and sue for
damages,'' Thompson said. ``The whole hall was laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ain't laughing now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton, Colo., high school massacre, following several
other horrible instances of school violence, is feeding a clamor
for the courts to put a cork in the stream of violent entertainment
in popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of mostly failed litigation seeking to hold
accountable everyone from rap musicians to movie producers, some
see a possible shift in society that could force changes in the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent appellate court decisions already had entertainment
lawyers worrying about the ``chilling effect'' on the First
Amendment rights which have traditionally protected their industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court refused to block civil actions brought by
surviving family members of crime victims in both a Louisiana
lawsuit against the producers of the movie Natural Born Killers and
in a Maryland suit against publishers of a book titled Hit Man: A
Technical Manual for Independent Contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in both cases are relying on an exception to free
speech protection spelled out by the Supreme Court in 1969. The
court ruled that speech is not protected if it ``incites imminent
lawless activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a week before the April 23 Littleton shootings, the parents
of three children murdered in December 1997 by a classmate in
Paducah, Ky., filed suit against two Internet pornography sites,
the producers of several computer games and the makers and
distributors of the film The Basketball Diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Those forms of entertainment, they argued, made violence
pleasurable and attractive to shooter Michael Carneal, and taught
him to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd filed it the day of (the Littleton shootings), we'd be
called ambulance chasers,'' said attorney Thompson. ``Now some
people are calling us prophets.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson wasn't alone in finding parallels between the Colorado
and Kentucky shootings. Like the Paducah shooter, the two boys who
fired on their classmates in Littleton and then killed themselves
were described as children who didn't fit in, and who immersed
themselves in computer games such as Doom and Quake, where killing
multiple opponents is a main objective.
</P>
<P>
   From legislated gun control to lawsuits directed against the
entertainment industry, the rush to assign blame for the school
shootings raises constitutional questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is the First Amendment guarantee of free speech at any cost
threatened if society thinks the cost is too high? And will the
courts respond, as they did in tobacco litigation, if legislative
leaders or industry will not?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugsley, a professor at Los Angeles' Southwestern
University School of Law, said the current climate of fear could
lead to a lawsuit that succeeds in holding a video game or movie
producer liable at some level for a violent incident such as a
school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I do think that's a significant development,'' Pugsley
said. ``If you eventually get a verdict against one of these
defendants and it goes up on appeal, who knows what could happen?
And you could have a further incursion into the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugsley said he thinks the First Amendment values that protect
free expression are more important than the immediate problem of
the school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying in any way to diminish the magnitude of loss
these individuals have suffered,'' he said, but, ``there's a lot of
copycatting going on. With the grace of God, somewhere, somehow
this will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson volunteered himself to the Paducah parents, and said he
hopes to see similar lawsuits. The attorney said he was encouraged
when the Supreme Court allowed the Louisiana Natural Born Killers
case to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Supreme Court really said was ... the entertainment
industry is not the sacred cow of the American enterprise system.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the idea that a video game is First Amendment
speech ``doesn't even pass the giggle test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a murder simulator. It's a dangerous toy,'' he said.
``Games, when they cause harm ... give rise to damages that are
compensable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carneal, who had never handled a handgun before, walks in (to
his Paducah high school) and, from a distance, discharges eight of
nine bullets,'' Thompson said. ``All eight hit their mark. They're
all potential kill shots. It's marksmanship off the scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney is leaning heavily on the research of
soldier-turned-psychologist David Grossman, a professor of military
science at Arkansas State University who argues that video games
that reward children for shooting faster than they can think are no
different that the reflex training the military uses to get
soldiers past their normal aversion to killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts tell us that when you discharge a gun, you empty it
into the initial target until your target drops,'' Thompson said.
``What he did was he discharged his gun, moved to the next target
and (immediately) pulled the trigger. Where did he learn that? In
video games where you have X amount of time and X number of shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The video games taught him to be a killer,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, who refers to himself as a ``culture warrior,''
said the Paducah lawsuit will lean heavily on a psychological
profile of Carneal commissioned by his parents and entered into
evidence in his criminal trial, which spelled out three categories
of entertainment that had profoundly influenced him.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist cited the movie The Basketball Diaries, in
which a student played by Leonardo DiCaprio fantasizes about
carrying out a classroom massacre, sexually violent pornography he
pulled off the Internet and violent video games such as Doom and
Quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be able to prove that the video game industry
... is addictive,'' Thompson said, echoing some of the strategy
which proved successful in recent litigation against the tobacco
industry . ``We believe we can show they do focus groups, physical
testing on these kids to see how high their heart rates go.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in a corporate boardroom and you target other
people's children with a program, and you know there are kids at
risk and you know from your own in-house studies you've trained
kids to be killers, you're responsible for that,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   James Hornstein, an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles who
represents Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation and its
affiliated businesses, said there's a big difference between the
tobacco litigation and lawsuits against the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's massive intervening causes between the viewing of a
movie and the killing of innocent victims,'' Hornstein said.
``Before a person has to go out and kill, they have to have a
short-circuit somewhere in the process, and they still have to have
access to a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that somebody sees a movie and as a result of their
upbringing or mental illness, goes out on a crime spree, doesn't
make the movie responsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tobacco situation, the cause of lung cancer is the
tobacco being inhaled,'' Hornstein said. ``The tobacco
manufacturers' product is doing the killing, doing the harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornstein predicts that the Paducah suit will not get far once
the defendants challenge the notion that there was intent to harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're claiming only negligence, it's not enough to charge
a free speech defendant with liability,'' Hornstein said. ``And
that's very well settled law, and I see nothing to say that law is
likely to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pugsley said that, even as a staunch defender of First
Amendment protections, he's intrigued by the arguments about
physiological responses that can be measured while children watch a
violent movie or play a violent game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the situation where a child voluntarily exposes
himself to a product consumer-tested to arouse the greatest level
of testosterone and desensitizes a person to the effects of what
they're doing, because its only a game? And it's sole content is
battering and maiming virtual human beings? It seems to me there's
the opening wedge of an argument there,'' Pugsley said.

STUNNED HAWKS STARING AT SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Atlanta Hawks sat in the visitors' locker room at
Madison Square Garden Sunday looking like Mike Tyson after his
stunning loss to Buster Douglas. There were no bruises or black
eyes, but the lifeless expressions that accompany shock were there
in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, after all, entered their second-round series against
the Knicks with unwavering faith. They had won 9 of their last 11
regular-season games to storm into the playoffs as the
fourth-seeded team in the Eastern Conference, while the
eighth-seeded Knicks backed in like shy teen-agers. So confident
were these Hawks that their center, Dikembe Mutombo, guaranteed
victory over the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking was that Michael Jordan was gone, that no team in
the East was dominant, that this was their chance to finally seize
the conference title. Instead, reality smacked Atlanta in the face
like one of Mutombo's elbows, exposing it for what it really is _ a
team that cannot shoot straight.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by three games to none and on the verge of being swept
after Sunday's 90-78 loss, the Hawks attributed their predicament
to their lack of ball movement and inability to make shots. They
know they have missed open 3-pointers, midrange jumpers, floaters
in the lane and layups while shooting 32.2 percent for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to win a series shooting in the low 30s,'' Hawks
coach Lenny Wilkens said after his team made just 27 of 87 shots
(31 percent) Sunday. ``They're real disappointed because they feel
they are a better team, but when you don't shoot the ball well.
...''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks started Sunday's game shooting 38 percent to trail by
only 52-46 at the half. Steve Smith, the high-scoring shooting
guard, was wiping away the memory of his 2-for-17 performance in
Game 2 by posting 17 points, and Grant Long scored a surprising 14.
But Smith, plagued by foul trouble, went scoreless in the second
half, missing all six of his shots, and Long scored just three more
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started shooting desperation shots instead of being in the
flow, because I was trying to get it back and trying to put it on
my shoulders,'' said Smith, who is shooting 28 percent in the
series. ``I had to take the scoring burden and rush shots
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It became apparent early in the third quarter, when the Hawks
missed their first nine shots, that they did not have the scoring
punch to challenge. They shot 4 for 20 in the third quarter and 4
for 18 in the fourth in tallying the embarrassing shooting figure
of 21 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Player after player _ from Mutombo, who went 2 for 7, to Mookie
Blaylock, who missed 10 of his 15 attempts _ blamed the Hawks'
imminent elimination on poor shooting and a lack of execution on
offense. They spoke as if they were dumbfounded by their
inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're hurting ourselves more than anything,'' Blaylock
said. ``Our offense wasn't clicking. We'd pass the ball and watch
instead of pass the ball and move. We're in a little funk. It's
like we're going through the motions and the flow isn't there. It's
a frustrating thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, however, is that Atlanta rarely shoots or moves the
ball well. While 32 percent shooting is exceptionally poor, the
Hawks have never been mistaken for marksmen. In fact, they were
27th in the 29-team league in shooting this season, at 40.9
percent. And that was with the now-injured starters Alan Henderson
and LaPhonso Ellis in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding their lack of ball movement, the Hawks again spoke as
if they have thrown the ball around the horn all year. But the
terribly low total of 10 assists they had Sunday was not that far
out of the ordinary. They had just 13 assists in Game 1 when they
scored 92 points, and only seven in Game 2. On the season, the
Hawks' average of 15.64 assists per game was last in the NBA, more
than five assists below the league average.
</P>
<P>
   Add the Knicks' energized defense to the equation and you get a
lopsided series that has the humbled Hawks wondering what clocked
them. Mutombo cannot believe the Hawks are about to make their
exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really surprised,'' Mutombo said. ``That's why this is so
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo sounded determined to avoid being swept, saying that it
had never happened in his seven-year career. Apparently, he forgot
that San Antonio ousted him and his Denver Nuggets teammates in
three games in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the untold stories of the savings and loan debacle will
come to a close today when prison doors open and a graying
56-year-old man walks out, free at last.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Ed Morris. He was sentenced to 46 months in prison
for encouraging the public to invest in his St. Louis-area S&AMP;L that
later went kerplunk. Morris says he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of former S&AMP;L executives _ including Morris _ are convinced
that Congress lost its collective mind a decade ago and unleashed a
reign of terror on the S&AMP;L industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some S&AMP;Ls in the late 1980s and early '90s were infested
with crooks and needed to be weeded out. But while the press was
busy covering the few crooks, many S&AMP;L managers complain, it
overlooked the much bigger story: the annihilation of decent but
struggling S&AMP;Ls.
</P>
<P>
   They say hundreds of legitimate S&AMP;Ls were exterminated, their
owners wiped out and more than a few packed off to prison
undeservedly. Depositors were insured for up to $100,000 each, but
S&AMP;L owners lost their money.
</P>
<P>
   And many in this quiet S&AMP;L underground say their poster child is
Ed Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great admiration for him _ a true hero,'' said Ernest
Fleischer, something of a poster child himself since he has pursued
a multiyear, multipronged legal campaign against the government.
Fleischer wants the government to repay him for Franklin Savings
Association, once Kansas' biggest financial institution, which he
contends was wrongly seized in 1990 and then obliterated by
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, a bookish and bespectacled Wharton School MBA, doesn't
look like an underground leader. But when he was under legal attack
in the early 1990s, he organized ``May Day'' conferences in which
kindred spirits gathered to share horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   And Morris had a sharp pen. He turned out a lively newsletter
called /{Regulatory Watchdog/} that railed against Congress for
tax-code tinkering that undermined real estate and whacked
real-estate lenders such as S&AMP;Ls. The newsletter also skewered
regulators for ``abuse'' when they enforced the new S&AMP;L bailout
rules.
</P>
<P>
   No one accused Morris of stealing money from his S&AMP;L. In fact,
he lost money when it failed, and he had to sell his house to pay
mounting legal bills. Morris' ex-wife, Ann Morris, said, ``Ed is
one of the most honest and good people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not all are sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not enough time!'' said Mabel Dickson upon learning
that Morris is to be released from prison. The Cahokia, Ill.,
retiree said her life savings of $229,000 was vaporized in Morris'
S&AMP;L, and Dickson said she had paced the floor at night for more
than 46 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sleep when everything's gone,'' she said. (Dickson
and other investors sued and later recouped more than half their
investment when the government and some of the S&AMP;L's executives
turned over some money.)
</P>
<P>
   And the prosecutor in the main case against Morris, Bruce
Reppert, pointed out that if Morris thought he was innocent, he
could have gotten his side of the story across to the grand jury.
Reppert said he encouraged Morris to testify, have others testify
for him or submit something in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed declined to do any of the three,'' Reppert said. ``So we
went ahead and indicted him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is evidence to support Morris' argument that the
so-called S&AMP;L bailout wrongly sent some S&AMP;L managers to prison.
Some academics now say that fraud accounted for little _ perhaps 3
percent to 7 percent _ of the $150 billion or so that taxpayers
spent to repay depositors and on other expenses of the S&AMP;L crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A national commission report to the president and Congress said
fraud was significant but accounted for 10 percent to 15 percent of
the $150 billion in losses. Still, it concluded, that the problem
was mainly caused by a series of government missteps and ``fraud
was not the cause of the S&AMP;L debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   If fraud was a small part of the S&AMP;L crisis, why were thousands
of S&AMP;L managers prosecuted? Morris thinks many were accused
unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as simple as this: The people who caused the crisis _ the
U.S. Congress _ decided to take the glare off themselves by making
crooks out of all of us,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fulwider, spokesman for the Office of Thrift Supervision,
the regulator for thrifts, who was in a similar capacity during the
S&AMP;L bailout, denied that thrift managers were jailed casually and
said that fraud and abuse needed to be cleaned up from the S&AMP;L
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   What Morris knew about savings and loans associations in the
early 1980s wouldn't have filled a passbook.
</P>
<P>
   He had gotten familiar with a suburban St. Louis savings bank
called Germania Bank when Morris, an investment banker in St.
Louis, helped Germania sell stock to the public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he was brought aboard Germania as a kind of temporary
chief executive officer. With his investment banking expertise,
Morris could help Germania raise fresh money.
</P>
<P>
   Germania quickly started selling new securities. But Morris saw
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped back and said, `I'm real worried about loan-loss
reserves here,' &UR; '' he said.

<P>
   ... After FIRREA, it had none.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Germania was insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   A so-called friend-of-the-court brief filed by the American
Association of Bank Directors several years later said that FIRREA
``took an honestly and competently managed thrift with adequate
capital and turned it into a prime candidate for the gallows in a
single day: Dec. 7, 1989, when the post-FIRREA S&AMP;L capital rules
took effect.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday evening in June 1990, Morris, sitting with friends
on the patio of his St. Louis home, took a call from Germania.
Regulators had seized the thrift.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unpleasant surprise but not a shock. That came the
following morning when he read the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock was to find out that they had made a criminal
referral,'' Morris said from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Germania's sad saga was tossed to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The 800 or so people who bought the schnotes were stuck with a
dead investment, and some sued. In November 1992, Germania's top
executives were indicted in federal courts in southern Illinois and
in eastern Missouri. Both indictments were similar, essentially
alleging that the executives had misled the schnote buyers by
hiding the September Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Morris argued that he and the other executives had done nothing
wrong. Investors lost their money, he said, because FIRREA killed
Germania.
</P>
<P>
   But his internal fear meter quickly rose. New, Germania's chief
financial officer who had prepared the September Analysis in 1987
that suggested Germania double its loan-loss reserves, pleaded
guilty. Eventually, he became the government's star witness,
testifying that the other Germania executives had ignored his
warnings. New got probation and no prison sentence. He declined to
be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   And Morris' fear leaped again when the judge signed an order
that prevented Morris and the other defendants from using FIRREA as
a defense. The rationale was that the offense occurred when the
schnotes were sold in 1987 and '88. FIRREA, passed in 1989, came
after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and the other defendants were doomed.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Reppert, the prosecutor, argued that would-be
investors in Germania had a right to know about New's September
Analysis. It would have been a red flag about the condition of the
thrift. But Morris and the other executives buried the September
Analysis, the prosecutor said, essentially defrauding the investors
into sinking their money in an ill-fated savings bank.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and the others argued that the September Analysis was
poorly done and so hastily prepared that it was worthy of the trash
bin. Thanks to Morris' insistence on packing away loan-loss
reserves, executives thought they had an ample rainy-day account.
The arguments didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what the jury heard: They had a string of little old
ladies, very sympathetic little old ladies, come to the stand and
talk about how they lost their life savings,'' Morris said. ``I
mean, clearly it was tragic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hear about this scheme to hide the shape of the bank to
induce the little old ladies to invest their money. They don't hear
at all anything about how the bank was healthy in 1988 and 1989 and
that FIRREA ravaged the bank, that the bank was closed because of
new capital standards and that the investors lost their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right up to the last day, we paid monthly interest payments to
all the investors.It wasn't our fault they didn't get their money.
It was because the government came in and changed all the rules and
closed us down. But we couldn't talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the jury room, two jurors held out for one day. The second
day, a sole juror, Michelle Lewis, held out until the end of the
day. She finally agreed to convict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until my dying day, I wish I had never given in,'' Lewis said.
``A great injustice was done to those men.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis thinks that if the jury had known about FIRREA and its
effect on Germania, the verdict could have gone the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The jury convicted Morris and Gardner of two counts of mail
fraud and one count of wire fraud related to marketing efforts to
sell the schnotes. Morris and Gardner were sentenced to 46 months
each.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner did not respond to requests to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Morris appealed the conviction and lost. He was sent to prison
in Springfield, Mo., and was later transferred to Greenville, Ill.,
where he is today.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case in Missouri, Joe Mason, Germania's chairman
and main shareholder, was made a defendant. Having seen what
happened in the earlier case, Mason decided to plead guilty in
return for a lighter sentence of one year and one day. He got out
of prison last May. He not only lost Germania, but he also lost his
homebuilding company in Missouri. Some insiders estimate that Mason
personally lost more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial really did miss the point,'' said Victor Simon, who
once owned a trade newspaper that covered the S&AMP;L industry. ``The
thing that caused Ed to go to jail was that they changed all the
accounting standards instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a year-and-a-half ago, Morris admitted he was
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in jail because of loan-loss reserves, something I still
lose sleep about,'' Morris said back then. ``It kills me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders believe Germania was doomed to fail anyway. It was
loaded down with souring real estate loans. Others dispute that,
saying Germania would have survived and the ample loan-loss
reserves would have taken care of the problem. In either case, it
was academic because FIRREA wiped out Germania's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he prepares to check in to a halfway house, where he
will report until September, Morris said he is no longer bitter.
</P>
<P>
   He's grateful for the support of his family. He's written a
novel. He said he does not regret failing to seek a plea bargain
that would have lessened his sentence because: ``There's nothing
I'm guilty of.
</P>
<P>
   ``My integrity's intact. I feel like I can walk out of here with
my head high and get back to my life. I want to get this lost
decade behind me.''

OLD FEELINGS DIE HARD FOR DEMPSEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers third-base coach Rick Dempsey
wasn't about to let St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa
disrespect the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers' Devon White cleared St. Louis' Shawon Dunston
from the rest of the pack after Dunston charged pitcher Jamie
Arnold in the ninth inning, Dempsey made sure to get a few barbs in
on La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   Before the teams headed back to their dugouts, Dempsey and La
Russa exchanged heated words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same kind of (stuff) he did before,'' Dempsey said.
``It's why we won the '88 World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey was referring the Dodgers' stunning defeat of the
supposedly mighty Oakland A's, who were managed by La Russa. The
Dodgers upset Oakland in five games to win the World Series.
Dempsey was a catcher on that squad. La Russa has the reputation of
being arrogant and abrasive, repeatedly infuriating other teams
with his managing style.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's more history between La Russa and Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey was a catcher on that squad, as he was with the
Baltimore Orioles in 1983 when that team beat La Russa's Chicago
White Sox team in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw at one of our guys and missed,'' Dempsey said. ``It's
the same thing, and he's complaining about our manager?''
</P>
<P>
   Dunston was upset when he was hit with an Arnold fastball with
two outs in the ninth and the Cardinals ahead 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Back at sixth: After batting second in the lineup for five games
and leading off in another, Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre
returned to a more familiar spot in the lineup. Beltre batted sixth
after struggling near the top.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre was 5 for 27 (.185) as his average fell from .336 to
.301. After drawing 19 walks in his first 34 games, he walked once
in the week he spent near or at the top of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to do too much because I would like to stay
there,'' Beltre said. ``I was taking a couple pitches so I could
walk and get on base for the next guy. That's what I did to try and
get on base for (Gary) Sheffield.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed back in the lineup Sunday, Beltre went 2 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen blues: After starting the season in surprising fashion,
the Dodgers' bullpen has been unreliable. It gave up four more runs
in the latest loss and has allowed at least one run in 12 of the
past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine games, in which the Dodgers are 3-6, the
bullpen has a 6.99 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the makeup of my bullpen right now,'' said Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson. ``With (Antonio) Osuna out, there's not a
lot of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance record: The sellout crowd of 54,514 was the largest
crowd at Dodger Stadium since 54,859 saw the Expos and Dodgers play
July 4, 1994, and it helped set a three-game attendance mark at
Chavez Ravine. The three-game series with the Cardinals drew
162,376. The old mark of 162,122 was established Sept. 5-7, 1966,
against the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Eric Young sat out his second straight game with a
sore ankle and Johnson held Devon White (hip) and Todd
Hollandsworth (back) out of the starting lineup after each were
banged up in Saturday's win. White pinch hit in the sixth and
remained in the game.... Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek
extended his hitting streak to nine games with a first-inning
single.... The Dodgers are 0-6 on Sundays.

NFL ISN'T LETTING OVITZ OUT OF SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They may be billing tonight's NFL meeting in
Atlanta as an update on the expansion effort in Los Angeles, but it
is appearing increasingly like another step in a setup.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL doesn't want to award ownership of the Los Angeles
franchise to Michael Ovitz, it is at least going to great pains to
keep him in their labyrinth expansion game.
</P>
<P>
   One month before the NFL selected the Coliseum as the Los
Angeles area site, commissioner Paul Tagliabue and expansion
committee members toured Ovitz's Carson site and proclaimed him a
``visionary'' and his plans ``compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Then despite selecting the Coliseum site promoted by the rival
Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr. group for over two years, NFL owners opened
up the stadium design plans and said Ovitz could still emerge as
the downtown team owner.
</P>
<P>
   Now the expansion committee is scheduled to hear an update on
stadium and financing plans from both groups tonight in Atlanta,
and many expect them to line up behind designs Ovitz has scrambled
to put together in less than 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   Whether because they are simply dazzled by his ideas and
Hollywood connections or just want to keep the process competitive
to assure a maximum expansion fee, the NFL is plainly not willing
to let Ovitz slip away.
</P>
<P>
   All these twists and turns, all these minor delays, look like an
effort to allow Ovitz to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on that,'' Broad said. ``That's up to the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain what the NFL will do about the Los Angeles
situation during its three-day meetings. Owners have other serious
issues to resolve _ the sale of the Redskins, the stadium issue in
New England _ but need to move forward on the Los Angeles issue if
its Sept. 15 deadline is realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Owners may select a stadium design plan. They could establish an
expansion fee. They could even select the would-be owner. They
could do nothing. This is the NFL, where anything and nothing is
always possible.
</P>
<P>
   Can you really select Ovitz's stadium design plans, and not pick
Ovitz as the owner?
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot predict what they're going to do,'' Broad said.
``They're going to do it on their timetable, with whatever they're
comfortable with. That's their history, and we respect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can say is, if you really want to meet the Sept. 15
date, there is something really ready to go and all the agreements
pretty well signed, you ought to do something now, rather than six
weeks or four weeks or two weeks ahead of that deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand, Roski has been working with the various _ and often
muddled agencies _ involved in the Coliseum area for more than two
years; Ovitz hasn't, and wants to build seven garages for parking.
</P>
<P>
   Are his plans OK with the Coliseum Commission, the city, the
state, the conservancy, USC, the museums? Does the NFL care?
</P>
<P>
   When Tagliabue was here April 13 to name the Coliseum as the
chosen site, he said the league was looking for a ``public-private
partnership.'' The Broad-Roski group clearly has that at the
Coliseum, not Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL can select Ovitz anyway and tell everyone to work it
out. Los Angeles area politicians have a bad history with the NFL
anyway. And if they place stumbling blocks in front of the Ovitz
plan, the NFL can throw its hands up and moan how nothing has
changed in L.A. Carson is still down the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Broad and Roski have been up front with their campaign. They
hired a respected local public relations firm. They put Broad, a
billionaire, on conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Ovitz works in the shadows. He rarely makes
comments when not in public. There is still much unknown about his
plan. If his parking garages are going to cost $225 million, does
he really expect public funding? Does his group have the estimated
$1 billion it will take to buy the franchise and renovate the
Coliseum?
</P>
<P>
   This much is known: Neither plan shows a new Dodger Stadium, and
both would like former Denver Broncos and Granada Hills High
quarterback John Elway to become a major player in their group.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're Elway, why throw in with either until one is
officially selected?
</P>
<P>
   One will be shortly. Probably not today, but soon. And if the
NFL wants Ovitz, Roski-Broad could be reduced as this pleasant
footnote for having revived interest in the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   This is the NFL, one of the most exclusive boys clubs in the
world, and they are used to getting their way.

DODGERS BEATEN UP BY CARDINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Jamie Arnold put
his head down in disappointment after plunking St. Louis' Shawon
Dunston with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   When he looked up Dunston was closing in.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston threw a right hook and slammed Arnold to the ground as
players from both sides streamed onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston's tack was less subtle than what's been happening with
the Dodgers, but the parallel exists. Opponents have been
body-slamming the Dodgers lately.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the emotion of a bench-clearing brawl was another
Dodgers loss, the sixth in nine games. St. Louis beat up the
Dodgers 8-3 Sunday at Dodger Stadium. It's the third time in a
month the Cardinals took two of three games from the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make heads or tails out of the Dodgers (22-21) seems
impossible these days, much like figuring out why Dunston found it
necessary to charge the mound after being hit in the lower back
with a 1-0 fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overreacted. That's Dunston,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``(Arnold) is a kid with (18) innings in the big
leagues coming out of Double-A. He's my fifth pitcher of the game.
Anybody that has any baseball sense would know (it wasn't on
purpose). I lost a little bit of respect for (Cardinals manager
Tony) La Russa by accusing him.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa fired back by saying, ``Well, losing respect can go
both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunston was the third Cardinals player to be hit with a pitch in
the game and seventh this season by the Dodgers. Starter Carlos
Perez (52/3 innings, 4 runs) hit Fernando Tatis in the fourth
inning and Arnold hit Joe McEwing to lead off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing was erased on a double play before Dunston, who was 3
for 5 with an RBI, was hit by the pitch. With both benches and
bullpens emptying onto the field, Dunston was pulled out of the
pack by Dodgers center fielder Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he felt he was thrown at, he did what he felt he had to
do,'' said White, who added he and Dunston are good friends. ``I
can't say we threw at him or not. I'm not in Jamie's head, and I'm
not in Shawon's head. I just tried to stop it before it went any
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Dunston said he didn't know why Arnold would throw at
him. Dunston was ejected but Arnold finished pitching the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did he hit me? I don't know,'' Dunston said. ``I have to
take care of Shawon Dunston and not worry about anybody else. I
have to take of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said he could feel tension between the teams. They played
nine times in less than a month, and the Cardinals won six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he's in the wrong,'' Arnold, 25, said. ``I had no
intention of hitting him. The only reason I knew he was coming was
I heard the crowd reaction. I'm not going to hold anything against
him. I didn't hit him on purpose. I didn't try to hit him or
McEwing. I was trying to pitch on the corners.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams aren't scheduled to meet again this season, which is
good for the Dodgers. The Cardinals hit 18 homers this season
against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' eight runs in the series finale was tied for only
their third highest output against Los Angeles this season. The
Cardinals scored 12 runs _ 11 in one inning _ on April 23, when
Fernando Tatis hit an unprecedented two grand slams in one inning
and opened this three-game series with 10 runs. They scored 60 runs
in nine games and averaged 7.3 runs in six games at Dodger Stadium
and battered Dodgers pitching for 25 runs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The big blow Sunday came when lefty Onan Masaoka allowed a
pinch-hit, three-run homer to former Dodger Thomas Howard in the
seventh inning to give the Cardinals a 7-3 lead. Johnson decided to
go to Masaoka to make the switch-hitting Howard bat righty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked our butts two out of three,'' Johnson said. ``I
had Thomas Howard (in Cincinnati). He's not a very good
right-handed hitter. In fact, he quit hitting right-handed for a
while.''

RUELASES PART WITH GOOSSEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former world champions Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas
will continue their careers without long-time trainer, Joe Goossen,
in their corners, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Ruelas, the former WBC super featherweight champion,
said he is looking for another trainer because he senses Goossen
doesn't believe in him 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ruelas, the former IBF lightweight champion, already is
working with trainer Manuel Robles at a Downtown gym. Robles also
trains light heavyweight champion Reggie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ruelas said only that he made the move because ``Joe and
I don't see eye-to-eye'' in regard to training.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he believes in me necessarily,'' said Gabriel
Ruelas, who has worked out a few times with his brother in Robles'
gym. ``When I lost my last fight (a knockout loss to John Brown in
October), Joe told me he didn't want me to fight any more. I
understand that. I know he cares about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give myself one more chance, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen had worked with the brothers in his Van Nuys gym since
they were children living in Arleta, teaching them much of what
they know.
</P>
<P>
   He guided them to their two championships and a degree of
international fame.
</P>
<P>
   To fight without him, both said, will be strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably be weird,'' Gabriel Ruelas said, ``just like
it's weird to be going to different gyms to work out. I guess I'll
really experience what it's like once I fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that our relationship goes beyond
fighter and trainer, though. Joe and I are close and I want it to
stay that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rafael Ruelas, who was stopped by Kostya Tszyu in his last
fight this past summer: ``Yeah, it'll be a little strange not
having him in the corner. But once the fight starts I'm focused on
fighting. That's how I've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers want to fight sometime this summer and expect to be
promoted by Dan Goossen, Joe's brother and their long-time manager.

COLONIAL WINS FALLS TO BROWNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Olin Browne lacks the type of golfing resume
that usually accompanies inclusion on the Wall of Champions at the
MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, who underwent major elbow surgery in October, never
swung a club in earnest until his freshman year in college. He did
not record his first sub-par round until after his 22nd birthday. A
10-time participant in the PGA Tour's annual qualifying school,
Browne arrived at Colonial this week with more top-10 finishes on
the Nike Tour (28) than the PGA Tour (nine) in a 15-year career.
</P>
<P>
   So it may be appropriate that yesterday's surprise winner found
himself in an unusual location when he fired his final shot before
slipping into a plaid jacket. Browne, 40, learned of his triumph on
the putting green beside the ninth fairway while preparing for a
playoff that never came.
</P>
<P>
   After salvaging a par from a greenside bunker on the 18th hole
to complete a final-round 66 and finish at 8 under par, Browne
warmed up with his back to the proceedings for another 30 minutes
because he figured there was ``no way'' he could win without
enduring a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, after countless contenders cratered down the
stretch, Browne found himself reflecting on a weekend in Fort Worth
that included both a 40th birthday and a second career tour
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be at the dock for your ship to come in. But
this one came screaming in and picked me up,'' said Browne, who
defeated five players by one stroke and four others by two. ``My
old man would say, `I backed \Rmyself\S into a tub of butter.' It
doesn't get any better than that. This is awesome. I feel really
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   He should. Browne, who celebrated his milestone birthday on
Saturday, became a poster boy for the ``Life Begins at 40''
campaign during yesterday's final round. He collected eagles on
both of Colonial's par-5 holes, draining a 20-foot putt at No. 1
and a 40-footer at No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   But he never grabbed a share of the lead until bagging his final
birdie, a 2-footer at No. 15, at roughly the same time Greg Kraft
steered his tee shot into the left rough at No. 12. At the time,
Kraft stood at 10 under and was three strokes ahead of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Kraft hacked his way to a double bogey. Browne's
near-simultaneous birdie allowed him to erase a three-shot deficit
and join Kraft, Billy Mayfair and Fred Funk in a four-player knot
at 8 under heading down the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Colonial's final four contenders dueled down the
stretch with a combined 11 PGA Tour titles to their credit. That's
two fewer than Phil Mickelson, the gallery favorite who opened with
an eagle but backtracked with bogeys at Nos. 7, 11 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   Other marquee names joined Mickelson in slipping off the
Colonial leader board long before the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, the PGA champ, disappeared with a watery double
bogey at No. 9. Lee Janzen, the U.S. Open champ, collected
back-to-back bogeys at Nos. 7 and 8 to seal his also-ran status.
Davis Love III, the No. 2 player in the world golf rankings, dug
himself an insurmountable deficit with a pair of front-nine bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   That left the title up for grabs between Browne, Funk, Kraft and
Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   Funk (7 under) blinked first, dropping out with a bogey from a
greenside bunker at No. 16. Mayfair (6 under) followed suit at No.
16, then compounded matters with another bogey after missing the
18th green. Kraft (7 under) coughed up his share of the lead at No.
17, when he flew the green from 141 yards with a pitching wedge and
failed to sink a 4-foot par putt.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft failed by inches on a bunker blast for birdie at No.
18, the title belonged to Browne, who jumped 136 spots on the money
list _ from No. 171 to No. 35 _ by collecting the $504,000 winner's
check.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a tour journeyman playing in only his second Colonial
was summoned from the putting green to make an acceptance speech.
As he looked at his brightly colored sports shirt, complete with
Tabasco sauce logos, and contrasted it with the plaid jacket he was
about to receive, Browne whispered to a tournament official: ``This
is going to be brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Browne explained, he hadn't dressed in something that
matched a red plaid blazer because he hadn't expected to win. A
half-hour later, he said he was ``still a little numb'' at the
concept of having his name on the same wall that features past
champions Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unreal, the way things transpired,'' Browne said.
``The very best players to have ever played have won on this turf.
To add my name to that list is overwhelming. I can't describe the
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard to believe you'd want one of these jackets. I
haven't looked at myself in the mirror, but I think anyone who wins
this tournament looks great in plaid. I hope they give me five more
before I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Browne has to be summoned from the practice green to
make his acceptance speech on each occasion.

<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The mood in the city.
It is weariness that hangs heavily in the air here, not defeatism.
The citizens of Belgrade, interviewed by the dozen this last week,
feel they are right to be fighting for Kosovo. Some express shame
at what they've heard about the purging of ethnic Albanians; most
express anger at Western support for the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army. They're proud of their war, of their brave if
inevitably futile defense against all the might of NATO. They smell
a political settlement that will bring foreign troops into Kosovo,
and they don't know why it's taking so long to write down the
obvious. By Stephen Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DOCTOR (Jazince, Macedonia) _ There are moments when the
pure exhilaration of being here leads Dr. Jennifer Walser to wish
she did not have to return to New York. But there are also moments
when her efforts to alleviate are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the
tragedy unfolding before her. By David Rohde.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Fier, Albania) _ In a place called Fier,
pronounced fear, there is a camp called Hope, and the Americans who

the refugees' fear of coming this far south seems to be winning out
over hope. By Anthony DePalma.

<P>
   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE (Newnan, Ga.) _ The members of the Coweta County
Board of Education are not naive enough to think that they
vanquished school violence two weeks ago when they voted to
prohibit students from carrying bookbags unless the bags are
transparent or made of mesh. But at least it is something, they
say. And their attitude is not unique: In the month since the
shootings at Columbine High School, school boards, county
commissions and state legislatures all across the country have
proposed and enacted a broad series of measures aimed at attacking
the youth violence problem at the margins. By Kevin Sack.

   COX-PROFILE _ He is something of a closet Renaissance man in the
House, one who speaks Russian, savors Ayn Rand and seeks out the
latest translation of Omar Khayyam. For a hobby, he reads book
after book on mathematicians. And so Rep. Christopher Cox may seem
the perfect prospect for presiding over the House's ultra-secret
