<HEADLINE> Lebanon's 1996 Budget Aims to Reduce Public Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of State for
Financial Affairs Fuad Sinyoura said here today the country's 1996
draft budget was the "first and important" step to reduce the
public debt.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a general session of the parliament, which
opened this morning for less than one hour, but was suspended by
House Speaker Nabih Berri on the grounds that Sinyoura failed to
distribute a written comment on the draft budget among the
deputies in advance.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will resume its general session at 10:00 a.m.
(8:00 GMT) Wednesday morning to discuss the draft budget, Berri
announced.
</P>
<P>
The government puts the 1996 budget at 6,450 billion Lebanese
pounds (about 4 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 14.56
percent over the 1995 budget. It also promises in the new budget
to reduce the deficit to 37 percent from 47 percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that this is the first time in many
years that the country's budget anticipates a decrease in the
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura stressed at the session that the government's economic
and financial policies are aimed at "a transition from an economy
of war to an economy of national peace and a gradual and
continuous improvement of the Lebanese people's life in level and
in quality" by creating suitable atmosphere for investments.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 draft budget, he said, "constitutes an important and
first step in the process of putting an end to the increase of
the public debt."

<HEADLINE> Strike In Swaziland Turns Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide strike
called by Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) entered its
second day today with reports of violent clashes between
demonstrators and police and the army.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said one policeman died in Manzini's
Nazarine Hospital and a number of people including two policemen
were wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Police used teargas and batons to disperse the protesters. A
number of people were wounded during the clash between security
force members and protesters at Mbabane Taxi Rank early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Although small clashes between police and groups of youths
were also reported in other areas of the capital, the city
remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
However, roadblocks are in force around Mbabane and Manzini.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU and other pro-democracy groups called the indefinite
general strike to demand an end to the absolute monarchy
established with the banning of political parties in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Swazi police arrested three SFTU leaders in Mbabane last night
after the Federation refused to negotiate with the government.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the banned People's United Democratic
Movement, co-organizer of the strike, said their leaders went
into hiding after the arrests of the SFTU leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, power and water supplies remain cut to Mbabane and
Manzini, as the strike has crippled Swaziland for the second day.

<HEADLINE> Rebels In S.Leone Declare Unilateral Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) fighting the Sierra Leonean government today declared
a unilateral week-long ceasefire, said a radio report reaching
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
This would allow the RUF to assess how serious the new Sierra
Leonean military leadership was about peace, the report quoted
RUF spokesman Fayia Musa as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast to the nation after being sworn in as the new
Sierra Leonean head of state on January 17, Brigadier Julius
Maada Bio made an offer of dialogue to the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Bio, who ousted his predecessor Captain Valentine
Strasser in a bloodless coup on January 16, appealed to the RUF
leader to "come out and hold dialogue with us and formally
present his case for our people and the international community
to hear".
</P>
<P>
The RUF, headed by Foday Sankoh, launched its revolt in 1991.
The nearly five years of civil war has wrecked Sierra Leone's
mining-based economy and driven more than one-third of the
country's four million people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
The RUF yesterday said it was prepared to hold talks with the
government without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Musa said the RUF wanted the elections, which are scheduled
for February 26, to be put off "so that we can have time to
restore peace in the country", a call which election officials
said they were studying.
</P>
<P>
The elections had been pledged by former Head of State
Valentine Strasser as a way to end the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Allegation on "Training Terrorists" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran today rejected an
allegation made by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmanov on Iran
training terrorists and assassinating a senior Tajik clergyman.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
regretted the recent remarks attributed to the Tajik president
and his recent stand.
</P>
<P>
Certain media reported that the Tajik president had referred to
the Islamic Republic of Iran as a country involved in training
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Describing the assassination of the Tajik Mufti Fathullo
Sharifov as a blind action, the spokesman noted that since the
assassination was detrimental to the national reconciliation,
peace and stability in Tajikistan, "it will not be acceptable to
us and has also been condemned by the opposition."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that President Rakhmanov's "reliance on
dubious information and news sources" is not in the interest of
the regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Tajik government would take
sincere steps toward national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi said that Iran's peaceful efforts leading to
the establishment of ceasefire, holding of elections and
continued negotiations in Tajikistan reveal the fact that the
Islamic Republic was for realization of national reconciliation,
peace and security in that country solely through peaceful and
negotiated means.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inflation Rate Stands At 45 Percent In 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 23 (Xinhua)-- Zambia's inflation rate stood at
45.5 percent in 1995 caused by huge budget deficit, local weekly
"Financial Mail" revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Acting Deputy Governor of the Bank of Zambia, Situmbeko
Musokotwane, was quoted as saying that the hign inflation rate
could be attributed to the government's huge allocation of funds
to Meridien Biao Bank in a bid to salvage it from total collapse,
compounded by over expenditure on wage bills and defence.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has put in place necessary monetary measures
aimed at reducing inflation, but achieving this will mainly
depend on the adherence to the cash budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the key to monetary control is the balance
of the budget which will determine the ability to control
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is ready to reduce inflation to 10 percent
this year on condition that fiscal discipline is observed to
minimize the budget deficit, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will present a new budget for 1996 at parliament this
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Confiscates 2,250 Satellite Dishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
confiscated 2,250 satellite dishes in an effort to fight against
Western culture, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The evening paper Ettela'at said that some 1,200 dishes were
confiscated in the capital city of Tehran and 1,050 were seized
from smugglers in the southeastern province of Sistan and
Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a justice ministry official as saying that
having satellite dishes were against the law.
</P>
<P>
"Using, storing and transporting satellite receivers is a
misdemeanor. The law says that those who do such things will be
fined 250 to 1,250 dollars and will have their equipment
confiscated," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The controversial issue of satellite dishes had been debated in
Iran for over one year before the Iranian Majlis (parliament)
approved a bill banning the using of satellite equipment in April
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, manufacturer, distributor and illegal
users of satellite equipment will be punished with confiscation
of all satellite equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign organizations such as embassies and news
agencies are permitted to use satellite facilities but they
should apply for licenses.

<HEADLINE> Four Afghan Drug Smugglers Killed in Eastern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Four Afghan drug smugglers were
killed in an armed conflict with Iranian law enforcement forces
in eastern Iran, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the four
smugglers were killed in the eastern frontier region of
Shahrakht, Khorasan province.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the conflict took place on Monday, 60
kilograms of opium, three pieces of arms and some ammunition were
seized.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced last month that law enforcement forces seized
125 tons of narcotics in the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iran captured more than 150 tons of narcotics, of
which 117 tons of opium and 13 tons of morphine.
</P>
<P>
Iran has executed over 4,000 drug traffickers since 1988 and
there are over 12,500 foreign smugglers in the Iranian jails.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems of
the country since it is one of the best transit for drug to Europe
and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest drug-producing center
in the world.
</P>
<P>
In its border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iran has made
1,400 kilometers of roads and 150 kilometers of canals in order to
prevent drug smugglers from entering the country.

<P>
ATHENS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Greeks will be able to pay in
taxis, supermarkets, at kiosks, theatre and elsewhere with the use
of a plastic card in the near future.
</P>
<P>
A new card, or "lectronic wallet" which can be used as a
substitute for petty cash, will soon be introduced in the country
by the National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ''electronic wallet'' will offer rechargable credit
facilities for continued usage, and will be available either as an
extra service to existing credit cards, or as a separate product,
for low-amount transactions.
</P>
<P>
This new facility, which resembles telephone cards, will have
10,000 Drachmas (about 40 U.S. Dollars) limit, and may be
recharged with credit at special terminals.
</P>
<P>
The cards, which carry a secret pin number known only to their
users, will have a three-year life limit and won't bear the user's
name.
</P>
<P>
In cases of theft or misplacement, the card's owner will
automatically lose the balance.
</P>
<P>
According to the pilot programme's coordinator, Kostas
Papageorgious, the ''electronic wallet'' will offer numerous
advantages to its users, including easy acquisition regardless of
age and income level, and less cash dependence.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that the Palestine National Council (PNC) must
amend the Palestinian covenant by abolishing clauses calling for
Israel's destruction instead of replacing it with a new document.
</P>
<P>
Peres was speaking at the Knesset (Israel's parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
He is due to meet with Yasser Arafat, newly elected President
of the Palestinian Authority, on Wednesday at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Peres welcomed steps taken by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), saying that the PNA has shown utmost seriousness
in dealing with violence by Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas and
the Islamic Jihad are still making efforts to carry out
anti-Israeli attacks, but they have not been successful. The PNA
are confiscating weapons, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no reason for him to offer new gestures
to the Palestinians during his meeting with Arafat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he does not intend to announce a release of
more Palestinian prisoners and his real intention is to ensure
that the two sides continue to adhere to peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to conclude the chapter that was concluded in
the Palestinian elections. I think the Oslo 1, Oslo 2 accords,
and the elections are great successes for peace, for new
relations between us and the Palestinians," Peres told reports
following the Knesset meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We should discuss how to go ahead and fulfill other parts of
the agreement between them and us," he added.

<HEADLINE> Michael Johnson Wins 1996 Owens Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 23 (Xinhua/OANA) -- World-famous sprinter
Michael Johnson of the United States, the undisputed world
200-meter and 400-meter champion last year, has won the 1996 Jesse
Owens International Trophy Award with top votes from a worldwide
panel of electors.
</P>
<P>
Johnson received 84 votes, beating Haile Gebrselassie of
Ethiopia with 71 points, who set world records in the 5,000 and
10,000 meters last year, and Britain's Jonathan Edwards with 68
points, who became the first triple jumper to surpass 18 meters.
</P>
<P>
Johnson swept the USA Championships at Sacramento, California,
in June, and the World Championships at Goteborg, Sweden, last
August to claim his unshakable dominance in these two events and
keep an all-win record starting 1988.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1995, Johnson defied the 45-second barrier for the
400 and twice smashed the world indoor record. He also won the 200
meters at the 1991 World Championships and the 400 at the 1993
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Only the athlete who best embodies excellence in athletic
performance and promotes cooperation and understanding among
peoples of all nations is entitled to this award. Johnson is the
first U.S. men's sprinter to win the award since Carl Lewis in
1985. He is to receive the trophy February 6 at a dinner at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

<HEADLINE> Increase of Meningitis in Older Children Linked With Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- British doctors are
investigating a link between rises of meningitis in older children
and teenage smoking.
</P>
<P>
Researchers in the British Public Health Laboratory Service,
where they have been closely monitoring the recent outbreaks, said
there has been an increase in meningitis with septicaemia (blood
poisoning, the most lethal complication).
</P>
<P>
The pattern of meningitis infection was also slightly
different, and overall cases and deaths from meningitis, which
doctors call the meningococcal disease, increased last year, said
the doctors.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis killed 185 Britons in 1995, compared to 148-173
deaths in the previous five years. There were 203 deaths in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Of the 185 deaths last year, 142 cases were attributed to
septicaemia.
</P>
<P>
"The age group affected by septicaemia is slightly older. There
is an upward trend in cases among the five-year to 25-year age
group, compared to the one-year to five-year age groups," said
Norman Begg, deputy director of the Service's communicable disease
surveillance center.
</P>
<P>
"This is highly speculative, but one possible explanation for
more septicaemia in the older children could be an association
with smoking in teenagers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is a very complex relationship between the
meningococcal disease and smoking. "We know more children are
smoking."
</P>
<P>
In Britain, 30 percent of 15-year-old girls and 26 percent of
boys of the same age were smoking in 1994, four and seven percent
more than in 1993, respectively, according to the latest available
official figures.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Asks ILO to Help Solve Unemployment Problem in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has asked the International Labor Organization (ILO) to help draw
up a plan to find a solution to the unemployment problem in Egypt,
an ILO official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Samir Radwan, head of the ILO Development and Technical
Cooperation Section, said that Mubarak asked the Geneva-based
organization to conduct a technical study to exactly specify
Egypt's unemployment rate, the Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been one of the major social problems of Egypt
mainly because of its slow economic growth and overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri said earlier this month that
the government would work to find job opportunities for some
500,000 people per year through attracting investment and
increasing the economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
According to Egypt's official media reports late last year, the
unemployment rate is 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Radwan, however, was quoted by MENA as saying that the World
Bank has estimated the unemployment rate in Egypt at about 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The official said he is now in Cairo with his accompanying
delegation to take stock of the unemployment problem in Egypt,
which has a population of nearly 60 million.

NEW YORK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
leading jetmaker, has signed a contract worth more than 4 billion
U.S. dollars to provide General Electric Co.'s aviation services
unit with as many as 259 passenger airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The order signals an upturn for the world's jetmakers, U.S.
newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
GE Capital Aviation Services, the world's largest
aircraft-leasing company, ordered five of Boeing's new wide-body
777s, 20 of its current 737 passenger jetliners and 82 of the next
version of the 737, which is being developed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company signed options to buy 152 more of the
newest 737s.
</P>
<P>
GE Capital said it will get about 25 planes a year, starting
late this year. The agreement covers several years. It is
difficult to settle the exact period.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's newest plane, the 777, carries more than 350
passengers. The 737 comes in three sizes -- for 108, 128 and 146
passengers -- and Boeing is working on several new version of
that plane.

<HEADLINE> Report on Ulster Arms Issue Submitted to UK, Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish
governments confirmed today that they have received the report
compiled by the international panel in charge of arms
decommissioning process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The report is aimed to break the impasse in the peace process
in the troubled province which has been installed for seven
months. It is reported that both British and Irish governments are
studying the report.
</P>
<P>
But the content of the report will not be revealed until
Wednesday, when George Mitchell, chairman of the international
body, publishes his recommendations in Belfast, Dublin and London.
</P>
<P>
According to some press reports here, the report suggests that
there should be no pre-conditions to all-party talks on the future
of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
So far, the British government has insisted that the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) must start to decommission at least some of
its arms before its political wing Sinn Fein can be admitted to
all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
This demand has been rejected by the IRA and Sinn Fein who have
accused the British government of deliberately delaying all-party
talks and sowing division among republicans who support the
reunification of the whole island of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The British government argued that rival paramilitaries must be
disarmed because all-party talks could not be held under the
shadow of guns.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Russia's Admission into Council of Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
urged today the Council of Europe to accept a membership bid by
Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said a negative decision would be regarded by many Russians
as "an indirect support for the sides attempting to resolve the
Chechen problem by inhumane, terrorist methods."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Yeltsin's Press Secretary Sergei
Medveded said that a rejection, "in a broader sense, would be
interpreted as a refusal of support for those who are struggling
to establish democratic principles and democratic institutions in
Russia."
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin issued the statement today because he deemed it
necessary to express his opinion on several important problems
before the Council votes on Russia's application on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the just-concluded State Duma (the lower
house of Parliament) elections were held on time and were
generally acknowledged as free and democratic.
</P>
<P>
As for the Chechen crisis, the statement said that "giving way
to terrorism means encouraging more violent and large-scale
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"Efficient and less painful methods against this horrible evil
must be found, and we are prepared to do so," it added.
</P>
<P>
Russia's application for the Council's membership was frozen
last year for seven months because of Moscow's military campaign
in the breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Council lifted the freeze after expressing
satisfaction with ceasefire talks between the government and
Chechen rebels in the region. But the hostility has flared up
again since then.

NAIROBI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Director General of
the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Renato Ruggiero pledged here
today to provide Kenya with manpower training to enable it to
survive in the new world order.
</P>
<P>
The WTO boss told Kenya President Daniel arap Moi in a meeting
that his organization would also help improve Nairobi's market
access into the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was heeding Moi's call for the WTO support in terms
of market entrance as a way of bridging Kenya's existing trade
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to the east African country, Ruggiero
also discussed trade issues with Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka
who rated unemployment and lack of access to foreign markets as
two biggest challenges in the face of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero called for a liberalized economy in Kenya which he
said is "the only way" to achieve economic progress.

<HEADLINE> Yields Expected Above Average In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- President of the Commercial
Farmers Union of Zimbabwe Peter Macsporran said today that
Zimbabwe's farmers would have above average yields this year
despite the late start to the 1995/96 rain season.
</P>
<P>
"Reports we have received from all over the country show that
the rains have been fairly widespread and, although we are not
expecting a bumper harvest, yields will be above average," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The union president expected farmers to produce about 600,000
to 800,000 tonnes of white maize, of which between 400,000 and
500,000 tonnes would be marketed, with the output of soyabean
production estimated between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
About 220,000 tonnes of cotton, more than double that of last
year, was forcast by the union chief for all Zimbabwean farming
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of Zimbabwe, which last year suffered a devastating
drought, have so far received heavy rains with some areas
recording their highest falls in more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological office officials said in their latest weather
assessment that the country would this year have a normal season.
Last year, the rains ended more than two months prematurely,
wiping crop output by over 18 percent.

<HEADLINE> NAFTA Sets Up Panel To Review U.S.-Canadian  Dispute Over Some Farm Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) --A panel of arbitrators will
have a final say whether Canadian tariffs on U.S. milk products,
eggs, chickens and barley violate the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The Office of U.S. Trade Representative confirmed Monday that
the panel had been appointed, the first under NAFTA since the
agreement took effect January 1, 1994. A ruling by the five-member
panel, which was appointed by the U.S. and Canadian governments,
could come as early as next summer.
</P>
<P>
The panel was set up after U.S. producers complained that
exceptionally high Canadian tariffs violate NAFTA. But Canada
argues the high tariffs are allowed under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been trying to negotiate a resolution to the
dispute since late 1993. Last July, the U.S. Trade Representative
Kantor formally requested a panel of arbitrators. The formation of
the panel, which must be agreed upon by the two governments, were
completed last week.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, a joint United States-Canada commission on grains
issued its final report on the grain trade dispute between the two
countries. The findings repeated what the panel reported in June,
that the Canadian Wheat Board should reform its grain pricing and
the United States should end export subsidies under the Export
Enhancement Program.

<HEADLINE> USAD Predicts Record Farm Export in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) --U.S. agricultural exports are
on a record-setting track for 1996, according to a report from the
U.S. Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The USAD predicts the exports of farm products will reach some
58 billion U.S. dollars during the year ending September 30. That
is 3.9 billion dollars more than the export record of 54.1 billion
dollars set during the same period in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
The country are expected to import 29 billion dollars of
agricultural products in 1996, some 500 million dollars below last
year. Lower world coffee prices are cited the main reason for the
decline.
</P>
<P>
The value of U.S. farm exports last January through October was
45.2 billion dollars, a 24 percent increase from the same period
in 1994. With high world prices prevailing for most commodities,
the largest gains were in grain and feeds, cotton, oilseeds and
vegetable oils and beef and poultry.
</P>
<P>
Corn shipments during the 10 months totaled 50.3 million tons
which is nearly double the year-earlier figure. Corn exports were
worth 5.9 billion dollars, about 3 billion dollars more than the
1994-95 period.
</P>
<P>
Japan was one of the biggest market for the U.S. farm products,
buying 13.4 million tons of U.S. corn. South Korea took 7.8
million tons and Taiwan, 5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Ten-month wheat shipments were 26.8 million tons, a slight
increase. But the value of those exports shot up by 1.1 billion
dollars, to 4.4 billion dollars due to higher prices. Egypt bought
4.3 million tons, while China, 2.6 million tons and Japan, 2.4
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Farmers supplied 18 million tons of soybeans to overseas buyers
during the 10 months, up 4.9 million tons with the total price of
4.1 billion dollars. The European Union bought 7.1 million tons
and Japan 3.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
For all of fiscal 1995-96, which will end September 30, tight
world supplies of wheat and coarse grain are expected to drive up
prices, resulting in a forecast of 19.1 billion dollars over grain
and feed exports. But the export volume will be slightly below
last year.

<P>
One poacher was killed instantly with another wounded. The
others fled into the bush.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says American Verbal Guarantee on Missiles Sale Not sufficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government
indicated here today that the verbal guarantees by U.S. officials
that Turkey will not use American Atacms missiles against Cyprus
are not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements made by U.S. President Bill Clinton
on the missile deal with Turkey, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said specific provisions should be included in the
contract for the sale of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted that in defiance to the U.S. law, American
military equipment has been used by Turkey to Cyprus' expense.
</P>
<P>
Washington announced last December its decision to sell 120
Atacms missiles to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Atacms are offensive-oriented deep strike weapons that can
hit soft and hard targets. The missiles have a maximum range of
165 kilometers and can easily be modified to a 300-kilometer
range.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has described the
U.S. government decision as an "unfriendly act" toward the
Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said that the sale of the missiles to Turkey
will serve U.S. strategic interests and will not harm the human
rights policy and efforts for progress in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the U.S. government responsible for these
missiles and it should guarantee that they will not be used to
Cyprus' expense," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "since they are determined to sell them, the
contracts they will sign with the Turks should have specific
provisions on the issue."

<HEADLINE> SADC Air Force To Set Up Search-And-Rescue Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) air forces have
proposed to establish a southern African search-and-rescue body
(SASAR).
</P>
<P>
South African Air Force (SAAF) colonel Coen Van Den Berg said
in Pretoria today that the proposal is advanced at a two-day SADC
meeitng on aviation safety at Waterkloof air force base near
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The proposed SASAR would be modelled on South Africa's
search-and-resue body, and may have difficulties in getting
permission from the departments of foreign affairs to do
search-and-rescue operations across the borders, the colonel
said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Aviation Safety Subcommittee is proposing procedures
for obtaining fast diplomatic clearances for such operations,
according to the colonel.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations made at the SADC meeting would be
referred to the aviation standing committee for discussion at a
meeting in Zimbabwe next month, the officer added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by representatives from Botswana,
Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola,
Mozambique and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Spending Outpaces Income in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumers spent money
at a faster rate than they earned it in November, the Commerce
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.9 percent in
November after falling 0.3 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Personal income rose just 0.2 percent in November, compared to
a 0.7 percent gain in October.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that disposable income, income after
taxes, increased 0.9 percent in November, after falling 0.3
percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, was
4.5 percent in November, compared to 5.2 percent the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
The report, which combined the October and November figures,
was the latest in a series of economic data that was delayed by
the partial federal government shutdown.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Called for Actions In EU In Social Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Foreign Minister Mr.
Erik Derycke today called for more actions by the European
Union(EU) and its member states in social field to lighten the
pressures they are facing with regard to the enormous
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the traditional New Year's reception for the
international press, Mr. Derycke admitted that, up to the present
day, the EU has not always succeeded in implementing each and
every one of its fundamental principles.
</P>
<P>
"If it has brought peace and stability, the Union has only
partially succeeded in creating prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the European authorities gave absolute
priority to economic cooperation "without linking it with a sound
social policy".
</P>
<P>
"This has led to a situation whereby current European
intergraiton is very much out of balance, and national authorities
are losing their hold on the economy and no longer having any
budgetary space left for social security or for creating jobs," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
According to the Belgium Foreign Minister, there is a hint of
social policy in certain areas, for instance in the field of
health and safety of workers, equal wages for men and women, "but
it is very succinct".
</P>
<P>
Citing from the annual report on employment in EU for the
period between 1991 and 1994, he noted the following figures: six
million jobs were lost; 18 million people are unemployed, which is
almost 11 percent of the active population; 48 percent of the
currently unemployed people are long-term unemployed, and more
than half of them have been so for over two years.
</P>
<P>
He called this situation "a social tragedy unacceptable of our
society".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he urged that the EU's Inter-governmental Conference
mandate of negotiation must consider social deepening as its
priority.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a confidence crisis between Europe and its citizens,
this crisis can only be resolved through action in the social
field," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Denies Receiving Money from Hawala Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao today denied that he had received any money from
hawala dealers.
</P>
<P>
The denial, which was made by an official spokesman on his
behalf, came in response to earlier reports that Bharatiya senior
leader Atal Behari Vajyayee had released a statement backing his
allegation that Rao had taken money from hawala dealers.
</P>
<P>
In the statement allegedly recorded by the Central Bureau of
Investigation, S.K. Jain, the key dealer involved in the hawala
case, claimed that he had paid 3.55 crore rupees (about 922,000 US
dollars) to Rao and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The official spokesman told reporters that he has been
authorized to say that the allegation against the prime minister
is totally baseless.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has not received any money from S.K. Jain
nor has he authorized anyone else to receive money on his behalf,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Side Rejects Denktash Suggestion for High Level Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- High-level direct talks,
suggested by Turkish Cypriot community leader Rauf Denktash,
between himself and Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, will not
be productive in facilitating a Cyprus settlement, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides made the remarks at his daily press briefing when
commenting on Denktash's latest statements that he was ready to
accept unconditional talks with President Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Turkish Cypriot leader had said
nothing new and that he continuously repeats that he wants to talk
with Clerides without setting any preconditions, but at the same
time, he states that his side is not prepared to make any
concessions.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said this means that Denktash is ready to meet
President Clerides and repeats all those arguments which
President Clerides has already refuted.
</P>
<P>
"Such a meeting will be unproductive and will bring adverse
results to the people who believe that a Cyprus settlement will be
found through dialogue," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides stated that the Cyprus president does not set any
preconditions for a meeting with Denktash but asks for a
well-prepared summit to make it productive and lead to a solution
to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman repeated that the two sides should agree first on
a common ground on the basic aspects composing the Cyprus problem
before going to direct talks between the two communities' leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem, created as a result of the Turkish
invasion in 1974 following an Athens-backed coup, has remained
unsolved for the past 21 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have intensified their
efforts since the beginning of this year in a bid to bring the
two communities' leaders to a direct negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> China's Commercial Sector Opening Up More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China will open the door wider
to overseas retailers and is considering the possibility of
letting foreign wholesalers enter China's huge market, according
to Chen Bangzhu, minister of internal trade.
</P>
<P>
Another possibility under consideration is that of allowing
entry to overseas material distributors and chain stores, the
ministry told a national distribution meeting on this year's work
and that of the next 15 years which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The central government has already approved 14 Sino-overseas
retail businesses in China, and granted import and export rights
to 206 Chinese enterprises, the ministry reported.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the meeting that China will work on more
legislation on distribution. "The ministry will try to submit its
drafts of the 'Wholesale Market Law', 'Commodity Transaction Law',
and 'Grain Law' to the National People's Congress for approval
this year," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A number of legislative rulings, including ones on alcoholic
drinks, chain stores, and the agent system
are also expected to be approved by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the distribution situation this year, Chen said
that the supply of consumer goods is expected to be good and the
market buoyant, but that there will still be structural problems.
</P>
<P>
There will still be a strain on major farm and sideline produce
supplies and controlling grain prices will be tough.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicts that this year's consumer goods retail
sales will reach 2.5 trillion yuan (304.8 billion US dollars), a
rise of 22 percent, and sales of chemical fertilizers, pesticides
and other materials will hit 3.1 trillion yuan, a growth of 15
percent.

ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is considering to
provide technical assistance for a textile mill and a cement
factory at the Taliban-controlled areas of Kalahari and Herat in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan State Television today, a delegation has
already left Pakistan for these areas in southeast and northwest
Afghanistan to conduct a survey on high quality onyx.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pakistan National Highway Authority (NHW) will
help repair roads in these areas which lead to the Central Asian
Republics. NHW also plans to lay a railway track there.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is planning to set up utility stores
and bank branches in Kandahar and Herat.
</P>
<P>
Direct telephone link between Lahore, capital of Pakistan's
Punjab province, and Kandahar, Herat, and Mazari-i-Sharif will
soon be established.
</P>
<P>
The nearest trade route between Pakistan and Central Asian
countries lies in Afghanistan, but due to the on-going Afghan
conflict, It is difficult traveling inside Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government has accused Pakistan of supporting its
rival, the student militia Taliban, which controls about one
third of Afghan territory, but Pakistan denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Awards Go To Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Three Americans, a Briton, a
German, and a Japanese were chosen as winners of China's
International Science and Technology Cooperation prize, a top
science official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for foreign scientists or scholars to
receive China's International Science and Technology Cooperation
Award.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan, secretary-general of the State Science and Technology
Commission, said that only those who have made outstanding
contributions to China's science and technology qualify for the
award.
</P>
<P>
The Briton, Joseph Needham, author of "Science and Civilization
in China", devoted the latter part of his life to research on
science and technology in China. His book was the first full
account of the 5,000-year history of science and civilization in
China.
</P>
<P>
The German was formerly patent bureau chief and contributed
much to the development of intellectual property rights protection
in China. China and Germany signed a "Promoting Patent Work in
China" agreement, based on his proposal, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Because of a Sino-German patent exchange program, 399 Chinese
had been sent to Germany for training by 1993, and Germany has
provided China's patent office with 18 million deutsche marks worth
of equipment and automated facilities, an important step in
developing China's patent system.
</P>
<P>
One of the Americans, S. S. Chern, has helped China improve its
mathematics research and set up the Nankai Mathematics Institute,
which has trained more than 1,000 young mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-Americans Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang are Nobel
Prize winners who have contributed to China's education.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lee has contributed to science and technology since
1970s. With his help, China built a positron-electron collider and
set up various science and research foundations, such as a
post-doctorate research system and the State Natural Science Fund,
which have increased the number of talented people and academic
exchanges and encouraged Chinese students studying overseas to
return to China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yang established an education fund in Hong Kong, which has
provided aid for one-year visits to American universities for more
than 100 scholars or researchers since 1980.
</P>
<P>
He also pushed for the establishment of several funds sponsored
by industrialists in Hong Kong and Macao to provide support for
outstanding Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Japanese rice expert Hara Shoichi began to introduce his Dry
Breeding and Sparse Transplanting Rice Technique to northern China
in 1981. Heilongjiang Province was able to increase per-hectare
rice yield to 5,700 kg, from 1,950 kg.
</P>
<P>
The technique is now being introduced to southern China as part
of a national extension program worked out by the Agriculture
ministry.

NEW DELHI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress Party
today rejected allegations made by the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) that Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao had received money
from Hawala dealers.

Earlier today, BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee released an
alleged statement to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
made by S.K. Jain, the key illegal foreign exchange dealer in the
Hawala case, in which he claimed that he had given 3.55 crore
rupees (about 992,000 US dollars) to Rao and his colleagues.

Congress Party spokesman V.N. Gadgil told reporters that the

The spokesman dismissed the allegation as totally false and

it.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Trade Minister on Use of Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China will rely mainly on a
better investment environment, its legal system, high efficient
management and service, and markets to attract overseas funds, a
senior trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official said that use of overseas funds would be improved
with reasonable and effective guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic
co-operation, made these remarks at a working conference on
foreign trade and the economy which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, China approved a total of 37,000
overseas-funded projects last year, with 38 billion US dollars
worth of overseas funds being actually used, an increase of 11.6
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the country's use of overseas funds improved in
1995 not only in quality but also in structure. Capital- and
technology-intensive projects increased in number and basic
industry and infrastructure attracted overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China would increase controls on
overseas investment with regulations and guidelines on overseas
investment ratified last year and pay more attention to improving
overseas investment quality.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment will be encouraged in infrastructure, basic
industries, pillar, new and hi-tech industries, innovation in
state businesses, and low-income residential projects, according
to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment will be encouraged in the middle and
western parts of China, and enterprises with overseas funds in
coastal areas are encouraged to transfer labor-intensive and
resource-processing projects, Wu noted, adding that this will
bring overseas investment in line with China's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The minster also called for increased administration of
existing enterprises using overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 120,000 overseas-funded enterprises are
in operation, employing more than 16 million people, and with
sales, profits, and exports rising annually, they have become a
major force in China's foreign trade.

Party (BNP) and some small parties which have filed their
nomination papers of candidates, all major opposition parties are
boycotting the polls process. They are demanding the resignation
of the prime minister to pave the way for the elections to be held
under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the need for holding elections in order to
maintain the constitutional process, Khaleda admitted there would
be some difficulty in conducting election campaigns and casting
votes during the month of Ramadan beginning from Monday.
</P>
<P>
But she added, "It has become obligatory for us to hold
elections during the Ramadan."
</P>
<P>
Constitutional rule and democracy could be jeopardized if the
elections were not held in due time in accordance with the
constitution, she stressed, urging the people to elect their
representatives according to their choice.

<HEADLINE> China's Overseas Students Have New Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Those who study abroad at state
expense now face the prospect of paying for the education if they
refuse to provide some service to the state.
</P>
<P>
China has decided on a new method of sending people abroad to
study beginning this year, according to a national working meeting
on international studies here today. It will consider national
economic needs and social development when sending people abroad.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 experts from across the country will make more
rational decisions on who and where people will go for further
training.
</P>
<P>
The National Scholarship Council for International Studies
(NSCIS), established at the proposal of the State Council, will
deal with these matters on behalf of the State Education
Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
Applications for study abroad are reviewed by the group of
experts and the applicant must sign a contract with
NSCIS. According to the contract, the person must pay an amount,
not to exceed 50,000 yuan (about 6,000 U.S. dollars), in earnest
money to NSCIS, who will deposit the money in a designated bank.
</P>
<P>
The money along with interest will then be refunded to the
person if he or she returns in the specified amount of time and
does some service to the country. If not, the person will have to
pay the government for their studies and be fined for breaking the
contract.
</P>
<P>
The new method has been successfully tried out by northeast
China's Jilin Province and east China's Jiangsu Province, and the
SEC decided to popularize it nationwide this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Miaorui, director of the SEC foreign affairs department,
said at today's meeting that the new method will improve the
quality of people being sent abroad for international studies and
urge them to return home to serve the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government spends about 10,000 U.S. dollars on each
student studying abroad for a year. "The government should get a
return on this," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Sending more people abroad for further study was an idea
proposed by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 as an important part of the
country's reform and opening up drive.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 people have gone abroad for studies since then,
some 120,000 at state expense, and more than 70,000 have returned
after having finished studies.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told Republican leaders
on Monday that he has run out of legal options to sidestep the
national borrowing limit and cannot keep the Government from
defaulting on its debts after February 29 without selling off the
national gold reserves of holding up tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
-- The State of the Union Message usually focuses all eyes on
the Resident, but because of the budget standoff and presidential
politics, the Republicans are drawing plenty of attention to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will appear under subpoena
Friday before the Whitewater federal grand jury here to answer
questions about the recent discovery in the White House residence
of her legal billing records that have been sought by
investigators for two years.
</P>
<P>
-- The Supreme Court yesterday rejected California Governor
Pete Wilson's challenge to a federal law that requires states to
provide voter registration at motor vehicle offices, refusing to
hear an argument advanced by several states, including Virginia,
that the law infringes states' rights.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- First Interstate, apparently throwing in the towel on its
10-billion-dollar merger agreement with First Bank, is close to a
pact to merge with former hostile suitor Wells Fargo for 11.2
billion dollars. The resulting bank would be the eighth largest in
the U.S., with 108 billion dollars in assets and more than 2,000
branches in the western U.S.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Prying open a cosmic tomb that has been tightly sealed for
4.6 billion years, the Jupiter probe Galileo has discovered a
Pandora's box of puzzles and surprises that promises to alter
scientists' thinking about the giant gas planet, and perhaps even
the evolution of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Federal programs that have careened from spending cuts to
complete shutdowns during the past four months face their next day
of reckoning Friday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Prepares for Change of World's Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has made preparations
to face possible changes in the world's oil price if Iraq resumes
oil exports, executive director of the state oil company
Pertamina, Faisal Abda'oe, said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the change in the international oil industry would
be inevitable if Iraq succeeds in persuading the United Nations to
lift its economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
If the embargo is lifted, Iraq may export 600,000 to 700,000
barrels of crude oil per day, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
A recent meeting between the UN and Iraqi officials has pulled
down the price of Brent oil on the London bourse.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which
Indonesia is a member, has taken necessary measures in case the
four-year trade embargo against Iraq is lifted, said Abda'oe.

<HEADLINE> China Needs Peaceful Int'l Environment, Says NPC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader said
here today that China needs a long-term peaceful international
environment while it handles its domestic affairs well.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, we must do our own things well; at the same
time, we should create a peaceful international situation as long
as possible." Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, told a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
At the 7th meeting of executive council of Chinese Association
for International Understanding (CAIU), Qiao, also a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) Central Committee, said the next 15 years will be an
important period for China to develop itself, adding that the
period will be one "full of hopes and difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Qiao extended congratulations on behalf of the CPC Central
Committee and the NPC Standing Committee on the convening of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
With the profound changes in the international structure and a
fundamental change of China's economic system, non-governmental
exchanges between countries will become more active, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
Founded 15 years ago, the CAIU has so far established links
with non-governmental groups, political parties and research
institutes in over 80 countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xueqian, chairman of CAIU and vice-chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee, said that it is necessary for the CAIU to make more
friends, particularly close friends, in order to keep pace with
the changes of the international situation, to enhance
understanding, friendship and cooperation with the people of other
countries, and to serve China's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting, Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of
the NPC Standing Committee and honorary chairperson of CAIU, and
Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and
vice-chairman of CAIU, called on all CAIU members to spare no
effort in making new progress.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting proposed that CAIU, under the
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with General Secretary
Jiang Zemin at the core, should carry forward its good tradition
and abide by the principles on foreign affairs formulated by the
CPC Central Committee so as to make more contributions.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Council of the CAIU is composed of celebrities,
experts and scholars from China's political parties and various
sectors. Lei Jieqiong was again elected honorary chairperson and
Wu Xueqian chairman of the association at today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Presidents Indicted on Insurrection Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution
today indicted former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo on
insurrection charges in connection with the notorious Kwangju
incident.
</P>
<P>
The incident, in which some 150 people were killed and 2,000
others wounded, happened when Chun launched a military crackdown
on the civil uprising in Kwangju, capital of the country's South
Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested respectively on November 16 and
December 3 last year, have been already indicted on charges of
accepting bribes and masterminding the military mutiny on December
12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Six key aides of Chun involved in the 1979 and 1980 incidents
were also indicted on the same charges today.
</P>
<P>
In an interim investigation report released after the
indictments, the prosecution said that Chun is charged with
sending troops to Kwangju to violently suppress the demonstrations
without prior approval of then President Choi Kyu-hah, the
commander in chief of the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Chun has also been charged with five other counts including
unlawfully closing the National Assembly and banning political
activities by extending martial law nationwide on May 17, 1980. If
convicted, Chun could face death penalty or life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Roh and the other six were accused of supporting Chun in his
plan to usurp power by force.
</P>
<P>
Roh was charged with five counts, including playing an
important role in the insurrection, unauthorized deployment of
Army troops for insurrection and unlawful detention of
politicians. He also faces capital punishment or life in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the Army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
nation until February 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Roh, who gave way in February 1993 to Kim
Young Sam, the first civilian president in South Korea in more
than 30 years.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The European soccer's
governing body UEFA has written to the European Commission asking
for a meeting, according to a letter obtained on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA wanted to discuss how to structure the game following
the Bosman court ruling.
</P>
<P>
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner asked to meet Competition
Commissioner Karel Van Miert and Employment Commissioner Padraig
Flynn to discuss the ruling's implications.
</P>
<P>
Aigner said UEFA's primary concern was to devise a new system
for European soccer that would protect the position of
associations, players and clubs while at the same time meeting
European Union law.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based European Court ruled on December 15 in a
case involving Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman that UEFA's
transfer fee rules and player-nationality restrictions violated
EU law on the free movement of workers.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Commission, which enforces the court's
rulings, put a deadline of six weeks for UEFA to end its transfer
fee system and nationality restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Britain Blocks Single-Currency Publicity Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain has made it clear that
it would not allow the European Commission to carry out a single
currency publicity campaign in the country, fearing a new round of
controversy over the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Clark, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told EU finance
ministers in Brussels Monday that it would be unwise to launch the
single currency campaign in Britain until there was greater
certainty about the monetary union, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said that we need an informed debate in the
UK. A Commission campaign is not at the present stage the best way
of taking the matter forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to European Commission President Jacques Santer
last week, the Foreign Office warned against any Commission-backed
campaign in Britain, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major has been under strong pressure from
the conservative Euro-sceptics, who insist that the Conservative
Party promise in its next manifesto to rule out entry into the
single currency during the life of the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll last month showed that most British voters
opposed the idea of a single currency and wanted a referendum on
whether Britain should join.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission officially launched its single currency
campaign in Brussels on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett Packard Predicts New Trend for PC Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China Hewlett Packard (CHP),
Hewlett Packard's joint company in China, has declared to put its
VECTRA500 personal computers on the Chinese market to meet the
demand of the rising SBSO (small business/small office) PC market.
</P>
<P>
A recent market analysis made by the No. 3 electronic products
maker in US indicates that a SBSO market exists, somewhere between
PCs for commercial need and family need, which has been scarely
covered by PC makers so far. These users refer to businesses with
less than 10 employees and professional working at home.
</P>
<P>
Foo Piau Phang, country marketing manager of CHP's computer
products organization, said SBSO users primarily demand business
software, compared with family users; and communicating with other
computer users rather than within the company itself, they require
that their PCs are easily connected with information networks such
as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
And VECTRA500 are specially catered to this market, said Foo.
</P>
<P>
The manager admits China at present has a very small SBSO
market, compared with the emerging markets in countries such as
the US.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the market will develop fast in the
next few years, especially in some southern China cities.
</P>
<P>
"I expect more and more PC makers will put products catered to
SBSO users in the Chinese market in the next two years." Foo said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, CHP received orders totalling 372 million US
dollars, accounting for one percent of the company's net revenue
for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Somalis Demand Humanitarian Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 disabled men,
women and children took to the streets of northern Mogadishu on
Tuesday demanding a humanitarian aid from both Somali society and
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The disabled demonstrators include victims of the
Ethiopian-Somali war in 1977 and of the Somali civil war since
the downfall of the late M. S. Barre's military regime.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the peaceful demonstrators who gathered at the
Fiat Square in northern Mogadishu said the international aid
agencies underestimated the need of the disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Accused some of the agencies of "feeding gangs", he said
"bandits who erect roadlocks and demand extortion payment from
aid agencies are given the highest priority".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman picked out the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) in
his accusation of giving little attention to the aid calls by
disabled Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he praised the International Committee of Red Cross
(ICRC) for their best humanitarian aid to the Somali people.
</P>
<P>
Among the demonstrators were 137 blind men and women who
carried placards which they can't read. "They are written by
people I trust," said Mahamed Jima'ale, a 32-tear-old blind
demonstrator.
</P>
<P>
"Someone can feed you for a limited period of time, but your
skills can feed you for ever," said Sheikh Kulmiye, president of
a group of 450 Somali blind people in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu is hosting 8876 crippled people, of whom 3400 are in
north Mogadishu and the rest in the south.
</P>
<P>
Somalia also accomodates many more disabled people in other
parts of the country, most of them living in the breakaway

<HEADLINE> HK Trade Development Council to Promote Internet Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong manufacturers and
traders are being urged to team with the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council to take advantage of the new opportunities of
global marketing on Internet.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing today to introduce the TDC's new
Internet-related services and activities, TDC's deputy Executive
Director Anna Lai said that manufacturers and traders in Hong Kong
could not afford to ignore the global information highway.
</P>
<P>
She said that TDC launched a multi-tiered program to encourage
Hong Kong companies to open Internet accounts and to promote the
TDC Home Page globally.
</P>
<P>
"Once they are connected, local businesses can receive overseas
trade inquiries or promote their products worldwide through TDC's
Home Page," she said, adding that TDC's Home Page is the world's
fast-track for doing business with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
For the future, she said, that the Council was planning to
launch a Chinese version of the TDC Home Page to increase its
capability to provide timely information about the market in
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
TDC's another project is the redevelopment and relaunch later
this year of TDC-Link, Hong Kong's most popular on-line trade
information service, which has over 5,500 local subscribers and
provides access to TDC's vast data bank of trade contacts and
market information.
</P>
<P>
Longer term, she added, more advanced functions would be
incorporated into TDC-Link to facilitate electronic business to be
transacted over the Internet between Hong Kong companies and
overseas customers.

<HEADLINE> Residential Mortgage Loans Grow In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Residential mortgage loans
for the purchase of properties in the territory grew at a higher
rate in December last year, as shown in the latest survey
conducted by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
The total amount of outstanding mortgage lending by the 33
institutions covered in the survey rose by 1.4 percent in December
to 272.7 billion HK dollars. The adjusted growth rate is above the
monthly average of 1.2 percent over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
David Carse, deputy chief executive of HKMA said: "The higher
growth rate of loans in December largely reflects the drawdown of
loans associated with the increased property transactions in the
preceding month."
</P>
<P>
Lending for the purchase of properties in China edged up 0.5
percent to 5.3 billion HK dollars in December, when gross loans
decreased both in number and in amount.

<HEADLINE> Head of Palestine National Council Allowed to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres has approved the return of the Head of the Palestine
National Council (PNC), Abdel Hamid Sayeh, to east Jerusalem,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was taken for humanitarian reasons, was
based on recommendations of security officials, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The move also came against the backdrop of the just-concluded
Palestinian elections. At a cabinet meeting Sunday, Israel's
Ministerial Committee on Security decided to allow all PNC
members to return to Palestinian territories. The PNC, the
Palestinian parliament-in-exile, has some 500 members.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the PNC is supposed to
reconvene to annul the clauses of the Palestinian Covenant that
call for destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres told reporters here Sunday that Israel cannot expect the
PNC "to change the covenant without giving those who have to make
the decision the chance to come and to express their opinions."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported, Bassam Abu-Sharif, who was once a
strong advocator of eliminating Israel and later became the
foremost PLO spokesman for Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation in
the months before the Oslo negotiations, is expected to return
from Jordan today.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Sharif escaped death in 1972 when a book on South American
guerrilla leader Che Guevara, which was sent to him by the
Mossad, exploded in his face, blinded him in one eye, deafened
him in one ear, and tore off two fingers and the thumb of his
right hand.
</P>
<P>
After recovery, Abu-Sharif decided that violence was not the
way. From then on, he encouraged contact with Israelis. In 1993,
Abu-Sharif began talking about a Gaza-Jericho solution.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Israeli Television Monday night, he
said he supports changing the Palestinian Covenant.

<HEADLINE> National Science and Technology Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,600 Chinese scientists
involved in 795 projects have been declared winners of the 1995
National Science and Technology Awards, a high-ranking official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan, secretary-general of the State Science and Technology
Commission, said the awards include 57 National Natural Science
Prizes, 131 National Invention Prizes, and 607 National Scientific
and Technological Advance Prizes (NSTA).
</P>
<P>
Included among the NSTA prize winners were three American
scholars, S.S. Chern, Tsung Dao Lee, Chen Ning Yang, the British
scholar Joseph Needham, a German intellectual property right
expert, and Japanese rice expert Hara Shoichi.
</P>
<P>
First prize and special prize winners in National Natural
Sciences remained vacant as they did in 1994, showing, according
to Lin Quan, that no breakthroughs have been made in the natural
sciences in recent years by Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
A technique used in cracking heavy oil and for developing a
catalytic agent was chosen as the only winner of the first prize
in National Invention for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Two techniques were selected for NSTA special prizes, one of
which was an Optimized Production System for the Baoshan Iron and
Steel Co., China's most advanced iron and steel producer.
</P>
<P>
The Electronic Chinese-character Typesetting and Publishing
System developed by the Founder Co. was among the 25 NSTA first
prizes.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,920 technological achievements that were
recommanded by provincial governments, ministries, and the armed
forces for consideration by the National Office for Science and
Technology for the awards.
</P>
<P>
The 167 technological advances used for national security and
national defense that received awards will be announced to a
restricted number of departments.
</P>
<P>
A national conference will be held later this month in Beijing,
where the awards are expected to be presented, and where Chinese
leaders Jiang Zemin and Li Peng are scheduled to meet with prize
winners.

<HEADLINE> HK Soccer Team Starts Training for Asia Cup Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Crippled though the newly
named Hong Kong soccer team may have been by a boycott launched by
nine rebel senior clubs, it started training this morning for the
Asian Cup Group Two qualifying rounds slated here just a week
away.
</P>
<P>
The other teams in the group are China, Macao and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Of the Hong Kong team's 24 players, hand-picked late on Monday
by the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA), 21 were present for
the opening session today of their week-long training. But five
of them did not take the field due to injuries.
</P>
<P>
All the three absentees belong to the rebel First Division
clubs, members of the Association of Hong Kong Professional
Football Clubs (AHKPFC), which, in a defiant move last week,
decided to boycott the local governing body.
</P>
<P>
The AHKPFC, which consists of nine out of Hong Kong's 10 senior
clubs, said it would neither release their players for the Hong
Kong team nor compete in any future HKFA-organized competitions.
</P>
<P>
The professional organization is asking for swift reforms on
the side of the HKFA, claiming the organization had been run by "a
group of amateurs".
</P>
<P>
"Many clubs believe the HKFA should compensate them for taking
their players for international duties," said Tony Siew, manager
of the rebel club Uhlsport Rangers.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly wouldn't be asking Rangers players not to play for
Hong Kong, but if some clubs were not willing to pay the wages of
players who are absent, you can't blame the players for deciding
not to join in the Hong Kong team," he added.
</P>
<P>
And the rebel clubs are refusing to provide a coach for the
Hong Kong side. The HKFA responded by calling two junior coaches
to guide the Hong Kong side.
</P>
<P>
The newcomers are LO Kwok-wah, a former Hong Kong team striker
who now coaches the Hong Kong's youth team, and Yuen Kuen-to, a
former Hong Kong team's goalkeeper who is now coaching the Hong
Kong women's side.
</P>
<P>
And, due to a delay caused by such a confusion, the team has
called off a planned training trip to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We have only one week's time before the qualifying tournament
and that is surely not enough for making any dramatic change of
the shape of the team," said Lo after this morning's training.
</P>
<P>
"Technically Hong Kong players are by no means weaker than
their Japanese or South Korean counterparts. Our guys are only
weaker physically," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What I can do now is to make the utmost of the short period of
time and try to improve the players' fitness and their team work,"
added Lo.

HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) today ended the second round of its experts
meeting on the handover ceremony which marks the transfer of the
political power of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after the meeting, Zhao Jihua,
senior Chinese representative to the JLG, said both sides handled
the meeting in earnest and with a realistic approach, and they had
deeper discussions this time in comparison with the first round.
</P>
<P>
He said they found that both sides were very close to each
other on many issues, and achieved common views on some of the
issues discussed. However, he said, some issues needed further
exploration by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that the handover ceremony involves many issues and no
specific results can be expected through only one or two meetings.
</P>
<P>
British Senior Representative Hugh Davies said that both sides
worked very hard at the meeting and there were already some
elements of common ground between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Former PM to Run for Head of Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Girija Prasad Koirala,
Nepal's former prime minister and leader of the ruling Nepali
Congress (NC), today announced that he would run for the NC's
presidency at the forthcoming party convention.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told a press conference that he had won the support of
NC President incumbent Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.
</P>
<P>
He said that as Nepal's lingering political transition is
leading to tendencies of violence, instability and unrest, the
responsibility to avert such a danger falls on the NC's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
The NC formed a coalition government under the 51-year-old Sher
Bahadur Deuba last September with the National Democratic Party
and the Nepal Goodwill Party to replace the minority Communist
government.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, 72, is believed to remain influential within his party
after the fall of his government, which was said to be mainly
caused by a intra-party rift between factions loyal to him and to
NC President Bhattarai.
</P>
<P>
An NC spokesman said Monday that he expected Koirala to be
elected unanimously as the new president at the NC's general
convention scheduled for the end of March.

MACAO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government's budget
rises by 4.2 percent in 1996 to reach 9.585 billion patacas (1.20
billion US dollars), said the latest issue of a government Gazette
supplement.
</P>
<P>
The budget, approved by the Macao Legislative Assembly last
month, will favor such fields as education, health and social
welfare, said the report.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 billion patacas (200 million US dollars) of the
budget are earmarked for the government's annual fund of
investment and development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The supplement said that about 73 percent of the government's
income would come from direct taxes, including those from gambling
franchise taxation that is estimated at 5.55 billion patacas (694
million US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Boasting some eight million travelers last year, tourism is
another leading source of income for the tiny region, over which
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Statement Backing Charges Against Indian PM Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- India's Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) today released a statement by a key dealer in the
Hawala scandal that supports the opposition's charges against
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
BJP's parliamentary leader, Atal Behari Vajpayee, gave the
press the purported statement made by dealer S.K. Jain to the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in which Jain claimed that
he paid 3.55 crore rupees (about 992,000 US dollars) to Rao and
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told a press conference that he was releasing the
statement to substantiate his earlier allegation of Rao's
receiving money from the Jain brothers to engineer defection of
other parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition leader, this statement of S.K. Jain
was recorded as early as on March 11, 1995, by the CBI, who chose
to keep the statement for almost ten months from both the Supreme
Court and the charge sheets filed so far.
</P>
<P>
The BJP leader demanded the publication of a progress report of
the CBI's investigation, which, according to him, contained all
the details of S.K. Jain's deposition.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that full facts be placed before the Supreme
Court so that the real culprits could be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
According to CBI's investigation report, Rao's name was not
listed in a diary found in S.K. Jain's residence in 1991. The
diary has a list of politicians receiving kickbacks from the Jain
brothers.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Ousts Sanchez at Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chanda Rubin beat third seed
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in maybe the longest match in the history
of the Australian Open in Melbourne tonight.
</P>
<P>
In a quarter-final match that lasted almost four and half
hours, the 19-year-old American squeezed off Sanchez of Spain by
6-4, 2-6 and 16-14.
</P>
<P>
The third set went on 30 games and two hours and 30 minutes,
with Rubin fighting to break deuce in most of her serving games.
</P>
<P>
Each of them broke the other's service twice before Rubin
wrapped up the match in the 30th game by breaking Sanchez' service
once more.
</P>
<P>
The 14,000 spectators at the center court at Flinders Park in
Melbourne were standing and chanting, staking their support
behind Rubin, a 13th seed fighting against the former world No.1.
</P>
<P>
Rubin hid her trademark smile and smashed winners with a sure
hand. She is famous of playing long matches. But this one is even
longer than her record of a 2-hour-5-minute match at Wimbledon
last year.
</P>
<P>
Worse, there were a lot of troubles with the calling of lines,
and her rival Sanchez hanged on well. Rubin saw three match points
pass her before seizing the fourth.
</P>
<P>
She is not a player to wait for her opponent to make
errors. She smashed the lobs sent by Sanchez and made a point from
every of them except one or two shots that went wide.
</P>
<P>
The spectators were anxious to see the end of the
match. Someone among the crowd shouted:"We want Agassi!" American
world No.2 Andre Agassi would fight against compatriot Jim Courier
in the following match on the center court. This was going to be a
match determining who is world No.1.
</P>
<P>
Apparently exhausted and dehydrated, Rubin stuck to every point
against Sanchez, who is known for her fitness and performance in
five-set matches in WTA championships.
</P>
<P>
At last, Rubin made the largest upset in the tournament today,
passing the third seed and going on to the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
She will play Monica Seles, the current world No.1 and winner
of three Australian Open titles, in the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Electoral Commission Scales Down Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman of the Sirra
Leonean Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC), Dr James
Jonah, announced on Tuesday that the commission has scaled down
its budget from 10 million U.S. dollars to 9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Up to "the moment", 6.7 million dollars have been received
with the bulk of funding coming from Britain and the Sierra Leone
government, which has contributed 1,1 million or so dollars in
local currency, the chairman told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"It is the shortfall of 3.7 million dollars that is giving
INEC an headache," the chairman said, indicating the donor
community has not yet provided enough funding.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether or not the February 26 elections could be
postponed if the expected funds were not received from the
international donor community, including the European Union (EU),
Jonah said, "they will not but what we shall have will be a shaky
election."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the election date has been signed by the
head of state, Brigadier Julius Maada Bio. That's "an indication
that the elections remain on course," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jonah's announcement is also a rejection to the call for an
election postponement from the country's rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
"What guarantee do we have if we suspend the elections, the
RUF will end its tyranny and destruction of lives and property?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that a United Nations team arrived here last
Saturday "to coordinate the list of international observers to
monitor the elections".

<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that it is imperative to wipe out all the armed forces
of Chechen rebels "unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
Although "the danger of the disintegration of Russia has gone,"
it is "necessary to unconditionally and harshly stamp out all the
rebel bases and liquidate the (rebel) armed groups, their leaders"
and all those hostage-takers, Yeltsin told the first meeting of
the new Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We are able to weaken the separatist moods and strengthen
Russia's integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the solution to the Chechen problem
presupposes further social consolidation on the basis of dialogues
among all the Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
The solution also depends on what treaty Moscow and Grozny can
reach on the republic's status within Russia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the lawmakers of the upper chamber to take a
"realistic approach" to the Chechen problem and promised to offer
various assistance to the war-torn north Caucasian republic.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Raw Wool Export up 31 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's raw wool export
increased by 31 percent during July-December of 1995, as compared
to the same period in 1994, the local newspaper "The Dawn"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics, Pakistan exported 3,309 metric tons of raw wool worth
5.46 million US dollars in the last six months of 1995, as against
2,318 metric tons worth 4.17 million dollars in the corresponding
period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason for the increase is the slightly higher raw
wool prices in New Zealand, the main exporter of wool, that forced
buyers to import from Pakistan," said Amanullah Farooq, chairman
of the Pakistan wool and Hair Exporters Association.
</P>
<P>
He said a seven percent devaluation of Pakistan's currency
rupee against the US dollar announced by the government last
October gave a further flip to the export in terms of value.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Rabin's Murderer Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Yigal Amir, who
murdered Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on November 4,
resumed today in Tel Aviv District Court.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the court rejected a petition from Amir's lawyers
for a postponement of the trial.
</P>
<P>
In the court this morning, Amir admitted that he fired the
fatal shots which killed Rabin, but he said that he did not
intend to kill "Rabin the man," but "Rabin the Prime Minister."
</P>
<P>
Amir said that he aimed his first shot at Rabin's spine to
wound him, but he made sure he fired another two shots. The
25-year-old law student added that he did not intend to wound one
of Rabin's bodyguards who was injuried by one of the three shots.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amir denied that his brother Haggai and another
suspected accomplice Dror Adani were involved in the conspiracy,
but admitted that they had discussed the matter. Amir also
admitted that Haggai made changes to the bullets he fired.
</P>
<P>
Completing his statement, Amir said he did not regret the
assassination of Rabin. Immediately after he murdered Rabin, Amir
said that he killed him because he gave Israeli land away to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
One of Amir's lawyer Mordechai Offri told the court today that
he was quitting the defense of Amir.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of murder, Amir faces a mandatory life sentence.
But if the court finds him guilty of a lesser offensive
manslaughter, he could get up to 20 years in jail.

<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Makro, the largest Dutch retail
store chain, has forged a partnership with two Philippine firms to
open 10 wholesale stores in the Philippines over the next five
years, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture of Pilipinas Makro Inc. (PMI) teams up SHV
Holdings N.V. -- Makro's parent firm -- with Ayala Land Inc. and
Shoemart Investment Corp., the two largest Philippine shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
PMI President Luis Maranon said today that the new venture
would set up at least two stores per year in strategic locations
in the country over the next five years to distribute goods and
merchandise under the modern wholesale club format.
</P>
<P>
With an initial capitalization of two billion pesos (80 million
US dollars), the company plans to open its first outlet in the
first quarter of 1995, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are putting more money in this area and the Philippines is
part of our overall strategic plan for the region," said Maranon.
</P>
<P>
Makro operates about 150 stores in 20 countries, including
eight in Thailand, six in Indonesia, four in Malaysia and one in
South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Disarmament Opens 1996 Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament,
the world's single multilateral negotiating body on disarmament,
opens its 1996 session here today, with an agenda focusing on the
on-going negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Starting on January 1994, the talks on nuclear test ban treaty
is likely to be intensive this year because all 38 members of the
Conference on Disarmament have expressed their support for a
completion of the negotiations no later than 1996.
</P>
<P>
To meet this objective, huge efforts would be needed because
negotiators have to iron out a large number of outstanding issues
concerning the scope of a test ban, the verification system, the
institutional framework and how many signatories will be needed
for the treaty's entry into force.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are about 1,200 "disputed provisions"
in the rolling draft text of the treaty to be resolved during the
24-week negotiating session of the Conference.
</P>
<P>
Another disputed issue likely to draw much attention at the
start of the Conference is the expansion of its membership.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament adopted a decision in September
last year to allow 23 countries to become its new members "at the
earliest possible date to be decided by the Conference".
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly, at its recent 50th session, urged
that the 23 countries should all assume membership of the
Conference of Disarmament at the start of its 1996 session.
</P>
<P>
However, membership of one of the 23, namely that of Iraq, is
likely to face strong resistance from the Unites States who insist
that as a country still under U.N. sanctions, Iraq should not be
allowed in.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament now consists of the five declared
nuclear weapon states, other militarily significant states, as
well as neutral and non-aligned countries which form the Group of
21 in the Conference.

MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The gross international reserves

In a short span of 23 days, the country's GIR increased by 386

<HEADLINE> Jordan Halves Export for Oil to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's exports to Iraq in
return for oil will be halved to 200 million U.S. dollars in
fiscal 1996 because of the nearly 1.2 billion dollars in
accumulated Iraqi debts to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Official sources confirmed that Jordan and Iraq had reached an
agreement to this effect during a meeting between the ministers of
trade of the two countries when they met last week to discuss the
annual bilateral trade accord, according to the English-language
daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The move to reduce the flow of goods, maily food and medicine,
in return for oil came amid signs that Iraq might be willing to
consider a United Nations' offer for limited oil sales to raise
funds for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources stressed that the decision had no
political bearings and was based on a consideration of the
mounting Iraqi debts to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Jordanian businessmen were quoted by the daily
as saying that Jordan's exports-for-cash to Iraq will not be
affected by the latest move.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview today, a diplomat in the Iraqi embassy
here also confirmed to Xinhua the local reports, but he declined
to give any detail.
</P>
<P>
Under the permission of U.N. Security Council, the Kingdom
imports about 50,000 barrels of crude and 25,000 barrels of fuel
oil from Iraq every day to meet its increasingly needs in part
settlement of Baghdad's debts to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Jordan's decision to halve its
exports for oil to Iraq resulted from the Kingdom's strenuous
efforts to seek alternative oil supplier in case of Iraq's
retaliation since General Hussein Kamel, son-in-law of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, defected to Jordan last August.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia promises to meet the oil needs of Jordan during
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal al-Saud's visit to
the Kingdom earlier this month prompted Amman to take the bold
step to cut its exports to Iraq by half, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Since the defection of the former Iraqi minister, Jordan
changed drastically its tilt toward Iraq and called for a change
of political setup in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's relations with Gulf Arab countries had been strained
since the 1990 Gulf crisis for its stance toward Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, and their ties began to improve after the kingdom
granted asylum to the defected Iraqi officials last August.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Price Inflation Going Down In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer price inflation in
Hong Kong came to the third consecutive month of moderation in
December 1995, according to the latest government release.
</P>
<P>
Consumer Price Index A, which covers 50 percent households in
the territory whose monthly expenditures are between 3,900 and
16,000 HK dollars, scaled down to 6.6 percent last December. The
index, a main indicator of HK's consumer price inflation, stood at
8.4 percent in October last year and shed to 8.2 percent in
November.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Census and Statistics Department
show that moderation was also recorded in Consumer Price Index B,
which calculates households with expenditures between 16,000 and
28,500 HK dollars each month. The index B, covering 30 percent of
the total households, rose by 7.3 percent in December, down one
percentage point from November.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped to 7.9 percent
in December, from 8.9 percent in the previous month. It is based
on the expenditure pattern of 10 percent households, who have
monthly expenditures ranging from 28,500 to 61,000 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The five percent richest and the five percent poorest
households are not included in the calculation of Consumer Price
Indices.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI, which is based on the combined expenditure
pattern of all households, had a less rapid year-on-year increase
of 7.2 percent, against 8.4 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Most components in CPI (A), including foodstuffs, outer
clothing, housing rentals and some Chinese newspapers, recorded
decreases in their prices. Some commodities registered slower
price hike than the overall average for December 1995 over the
same period of 1994, such as food, durable goods, alcoholic drinks
and tobacco, as well as fuel and light.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today hailed the upgrading of the country's credit rating to the
"investment grade" by the Japan Credit Rating (JCR) Agency Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The "investment grade" rating, signifying sufficient protection
from risks of default, is the minimum rating required by banks and
insurance authorities for prudent investment.
</P>
<P>
The rating granted to the Philippines considerably broadens the
pool of funds that the country could tap to finance its various
undertakings as it lowers the cost of capital, said Ramos.
</P>
<P>
This is the first "investment grade" rating assigned to the
Philippines since the country regained access to the international
voluntary capital markets in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The JCR attributed the upgrade to the Philippines' political
stability, macroeconomic balance, and outward-looking
market-friendly reforms.

<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain is pressing Canada to
decide on the purchase of four British Upholder-class
diesel-electric submarines, according to a Financial Times report
today.
</P>
<P>
British government sources have made it clear that if Canada
did not want to strike the deal worth 294 million U.S. dollars,
Britain was planning to open talks with Portugal.
</P>
<P>
UK-Canadian talks on the submarines have dragged on for 16
months, but the Canadian government remained reluctant to decide
whether spending on the defense contracts would be politically
acceptable or not, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Upholder-class submarines, which are much quieter than
nuclear submarines, would be used by the Canadians partly for
coastal patrol, including surveillance of the disputed North
Atlantic fishing areas, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canadian Defense Minister David Collenette had
reportedly won support of a majority of his cabinet colleagues for
the submarines deal.
</P>
<P>
Collenette argued that the purchase would not require any extra
budget allocation and it would be financed partly by savings on
refitting the existing Oberon-class vessels.

WUHAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
used about 500 million US dollars in overseas investment last
year, even though the number of new foreign-funded enterprises was
slashed nearly by half to 678.

The amount of overseas investment last year increased by 14

The number of joint ventures went down because of declining

considering the market potential, rich resources and relatively
cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
To date, about 20 of the global top 500 enterprises have
established joint ventures here, and about 20 others have set up
representative offices, with dozens of projects negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Japan's NEC established a mobile telephone joint venture here
last year. The venture turned out 50,000 mobile telephones and
yielded about 17 million US dollars-worth of sales.
</P>
<P>
The province benefited from co-operation with the
multinationals. To date, it has set up three automobile joint
ventures with foreign partners, spurring the local auto-parts
industry.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Opens Upper House Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today opened the first meeting of the new Federation Council, the
upper house of Parliament, hoping that the upper chamber will
cooperate with him and the government.
</P>
<P>
The 178-member Federation Council with almost two-thirds being
new faces includes the heads of legislative and executive bodies
of the subjects of the Russian Federation, or the presidents or
parliament chiefs of local republics and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen Republic is being represented for the first time by
its head Doku Zavgayev and its parliament chief Amin Osmayev. The
upper house also includes for the first time the mayors of Moscow
and St. Petersburg, which are directly subordinated to the central
authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources here, the lawmakers of the
upper chamber will elect their speaker at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The voting will be secret. Yegor Stroyev, head of the Oryol
Regional Administration, is one of the candidates to the post of
upper house chairman. He is reportedly Yeltsin's first choice for
the post.
</P>
<P>
They are also to decide matters linked with the structure and
procedural rules of the new Upper Chamber, endorse the
compositions of its committees and commissions, decide the
periodicity of its meetings and functions of its apparatus, and
adopt a document on the work of its members and their assistants.
</P>
<P>
The new State Duma, or the lower house of the Russian
Parliament, already began its work last week by electing its
leadership headed by communist Gennady Seleznyov.

<HEADLINE> British Economy Grows 2.6 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economy expanded at
the slowest rate in three years in the last quarter of 1995,
making less impressive result of economy for the whole year,
according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) today.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 0.4 percent during the
last quarter, and 1.8 percent year-on-year. This compared with
3.8, 2.8 and 2.1 percent annual growth rates in the previous three
quarters, suggesting the slowdown had taken shape.
</P>
<P>
The growth in 1995 as a whole was 2.6 percent, much lower than
the 4.1 percent level in 1994.
</P>
<P>
While manufacturing industry struggled to clear stocks because
of deteriorating conditions at home and abroad, the service
industry continued its boom, picking up 0.7 percent on the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The service industry, including banking and tourism, has
accounted for two-thirds of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The figures vindicated the decision by finance minister Kenneth
Clarke to cut the interest rates by a quarter point earlier this
month, to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed that with the latest figures confirming the
trend, the government would cut the interest rates again in near
future to meet the growth target.
</P>
<P>
The economy has grown for 15 successive quarters. GDP has
climbed by 10.3 percent since the recession in early 1990s, and is
6.2 percent higher than in the second quarter of 1990, at the
height of the last boom.

<HEADLINE> Large Commercial Conglomerates Envisaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a number
of huge state-owned commercial conglomerates in the coming five to
ten years by merging and other means, to cope with fiercer
competition both in the domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Under a plan drawn up by the Ministry of Internal Trade, the
envisaged commercial conglomerates will each have annual sales
worth at least five billion yuan (about 602 million US dollars)
and the materials distribution groups will each have more than 50
billion yuan in annual sales, according to Minister of Internal
Trade Chen Bangzhu.
</P>
<P>
Though state-owned commercial businesses are still the mainstay
under the existing market economic framework, they can no longer
merely rely on traditional planning but have to face tough market
competition. However, the present state-run distribution sector
lacks big competitive enterprises, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
In order to change this situation, the minister called
representatives of large and medium-sized state distribution
enterprises to a national commodity circulation meeting which
opened here today to focus on conglomerate and chain-store
operations.
</P>
<P>
Commercial enterprises can invest or buy equities in industrial
businesses to form commercial and industrial groups, the minister
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The commercial businesses in coastal, river and frontier
regions can take advantage of their own geographical advantages to
form trans-regional groups.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises of different trades and industries can be merged to
form integrated enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, large commercial businesses can make full use of their
reputation and market sources to develop chain operations, the
minister told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"These conglomerates should establish a perfect
parent-subsidiary structure linked up by the tie of assets", the
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged several existing conglomerates directly under the
ministry to take the lead in perfecting the structure and further
probe large-scale development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting did not release figures of the conglomerates
already established but said that over 400 chain-operation
corporations, with over 6,000 chain stores, have been set up.

<HEADLINE> Policy Bank Provides Firm Backing for Large Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than half of China's large
and medium-sized capital construction projects benefitted from
loans provided by the State Development Bank (SDB) last year,
according to a senior bank official.
</P>
<P>
Bank President Yao Zhenyan told a working meeting of the bank
here today that 82 billion yuan (about 980 million US dollars) out
of the 87.3 billion yuan in loans extended by the bank was used to
finance 381 large and medium-sized projects, which accounted for
56 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Of the projects, 116 were state key items, about 70 percent of
the national total, Yao said, adding that those supported by the
bank included the second phase of the Qinshan Nuclear Power
Station, the Three Gorges Dam Project and the Beijing-Kowloon
Railway line.
</P>
<P>
The SDB, one of the three policy-oriented banks established in
1994, sharply increased its financial support for agriculture last
year, with loans to the sector up by 50 percent to 8.85 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Geographically, the bank leaned more toward the
relatively-less-developed areas in central and western China. Yao
said that loans to these areas totalled 58.4 billion yuan in 1995,
about 67 percent of the bank's lending volume last year.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his bank also made "substantial
progress" in expanding its international business, with loan
contracts worth 3.427 billion US dollars for a total of 16
projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with approval from the central financial authorities,
the bank will establish its first batch of subsidiaries this year,
Yao revealed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand to Build Its Own Merchant Fleet (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is drawing an
ambitious plan for its own merchant fleet in a bid to ease the
country's almost total dependence on foreign-owned vessels to
transport its exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from Thai economic sectors endorsed a package of tax
incentives and a proposal to seek funds to create the country's
first national fleet at their working meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The tax incentives include exemptions from duty on the purchase
of large cargo vessels, rentals of vessels, and sales of old
vessels to buy new ones.
</P>
<P>
the incentives, originally proposed by the Transport and
Communications Ministry, also will grant special privileges to
Thai shipping companies offering sea transport services.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which will go to the cabinet for approval,
Thailand will set up a committee to study the establishment of a
national fleet fund and related institutions.
</P>
<P>
The plan came also as a measure to contain the country's huge
current-account deficit. Thai spending on freight costs, some 160
billion baht (6.4 billion US dollars) per year, is a major
contributor to the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Expressing support to the plan, Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa stressed the country's need for its own merchant fleet
to ease the deficit paid out to foreign-owned vessels.
</P>
<P>
If the plan is implemented, Banharn said, Thailand could
capture an 18 percent market share from foreign vessels over the
next four or five years, and 25 percent within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Some senior Thai officials also extended their support to the
merchant fleet development plan.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Chaipak Siriwat
noted that without its own fleet, Thailand has no bargaining power
with international shippers.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Surakiart Sathirathai said he even backed an
idea for an exemption from personal income tax for crewmen and
from tax payments by Thai investors at places where vessels are
bought.
</P>
<P>
Thailand lost some 130 billion baht (5.2 billion dollars) in
freight charges to foreign vessels in 1994. A Thai government
spokesman said that by 2001, the figure will reach 254.7 billion
baht (10.2 billion dollars) if nothing is done.
</P>
<P>
Under the merchant fleet development plan, the country needs to
invest 5.6 billion baht (0.2 billion dollars) in fleet development
in the current fiscal year to increase its market share from the
current 10 percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 1997 and 2001, another 42 billion baht (1.7 billion
dollars) will be needed to increase its market share to 18
percent, and 156 billion baht (6.2 billion dollars) more are
needed to increase the share to 25 percent by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Besides the funding problem, the Thai government is also
considering any possible impact of the tax incentives on the
country's whole taxation system.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the plan, no matter whether it will be
approved by the full cabinet or not, will give a boost to the
formation of the country's national merchant fleet.

the economic growth, the share of China's military spending in its
GDP and budget is actually on the decline."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it is groundless to say that China's
economic growth would pose a threat and China is increasing its

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government hopes
that the international community should offer aid to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to help the country
tide over the food shortage.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made here today by Chinese Foreign Ministry

<HEADLINE> Leading Paper Lauds New Model Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The nationally distributed
"Guangming Daily" has frontpaged a lengthy story, introducing a
new figure who embodies the ideals of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
He is an officer serving with the Beijing Military Area
Command, who has led his troops to dig wells in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a desert area.
</P>
<P>
Local residents call Regimental Commander Li Guoan the "God of
Water", as he has helped them get water to drink and get rid of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
In peacetime China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has the
responsibility to help local people develop their economy.
</P>
<P>
Li, 50, has led a water-supply regiment creating scores of
miracles in many places in the desert where experts had concluded
that no water existed.
</P>
<P>
The officer was received by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
1993 for his deeds. Jiang highly praised his activities, which, he
said, had demonstrated the Party's lofty doctrine of serving the
people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
Li is so popular among the local people that they always burst
into applause when they see his jeep coming, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Houyaozi was a village where people had stored rain water for
drinking for thousands of years. Then there came Li and his young
soldiers in 1990. They forthwith launched a precise
investigation. One month later, a well containing fresh water was
dug.
</P>
<P>
"We will forever remember the kindness of the Party and the
PLA," the paper quoted the villagers as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Li's health deteriorated in the midst of his strenuous
work, and he was finally forced to recuperate in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Tianshuijing, or "Sweet Well", is a new place name added to the
map of China. It was named after a well dug by Li and his men.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also published a commentary on Li's deeds, urging
the whole Party to learn from this hero and serve the people
wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
What Li has done will serve as instructional material for
people who are used to comfortable conditions, particularly for
those officials who seek their own interests by abusing their
administrative powers, the commentary stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li Guoan's selflessness is a spiritual treasure of great value
in building the socialist market economy, it explained.
</P>
<P>
It has long been a tradition for the Chinese media to publicize
certain heroes or models to help improve the ethics of the nation
of 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
There have been many examples in this respect, including the
famous Lei Feng in the 1960s, also a selfless soldier, and Kong
Fansen in the 1990s, a Party official.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Tap Japanese Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will be ready to
tap the Japanese bond market after it received an upgrade of its
credit rating from the Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR).
</P>
<P>
The JCR has upgraded its credit rating on Philippine
foreign-currency-denominated bonds from BB to BBB-, which is an
investment rating.
</P>
<P>
The JCR attributed its credit rating upgrade to the
accomplishments of the Ramos administration in achieving political
stability and macroeconomic balance and in implementing
outward-looking and market-friendly reforms.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo today welcomed the credit
rating upgrade, noting that "it is a fair assessment that reflects
what has been achieved by the government so far."
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed the government's plan to tap the Japanese
bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance had been studying the possibility of
floating a "samurai" bond, but had put off such a floatation until
it could secure a credit rating upgrade.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said that tapping the yen bond market at this time
will enable the country to take advantage of the prevailing low
rates in the yen bond markets to refinance its existing debt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, market analysts noted that the JCR credit rating
upgrade is also expected to encourage higher levels of portfolio
and direct foreign investments from Japan.
</P>
<P>
It also provides opportunities for the private sector to tap
the yen bond market, they added.

<HEADLINE> Sun Island in Harbin Becomes Major Winter Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sun Island, a famous summer
resort in this capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
has become a major winter attraction for holiday-makers.
</P>
<P>
The island, which was seldom frequented by visitors several
years ago, is receiving more tourists as the 96' Asian Winter
Games to be held in the city in February draws nearer, according
to Zhang Yawei, director of the Sun Island Park Management Office.
</P>
<P>
Every day over 5,000 people including many from the southern
part of the country go sightseeing on the island in the middle of
the Songhuajiang River flowing through the city, although the
temperature is now as low as minus 30 degrees, zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On the island, tourists can visit the snow carvings shows, go
skiing, snow-sliding or ride deer-pulled sledges and trains on
snow.
</P>
<P>
Several international and national snow carving competitions
have been held over the past few years in the park, he said,
adding that during the competitions 119 pieces of snow carvings
have been made, using 7,600 cu m of snow.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also attributed his park's current flourishing to the
installation of foreign snow-making equipment in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"Snow carvings made from artificial snow which are harder and
lustrous can last about 40 days, 20 days longer than that made
with natural snow," he said.

<HEADLINE> Curfew Lifted in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The new military regime in
the west African state of Sierra Leone has ended the midnight to
dawn curfew imposed six days ago, state radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The curfew was first imposed on January 16 running from 7 p m
to 6 a m as a sequel to the "palace coup" which toppled former
head of state, Captain Valentine Strasser and sent him into
forced exile in neighbouring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, west African diplomats said here today that a "high
degree of hope" is now prevalent in Sierra Leone after the
Revolutionary United Front (ruf), which has been waging a
five-year war, announced Monday it has "withdrawn" all
preconditions "for talks with the new military government" of
Brigadier Julius Maada Bio.
</P>
<P>
Ruf spokesman Fayia Musa, speaking from Cote D'Ivoire, was
quoted in an interview with the BBC Focus on Africa as saying
"the war council, the combatants and all civilians in the ruf-sl
have agreed now to meet and have dialogue with the military
administration anytime, anywhere convenient and as determined by
the two parties."
</P>
<P>
According to Musa, "the idea of having previous conditions
fulfilled before dialogue with the military government has been
dropped."
</P>
<P>
The ruf in its previous demands has asked for the withdrawal
of foreign troops (Nigerian and Guinean) as well as the South
African expeditionary force, the Executive Outcomes "before any
dialogue can start."
</P>
<P>
Government officials reacting to the announcement said today
the "olive branch (from the ruf) is welcomed" but declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
"We are also prepared to provide documents to facilitate the
travelling of any ruf group to any country for talks," a senior
government official added.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here called the ruf move "a great relief"
while African diplomats see the statement as "a concession which
if maintained can see peace within weeks."
</P>
<P>
Election officials however said they are studying the ruf's
call "for elections (due February 26) to be postponed until we
restore peace which is a primary issue now."
</P>
<P>
Musa said in the radio interview "we want the elections to be
postponed so that we can have time to restore peace in the
country."
</P>
<P>
"If elections come now, the government that is coming in will
definitely have problems again because we have not come to terms
yet," Musa added.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission last week extended the registration
of voters to January 31, saying that registration in "some parts
of the western area (which includes the capital) and the south of
the country has not been completed."
</P>
<P>
The commission also asked the 15 political parties to "list
the names of 60 candidates each for the general elections" with
the deadline for presentation of the list billed for yesterday.
</P>
<P>
There has not been any reaction so far from the political
parties on the ruf call for the elections to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, local journalists in Bo in the south
reported today that commercial vehicles carrying consumer goods
to the interior are plying the strategic mile 91 highway "without
being attacked."
</P>
<P>
"Over 300 vehicles as well as taxis and private cars have
arrived in Bo within the past three days unescorted," one radio
journalist said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Their arrival has greatly reduced the possible starvation that
is creeping in and prices of most goods including rice, cassava
and yam have dropped," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several commuters reported graffiti writings on the tarmac on
the main roads at Masiaka, 47 miles from the capital and mile 91,
both hotbeds of rebel attacks in the past.
</P>
<P>
Some of the writings which began to appear on Sunday read, "we
are now ready for peace," "ruf has ended the war," and "no more
ruf attacks."

<HEADLINE> You're Never Too Old to Fly a Kite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- After a heavy snowfall the
temperature dropped to minus 20 degrees, although the day was
sunny. After lunch Zhou Jianhua, 67, took one of his favorite
kites to join other kite-flying fans in a local square.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a retired primary school teacher in this capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province, has been engaged in this pastime
for nine years.
</P>
<P>
"I come to the square to fly a kite for one or two hours almost
every day," he said, while pulling vigorously on the string
attached to his 10-m-long dragon-shaped kite.
</P>
<P>
The glove on his right hand has been worn out. "I need at least
four pairs of gloves to last the winter," he said.
</P>
<P>
This winter dozens of senior local citizens have been gathering
in Dizhegong Square in the center of the city every day to fly
kites, which is a traditional spring activity in China.
</P>
<P>
"Flying kites is specially suitable for old people as it does
not involve too much movement," a 68-year-old man surnamed Liu
said. "It is good for the brain and eyes, as well as for the
respiratory, digestive and circulatory systems."
</P>
<P>
Liu, a professor at a local medical school, took up flying
kites after retirement. He made a 20-m-long centipede-shaped kite
himself, which took him nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
Another man, who used to suffer from cervical vertebra
hyperplasia, began to fly kites last September and found that the
pain in his neck gradually disappeared.
</P>
<P>
"If I refrain from flying my kite for only a few days, the pain
will worsen," he said.
</P>
<P>
After an hour or so Zhou and other old people tie the strings
of their kites to the trunks of trees and have a half-hour break,
when they mostly discuss their favorite hobby, leaving their kites
floating high in the sky.
</P>
<P>
Song Dianchang, 70, told how he once had to jump on a bicycle
and chase his kite when it blew away.

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia is to produce
more desalinated water to meet growing needs in water and
electricity in that country, a Saudi Arabian official said.
</P>
<P>
Fahd bin Suleiman al Ghunaim, senior official from the Saudi
General Establishment for Water Desalination, said the kingdom

total output of desalinated water, reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the number one desalinated water producer in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is building four new hydro-electric stations to
boost total production to some three billion liters per day and
add a further 4,500 megawatts for electricity, the official said.
</P>
<P>
New power and water ventures in Saudi Arabia are also under
studying, he added.

According to an action plan drawn up by the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI), direct air links between Manila and Phnom Penh
are crucial in enhancing economic and trade ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines will propose the forging of the air pact in
scheduled talks with Cambodia later this year to facilitate the
flow of goods and investments.
</P>
<P>
However, to successfully carve a niche in the growing Cambodian
market, the Philippines must counter stiff competition from
Cambodia's immediate neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Towards this end, the action plan proposes the formation of a
joint commission for bilateral cooperation, similar to the one
established with Vietnam, to oversee that all existing bilateral
agreements are carried out.
</P>
<P>
With Cambodia's investment climate regarded as "risky" on
account of the prevailing volatile political situation, the
signing of a bilateral investment promotion and protection
agreement is being considered.
</P>
<P>
The DTI is also assessing the feasibility of sending a
commercial representative to Cambodia to monitor emerging
opportunities and the passage of new laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
It will encourage the private sector to participate in
Cambodia's construction, agriculture, mining and services sectors
in partnership with its state trading and private companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will also invite Cambodian businessmen to invest
in the local agriculture and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
The DTI also proposes that the government issue a formal
declaration supporting Cambodia's membership bid in the ASEAN, and
help push its loan requests with the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' trade with Cambodia totaled 420,000 US dollars
in 1994 as against 42,000 dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' exports to Cambodia amounted to 294,000
dollars while imports hit 126,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> China to Add 200,000 Elevators by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China will need over 200,000
elevators during the next five years, with the demand rising at an
annual rate of more than ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Delin, deputy secretary general of the China Elevator
Association, said the strong demand is supported by a booming
construction industry during the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan
period.
</P>
<P>
During this period China plans to build about 900 million sq m
of dwelling houses each year, one-third of which will be
highrises. By 2000 China will have built some 170 new cities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the modernization of public facilities and
infrastructure facilities is also expected to quicken, providing a
huge market for elevator producers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China has more than 120 elevator producers and
five sino-foreign elevator joint ventures, but the elevators'
output, technological level and variety are far from matching the
needs of the market.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the elevators installed in high-grade hotels, shopping
centers and office buildings are imported," he said. "Last year
China imported more than 7,000 elevators."
</P>
<P>
He added that besides elevators, demand for elevator components
and parts is also strong.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China's elevator industry developed
rapidly only after the country implemented the policies of reform
and opening to the outside world in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In the 30 years prior to 1979 China produced only 10,000
elevators. But since 1979 China has produced 190,000
elevators. About 200,000 elevators are in use in China at the
moment.

<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb leader today
called on Serbs in Sarajevo not to leave the Serb-held area in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Assembly of the Serbian
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, made the call at a Dayton
agreement implementation meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also urged those who had already left to return to the city
to build a Sarajevo of their own.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said the Serbs have no reasons to flee because they
can expect a future of their own in the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement signed last month, the
Serb-held area must be put under the Muslim-led Bosnian government
by Mid-March.
</P>
<P>
For fear of persecution, thousands of Serbs have fled the city
and many more are planning to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> China to Build More Highways, Berths This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China is to build 15,000 km of
highways, as well as 29 berths in its seaports and five berths on
its inland rivers this year, adding over six million tons to its
annual port handling capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to this year's land and water transport facilities
construction plan worked out by the Ministry of Communications,
the country will build some 600 km of expressways in the first
year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), and 1,100 km
of highways exclusively for motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Major road construction projects include the expressways from
Shanghai to Hangzhou and Nanjing, two provincial capitals, and
eight other expressway projects, six motor vehicle highway
projects and a bridge over the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 China had a total of 1.14 million km of
highways, of which 2,141 km were expressways.
</P>
<P>
This year China will complete two projects in its coastal ports
construction, continue four and start a new project at Qinhuangdao
Port in north China.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also earmarked the overhauling of 400 km of
inland watercourses for this year, and the initiation of
construction of major water transport channels including sections
on the Yangtze River and the Pearl River in south China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the annual handling capacity of major
Chinese ports had reached 1.08 billion tons.

ADDIS ABABA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 186 Eritrean
refugees have returned home from Libya after a stay of 2 to 20
years, according to the latest issue of the English weekly

</P>
<P>
The weekly said 30 percent of the returnees are women.
</P>
<P>
These returnees who were back to Asmara, capital of Eritrea on
January 19, decided to take the move because they felt living
conditions in Libya deteriorated from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The expenses for their repatriation were covered by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (unhcr).
</P>
<P>
After a brief stay at temporary shelters in Asmara, the
returnees are being assisted by the Eritrean Commission for
Relief and Refugee Affairs to resettle in place of their choice,

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warship to Be Salvaged from Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 23
 (Xinhua) -- The sunken cruiser "Chungshan" will be salvaged early
next year after lying on the bed of the Yangtze River near this
capital city of central China's Hubei Province for 59 years.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will take more than three months, but the
first-phase work, now under way, will have to be finished before
late February this year, when the river's dry season ends,
according to the Chongqing Yangtze River Rescue and Salvage
Company, which is in charge of the work.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the
Chinese democratic revolution, was sunk at Wuhan October 24, 1938,
after having shot down three Japanese fighters in China's
Anti-Japanese Aggression War (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
The second-phase work will start in November this year.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, built in 1913, is connected with a famous historic
event -- the Cruiser Chungshan Incident -- when Chiang Kai-shek
betrayed the revolution, created the incident and launched a
surprise attack on the Chinese Communist Party March 20, 1926.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 many departments and noted figures in China have
urged that the ship be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
At the moment it is a cultural relic under state protection.

appear heading for a serious crisis with virtually all major
government hospitals reporting this week that they are running
out of supplies.
</P>
<P>
Food and medicines are fast running out, and as a result at
some of the hospitals patients are being asked to bring their own
food and buy drugs from pharmacies. The shortages are set to
worsen due to huge unpaid debts.
</P>
<P>
At Harare hospital, for example, an emergency meeting was held
yesterday with health officials reporting that they had no food,
drugs, needles, gloves, no blood giving services and no
intravenous giving services.
</P>
<P>
"Patients are being prescribed drugs which relatives go and
buy and then we treat the patients. We are down on the last food
supplies for patients and tomorrow patients have to bring their
own food," hospital officials told the Herald newspaper last
night.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Desert Area Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Shabianzi Village in Yanchi
County in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is now
inhabited by 79 households, and each person owns three mu (0.2 ha)
of arable land. Last year the land yielded 400 kg of wheat per mu.
</P>
<P>
But only 20 years ago there was nothing there but sand and a
solitary tree.
</P>
<P>
The village is a good example of how people in the region have
been expanding their living space through fighting against the
desert in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent national survey of the problem of
desertification, the region has 1.25 million ha of desert areas,
compared with 1.32 million ha in 1970, which is the first time in
history that saw a reversed rate of desertification.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is located in the area
between the Loess Plateau and the western desert. It had long
suffered from sandstorms and soil erosion and large area of arable
land had been swallowed by the desert.
</P>
<P>
The region has put great efforts into planting trees and
growing grass. At present, the region has a man-made forest area
of 107,000 ha, and its forest coverage has been raised to 6.3
percent from the previous 4.8 percent. Forest belts have been
built to protect farmland, highways and railways.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the region has also built numbers of water-control
works to cultivate the desert. Since the 1950s a total of 250 km
of water channels have been built and 54,000 ha of land
irrigated. Since the 1980s another 250 million yuan has been put
into pumping water from the Yellow River to irrigate another
90,000 ha of land.
</P>
<P>
Another water-control project is now about to be finished, and
is expected to turn 155,000 ha of barren land into fertile
farmland.
</P>
<P>
The control of the desert in the region has also gained support
from the international community. An irrigation project funded
with a loan from the World Bank has turned 36,000 ha of desert
into arable land. The project has also resulted in another 4,480
ha of forest, a dozen-km-long tree belt and 670 ha of cash
trees. The green coverage in the projected area has been raised to
over 40 percent, up from the previous eight percent.

LUSAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Five opposition parties have
accused national secretary of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy (mmd) Michael Sata of threatening traditional chiefs.
</P>
<P>
In separate statements, the opposition parties appealed to
President Frederick Chiluba to stop Sata, also health minister,
from making irresponsible statements before his conduct causes
anarchy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties insisted that Sata's statement on the
role of the chiefs is a potential source of conflict.
</P>
<P>
They are reacting to Sata's threats at the weekend to withdraw
recognition of traditional rulers who indulged in politics.
</P>
<P>
The five opposition parties are Zambia Democratic Congress
(zdc), Liberal Progressive Front (lpf), the United National
Independence Party (unip), National Party (np) and National Party
for Democracy (npd).
</P>
<P>
However, brushing aside accusation from the opposition
parties, special assistant to the president Richard Sakala said
Sata, as mmd party chief, was justified to ask traditional chiefs
with political ambitions to abrogate their traditional roles.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Police in Harare have cracked
the first black market firearms racket and recovered nine guns,
the daily newspaper "the Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The firearms had been sold to unlicensed holders by a former
gunshop employee who has since been arrested for allegations of
stealing the weapons from his employer. The weapons were
recovered from their unlicensed holders.
</P>
<P>
The daily said Zimbabwe is currently faced with an influx of
unregisterfed firearms and that most of these are used in armed
robberies making it very difficult for police to trace the owners
since they would not be registered.
</P>
<P>
It was strongly suspected that most of these weapons were of
foreign origin, with Mozambique and South Africa being major
sources. This is the first time a local has been arrested for
illegally distributing weapons on a high scale in Harare.
</P>
<P>
A police officer in Harare said it was disturbing that some
people were engaging themselves in dealing in firearms on the
black market at a time when armed robberies were a thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 5,508 robbery cases were reported in 1994
and 1995 in Harare area and 276 of these were armed.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Draft Provisional
Regulations on Managing the Connection of Computer Information
Networks with International Networks were adopted today in
principle at an executive meeting of the State Council, China's
highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting agreed that computer information
networks are infrastructure useful for the spread of information
for China's economy and that they are playing an "increasingly
important" role in the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the view that over the past few years, with the
growth of a market economy and progress in spreading information,
such networks have been playing an active role in accelerating
China's economic, scientific, technological and educational
development, expanding international cultural exchanges and
improving publicity for China abroad.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, imperative to formulate necessary laws and
regulations in order to further improve the management of the
linking of computer information networks with international
networks and ensure the sound development of computer information
exchanges.

US dollars in contractual overseas investment, the province has
approved 29,442 foreign-funded enterprises, more than 13,000 of
which have become operational.
</P>
<P>
Of the 209 joint ventures set up here by 130 multinationals

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Travelling Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The thought of travelling
abroad, which for the vast majority of the Chinese people was
unthinkable ten years ago, is now possible for millions of them.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese citizens going abroad was 861,400 in
1992, 723,600 in 1993, and 1.1 million in 1994, Zhong Haisheng,
deputy director of the Bureau of Travel Service and Hotel
Management of the National Tourism Administration said, noting
that 1995's figure is expected to be about one million.
</P>
<P>
The figures do not include people going abroad for private or
business purposes. Statistics from the Ministry of Public Security
show that the total number going abroad was more than 2.92 million
in 1992, 3.74 million in 1993, and 3.73 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that major destinations for Chinese tourists were
Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia,
and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 820,500 people travelled to these countries in 1994,
accounting for 66.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
There are now nine travel services that can handle tourism for
Chinese travelling abroad. In Beijing they are China International
Travel Service, China Travel Service, China Youth Travel Service,
and the China Jinqiao (Golden Bridge) Tourism Corporation. The
other five are in Guangdong and Hainan provinces in south China
and Fujian province in east China.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Wuxiong, an official with the China
International Travel Service, the service handled more than 5,000
Chinese tourists travelling abroad last year, compared with fewer
than 1,000 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xiaodan, who has worked as a high school teacher for
nearly 40 years in Beijing, could hardly hide her excitement
during an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She said that she spent 13,000 yuan last year on a trip to
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and that the service
provided by CTS (China Travel Service) was excellent.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Luhong, a CTS official, said that because a large number
of old and middle-aged people in China have never been abroad, and
many young Chinese people have a strong desire to travel abroad,
China has a huge potential international tourism market.

<P>
The project director said during the first two years of the
five-year-programme, 1.1 million dollars would be given to
clients operating in Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, Arusha and Mwanza

XIAMEN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific Insurance Company,
China's No.2 underwriter, received 6.63 billion yuan in premiums
in 1995, up 83.46 percent, with profits surging by 56 percent to
560 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Pacific performed wonderfully because we raised our registered
capital to two billion yuan by inviting local governments and many
large and medium-sized enterprises to be our shareholders,"
explained Director Li Zhongjie.
</P>
<P>
"We've separated our life insurance and non-life insurance
businesses, and improved management," Lin cited as other reasons
for Pacific's progress.
</P>
<P>
"Pacific has a better reputation since it paid indemnities on
time for the crash of a satellite and serious floods in northeast
China," Lin added.
</P>
<P>
Pacific plans to increase premiums to nine to ten billion yuan
this year and report 800 million yuan in profits. It has also
drawn up blueprints for the run-up to the year 2000: quadrupling
the 1995 profit figure through developing property insurance, life
insurance and re-insurance, and efficiently making use of
premiums.

<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC) and the Kerr-McGee Corp. and HUFFCO of the
United States signed a contract here today to explore for oil in
the 05/36 block of the Bohai Sea area.
</P>
<P>
The current contract is the 110th offshore oil contract China
has signed with foreign oil companies, according to a CNOOC source.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the contracted area lies some 100 km east
of Tanggu, Tianjin City, in north China, and covers an area of
1,680 sq km.
</P>
<P>
In line with the contract, the two American oil companies will
undertake the risk alone within the exploratory period and bear
the costs of such offshore operations as the collection of seismic
data and drilling exploratory wells.
</P>
<P>
As the operators, the Kerr-McGee Corp. has a 65 percent
interest in the contract, and HUFFCO 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior CNOOC official, the Bohai Gulf is a core
exploration area for Kerr-McGee. The new contracted area is
immediately east of Kerr-McGee's three existing operating blocks
in this area, with all the four blocks covering a total area of
more than 4,450 sq km.
</P>
<P>
According to an exploratory survey, the four blocks, bordering
the Dagang Oilfield in the west, the East Hebei Oilfield in the
north and the Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield in the northeast, enjoy
promising prospects.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the contracted areas in the Bohai Sea,
Kerr-McGee is a 24.5 percent partner in CNOOC and Amoco's South
China Sea Liuhua 11-1 project, where initial production is planned
for the second quarter of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Oilfield Raising Output Via Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin
Oilfield, one of the eight-biggest in the country, has finally
reversed a steep decline in production.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the oilfield produced 3.4 million tons of crude oil,
360,000 tons more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
After more than three decades of development the oilfield found
it difficult to maintain stable output. From 1991 to 1994 the
oilfield saw a continuous decline in output.
</P>
<P>
But it recently reported that the downturn trend has been
effectively checked because it has implemented the strategy of
raising output through science and technology.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of nearly 900 technological upgrading
projects, the oilfield has discovered four more oil deposits, with
a total of over 200 million extra tons of oil, and reactivated
many older fields.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the oilfield drilled a record 1.1 million m in
1995, without adding drillers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years 169 wells have been drilled and
pipelines totaling 90 km laid. Besides, the oilfield's daily
output of crude oil has been raised from 60 tons to 500 tons.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990 the oilfield has discovered 500 sq km of oil-bearing
areas and increased its reserves by nearly five times.

CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- World number five Michael
Chang of the United States powered his way to the semi-finals of
the Australian Open after beating Sweden's Mikael Tillstrom in
Melbourne on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fifth seed met little trouble against the 23-year-old
Swedish, winning the match 6-0, 6-2, 6-4 in only 76 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Chang, the semi-final loser last year, will take on either
second seed Andre Agassi or eighth seed Jim Courier in the top
four.
</P>
<P>
Tillstrom reached the quarter-finals in his first Australian
Open campaign after eliminating third seed Thomas Muster of
Austria in the previous match.
</P>
<P>
Chang broke Tillstrom's serve six times and kept his own serves
intact with consistent baseline play. He had improved his serve
to some 185-190 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The first set took just 22 minutes with the second 24 minutes
as Tillstrom made 45 unforced errors against Chang's 13.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Transport Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China is to build seven major
national highways, three main water transport channels and two
water navigation networks, and build the country's first
international shipping center in Shanghai, the biggest port city
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, China's minister of communications, announced
the overall plan to improve the nation's transport infrastructure
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) at a four-day
national working conference on communications, which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, China plans to build some 110,000 km
of highways in the next five years, of which 6,500 km will be
expressways, and 3,500 km highways exclusively for motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
As the arteries of a national highway network, four major
highways crisscrossing China from Tongjiang in the northern tip of
the country to Sanya at the southern tip, from Beijing to Zhuhai,
from Lianyungang, an east China port, to Horgos in the remote west
region of Xinjiang, and from Shanghai to Chengdu in inland Sichuan
Province, in addition to three more connecting China's major
cities will be completed during the period.
</P>
<P>
Berths for coal, containers and raw materials will constitute
the majority of seaport construction projects, said the
minister. More than 200 berths of the 1,000-dwt level and above
will be built, adding an annual handling capacity of 300 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
To aid Shanghai's ambition to become an international economic,
financial and trading center in the Far East, an international
shipping center with Shanghai as the hub, ports in neighboring
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will be established as supporting
ones, Huang revealed.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years China will also establish a water
transport network comprising the Yangtze River, the longest river
in the country, the Pearl River in south China, and their
tributaries, and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,400 km of inland waterways will be overhauled, and 160
berths with a total handling capacity of 42 million tons will be
built by the end of the century, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also made a summary of transport construction in the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), telling participants that China
achieved important achievements in the field in the five years.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995 China built a total of 112,000 km of
highways, representing 124 percent of the target, as well as 283
berths in its chief seaports, adding an annual handling capacity
of 120 million tons.

<HEADLINE> New Technique to Treat Waste Water from Tanneries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A new technique to treat
waste water from the hide-processing industry has passed state
assessment and will be used in all tanneries in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
By using the new technique, 90 percent of the processing liquid
can be re-used instead of being discharged as waste water to
pollute rivers.
</P>
<P>
The province currently has nearly 2,000 tanneries, with a total
output value of around 2.5 billion yuan. They are also major
polluters, discharging 7.96 million tons of waste water annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the technique can help control the serious
water pollution caused by small tanneries in the Huaihe and Haihe
river valleys. Thus it can secure over 1,000 factories from being
shut down.
</P>
<P>
The technique will bring both economic returns and social
benefits to the whole country if it used more widely, they said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan student militia
Taliban has rejected the unilateral ceasefire offer announced by
the Kabul regime for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, reported
the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) today.
</P>
<P>
"We could not trust the words and deeds of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, and the ceasefire announcement is aimed at
just taking advantage of the situation, " APP quoted a Taliban
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"President Rabbani has been talking about peace and
negotiations, but on the other hand his forces have been attacking
the Taliban positions, that's why the Taliban don't trust him, "
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, which controls about one third of the Afghan
territory, have been besieging Kabul since last October in a bid
to topple Rabbani by force.

<HEADLINE> Countermeasure to Potato Wilt Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A new way has been found to
control bacterial wilt, which is caused by pseudomonas
solanacearum, a bacterium that infests more than 200 kinds of
plants, including potatoes, tobacco and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, the research project of bacterial wilt resistant gene
for potatoes has passed a state assessment.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Bio-Technology Research Center under the
academy have developed technological means to identify and
synthesize potato antibacterial peptide, a kind of protein with
lower molecular weight. The center has turned out three kinds of
the peptide, which have so far not been reported by any other
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have also succeeded in creating new genes with
the antibacterial peptide and in transferring them to seven
strains of potatoes that are widely planted in China. So far, over
1,000 transgenic lines have been obtained from the project and
experts have selected three which are superior in resisting the
disease.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Breakthrough in Rural Old-age Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- About 4.33 million peasants in
east China's Zhejiang Province do not have to worry about
old-age, thanks to a rural old-age insurance system based on
savings.
</P>
<P>
Covering more than half of the province's townships, the system
has been put in practise in over 2,000 administrative villages.
</P>
<P>
By December, 1995, Zhejiang had accumulated 560 million yuan
(67 million U.S dollars) in rural old-age insurance fees, six
times the figure for the previous year, pushing the province from
fifth place in 1994 to third in 1995 among the country's rural
old-age insurance work.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the Interim Means on Rural Old-age
Insurance in Zhejiang in 1995 helped pull the province out of an
unsteady position it had been in since 1992.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 76 counties and 1,200 townships had been
involved in the work, a jump of 85.4 percent and 158.6 percent
respectively compared with the previous year's figures.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, an additional 3.2 million peasants got insurance.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge of rural insurance in Zhejiang is a heavy blow to
the outdated notion that one has children as a hedge against old
age.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are 4,552 peasants in Zhejiang, all above the
age of 60, who have begun to receive monthly pensions from the
government just as city-dwellers do simply because they are
insured for their later years.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Enterprises Top 12,000 in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of high-tech
enterprises in China has topped 12,000, of which 358 have output
values surpassing 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruiming, a senior official with the State Science and
Technology Commission, revealed this at a seminar on the 1995
development of high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was co-sponsored by the China Journalism Society
for Science and Technology, the "China Science and Technology
Information Journal" and the China High-Tech Development Zones
Association.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that over 6,500 scientific and technological
projects have been put in place since the "Torch Program", aiming
at accelerating the country's scientific and technological
progress, was launched in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In China's 52 high-tech development zones, he said, the total
annual revenue has exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion US
dollars), and the industrial output value has topped 90 billion
yuan, while profits and taxes are around 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech enterprises, which have also earned 1.3 billion
US dollars-worth of foreign currency, have become an important
part of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Condemns Murder of Muslim Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov today condemned the murder of the country's Muslim
spiritual leader, Mufti Fatkhullo Sharifov and his family as an
attempt to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik Foreign Ministry said the killing could have been
committed by an international terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
President Rakhmonov called the murder "a disgusting and cynical
challenge" to the entire Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The president urged his government and law enforcement agencies
to do their best to investigate the crime and expose the killers.
</P>
<P>
He also visited the scene of the crime and expressed sincere
condolences to the victim's relatives and fellow-countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Sharifov and his family were machine-gunned to death in their
house in the village of Lantakhorak on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik Foreign Ministry said in a statement many terrorist
groups, financed by some Islamic states, have recently been sent
to Tajikistan and may have been responsible for the murder.
</P>
<P>
Some circles in and around Tajikistan are not interested in
pushing forward the negotiating process between the Tajik
authorities and the opposition, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The ministry accused certain opposition factions of trying to
worsen the situation by provoking incidents on the Tajik-Afghan
border and committing acts of terrorism in the country, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry pledged to find the murderers and punish
them.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce 200 Million Tons of Oil in 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's oil production is
rising steadily and will reach 200 million tons in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Yongkang, deputy general manager of the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), this will be an increase of
one third over the present annual production output of about 150
million tons.
</P>
<P>
"China will still rank fifth in the world in oil production at
that time," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the estimated figure is based on the
stabilized oil production output in east China and the development
of oil resources in the west.
</P>
<P>
By injecting water into the ground to maintain oil output, old
oilfields in east China, of which the output accounts for 90
percent of the country's total, have succeeded in controlling the
rate of natural output decline within 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these oilfields have accelerated prospecting to push
the oil production capacity to 64 million tons, thus maintaining
the oil output.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Daqing, China's leading oilfield, has
kept its annual output at 50 million tons for 20 years running.
Shengli, the country's second-largest, has maintained its output
at 30 million tons for eight years running, and the Liaohe
oilfield has reported an annual output of 13.6 million tons for
eight years running.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the annual output of the North China Oilfield has
stabilized at more than five million tons, and those of the
Zhongyuan, Dagang, Jilin, Henan and Jianghan oilfields also
registered increases. The output of the Jiangsu Oilfield topped
one million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou disclosed that geological and oil workers have discovered
four large oil- and gas-bearing structures each with oil reserves
between 50 million tons and 100 million tons in the Tarim Basin in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and three large oil- and
gas-bearing structures in the Jungar Basin, also in the region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 Xinjiang had verified oil reserves totalling
1.94 billion tons, and its production output amounted to 12.8
million tons.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. to Simplify Customs Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
announced here today an action plan to ease controls on frequent
travelers across the shared border which should cut costs for the
government and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Canada will roll out automated customs check
points at its major airports and other border crossing points to
allow bona fide frequent travelers to use a "smart card" pass,
which allow them to be checked and to declare duties at a machine
instead of in front of a customs officer.
</P>
<P>
The plan, jointly announced by Canadian Minister of National
Revenue David Anderson and U.S. Ambassador James Blanchard, will
simplify border crossing procedures for frequent travelers.
</P>
<P>
A pilot project opened at Vancouver International Airport last
year and a similar system is already in place at major U.S.
airports.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also considering merging the two systems
to allow a traveler to get entry approval without a second
security check when crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
The action plan is in response to growing passenger and goods
traffic between the two countries. About 115 million travelers
and 11 million trucks cross the shared border each year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in paper work should cut costs for exporters and
importers as well as the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Simplifying procedures for bona fide travelers should allow the
two countries to spend more time fighting drugs, smuggling and
illegal and irregular movement of people across the border, it is
reported.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Took Drug Money, Campaign Chief Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- President Ernesto Samper knew
that the Cali drug cartel contributed funds to his 1994 election
campaign, his jailed campaign director said today.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Botero, Samper's former campaign chief and defense
minister, told a local television news program that Samper knew
all about the illicit money alleged to have supported his campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Samper is seriously involved in the Cali cartel money that
entered his campaign," Botero was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Samper has denied the charges repeatedly and said that if any
drug money was used in his campaign, it was done "behind my back."
</P>
<P>
In December, a congressional commission dropped an
investigation of Samper and his campaign, citing lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Botero, a close friend of Samper, was jailed in August on
suspicion that he accepted campaign contributions from Cali drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Reports say Botero broke his silence because he was angry with
Samper for making him the scandal scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
Samper, a Liberal who was seriously wounded by drug cartel
gunmen in 1989, defeated Conservative rival Andres Pastrana in
June 1994 in one of Colombia's tightest presidential races.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Peruvian Economy to Remain Strong In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Peruvians
believe the outlook for 1996 is good as the country continues to
experience strong economic growth, lower inflation and improved
political stability as the threat of terrorism subsides.
</P>
<P>
Peru's economic growth was one of the highest in Latin America
last year, with a 7 percent increase in gross national product.
Official estimates put the growth rate at 5-6 percent a year until
the year 2000, reversing the poor performance of the late 1980s
and early 1990s as the country embarked on major economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The rampant inflation of the early 1990s is also now under
control, falling from 400 percent in 1991 as subsidies were
abolished, to an expected 8 percent this year and to a target of 3
or 4 percent by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for international trade is also improving and
international reserves have recovered to 6.48 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic reform, including economic liberalization and
privatization started in the early 1990s, will continue.
Privatization, which generated 1.1 billion dollars in 1995, will
be speeded up and the government has recently agreed to sell the
country's largest company, oil concern Petroperu.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which has lagged behind the mining sector, a major
export industry and foreign currency earner, will be targeted for
special attention.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori said Peru's high growth rate makes
it an attractive target for foreign investment. He believes Peru
will receive more than 4 billion dollars of foreign investment
during the five years to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have shown much greater interest in the
country as the 15-year confrontation with internal terrorists has
subsided over last two years and members of armed groups such as
the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)
have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
The country is also renegotiating its 20 billion dollars of
foreign debt. Some 3 billion dollars has already been rescheduled
with the 'Paris Club' of official creditors and some 9 billion
dollars of private sector debt is being restructured through the
Brady Plan.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of the improving economic situation, poverty and
poor education remain huge problems in a country which official
surveys show to be an "ocean of poverty"
</P>
<P>
This year the government is planning a 2.5 billion dollar
campaign to combat poverty through a range of social and welfare
projects.
</P>
<P>
The overall positive outlook for Peru can be partly attributed
to political stability.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori began his second five-year term on July 28, 1995 with
the backing of 64 percent of the people, defeating former
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori won support for such policies as the war against
poverty, emphasis on educational investment, the improvement of
productivity in small businesses, support for exports and efforts
to resolve border disputes with neighboring Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
These policies helped reinforce the process of bringing
internal peace to the country after 15 years of internal warfare

stability.

However, the potential for other conflicts cannot be ignored,
particularly armed conflict with Ecudaor over a border dispute.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
assist the local textile industry with a subsidy of 7 million US
dollars over a period of three years mainly to help manufacturers
who are facing liquidity problems, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The subsidy will be in the form of the payment of a subsidized
interest rate by the Ministry of Finance directly to the banks on
behalf of troubled companies.
</P>
<P>
The troubled company will have to pay an interest rate of 8
percent while the balance will be paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
This program comes in the wake of the tremendous difficulties
faced by the local textile manufacturers who called on the
government to take immediate action to help them overcome
financial difficulties, according to the sources.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Victoria state
government said on Tuesday that Melbourne will make a bid to host
the 2006 Commonwealth Games, the first one after the Australian
Commonwealth Games Association (ACGA) launched a campaign to bring
the games home for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
Premier Jeff Kennett said he had set up a nine-member committee
to oversee the bid, with Hudson Conway and Crown Casino director
Ron Walker as chairman and International Olympic Committee
vice-president Kevan Gosper as deputy chairman.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee would also include former Australian
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, Coles Myer executive Peter Bartels,
Pacific Dunlop chairman John Gough and Tattersalls managing
trustee David Jones.
</P>
<P>
Walker is also a member of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games
Committee and chairman of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Kennett said if the bid was successful it would cost about 54
million U.S. dollars, 18.75 million of which will be used in
facility construction.
</P>
<P>
ACGA has sent letters to the leaders of all eight states and
territories to invite expressions of interest in hosting the games.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that other cities which might have
interest include Perth, Brisbane, Sydney and Darwin.
</P>
<P>
Australia has staged the games three times previously, at
Sydney in 1938, Perth in 1962 and Brisbane in 1982.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- American football star
O.J. Simpson was in court in Los Angeles on Monday to make a sworn
statement in a lawsuit brought by the families of his ex-wife and
her friend, less than four months after the court ruled he was
innocent.
</P>
<P>
The suit forces Simpson, who did not take the witness stand in
the 10-month criminal trial, to tell his story under oath.
</P>
<P>
The civil case will need only a preponderance of evidence to
find guilt, unlike a criminal trial, in which the jury must find
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
The trial for the civil wrongful death lawsuit is set for April
2. The sworn testimony should be provided before trial begins.
</P>
<P>
He was expected to testify all day and perhaps several more
days this week.
</P>
<P>
The only testimony he has provided to date is on a video that
he made to sell.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers are expected to ask about the video, which gives the
former football running back and movie star's side of the events
leading up to the June 12, 1994 slashing deaths of his former wife
Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
Simpson will also make his first appearance after his acquittal
in the public on Wednesday in a formal TV interview.

MEXICO CITY, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The second summit of
Central American nations and Mexico, to be held in Costa Rica on
February 15-16, will focus on the creation of a free trade zone
among the participants, Honduran Economy Minister Fernando Garcia
said.

According to reports from Tegucugalpa, the capital of Honduras,

At the first summit, participants discussed the framework of a

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Mexicans Expect Better Economy in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Most Mexicans have put last
year's economic crisis behind them in the expectation that this
year will be better.
</P>
<P>
Economists here predict great improvements in 1996 in an
economy that shrank 7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
They said positive economic indicators include a rebound in the
stock market and the peso-dollar exchange rate, lower interest
rates, a falling unemployment rate and the possible influx of 7
billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate dropped from 7.3 percent in September
1995 to 5.2 percent this month, according to figures released
January 17 by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and
Computerized Database (INEGI).
</P>
<P>
The successful placement of bonds worth 1.5 million German
marks on the European market and upcoming placements of government
bonds in U.S. dollars this month demonstrate a recovery of
international confidence in the Mexican economy.
</P>
<P>
But economists believe that, despite these encouraging signs,
the government still faces enormous challenges to the recovery
goals it set last November.
</P>
<P>
Some national and international organizations agree that
Mexico's battered economy will recover in the second half of the
year, though the government's target of 3 percent growth by the
end of 1996 will be difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
Several of the biggest stumbling blocks for the government's
recovery plan include lack of investments, high inflation,
volatility in financial markets and an agricultural crisis.
</P>
<P>
Politically, the armed rebellion in the southern state of
Chiapas has yet to be settled.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government have shown a desire to resolve the
conflict peacefully and to continue negotiations with the leaders
of the armed Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN).
</P>
<P>
The talks have so far resulted in the EZLN announcing on New
Year's Day that it would convert into a political party. On
January 18, both sides reached their first agreements concerning
autonomy and rights of indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
Still, observers say that due to differences over political
reforms, further talks will be necessary to make peace a reality.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Zedillo has said that the creation of jobs
and the recovery of wage levels are this year's priorities in his
government's social agenda.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's recovery program, the minimum wage will
be increased by more than 20 percent during the year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the monthly minimum wage last year
was 77 percent lower than in 1970 and more than 40 million people
-- nearly half the population-- live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
In a document released January 15, the Mexican Association for
Consumer Research estimated that inflation will close the year at
35-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The association expects purchasing power to fall by 45 percent
in 1996, following a 35 percent drop last year.
</P>
<P>
The war against poverty is one of the Mexican government's top
priorities -- perhaps the most difficult -- apart from the growing
crime wave and drug trafficking.

BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- German industrial giant
Daimler-Benz AG today decided to stop financial support for its
bankruptcy-threatened Dutch aircraft subsidiary, Fokker N.V.
</P>
<P>
Since its aerospace subsidiary, DASA, bought a 40 percent stake
in Fokker in 1993, Daimler has pumped billions of marks into the
Dutch company only to see the latter post mounting losses.
</P>
<P>
Daimler itself also posted a record loss of six billion marks
(about 4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995, with 3.8 billion marks
(2.4 billion dollars) arising from the red ink at Fokker and AEG
AG, the Daimler electronics and rail technology subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
Daimler's supervisory board today announced the decision to cut
off support for Fokker after talks with the Dutch government,
another major shareholder of Fokker, failed to agree on a
life-saving cash injection.
</P>
<P>
Daimler wanted the Dutch government to contribute about 2.5
billion marks (1.7 billion dollars) to help save the company -- a
request Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok dismissed as "unthinkable."
</P>
<P>
Daimler said that after hacking off unprofitable businesses in
an aggressive restructuring effort, the company is now set to
return to profit this year.

"Profitability in all business sectors is the first goal of the
company," Daimler Chairman Juergen Schrempp said.

greater flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The fund would begin with a budget of 300 million baht (12
million US dollars), according to Deputy Public Health Minister
Sora-ath Klinprathum.
</P>
<P>
The budget would come from the about 2,000 million baht (80
million US dollars) AIDS budget allocated to various ministries
for the 1996 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new fund, to be administered by senior
administrators of ministries concerned, would hopefully make the
administration of the government budget more flexible.
</P>
<P>
The fund would begin after draft regulations are completed with
two months, according to Sora-ath.
</P>
<P>
Sora-ath said bureaucratic red tape by various government
organizations often resulted in a lack of coordination and
efficiency in administrating the AIDS problem.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government's efforts in tackling the AIDS
issue have been slowed down by years, making it unable to cope
with the world situation.
</P>
<P>
Public Health Ministry figures show that an estimated 700,000
people in Thailand are infected with HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> China's Increases Education Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China spent 414.7 billion yuan
on education in the period 1991-1994, an increase of 25 percent
annually, the State Education Commission revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or the total value of
product and services, grew by some 10 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the fund for nine-year compulsory
education will reach 10 billion yuan by the year 2000, which will
be the largest investment the government has injected into the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 billion yuan will be used for the improvement of 100
key universities.
</P>
<P>
The commission also said that it has created a mechanism to ensure
teachers' salaries increase continuously.
</P>
<P>
However, officials admitted that a shortage of education funds is
still a major problem, owing to historical and regional
factors. Some poverty-stricken regions are facing difficulties in
developing local education.

SHENYANG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- In Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, a total of 2,500 outstanding professionals receiving
special subsidies from the government have bought preferential
old-age insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
The action came as the result of help from the provincial
Department of Personnel and the Shenyang branch of the China
Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies are available for those professionals who
are below 65 years of age and are healthy enough to do daily
work. They pay 2,000 yuan (240 U.S.dollars) for the insurance
policy.
</P>
<P>
The policy holder can get maximum compensation of 30,000 yuan
for accident-related injury, or a lump sum of 10,000 yuan for
death from illness before the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
From the age of 70 until he or she dies, a pension will be paid
each year in accordance with standards set by the China Pacific
Insurance Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
In this case, if a person buys an insurance policy at a cost of

<HEADLINE> Oil Spilling Off US Coast Controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Working crews stopped the
leakage of a 340-foot oil barge stranded off the U.S. northeast
coast today, after pumping 1.8 million gallons of fuel from the
ruptured ship, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The barge, carrying four million gallons of home heating oil,
ran aground off Moonstone Beach, Rhode Island, in stormy seas
Friday and began leaking oil to the Atlantic almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the barge spilled a total of 820,000 gallons of
its cargo and a sheen of oil covered an area stretching 12 miles.
Fishing was banned in a 105-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Rhode Island said thousands of dead lobsters,
clams and starfish washed up on shore and dozens of oily birds
struggled out of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Keeney, director of the Department of Environmental
Management of Rhode Island, said the damage to the state's marine
industries is expected to run into the tens of millions of
dollars. The spill is the worst in the state history.
</P>
<P>
But home heating oil is lighter and much easier to evaporate
than crude oil. Some of the spilled oil was cleaned up by
oil-skimming vessels and some probably evaporated or dissipated in
the water.
</P>
<P>
Steve Lehmann of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration estimated that less than 100,000 gallons remained
in the coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
Working Crews planned to pump air into compartments on the
barge Tuesday to raise it from the sand so it can be towed out to
sea.

YANGON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A new natural gas power station
on Monday went into operation in the township of Mingaladon, 26.4
km from Yangon, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Cash In On Animal Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans have learned how to make
20 to 30 times the amount of money made previously from a head of
sheep, pushing the autonomous region's animal husbandry onto a new
track and helping Tibetans leave their poverty behind.
</P>
<P>
For generations, Tibetans lived a nomadic life in the
Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Most Tibetans often faced poverty in the
past, with only their herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, as the
traditional notion that doing business was shameful prevented them
from making more money by selling their cattle and sheep.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the reforms, the concept of a market
economy has begun to take root here, and instead of exchanging
their cattle and sheep for a little highland barley, a few
radishes, or some pocket money as they did before, they now sell
wool and cashmere to the state, sheepskin to hide dealers, and
mutton to markets.
</P>
<P>
Even sheep's heads, which used to be left alone, can now be
sold to dealers who use them for handicrafts with ethnic
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Germany Expects Moderate Economic Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The German government said today
it expects the country's Gross Domestic Product to rise by a
moderate 1.5 percent and the unemployment rate to go up further to
10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In a draft annual economic report released by the German news
agency DPA, the government said the GDP will grow by only 1
percent for western Germany and 4 to 6 percent for eastern Germany
over the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate across the country will go up
to some 10 percent in 1996 from 9.4 percent last year, with an
average rate of 9 percent for the western half of the country and
15.5 percent for the eastern half.
</P>
<P>
By December last year, the unemployment rate had already
reached 8.7 percent for the west and 14.9 percent for the east.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the government also noted that exports will
continue to be the major engine of economic growth during the
year. It expects exports to increase by 3.5 to 4.5 percent and
imports to rise by 3 to 4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It also forecast that domestic demand will increase by 1.5
percent while consumer prices will go up by around 2 percent
during the year.
</P>
<P>
The government's national economic forecast for this year is
regarded as the most conservative so far. Germany's key
economists had predicted in November last year that the economy
would grow by 2 percent this year and that the unemployment rate
would remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the economy grew by 1.9 percent -- 1.5 percent for
the west and 6.3 percent for the east.
</P>
<P>
The DPA said the draft economic report, along with a program of
action to accelerate the economic growth, will be submitted to the
cabinet for debate and approval on January 30.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A former Chilean
intelligence agent has been arrested for the 1974 assassination in
Argentina of Chile's former Army Chief Carlos Prats, Argentine
President Carlos Menem revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Enrique Lautaro Arancibia Clavets was detained last Thursday by
Argentine authorities after intense investigations, judicial
sources said. He is reportedly being held at the headquarters of
the Argentine Federal Police.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations have implicated others in the
assassination, including Col. Manuel Contreras, former head of
Chile's National Intelligence Office (DINA), other Chilean
military officers, and Michael Townley, a liaison officer between
DINA and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
General Carlos Prats, former commander-in-chief of the Chilean
army and interior minister, was living in exile in Argentina
following the military coup that overthrew former Chilean
President Salvador Allende in September 1973.
</P>
<P>
Prats and his wife were killed on September 30, 1974, by a bomb
placed under his car close to his home in Buenos Aires, the

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Households Specialize in Cotton Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A large number of households, of
various ethnic groups, have emerged as specialized cotton growing
families in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, one of China's
major cotton producers.
</P>
<P>
According to Yushan Ashan, a farmer who has contracts for more
than 100 ha of reclaimed land in Halata Township of Aksu City, his
income from growing cotton was 1.5 million yuan (about 180,000 US
dollars) in 1995, thanks to a loan from the township authority to
help him do large-scale planting and because of rising cotton
prices.
</P>
<P>
Yushan says that he respects Wang Guoze, another farmer in
Halata who runs the biggest household farm in the autonomous
region. Having gotten contracts on 450 ha of land and having
picked over 1,300 tons of cotton, Wang's income in 1995 was
expected to reach 6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In Cangtamu Village, Xayar County, every household can be
regarded as a specialized cotton growing family, and 70 percent of
them have an annual income over 100,000 yuan from cotton,
according to Liu Dajun, a village official.
</P>
<P>
"Per ha output in my township is more than 1,500 kilograms of
ginned cotton, twice the country's average, thanks to the
upgrading of cotton growing technology", explained Yushan Zayid,
deputy head of Halata Township.

<HEADLINE> Largest Euphrates Poplar Forest Recovers from Deterioration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's largest Euphrates poplar
forest belt, in the Tarim Basin in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, is seeing a recovery after suffering from
deterioration for many years due to human encroachment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the mid-1980s over two million mu
(130,000 ha) of Euphrates poplars has been restored in the Tarim
Basin, which has raised the total area of such forests to over 3.5
million mu.
</P>
<P>
The Euphrates poplar, capable of resisting both drought and
wind, is an ancient variety of tree that can survive along river
banks in desert areas. There used to be over eight million mu of
such forests in the Tarim Basin, accounting for 94 percent of the
total area of Euphrates poplars in the world.
</P>
<P>
Until recently large-scale cultivation and overuse of water in
the basin resulted in the disappearance of large areas of
Euphrates poplars, which not only caused serious ecological
degradation around oases, but had also resulted in many valuable
desert plant species being pushed to the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the regional government set up a 3,879-sq-km Euphrates
poplar protection area on the middle reaches of the Tarim
River. On the lower reaches of the river people used river water
in the flood seasons to irrigate the forest.

nomination for the premiership on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic, who was in charge of relations with the U.N., was
nominated for the prime minister's post by the Muslim-led ruling

The new government, whose formation was laid down in the Dayton
peace accord signed in Paris last December, would represent two
entities -- the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic.
</P>

The Bosnian president is expected to appoint Muratovic prime
minister-designate and the appointment will then be sent to the
Republic's Assembly for approval.

</P>
<P>
Sharipov, 53, died in a spray of sub-machinegun fire while the
assailants stormed his house, the ITAR-TASS news agency
reported. His wife, son, daughter-in-law and a child were also
killed in the assault.
</P>
<P>
The murder, on the first day of the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan, drew immediate condemnation from the government of
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry denounced it as "an impudent attempt to
destabilize the situation in the republic."
</P>
<P>
International efforts are currently underway to try to end the
three-year civil war in Tajikistan, a mountain state of 5.7
million people bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Such an action was undertaken as our country chose the path
of democratization. The action was ill-intentioned and aimed at
breaking the peace process," the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed foreign terrorist groups, which it did
not name, were involved in the murder.
</P>
<P>
President Imomali Rakhmonov visited the mufti's surviving
relatives and later denounced the murder as "a monstrous and
cynical challenge to the Muslim world."

<HEADLINE> Galileo Probe Suggests Review of Planetary Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Initial analysis of early
data from Galileo probe has encouraged scientists to review their
theories of planetary evolution, according to scientists at a NASA
press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo on July 13 and
entered into Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7, was the first
man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet and
sent back data on its way to demise.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the Galileo probe data exceeds all of our most
optimistic predictions," said Dr. Wesler Huntress, Associate
Administrator for Space Science with the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
"It will allow the scientific community to develop valuable new
insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system and
the origins of life within it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere offered some surprise.
It contains lower than expected levels of helium, neon, and some
heavy elements, such as carbon, oxygen and sulfur, said projects
scientists.
</P>
<P>
The probe detected extremely strong winds and very intense
turbulence during its descent through Jupiter's thick atmosphere.
It provides evidence that the energy source driving Jupiter's
circulation is "probably heat escaping from the deep interior of
the planet," said Dr. Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
"The probe also discovered an intense new radiation belt above
Jupiter's cloud tops, and a veritable absence of lighting."
</P>
<P>
The probe found that lighting occurs on Jupiter only about
one-tenth as often as on Earth, which is consistent with the
absence of water clouds but reduces the possibility of finding
organic molecules in the Jovian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the meaning of these findings, the project
scientists said that the probe's measurements may necessitate a
reappraisal of existing views of how Jupiter evolved from the
solar nebula, because most scientists believe now that Jupiter has
a composition similar to that of the gas and dust cloud of the
primitive solar nebula from which the planets and the Sun were
formed.
</P>
<P>
The Galileo probe made the most difficult voyage entering
Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7 last year. It sent back more
than 30 minutes of data before its life came to an end under
extreme conditions including entry speed of about 170,000
kilometers per hour, temperatures twice those on the surface of
the Sun and 230 times the strength of gravity on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle
Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to
study Jupiter and its moons.

<P>
The arsenal includes 3.3 million single-chemical bombs,
rockets, artillery shells and cartridges and 315,682 binary
weapons, in which chemicals are mixed to produce deadly gas.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said that the U.S. Defense Department
released the figures of the U.S. chemical weapons partly because
both Clinton and former U.S. President George Bush had pledged not
to use such weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, there is no longer a military reason to keep the
number of such weapons in secret," one official told reporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian federal government
has selected 25 contractors to take charge of toll collection at
the 28 toll gates in the country from February 1, Works and
Housing Minister Abdulkarim Adisa announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Adisa said the federal government wanted to draw on the well-
known efficiency of the private sector, explaining that the
private sector will take complete charge of the collection of
tolls at the toll gates as well as the operation and maintenance
of the facilities in them.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that revenue generated from the gates would
increase significantly and would be treated as a supplementary
fund for the maintenance of the roads.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government determined the toll rates, and
any unauthorized upward review by a contractor would be deemed to
constitute a fundamental breach of the terms of the agreement and
would lead to immediate termination of the contract and severe
sanctions imposed.

WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
congratulated Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization
Yassir Arafat on his election.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns described the
Palestinian first-ever election in the West Bank and Gaza

It was reported that there was a very high turnout throughout

<P>
"We share the view of the international monitoring community
that the election was a successful and historic opportunity for
the Palestinian people democratically to choose their leaders,"
Burns said.

Burns noted that there was a massive international monitoring
presence there, including an American monitoring team led by
former President Jimmy Carter.

on the reports we have received, both from former President Carter
but also from the European Union monitoring team," Burns said.

process," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Government has
promised to release more prisoners of war, a senior U.S. official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck told reporters
today after meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic that
"I was assured by the president that he will continue to release
prisoners."
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, all 900 POWs should have been freed
by the three warring factions by last Friday. But only 225 were
exchanged last Friday and 646 are still kept in prisons.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Government had said previously that Serb POWs would
not be released unless the Serbs provided information on thousands
of missing Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Shattuck also said the U.S. and International Committee of the
Red Cross will set up a working group to investigate the missing
persons in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Shattuck toured suspected mass grave sites near an eastern town
of Srebrenica on Sunday and said there were evidences that many
Muslims could have been killed by the Serbs. The Bosnian
Government claimed that 7,000 Muslims were missing when the Serb
troops captured the Muslim enclave last July.

CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today it is making
intensive contacts with other members of U.N. Security Council to
discuss a draft resolution on Sudan's involvement in the
assassination attempt on the Egyptian president last June.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will discuss the draft resolution next
week, Assistant Foreign Minister for Multi-lateral International
Relations Sayyed Qassem al-Masri was quoted by the Middle East
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the issue has been discussed with U.S. Permanent
Delegate to the U.N. Madeleine Albright and the Russian and
Chinese ambassadors in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Albright met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and expressed concern over Sudan's refusal to hand over to
Ethiopia three suspects involved in the foiled murder attempt on
Mubarak in Addis Ababa last June.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has asked the Security Council to consider sanctions
against Sudan to force it to surrender the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which became a member of the Security Council earlier
this month, does not seek to aggravate the suffering of the
Sudanese people, Masri said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt is also making contacts with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to discuss imposing political
sanctions on Khartoum to make it surrender the suspects and stop
sponsoring terrorism.

<HEADLINE> New Russian Upper House Speaker Outlines His Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The newly-elected Russian Upper
House speaker Yegor Stroyev stated today that he would serve the
interests of Russia's political and budgetary federalism.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, 58, head of the Oryol regional administration, was
elected Chairman of the Federation Council, the upper house of the
Russian Parliament, by a majority of 147 votes with 19 against and
one ballot paper found invalid.
</P>
<P>
He told his debut news conference after the election that he
would refuse to be elected as full-time speaker and was set to
combine the leadership of the upper chamber with his post of the
Oryol region's governor.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev cited as his key concern Russia's independent food
program as an alternative to the present food imports. He told
reporters that the Central Russian Economic Association, of which
he is chairman, had drafted and submitted to the government a food
program.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Chechen settlement, he said he "always opposed"
the use of force in the local republic in Russia's North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with U.S. ambassador at large James Collins on the
same day, Gennady Seleznyov, the newly-elected speaker of the
State Duma (the lower house of the Russian Parliament), said he
believes Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev and his chief
terrorists Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev should be eliminated
but "problems in the Caucasus (including Chechnya) cannot be
solved by war."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the reporters, Stroyev voiced the hope that the new
Federation Council "will not be engrossed in political bias, and
this will make the new membership different from State Duma
deputies."
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports here, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin sent a congratulation message to Stroyev immediately after
his election. But the president congratulated Seleznyov, one of
the Russian Communist Party leaders, three days later after the
communist was elected Duma speaker.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin has expressed his readiness to keep a close
cooperation with the two houses of the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government, AAC Conclude First Round Of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 23 (Xinhua)-- A Zambian Minister announced today
that the Zambian government and the Anglo-American Corporation (AAC)
have concluded the first round of negotiations on the proposed
development of the Konkola deep mining project in northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ronald Penza said in a statement that the
meetings were held in a constructive and positive manner and marked
the first step towards the project's development.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that there are still many issues which have to be
investigated and resolved.
</P>
<P>
The government and AAC, acting on behalf of the Zambia Copper
Investment Limited, have agreed upon a program of further work and
meetings to pursue these issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The size and complexity of the project mean that the program is
likely to take many months, but both parties involved intend to work
positively towards completion of the program as soon as possible,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Other South African companies, including Gencor Limited and
Western Mining Corporation Limited, who are expected to join the
Zambia Copper Investment Limited as partners, will participate in future
meetings.
</P>
<P>
AAC and other foreign investors will form a consortium to develop
the Konkola Deep Mining at the cost of some 600 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Forming Coalition Government Begins in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Turkey's two
major parties today started their talks on forming a widely-awaited
coalition government, but no breakthrough was achieved due to
differences on who should take the rein first.
</P>
<P>
This came after Caretaker Prime Minister and chairwoman of the
True Path Party (DYP) Tansu Ciller met with leader of the
Motherland Party (ANAP) Mesut Yilmaz, the first official meeting
after the December 24 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, emerging from the two-hour talks, said she had offered
Yilmaz a coalition partnership based on a rotating premiership,
with each leader heading the government for half of the five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
Ciller described the idea as "splitting an apple right down the
middle," saying that to ensure the government continuity, she
should take the first turn to lead the projected partnership.
</P>
<P>
However, Yilmaz made his opposition clear at a joint press
conference. He said that the nation wanted "a change in the shop
window," so he asked Ciller to reconsider her views on the turns.
</P>
<P>
"if this is not done, we have serious reservations about the
chances for success of the new government, and I have told her
(Ciller) that we would not want to be a party to it," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz is expected to hold more discussions on Ciller's offer
with his aides and make his decision within this week.
</P>
<P>
No single party obtained a simple majority out of the December
24 election, therefore a coalition government is inevitable.
