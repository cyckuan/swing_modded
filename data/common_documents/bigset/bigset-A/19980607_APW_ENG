Rapids, Fire win in shutouts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Ross Paule scored his third goal in two games as
the Colorado Rapids beat the San Jose Clash 2-0 Saturday night.
	   Paule scored the game-winner in the 50th minute. Paul Bravo
passed to Adrian Paz on the right flank, and Paz sent a cross to
Paule in the middle of the penalty area. Paule bounced a header
past goalkeeper David Kramer for his fourth goal of the season.
	   Chris Henderson scored his first goal of the season in the 56th
minute to ice the victory. Henderson beat Kramer with a shot into
the upper corner of the net from 22 yards (20 meters) out.
Defenders Tahj Jakins and Joey DiGiamarino assisted on the play.
	   Rapids goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann made four saves to earn the
shutout.
	   Colorado's defense has rebounded after a five-game losing streak
in which the Rapids were outscored 17-1. Colorado (6-8) has now won
three straight and outscored its opponents 7-1 during the streak.
	   San Jose (5-9) lost its third straight and has not scored a goal
in 239 minutes. The longest scoreless streak of the season _ 292
minutes _ belongs to the Miami Fusion.
 &UR; Fire 2, Crew 0
	   In Chicago, Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton posted his
league-leading fourth shutout Saturday night as his team beat the
Columbus Crew 2-0.
	   Rich Kotschau scored just eight minutes into the match,
finishing off a cross from Jerzy Podbrozny. Peter Nowak scored the
insurance goal seven minutes into the second half, breaking through
the center of the defense and beating Columbus goalie Mark
Dougherty from close range.
	   Thornton had to make just one save as the Fire outshot the Crew
17-8.
	   The victory moved Chicago (7-5) past idle Dallas into second
place in the Western Conference, 12 points behind Los Angeles.
Columbus (7-6) remains in second in the Eastern Conference.

No birthday celebrations for Indonesia's reclusive ex-president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ex-President Suharto turns
77 on Monday, but there will be no celebration for the man who last
month surrendered a 32-year-long iron grip over the world's fourth
most populous nation.
	   Forced to quit after mobs went on a rampage and angry protesters
demanded he be tried for corruption, Suharto has said nothing
publicly since his resignation on May 21.
	   In contrast, his successor, President B.J. Habibie, cannot seem
to get enough of the limelight and is basking in the glory of
rolling back many of Suharto's draconian ways.
	   The aloof, king-like Suharto usually avoided the media. But
Habibie chatted for hours on Saturday with editors and foreign
correspondents about his vision for ``accelerated evaluation'' to
bring Indonesia out of its economic crisis.
	   Suharto remains holed up at his private home on Cendana Street,
Central Jakarta, guarded by the powerful military from growing
calls for retribution against him and his super-rich family.
	   He rarely ventures outside the compound. Looking for solace, he
visited a mosque. One family member said the former autocrat has
slipped out to play a few rounds of golf in recent days.
	   Meanwhile, newly sworn-in President Habibie has busied himself
by releasing some political prisoners, lifting bans on labor unions
and abolishing restrictions on press freedoms.
	   He has pledged to cooperate fully with the Washington-based
International Monetary Fund to save the economy.
	   In addition, Habibie has also promised new electoral reforms
laws by August. Bans on the formation of new political parties will
be lifted as well.
	   Parliamentary elections have been scheduled for next May and a
1,000-seat national assembly will chose a new president by December
of 1999.
	   His embrace of reform is a dramatic turnaround for the once
staunch Suharto supporter. A friend of Suharto's since the 1950s,
he was rewarded for his loyalty by being elected vice-president
earlier this year.
	   On Saturday, he recounted how Suharto has told him 24 years ago
that both would one day lead Indonesia into the next century.
	   However, he denies that he is still taking orders from his
former mentor. He claims not have talked with Suharto since the
aging general stepped down.
	   ``Look what we have done,'' he said in reference to the changes
he has wrought in the wake of the end of Suharto's regime.
	   Still, he appears determined to protect his old boss.
	   ``I ask the people of the Republic of Indonesia to concentrate
on the future. It doesn't mean that corruption and nepotism and so
on will be forgotten. I ask them to leave it to the legal
process,'' Habibie said.
	   Many have called for Suharto to face trial for corruption and
abuse of power. Some want the state to seize billions of dollars
amassed by his family.
	   A party was held for Indonesia's former leader Saturday, but it
was not Suharto who was feted.
	   About 90 people gathered to celebrate the birth of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, who was replaced by Suharto after an
abortive communist coup in 1965.

Singaporeans cross border to Malaysia for cheaper medicine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Cost-conscious residents of
Singaporean have been heading to neighboring Malaysia for cheaper
medical treatment, a Malaysian newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Singaporeans with diabetes, for example, can buy a month's
supply of treatment medicine for only 2 ringgit (U.S. dlrs 0.5) in
Malaysia, far cheaper than the 600 ringgit (dlrs 153) they would
pay at home, The Star newspaper said.
	   ``I have been told that 10 to 15 foreigners, mostly
Singaporeans, seek treatment at (a local) hospital daily,'' Suresh
Naidu, a Malaysian politician, was quoted as saying by The Star.
	   Malaysia's government-subsidized hospitals charge only a nominal
fee for medical treatment and drugs.

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb tore through a train
traveling through southern Pakistan on Sunday, killing 20 people
and wounding 25 others, many of them seriously, police and
emergency workers said.
	   The train was six kilometers (three miles) outside Sukkur, some
200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Karachi, capital of the
southern Sindh province, when the bomb shattered the train just
before dawn, police said.
	   The train was headed toward the northwestern city of Peshawar,
they said.
	   No one immediately took responsibility for the bombing, but the
government has blamed rival India, for explosions in the
neighboring Sindh province and in the eastern Punjab province,
which borders India.
	   The government blamed India for a Friday bombing of a theater
that killed three people in eastern Lahore, capital of Punjab
province.
	   The government said it had received intelligence information
that Indian secret service agents would try to infiltrate into
Pakistan to conduct terrorist acts between June 5 and 7.
	   Pakistan and India routinely blame each other for acts of
terrorism on their soil. The two countries have fought three wars
since the South Asian subcontinent gained its independence in 1947
from the departing British.

Hong Kong leader says economy will rebound after ``some time''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Hong Kong will rebound from its
current economic downturn, though it will likely take ``some
time,'' the Chinese territory's leader said Sunday.
	   ``We are now in a very painful period of economic restructuring
because of years of high property values, high interest rates and
very high wages have threatened our competitiveness,'' said Hong
Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   ``It is a period of adjustment, but as before, we come out of it
very well and will be stronger, better and fitter,'' he said.
	   Figures released late last month showed Hong Kong's economy
contracting by 2 percent in the quarter ending in March, the first
period of negative growth in 13 years.
	   Avoiding questions as to whether Hong Kong was at the start of a
full-blown recession, Tung, speaking on a local news program, said
Hong Kong was in ``a process of adjusting ourselves.''
	   ``It will be some time realistically speaking before we will
come out of it,'' he said.
	   Separately, Tung said on the program that he does not believe
China will devalue the Chinese currency as a way to bolster its
economic performance.
	   ``China continues to be very competitive and there is no reason
for China to devalue,'' he said.
	   The Hong Kong leader is scheduled to visit Australia next week.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police said the body of a child found in a stream
was believed to be the missing son of a North Korean diplomat,
according to a news report Sunday.
	   Police said they were still conducting tests, but initial
evidence indicated it was the body of the two-year-old child who
went missing May 30 while on an outing with his father and other
diplomats from the North Korean embassy.
	   The child went missing in a park just 100 meters (yards) from
the North Korean embassy in central Moscow. The body was found in a
stream in the west of the city.

Former Khmer Rouge rebels register for Cambodian election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Khmer Rouge defectors who were
outlaws just three months ago will for the first time help select
Cambodia's new government with ballots, not bullets, officials said
Sunday.
	   The National Election Commission expects to register more than
10,000 ex-guerrillas and others in the one-time Khmer Rouge bastion
of Anlong Veng to vote in elections July 26, said Sarang Kamsan, an
aide to Chheng Phon, the commission chairman.
	   Anlong Veng came under control of the Phnom Penh government in
March after war-weary guerrillas rebelled against the leadership of
Ta Mok, who is believed to be pressed against the Thai border with
a few hundred die-hard followers.
	   The commission, charged with overseeing the polls, determined it
was technically feasible to let the defectors participate after
they were formally brought under government rule Friday.
	   ``Everyone here who can vote will,'' said Yim Phanna, a former
commander who helped lead the Anlong Veng defections. ``Why not?
Now we are citizens, we have that right.''
	   The Khmer Rouge were a much larger force when they boycotted
U.N.-organized polls in 1993 and threatened to kill Cambodians who
participated. Most Cambodians ignored the threats and voted for the
first time in decades.
	   The Maoist-inspired revolutionaries caused the deaths of as many
as 2 million Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979.
After they were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion, they continued to
wage civil war against successive governments.
	   The group has been breaking apart since 1996 and is believed to
be on its last legs. Anlong Veng was the last major stronghold.
	   Cambodian strongman Hun Sen has called the elections in a bid to
regain international legitimacy and aid lost after his violent coup
last July against his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.

it wasn't clear if the passengers were in any danger.
	   Turkish authorities asked the captain of the Ukrainian-flagged
ship, the Taras Shevchenko, to stop, but he refused, saying
everything was calm on board, the semi-official Anatolia news
agency said.
	   The ship was traveling through the Dardanelles straits and was
due to pass through Istanbul's Bosphorus straits Sunday morning,
Anatolia said. The two straits connect the Aegean Sea with the
Black Sea.
	   The passengers began sending distress signals when a Turkish
patrol boat approached the ship to carry out a health inspection,
Anatolia said. It wasn't known if the inspection occurred.
	   The passengers, from Azerbaijan, held up ``S.O.S.'' signs and
tossed a message to the patrol boat in a tin can reading:
	   ``On the Ukrainian boat, we are in danger. The children and the
elderly are in danger. The women and children are being held
hostage,'' the message read.
	   They said the boat was bringing the 530 passengers to Odessa, a
Ukrainian port city on the Black Sea, against their wishes.
	   They urged the maritime authorities to relay their message to
the consulates of Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Russia and Germany.
	   According to the Greek coast guard, the ship left the Athens
port of Piraeus with 271 crew members and 517 passengers and told
port authorities it was headed toward Italy.

	   In St. Louis, Bill Mueller ended another marathon between the
Giants and the Cardinals with a 14th-inning RBI single for a 5-4
victory Saturday night to extended San Francisco's winning streak
to eight games.
	   Brent Mayne walked off Sean Lowe (0-2) to start the 14th and
advanced on a sacrifice. Darryl Hamilton also walked before
Mueller, who was 2-for-7, dumped a single into shallow center that
scored Mayne.
	   Rich Rodriguez (1-0), San Francisco's seventh pitcher, worked
three scoreless innings as the Giants moved into first place in the
NL West, a game ahead of San Diego.
	   The five-hour, nine-minute game was the third extra-inning
contest in nine meetings between the teams, with previous marathons
of 17 and 12 innings.
	   Mark McGwire, who hit his major league-leading 28th home run on
Friday, went 0-for-3 with three intentional walks.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - For the first time in nearly four decades
residents of Beirut went to the polls to elect a municipal council
that Lebanese leaders hope will preserve the country's delicate
sectarian balance.
	   In the predominantly Shiite Muslim south Lebanon, the race for
municipal posts is between the two largest Shiite factions,
Hezbollah and Amal, over who controls the region where guerrillas
are fighting against Israeli occupation forces.
	   Polls in Beirut and the southern province opened at 7 a.m.
(0400gmt) and are expected to close at 5 p.m. (1400gmt).
	   There are nearly 400,000 eligible voters in Beirut and 380,000
in the the south. At stake are 24 city council seats in the capital
and 1,589 municipal posts in the south.
	   There will be no voting in the occupied zone along the border
with Israel.
	   In fear that minority Christians will fare poorly because of
Beirut's population shift, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri appealed to
voters not to ignore Christians in electing a new city council for
the Muslim majority capital.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb tore through a
cross-country train Sunday in southern Pakistan, killing 20 people
and wounding 25 others, many of them seriously, police and
emergency workers said.
	   The train was passing through a village 30 kilometers (18 miles)
outside Sukkur, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Karachi,
capital of the southern Sindh province, when the bomb shattered the
train just before dawn, police said.
	   The express, with about 1,000 passengers on board, was headed
toward the northwestern city of Peshawar, they said. Among the dead
were four children aged 5 or younger, police said.
	   ``When we arrived, the carriage was destroyed and bodies were
blown to pieces. Many of the passengers were trapped and shouting
for help,'' said ambulance driver Mohammed Hafiz.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, but
the government has blamed rival India for explosions in the
neighboring Sindh province and in the eastern border province of
Punjab.
	   The government blamed India for a Friday bombing of a theater
that killed three people in eastern Lahore, capital of Punjab
province.
	   The government said it had received intelligence information
that Indian secret service agents would try to infiltrate into
Pakistan to conduct terrorist acts between June 5 and 7.
	   Pakistan and India routinely blame each other for acts of
terrorism on their soil, but they rarely provide evidence to
support their claims.
	   The two countries have fought three wars since the South Asian
subcontinent gained its independence in 1947 from the departing
British.

Supporters of defeated candidate burn Philippine town hall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Supporters of a defeated mayoral
candidate in the Philippines allegedly set ablaze a town hall in a
suburb of the capital city, injuring at least seven people, local
officials said Sunday.
	   Scores of rowdy backers of the main opposition party's mayoral
candidate stormed the Navotas town hall Saturday night, and are
suspected of having doused it with gasoline and then setting it on
fire with torches, outgoing Mayor Felipe del Rosario said.
	   ``This is plain and simple arson,'' he said.
	   Police have arrested and begun questioning at least two people
linked to the blaze, fire officials said.
	   Del Rosario also alleged the attackers burned tires on the
street leading to the two-story town hall to block fire trucks.
	   An undetermined number of attackers fled the scene of the fire.
	   Among the injured were two policemen who jumped out of a window
on the second floor of the hall after it was set ablaze, officials
said.
	   The attackers were upset over suspicions of electoral fraud in
the mayoral election, which was won by the outgoing mayor's wife,
the mayor and fire officials said. The wife was scheduled to be
proclaimed as the winner on Monday, officials said.
	   The general elections held May 11 were among the Philippines'
most peaceful ever, although at least 45 people were killed and
protests over alleged electoral fraud broke out in many towns and
cities.

Johns leads Newcastle to victory

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Newcastle scrum half Andrew Johns
backed up from Friday's State of Origin match to push his team to
the outright lead in Australia's National Rugby League competition
on the weekend.
	   The Knights went alone at the top after scoring an 18-16 victory
over Cronulla on Saturday, while St. George fell from the joint
ladder lead with a surprise 22-20 loss at Adelaide.
	   Johns was outstanding in New South Wales' win over Queensland on
Friday and continued his fine form 24 hours later when he played
the full 80 minutes. The Knights were down 16-12 with 12 minutes
left before Johns regathered his own kick ahead and sparked a try
for Mark Hughes.
	   ``They were all over us until then, and probably deserved to
win, but to our guys' credit we showed why we keep winning games
this year,'' Johns said.
	   Adelaide pulled off the upset of the season by beating the
Saints. Former Canberra Raider Graham Appo booted Adelaide home
with a conversion from the sideline after the scores were locked at
20-20 with four minutes left to play.
	   St. George, chasing a club record 10th win in a row, led 20-8
midway through the second half.
	   Melbourne scored a 25-16 win at Balmain to stay one point behind
Newcastle and move above St. George.
	   Brisbane, playing without regulars Steve Renouf and Darren
Smith, had a controversial 20-16 loss to Parramatta at ANZ Stadium
on Sunday.
	   Petero Civonicivea just missed a try in the dying minutes when
his stretch for the line just failed. In the last minute Gorden
Tallis had the ball stripped from him illegally as the Broncos
moved within five meters, but referee Brian Grant waved play on.
	   Brisbane slipped to an 8-5 record after losing the past three in
a row while Parramatta moved into equal third with the Saints.
	   Wests' coach Tommy Raudonikis blasted his team after they
crashed to a dismal 40-10 loss to the North Queensland Cowboys.
	   Raudonikis offered only two sentences at the post-match news
conference before walking out.
	   ``We were bloody disgraceful. We've got plenty of work to do,''
he said.
	   Auckland's Gene Ngamu potted a late field goal to give the
Warriors a 15-14 win over Penrith.
	   Sydney City thrashed South Sydney 30-6, Norths crushed
Canterbury 38-4 and the Gold Coast was dumped 32-10 by Illawarra.
Manly hosts Canberra on Monday.

Beirut fears losing its sectarian balance in municipal polls

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents of Beirut went to the polls
Sunday to elect a municipal council that Lebanese leaders hope will
preserve the country's delicate sectarian balance.
	   In the predominantly Shiite Muslim south Lebanon, the race for
municipal posts is between the two largest Shiite factions,
Hezbollah and Amal, to control the region where guerrillas are
fighting against Israeli occupation forces.
	   Polls in Beirut and the southern province opened at 7 a.m. (0400

1,589 municipal posts in the South.
	   There will be no voting in the occupied zone along the border

	   Beirut, the city where the civil war of 1975-90 began, elected a
half-Muslim, half-Christian council in its last local elections 35
years ago. But the city's demography has since changed in favor of
the Muslims.
	   Afraid that minority Christians will fare poorly because of
Beirut's population shift, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri appealed to
voters not to ignore Christians in electing a new city council for
the Muslim majority capital.
	   ``Let's maintain the national balance and give mutual
coexistence top consideration when voting,'' said Hariri, a Sunni
Muslim who has endorsed a slate of candidates that includes
Christians, Sunnis and Shiite Muslims.
	   Christian politicians have voiced fears that their sect will
become marginalized in Beirut's elections.
	   A similar shift has occurred in the northern city of Tripoli,
which on May 31, in the second stage of the four-stage polls,
reduced its Christian minority to a single member on its council.

New Indonesian leader wants end to anti-Chinese discrimination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Suharto Birthday
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Angry Indonesian mobs blamed the
Southeast Asian country's Chinese minority for the worst economic
crisis in 30 years, burning and ransacking Chinese-owned shops and
homes last month.
	   But Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, has called for an
end to deeply ingrained anti-Chinese sentiment in the world's
fourth most populous nation.
	   His plea was hailed by ethnic Chinese leaders Sunday.
	   Appearing before local media executives and a handful of foreign
correspondents on Saturday, Habibie said all Indonesian-born people
have equal rights.
	   For generations indigenous Indonesia have referred to themselves
as ``pribumi,'' or ``sons of the soil,'' while regarding even
locally-born Chinese as outsiders.
	   But Habibie said Indonesian society should no longer be spilt
along indigenous-versus-Chinese lines.
	   ``I regard all citizens who serve the people, including those of
Chinese-ethnic origin, as pribumi,'' he said.
	   Thousands of fearful Chinese left Indonesia when the violence
erupted, killing almost 1,200 people of both races and helping
force former President Suharto out of office. Many scared
Indonesians painted ``Pribumi'' on their walls and doors to ward
off rampaging mobs.
	   Surya Chandra, who chairs the Indonesian Youth Committee for
Abolition of Race Discrimination, welcomed Habibie's comments.
	   ``It's the first time such a statement has come from an
Indonesian president,'' said Chandra, himself of Chinese stock.
	   But he said Habibie must back up words with action, starting
with tackling discrimination embedded in Indonesia's bureaucracy.
	   For example, he said, while many Chinese have adopted Indonesian
names to fit in with majority, a number code on their identity
cards indicates they are of Chinese origin.
	   Ethnic Chinese people make up only about four percent of
Indonesia's 202 million population. However, they dominate commerce
and industry.
	   Many are Christian or Buddhist in a society that is 90 percent
Muslim.
	   During former President Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule, a
small clique of Chinese entrepreneurs, along with Suharto's family,
built huge business empires and made fortunes under his patronage.
	   When the economy went sour last year, the whole Chinese
community became scapegoats for soaring prices and mass
unemployment.
	   Until very recently Chinese-Indonesians have tried to keep a low
profile in national affairs. But last week a coalition of Chinese
businessmen said they would form their own political party.

	   GALLE, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Nervous New Zealand lost five wickets
for 20 runs in the first hour of play as Sri Lanka won the second
cricket Test by an innings and 16 runs on the final day of the
match in this southern city Sunday.
	   The match was over in the 43rd minute of the fifth day's play
when first slip Sanath Jayasuriya held on to a simple catch from
the last batsman Shyane O'Conner, who went for nought off Muttiah
Muralitheran.
	   New Zealand resumed from an overnight 94 for 5 and hit trouble
in the very first over when left arm spinner Niroshan
Bandaratilleke had Chris Cairns caught by close-in fielder Hashan
Tillekaratne for his overnight score of 16.
	   The New Zealand innings then caved in without resistance, all
out at 114 with Adam Parore remaining unbeaten on 32.
	   After taking a first innings lead of 130 runs, Sri Lanka had
taken five quick wickets on Saturday to leave New Zealand on 94 for
5 with Adam Parore and Cairns struggling at the crease on 25 and 16
respectively.
	   With Sunday's win, Sri Lanka leveled the three-test series. It
lost the first test to New Zealand by 167 runs last week.
	   Bandaratilleke, playing only his second Test, finished with
bowling figures of 9 for 83 but batsman Mahela Jayawardena, Sri
Lanka's rising star, was adjudged man-of-the-match for his innings
of 167.
	   The bus carrying the Sri Lankan team was mobbed outside the
pavilionby autograph hunters and hundreds more waved at the players
on the nearby highway as they drove back to their hotel.
	   The third and deciding Test begins in Colombo on Wednesday.

World leaders convene for three-day conference on global drug
</HEADLINE>
problem &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Leaders of the world's major
drug-producing and drug-consuming nations open a three-day
conference Monday to combat trafficking, curb demand and strengthen
global cooperation in the fight against drugs.
	   The goal of the U.N. General Assembly ``special session on
drugs'' is to endorse target dates for governments to enact
legislation on issues such as money-laundering, judicial
cooperation, reducing demand for drugs and stamping out cultivation
of illicit crops.
	   ``Around the world, there is a growing consensus that more needs
to be done to understand and reduce the rising demand for drugs,''
the United Nations said in a report.
	   But critics fear the United Nations is placing too much emphasis
on legal measures, following a path which has largely failed in the
United States, and should consider drugs a health problem.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who delivers the opening address
Monday, has pledged to cut drug use by half in the United States _
the world's leading drug consumer _ by the year 2007.
	   Latin American leaders say their own efforts to curtail drug
production and trafficking will fail unless Americans curb their
appetite for narcotics.
	   That message is expected to be delivered forcefully by Latin
American presidents expected at the conference. They include
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, Venezuelan President Rafael
Caldera, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, Bolivian President
Hugo Banzer and President Ernesto Samper of Colombia.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi are also among the first day speakers.
	   The conference is expected to approve a plan of action prepared
in March by representatives of 130 countries in Vienna, Austria.
The plan sets a target date of 2003 for countries to pass laws to
control money landering and increase judicial cooperation.
	   It also sets 2008 as the target for significantly reducing
illicit cultivation of cocoa, cannabis and opium poppies and for
controlling the spread of amphetamines.
	   Some critics believe the United Nations should consider drugs as
a health problem and use the resources of the World Health
Organization to develop effective treatment programs.
	   ``Drug policy is a global public health concern,'' said Dr. Alex
Wodak, director of alcohol and drug services at St. Vincent's
Hospital in Sydney, Australia. ``The U.N.'s exaggerated emphasis on
interdiction and criminalization makes it impossible to protect
public health.''
	   In an open letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, about
500 prominent figures from around the world said the ``global war
on drugs is now causing more harm than drug abuse itself.''
	   ``Human rights are violated, environmental assaults perpetrated
and prisons inundated with hundreds of thousands of drug
violators,'' the letter said. It called for a drug program based on
``common sense, science, public health and human rights.''
	   Among the signers were former U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz, former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, and former President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
	   Pino Arlacchi, head of the U.N. drug control office in Vienna,
insists that the United Nations has no intention of promoting a
U.S.-style ``war on drugs'' on a global scale.
	   ``For the first time, we have the issue of demand reduction
included at the same level as other components of narcotics
control,'' Arlacchi said. He cited proposals for treatment,
educational campaigns and incentives to farmers to grow alternative
crops.
	   But the U.N. drug office has frowned on novel experiments, such
as Swiss program to prescribe limited amounts of heroin to addicts.
	   More than two-thirds of the Swiss addicts had been involved in
prostitution, drug trafficking and other criminal activity when
they enrolled in the program. The number dropped to 10 percent, the
study showed.

Bulldogs increase their lead in AFL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Western Bulldogs went two wins clear at
the top of the Australian Football League ladder with an impressive
win over defending champion Adelaide on Sunday.
	   As Sydney suffered its second humiliating loss in succession,
the Bulldogs made the most of their rival's stumble by thrashing
Adelaide 24.11 (155) to 13.10 (88). The Bulldogs had a 9-2 record
at the half-way mark of the season to lead Sydney and Melbourne on
7-4 and St. Kilda, which is 7-3 with a game in hand.
	   Sydney was beaten 24.16 (160) to 15.10 (100) against Essendon
after a 101-point loss against St. Kilda a week earlier.
	   The Swans won their first five matches but have lost four of
their last six games.
	   West Coast Eagles continued their good run with a two-point
victory over Port Adelaide on Saturday night.
	   Port led from the 24th minute of the second quarter until
time-on in the last term. But the hosts failed to score a goal in
the last quarter while Eagles midfielder Ben Cousins scored twice
to secure a 8.9.(57) to 7.13.(55) victory.
	   Melbourne bounced back after a mini mid-season slump to go
fourth with a 18.9 (117) to 10.10 (70) win over Hawthorn.
	   Demons forward Jeff Farmer kicked three goals in the opening
quarter to give them a flying start and finished along with Garry
Lyon with four goals each.
	   Demons coach Neale Daniher warned that the side was ``still
around the place'' and was now well positioned for a finals attack.
	   ``To be 7-4 at the halfway mark considering we have gone on the
road four times is a pretty good position to be in,'' Daniher said.
	   At the MCG Geelong repelled two second half charges from Carlton
to win their rain-affected match by 17 points on Saturday.
	   The Blues drew level in the third quarter and trailed by only
three points late in the last term, but the Cats held on to win
12.8 (80) to 9.9 (63).

Philippine Airlines pilots continue strike despite dismissal
</HEADLINE>
threat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines pilots continued
a strike and staged a protest march Sunday, defying airline threats
of dismissal unless they return to work.
	   The strike at the financially-troubled airline began Friday,
forcing international and domestic flight cancellations and
stranding hundreds of passengers.
	   Calling the strike illegal, the airline fired 29 officers of the
620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines Saturday
and warned remaining members would also be dismissed if they didn't
return to work by noon of Sunday.
	   Instead of returning to work, the pilots marched around a PAL
compound in metropolitan Manila's suburban Paranaque city,
brandishing placards that read ``Give labor its due'' and ``All is
not well in PAL.''
	   The strikers staged a countdown and yelled, ``jobless!'' at noon
Sunday.
	   Union spokesman Florendo Umali said the dismissal of the union
officers was illegal and warned they would go on with the strike
indefinitely until their demands are met.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of retiring
pilots who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours,
regardless of age. This policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of
being ``retired,'' Umali said.
	   PAL called the strike illegal because the Department of Labor
has assumed jurisdiction over the labor dispute. Labor department
officials were determining whether the strike was illegal or not,
and trying to mediate.
	   PAL scheduled five international flights out of Manila,
including three bound for Hong Kong, one for Singapore and another
for Los Angeles and 14 domestic flights to 12 provinces Sunday,
using management pilots.
	   It said it would open ticket offices in the capital to rebook
flights, refund unused tickets and deal with stranded passengers.
	   Over the past four years, the airline has incurred annual losses
ranging from 451.4 million pesos (dlrs 11.3 million) to 2.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 62.5 million), in part because of large debts, an aging
fleet and Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL says it faces an ``uncertain future,'' and announced plans
earlier this year to cut expenses by as much as 40 percent, slash
flights, and sharply reduce its work force. The airline hasn't
disclosed an estimate for its manpower reduction, but employees
fear it could be as much as 30 percent.
	   The union filed a notice of strike in December following the
company's early retirement of Capt. Albino Collantes, 45, a senior
pilot. But it said it delayed the strike after considering its
impact on the company.
	   In calling the strike Friday, the union accused management of
filing administrative charges against another pilot and union
officer who delayed a flight by returning to the gate for
refueling, and of delays in turning over union dues.
	   The refueling delay will be investigated under proper
procedures, airline officials said.
	   PAL is controlled by Chinese Filipino tycoon Lucio Tan. It had
been completely owned by the Philippine government from 1941 until
it was partly sold in 1992.

<TEXT>
	   LE MANS, France (AP) - Two Porsche cars lost big leads as dawn
broke Sunday morning at the Le Mans 24 hour race, allowing a Toyota
to challenge for the winning spot.
	   With five hours left in the race, a Porsche GT1 driven by Alan
McNish, Laurent Aiello and Stephane Ortelli was in the lead with
275 laps completed.
	   Only 24 seconds behind stood the Toyota GT vehicle in the hands
of Thierry Boutsen, Ralf Kelleners and Geoff Lees.
	   Another Porsche GT One driven by Jorg Muller, Uwe Alzen and Bob
Wolleck, was in third, with 274 laps.
	   Earlier, Porsche cars held a three lap lead at the 12-hour mark
of the endurance race.
	   But Porsche chiefs could only look on as driver error and
mechanical failure left both cars in the pits for more than half an
hour as dayliught came.
	   First the car driven by Muller, Alzen and Wolleck, while in
second place, was in the pits for 31 minutes.
	   The car needed new brakes and a change in undercarriage after
Muller skidded out of control in rain.
	   Within minutes the leading car, the Porsche driven by McNish,
Aiello and Ortelli, was also in trouble.
	   With McNish behind the wheel, the car had a water leak and was
in the pits for 35 minutes.
	   Porsche's problems allowed the Toyota One driven by Boutsen,
Kelleners and Lees to move into contention.
	   Two Nissans R390s were also performing well, lying in fourth and
fifth place.
	   As the drivers prepared for the final five hours, the skies
cleared again and a finish in dry conditions was predicted.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With a border dispute escalating into
bombing raids, hundreds of foreigners scrambled out of Eritrea on
Sunday, fearing it will be engulfed in war with Ethiopia. One of
their main escape routes earlier had come under attack for a second
straight day.
	   Ethiopian jets bombed a military-civilian airport on the
outskirts of Asmara on for the second time Saturday, forcing
embassies to step up their exit plans.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried foreigners
out of harm's way late Saturday and early Sunday after Ethiopia
agreed to temporarily halt bombing.
	   Weary expatriates crowded the airport parking lot, waiting for
to be evacuated. Angered and confused by the sudden violence in
this capital of broad boulevards and modern buildings, no one
wanted to talk about his decision to go.
	   ``In principle, this is the last of the evacuations, but in
practice, if
	   someone wants to leave we'll try to help,'' said French
Ambassador Louis Le Vert.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   But the two countries dispute at least six areas along their
common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered Eritrea
in 1885.
	   Relations between the one-time allies soured when Eritrea
introduced its own currency in November in an effort to reassert
its independence.
	   On Saturday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Susan
Rice stepped up a campaign of shuttle diplomacy in an effort to
broker dialogue between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Rice left the West African nation of Burkina Faso and a meeting
of the Organization of African Unity for Ethiopia and Eritrea where
she hopes to meet once again with leaders.
	   Rice is promoting a peace plan for the two feuding Horn of
Africa nations. The plan was drafted by the United States and
Rwanda.
	   ``The peace recommendations by the United States and Rwanda
constitute a
	   reasonable basis for a peaceful resolution for the conflict,''
Rice told journalists in Ouagadougou, the Burkina Faso capital.
	   The proposal includes a call to Eritrea to redeploy to positions
held prior to May 6 back from the northwestern Ethiopian region of
Badme where hostilities were first reported _ in other words, to
withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its territory.
	   Eritrea, however, claims it is rightfully in territory defined
by boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   In Asmara, government spokesman Issac Yared said Eritrea broadly
agreed with the four-point peace plan but said any accord must
include a precise demarcation of the border.
	   ``We need to work out the details to achieve a lasting
solution,'' he said.
	   Late Saturday, foreign diplomats met with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa and received a pledge that
Ethiopian warplanes would suspend their bombing of the airport from
Saturday evening until Sunday morning so evacuations could take
place, Italian Ambassador Marcello Ricoveri said.
	   Afterward, German military aircraft carrying 210 Europeans took
off for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the German Defense Ministry said. And
a British air force plane picked up the remaining 40 Britons and
about 60 Australian, Canadian and South African nationals and took
off for Jeddah, the British Defense Ministry said.
	   Le Vert said two U.S. and two Italian planes also carried
foreigners from
	   Asmara to neighboring Djibouti, but he didn't know how many
people were aboard.
	   When the U.S. plane arrived, Marines jumped out and deployed
into combat
	   position, startling Eritreans working at the airport, which was
under a cease-fire.
	   Earlier Saturday, a U.plane with 194 people aboard arrived in
Frankfurt, Germany, 129 of them Americans.
	   The number of foreigners still waiting to be evacuated from
Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea, was not
known.
	   With the attacks on Asmara's airport, a quick resolution to the
crisis appeared unlikely.
	   ``At the moment, I'm not seeing any light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki told reporters
Saturday.
	   There was no word on casualties from Saturday's bombing, but
Eritrea claimed to have shot down one of the Ethiopian MiG 23
fighter-bombers and to have captured its pilot. Ethiopia confirmed
the downing.
	   A source in the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said the Ethiopians
had shot down an Eritrean MiG over northeastern Ethiopia on Friday
and troops had taken the pilot into captivity. At the same time, he
denied that Eritrea had downed any of its planes Friday as claimed
by Asmara.
	   A source familiar with the Eritrean Air Force, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Ethiopia clearly was trying to wipe
out Eritrea's small force, which consists of a half-dozen aging
Soviet-era MiG fighter-bombers.
	   Ethiopia's army also outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by
about three to one.
	   Ethiopia said its Friday bombing raid on the same airport was in
retaliation for an Eritrean air attack on Mekele, 125 miles (200
kilometers) north of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. At least
44 Ethiopian civilians were killed and 135 wounded in Mekele,
according to government-run Radio Fana.

Over 300 foreigners evacuated from Eritrea arrive in Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ More than 300 foreigners evacuated
from war-torn Eritrea have arrived in the Red Sea port city of
Jiddah, officials at foreign embassies said Sunday.
	   Of those, 101 foreigners evacuated from the Eritrean capital
Asmara arrived Sunday in Jiddah aboard a British Royal Air Force
plane, the British Embassy said.
	   The embassy statement said 41 of the people evacuated were
British. The remaining 60 passengers were Australian, Canadian and
South African nationals, according to the British Defense Ministry.
	   ``The consulate general has arranged hotel accommodation for the
evacuees and will be helping these British nationals make onward
flight arrangements,'' said the statement.
	   More than 200 Germans, mainly businessmen and their families,
arrived from the Eritrean capital Asmara late Saturday, a German
embassy spokesman said Sunday. They will leave for Germany later
Sunday, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   Eritrea and Ethiopia's territorial dispute, which has escalated
into bombing raids, has propelled hundreds of foreigners out of
Eritrea in fears that it will be engulfed in war with Ethiopia.
	   On Saturday, Ethiopian jets again bombed a military-civilian
airport not far from the Eritrean capital Asmara, forcing embassies
to step up their exit plans.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried foreigners
out of harm's way late Saturday after Ethiopia agreed to

Southeast Asian growth sustainable only after financial reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Sustainable growth could return to Southeast
Asia in three to five years, but only after financial and banking
reform, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said in remarks
made available Sunday.
	   ``The end of the economic crisis in Southeast Asia, and the
restoration of economic growth can only come about with the
establishment of properly regulated and well supervised banking and
financial systems,'' said Tan during a speech at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Boston on Saturday.
	   He said that regional economies can return to sustainable growth
in three to five years provided ``the governments in the region
have the necessary will and determination'' to implement such
changes.
	   Tan argued that Southeast Asian banks were not equipped to
handle the large influx of foreign capital in the 90's, and bank
practices ``have not kept up with the rapid pace of growth in the
last few years.''
	   He said between 1990 and 1996, the flow of private capital from
industrial countries to emerging economies in the region grew five
times, to dlrs 200 billion from dlrs 40 billion.
	   He added that sound domestic banking systems were sometimes
lacking during those years of easy money, and when confidence in
Asia ebbed, large outflows of capital precipitated the crisis.
	   Although he did not specify what reforms were needed, regional
and international bodies like the Asian Development Bank and the
International Monetary Fund have stressed the need for greater
transparency in the banking sector and more cautious lending
practices.
	   Tan added that for the short term, the political and economic
situation in Indonesian remained the ``main worry,'' because the
country occupies a large and important role in Southeast Asia.
	   Despite riding the storm better than its neighbors, Singapore
has felt the pinch too, he said. The island republic's commerce and
financial sectors, which rely heavily on regional trade and
activity, have been ``severely affected by the regional downturn.''
	   But he said Singapore would reap the benefits of its sound
macroeconomics, large foreign reserves, fiscal surpluses, and its
well established trade with the strong U.S. and European economies.

Aid workers try to assess danger of epidemics in Afghanistan

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid workers were trying Sunday to
assess whether serious disease has broken out in remote villages of
northern Afghanistan devastated during last weekend's earthquake.
	   The quake killed up to 4,700 people and injured thousands of
others, according to Afghan authorities. It smashed houses, buried
wells and swallowed crops and livestock.
	   The United Nations and Red Cross have delivered food to 31 of
the approximately 100 affected villages.
	   An outbreak of bloody diarrhea was reported in the Chah-ab
region, about 60 kilometers (38 miles) west of Faisabad, said U.N.
spokesman Rupert Colville. Red Cross helicopters postponed some
emergency food deliveries and set out for the region to investigate
whether the outbreak might signal shigella or dysentery.
	   Both diseases spread quickly when water supplies are polluted.
In addition to destroying wells, the May 30 quake cut channels and
pipes carrying spring water to villages, and landslides
accompanying the quake have filled rivers with mud.
	   Chris Johnson, a water specialist with the Oxfam relief
organization, said that the remoteness of the affected villages,
and the fact that most people appeared to be staying put, could
help stem any serious epidemic.
	   ``What we're all really worried about is the possibility of a
lot of displaced people concentrating,'' Johnson said.
	   About 700 families were reported to be walking from Malwan,
about 35 kilometers (22 miles) west of Faisabad, to Rostaq, a
provincial center about 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the southwest,
Johnson said.
	   Oxfam has sent a representative to try to find out whether the
approximately 4,000 people are on the move because they are hungry
or because they fear further earthquakes. If they are afraid to go
home, aid workers will have to organize camps for them, Johnson
said.

Beirut fears losing its sectarian balance in municipal polls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hariri voting, comments, army deployment. First
results expected after 2100gmt. &QL; 
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Sunday
urged Beirut's Muslims and Christians to ``put the war behind
them'' and use the first municipal elections in 35 years to
preserve the city's delicate sectarian balance.
	   In the predominantly Shiite Muslim South Lebanon, the race for
municipal posts is between the two largest Shiite factions,
Hezbollah and Amal, over who controls the region where guerrillas
are fighting against Israeli occupation forces.
	   The government deployed thousands of army troops in armored
vehicles and trucks to ensure safe voting in both regions. Soldiers
manned road intersections and stood on guard outside polling
stations.
	   Polls in Beirut and the southern province opened at 7 a.m.
(0400gmt) and are expected to close at 5 p.m. (1400gmt).
	   There are nearly 400,000 eligible voters in Beirut and 380,000
in the the south. At stake are 24 city council seats in the capital
and 1,589 municipal posts in the south.
	   There will be no voting in the occupied zone along the border
with Israel.
	   Hariri, a Sunni Muslim moderate, has been campaigning for
Christian-Muslim coexistence in the Lebanese capital amid Christian
fears that the Muslim majority could overwhelm them and drive them
out of city council.
	   The prime minister, joined by moderate Muslim clerics, appealed
on television to voters not to ignore Christians in electing a new
city council for the Muslim majority capital.
	   Hariri, who has endorsed a slate of candidates that includes
Christians, Sunnis and Shiite Muslims, appeared confident of a
balanced outcome.
	   After casting his vote Sunday morning, the prime minister called
on residents ``to leave the war behind them and seriously show that
Beirut is the capital of Lebanon, capital of coexistence and
(sectarian) balance.''
	   Beirut, the city where the civil war of 1975-90 began, elected a
half-Muslim, half-Christian council in its last local elections 35
years ago. But the city's demography has since changed in favor of
the Muslims.
	   A similar shift has occurred in the northern city of Tripoli,
which on May 31, in the second stage of the four-stage polls,
reduced its Christian minority to one member on its council. There
had been four in the last elected council.
	   Christian politicians have voiced fears that their sect will
similarly become marginalized in Beirut's elections.
	   In the other part of the country voting on Sunday, the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian Amal groups are vying
for the votes of southern Lebanon.
	   All attempts to get the two Shiite groups to agree on a joint
ticket failed.
	   Hezbollah, whose guerrillas are the most active opponents of the
Israeli occupation of part of southern Lebanon, trounced the
mainstream Amal in municipal elections in Shiite districts of Mount
Lebanon on May 24.
	   Hezbollah hopes the polls will consolidate its claim to lead the
1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest single sect.
	   The municipal polls, widely seen as extending democracy after
the civil war, began in Mount Lebanon and are scheduled to end in
the eastern Bekaa Valley on June 14.

Acropolis auto rally starts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The 45th Acropolis motor rally got
underway from Athens Sunday, designed to test drivers and cars in
one of the toughest competitions for the world driving
championship.
	   A total of 32 foreign and 71 Greek drivers were flagged off from
the foot of the Athens Acropolis hill in one minute intervals.
	   The 1,036 kilometers (647 miles) rally takes cars over some of
Greece's best and worst roads through valleys and picturesque
villages. Seventeen special stages totaling 388 kilometers (243
miles) will also test the ability of the drivers to control their
cars at high speeds on narrow dirt roads with sharp turns.
	   Unlike previous races, this year's three-day rally will end in
the western town of Delphi. The ancient Greeks considered Delphi to
be the center of the world. It was also the site of the oracle that
ancient Greeks would seek prophesies of the future.
	   Last year's Acropolis Rally winner, Spain's Carlos Sainz with
co-driver Luis Moya in a Toyota Corolla WRC, is a leading contender
for first place. Sainz, the current leader of the world driving
championship, was also the winner of the 1990 and 1994 Acropolis
rallies.
	   Britain's Colin McRae with co-driver Nicky Grist in a Subaru
Impreza WRC and Finland's Tommi Makinen with co-driver Risto
Mannisenmaki in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 5, are also among the
favorites to win the gruelling race.
	   Makinen, who had won twice the title of the world driving
championship but never an Acropolis rally, expressed confidence
that everything will go well.
	   ``It's going to be hard...it's a big fight for sure, but we did
good preparations.''
	   Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota, all of Japan, are vying for the
prestigious manufacturer's cup.

No team in World Cup, but Thailand in top league for gambling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has no team in the World Cup
and has struggled to recover from a region-wide economic crisis,
but the Southeast Asian country is still playing for major stakes
in soccer's greatest event _ through illegal gambling.
	   ``Soccer gambling is the police department's top priority to
crack down on at the moment,'' said Pol. Maj. Gen. Chatt Kuldiloke,
adviser to a newly created special World Cup gambling task force.
``We believe the gambling will be intense over France '98.''
	   Police predicted this weekend that 30 billion (dlrs 750 million)
will be gambled and have braced for an increase in suicides and
robberies in the anticipation that fortunes wagered _ and often
lost _ will lead to desperate acts.
	   Gambling is illegal in Thailand, but the laws are widely
ignored. From cockfights to kick-boxing to underground lotteries,
placing bets has become embedded in Thai culture. Money changes
hands openly at arenas, through calls to bookmakers or via Internet
web sites.
	   Channel Islands-based William Hill International even placed an
advertisement Friday in a major newspaper urging readers to ``open
an account now and be ready for the World Cup.''
	   Words like ``gamble'' and ``bet'' were not used, but the message
was clear.
	   Soccer is an increasingly popular gambling vehicle. The World
Cup was broadcast live in Thailand via satellite television for the
first time in 1994 and quickly became a favorite.
	   Fans can now see soccer matches on TV most nights from the
European and South American leagues, but few claim they watch just
for love of the sport.
	   Cup fever has worried Thailand's Education Ministry because
recent research suggests students as young as their early teens are
wagering their lunch money _ and sometimes more _ on soccer.
	   ``More student crimes will occur,'' said Deputy Minister Somsak
Prisana-nantakul. ``But what we're worried of is suicide by those
who cannot pay their debts.''
	   Despite fears of suicides, none have yet been reported. But the
case of a university law student, Rewat Kengsakul, has crystallized
fears of how gambling can corrupt the young.
	   Rewat, 18, was arrested in April after using an air-gun to rob a
gold shop to clear a 9,000 baht (dlrs 225) gambling debt. He was
arrested with 33 gold chains in his possession and is currently
awaiting trial.
	   Students interviewed by the Bangkok Post newspaper say that
soccer gambling is rife and that bookies wait outside campuses. On
weekend nights, when there are several matches, one bookie said he
often collected up to 1 million baht (dlrs 25,000) in bets.
	   Chokchai Banjongsawas, an office worker and soccer fan, summed
up the soccer craze: ``It's a great, fun sport and it only takes 90
minutes to know the outcome of whether we're to win or lose.
Boxing, horse racing are too common and too familiar.''
	   Bookies normally accept no bet lower than 1,000 baht (dlrs 40).
	   Gambling aside, Bangkok pubs foresee a brisk trade during the
tournament and are jostling with each other to publicize the size
of their giant-screen televisions.
	   Cup fever, along with a special promotion, was attributed by
sales staff at a Bangkok department store for the doubling of TV
sales ahead of the tournament, economic slump notwithstanding.
	   ``I want a big screen,'' said Surat Saicharoen, 37. ``If the
screen is big, the ball will also be big. I think it affects your
cheers.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The 45th Acropolis motor rally got
underway Sunday from Athens, designed to test drivers and cars in
one of the toughest competitions for the world driving
championship.
	   A total of 32 foreign and 71 Greek drivers were flagged off from
the foot of the Athens Acropolis hill in one-minute intervals.
	   The 1,036-kilometer (647-mile) rally takes cars over some of
Greece's best and worst roads, through valleys and picturesque
villages. Seventeen special stages totaling 388 kilometers (243
miles) will also test the ability of the drivers to control their
cars at high speeds on narrow dirt roads with sharp turns.
	   Unlike previous races, this year's three-day rally will end in
the western town of Delphi. The ancient Greeks considered Delphi to
be the center of the world. It was also the site of the oracle that
ancient Greeks would seek prophecies of the future.
	   Last year's Acropolis Rally winner, Spain's Carlos Sainz with
co-driver Luis Moya in a Toyota Corolla WRC, is a leading contender
for first place. Sainz, the current leader of the world driving
championship, also won the 1990 and 1994 Acropolis rallies.
	   Britain's Colin McRae with co-driver Nicky Grist in a Subaru
Impreza WRC and Finland's Tommi Makinen with co-driver Risto
Mannisenmaki in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 5, are also among the
favorites to win the grueling race.
	   Makinen, who had won twice the title of the world driving

	   ``It's going to be hard ... it's a big fight for sure, but we

Tehran mayor goes on trial for corruption, pleads not guilty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The trial of Tehran mayor Gholamhossein
Karbaschi started Sunday, with the reformist mayor describing as
``lies'' the corruption charges brought against him.
	   Karbaschi, 44, arrived at the courtroom in his trademark dark
blue suit, flanked by his two lawyers, looking relaxed and
confident.
	   In front of a packed courtroom at the Imam Khomeini Judiciary
Complex in central Tehran, Karbaschi pleaded innocent. He said the
charges of embezzlement, fraud, and mismanagement of public funds
brought against him were trumped up.
	   ``All of the charges against me are absolute lies. I don't
accept any of them,'' the black-bearded Karbaschi told the judge
calmly.
	   After Karbaschi's statement, the trial was adjourned until
Thursday.
	   Karbaschi was arrested April 4 when Chief Judge Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, a hard-liner, accused him of misappropriating
public funds in a wide-ranging corruption scandal and ordered him
detained.
	   But the move was widely seen as a bid to topple key officials
allied with moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who took
office in August. Karbaschi had run Khatami's election campaign.
	   In the scandal, more than a dozen senior municipality officials
have been put on trial since last October. Most were accused of _
or sentenced for _ issuing building permits in restricted zones in
return for large kickbacks.
	   Karbaschi was freed April 15 after a series of street protests
that turned violent.
	   He was released after the intervention of Iran's spiritual
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, considered an ally of hard-liners.
	   Dozens of reporters attended the trial, and extra policemen were
on patrol around the courthouse complex.
	   Karbaschi's arrest ignited a long-simmering power struggle
between moderate and hard-line clerics. His case has gripped the
nation, generating hundreds of stories for and against the mayor.
	   As mayor since 1989, Karbaschi has improved the capital's
appearance as well as public services for its 8 million residents.
	   Despite his popularity, he has critics who consider his
administration high-handed and who dislike him for taxing the
powerful merchants who make up the hard-liners' power base.
	   The mayor went back to work days after his release. But
according to Iranian law, he is not allowed to work while the trial
is under way.

Harada wins Resorttrust Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITA, Japan (AP) _ Overnight co-leader Kaori Harada won her
second title of the season Sunday, clinching a two-stroke victory
in the Resorttrust Ladies with a final round of 2-under-par 70.
	   Harada, winner of the Glory Queens in April, shot four birdies
and two bogeys for a 9-under 207 total, two shots ahead of Natsuko
Noro.
	   Harada's seventh career victory was worth 9 million yen (dlrs
65,000) from a purse of 50 million yen (dlrs 362,000).
	   ``I thought of winning when I learned I was leading by two
strokes after the 16th,'' said Harada. ``But I tried to stay
persistent in order not to make a goof for the second straight
week.''
	   She was referring to her final round of 70 to finish second in
the Toto Motor Ladies last week. South Korean Lee Young-me, one of
Harada's two overnight co-leaders, won that tournament with a final
round of 69.
	   On Sunday, Natsuko Noro, in contention for her second career
victory, shot a 70 for 209.
	   Yuri Fudo fired the day's best round of 68 and shared third at
210 with Taiwan's Tseng Hsiu-feng, who shot a 71.
	   Akiko Fukushima, the other co-leader overnight, had a fat 74 for
a share of fifth at 211 with Fumiko Muraguchi, who shot a 69.
	   Fukushima, the 1996 and 1997 money earnings leader, has yet to
win this season.

World Cup: Tea-growing region breeds Japan's soccer stars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ It's probably not the water, just
hard work and good coaching. Nine of the 22 players on Japan's
World Cup team hail from the same state.
	   If any spot on the island nation can be called the heart of
Japanese soccer, it would be Shizuoka (she-zooh-OH-kah), a region
famous for green tea. Located 150 kilometers west of Tokyo, the
state has long been the breeding ground for Japan's top stars. No
other state sent more than two players to the World Cup team.
	   One reason is that Shizuoka has the best high school soccer
teams in Japan and the best training programs for kids. Competition
is intense.
	   ``It's a great environment to see quality soccer while you're
growing up,'' midfielder Hiroshi Nanami, 25, said after Saturday's
practice in this French spa. ``And you get the best coaching in
Japan.''
	   More remarkably, four players now on the national team _
including Nanami and starting goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi _
trained under the same high school coach.
	   ``I'm as happy as a proud father,'' coach Masayoshi Otaki of
Shimizu Municipal Commercial High School said in a recent interview
in Shizuoka.
	   Otaki acknowledged he sometimes hits his student-players _ a
coaching style that is becoming less popular but remains
surprisingly commonplace in tradition-bound Japan.
	   ``I scold them a lot,'' said Otaki, 46, an unpretentious,
energetic man, who has been coaching for 25 years. ``Sometimes
words aren't enough.''
	   Otaki became all gentle smiles when describing his World
Cup-bound players: Kawaguchi was the one who worked extra hard;
Nanami was never afraid to be a little different; Shinji Ono showed
up at practice first and left last.
	   ``I was truly lucky to have met such a good person,'' the
18-year-old Ono said of his high school coach. The midfielder
recalled that Otaki took him to classical music concerts.
	   Nanami, who wears the No. 10 jersey, also said Otaki had a
profound impact on his development as a player.
	   ``He was extremely strict,'' he recalled. ``He taught us the
discipline of soccer.''
	   But Masashi Nakayama, 30, suggested people shouldn't make too
much of the Shizuoka magic.
	   ``It's not that special,'' he said.
	   The Shizuoka-born striker, who is expected to start in Japan's
opener against Argentina, is the top J-League scorer, netting a
league-record four consecutive hat tricks this season.

Both sides in Air France strike show willingness for new talks

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup four days away, both sides in a
strike by Air France pilots appeared willing Sunday to begin new
talks aimed at ending the walkout now in its seventh day.
	   Airline officials said Saturday evening they were in contact
with the pilots about resuming negotiations but none had been set.
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin also said Saturday the government was
prepared to intervene but no concrete proposals have emerged.
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   Meanwhile, public support for the strike appeared lukewarm.
	   A poll that appeared in Sunday's edition of Le Journal du
Dimanche showed just 38 percent of those surveyed were sympathetic
to the strike, while 34 percent opposed it. In contrast, 79 percent
of those polled supported truckers in a strike in Novemember 1997.
	   The poll was carried out Friday by the CSA polling agency among
1,004 people. No margin of error was given.
	   The pilots appeared divided about new talks, with the head of
the main pilots' union indicating a new round could take place
Monday and a spokesman saying they could resume over the weekend.
	   Both sides were under pressure to end the strike from the
government, worried about France's image and embarrassed by the
strike, which has threatened to tarnish the soccer championship.
	   Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is committed to
transporting the teams from one venue to another.
	   The pilots were protesting pay cuts planned by Air France, which
is currently restructuring and needs to free up capital to
modernize the company and its planes.
	   Talks between Air France management and the striking pilots
broke off Saturday after all night negotiations.
	   The stumbling blocks remained planned salary cuts and an Air
France proposal to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay
reductions, as well as a two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots
earn less.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Sunday. Meanwhile, a train strike disrupted provincial
service and service was expected Sunday, especially in the south.
	   Once the air strike ends, Air France says it will take three
days for service to be restored fully to normal.

Mother skeptical as young Swiss guard's final letter published
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The final letter of Cedric Tornay,
the young Swiss guardsman who the Vatican says fatally shot the
Swiss Guards' commander and his wife, raises more questions than it
answers, his mother was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   ``I'm not saying my son didn't do it,'' Muguette Baudat-Tornay
told the Lausanne daily Le Matin.
	   ``But it still has to be clearly proved whether, and above all
why, he did it,'' she added.
	   The Vatican says Tornay, 23, bitter because of a reprimand by
commander Alois Estermann and the latter's failure to award him a
medal, fatally shot Estermann and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero, and
then killed himself, in the couple's Vatican apartment last month.
	   Le Matin published the brief letter from Tornay, addressed to
his mother and written in French, which appears to back that
version of events.
	   ``Mom, I hope you will forgive me for what I have done, it was
they who pushed me,'' the letter started.
	   ``I must perform this service for all the remaining guardsmen as
well as the (Roman) Catholic church,'' one passage read. ``I swore
to give my life for the pope and that's what I'm doing.''
	   But Baudat-Tornay was quoted by the newspaper as saying she had
asked for a handwriting analysis, as the letter was not written on
Tornay's usual paper and was addressed to her married name, which
her son never used.
	   The letter also said he been in the pope's army for ``three
years, six months and six days'' _ more than a month too long,
according to Baudat-Tornay.
	   Baudat-Tornay was given the letter, apparently given by Tornay
to another guardsman, identified only as C.G., shortly before the
shootings, two days later.
	   In a telephone call on the afternoon of the killings, Tornay had
seemed happy and talked of coming to Switzerland in June, she said.
	   Tornay's mother was also quoted as claiming her son had told her
last autumn that he was investigating the traditionalist and
secretive Opus Dei movement. ``More recently, he had even started
to fear this organization ... why?''
	   In a statement last week, the organization dismissed rumors that
Estermann was a member of Opus Dei, Le Matin said.
	   On Tuesday, Pope John Paul II named Swiss army colonel Pius
Segmueller as the new commander of the tiny force.

Homemade bomb injures guard near Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A homemade bomb exploded outside a border guard
checkpoint in southern Russia, damaging the building and injuring
one officer, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The incident occurred late Saturday in Nazran, a city in the
restive region of Ingushetia, which borders the rebel republic of
Chechnya, the report said.
	   One guard was slightly injured by flying plaster, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Although Russia's war with Chechnya ended nearly two years ago,
the area remains troubled by violence.

Egypt holds mid-term elections for Parliament's upper house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Mid-term elections were held Sunday for half
the elected members of the 264-seat Shura Council, or Consultative
Council, which boasts Egypt's elite as members but has little
power.
	   Egypt's 13 opposition parties boycotted the elections to
Parliament's upper house, saying they would not trust the results.
In the last elections in 1995, the opposition charged widespread
vote-rigging.
	   President Hosni Mubarak appoints one-third of the Shura
Council's seats, with elections for half the others held every
three years.
	   Of the 88 seats up for grabs Sunday, 22 went uncontested to
members of the ruling National Democratic Party or independents who
support it. One uncontested seat was that of the council's
president, Mustafa Kamal Helmy.
	   The council's members are writers, intellectuals, professors and
scientists. It serves mainly as an advisory body. The lower house,
or People's Assembly, has the real power. Like the Shura Council,
it is dominated by the ruling party.
	   Shura Council elections usually draw little attention; on Sunday
even government newspapers carried only brief stories on the
balloting. After the vote, Mubarak will appoint half his allotment,
or 44 members.
	   The Interior Ministry listed 24,000 polling stations throughout
Egypt, but had no figure for eligible voters. Newspapers put the
number at around one million.
	   Polls opened at 8:00 a.m. (0500gmt) and were to close at 5:00
p.m. (1400gmt). Results are expected within 48 hours.
	   Of the 628 candidates who entered the race, 19 were excluded as
unworthy by a judicial committee and 190 withdrew. A re-vote will
take place June 14 in cases where candidates did not get the
necessary 50 per cent, plus one vote.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela will
attend a meeting of Caribbean heads of state from June 30-July 4,
the foreign ministry annnounced Sunday.
	   The chairman of the Caribbean Community and Common Market and
Prime Minister of Grenada, Keith Mitchell, had invited Mandela,
according to the foreign ministry.
	   The statement said Mandela would emphasise the importance of
South Africa's growing relations with the Caribbean community
during his visit.
	   South African exports to the Caribbean region in 1997 reached
425 million rand (dlrs 83 million), more than double the figure for
1996. Total imports from the region increased to 112 million rand
(dlrs 21 million).

Tehran mayor goes on trial for corruption, pleads not guilty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in grafs 5-8 judge's statement, color. &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The trial of Tehran mayor Gholamhossein
Karbaschi started Sunday, with the reformist mayor describing as
``lies'' the corruption charges brought against him.
	   Karbaschi, 44, arrived at the courtroom in his trademark dark
blue suit, flanked by his two lawyers, looking relaxed and
confident.
	   In front of a packed courtroom at the Imam Khomeini Judiciary
Complex in central Tehran, Karbaschi pleaded innocent. He said the
charges of embezzlement, fraud, and mismanagement of public funds
brought against him were trumped up.
	   ``All of the charges against me are absolute lies. I don't
accept any of them,'' the black-bearded Karbaschi told the judge
calmly.
	   The judge, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejaei, a cleric, wearing a
white turban and brown robe, said:
	   ``I'm not happy today to try a manager of the Islamic Republic
of Iran, but we know that the law should be implemented and there
are no exceptions. Nobody is above the law.''
	   The trial was adjourned until Thursday. As Karbaschi left the
courthouse, about 200 supporters greeted him with shouts of ``Long
live Karbaschi,'' while another 50, standing nearby, yelled,
``Death to Karbaschi.''
	   Some 130 citizens attended the trial _ those who arrived early _
along with about 70 journalists. A crowd of several hundred watched
the four-hour hearing on two 28-inch television screens outside the
courthouse, where extra police were assigned to keep order.
	   Karbaschi was arrested April 4 when Chief Judge Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, a hard-liner, accused him of involvement in a
wide-ranging corruption scandal and ordered him detained.
	   But the move was widely seen as a bid to topple key officials
allied with moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who took
office in August. Karbaschi had run Khatami's election campaign.
	   In the scandal, more than a dozen senior municipality officials
have been put on trial since last October. Most were accused of _
or sentenced for _ issuing building permits in restricted zones in
return for large kickbacks.
	   Karbaschi was freed April 15 after a series of street protests
that turned violent.
	   He was released after the intervention of Iran's spiritual
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, considered an ally of hard-liners.
	   Karbaschi's arrest ignited a long-simmering power struggle
between moderate and hard-line clerics. His case has gripped the
nation, generating hundreds of stories for and against the mayor.
	   As mayor since 1989, Karbaschi has improved the capital's
appearance as well as public services for its 8 million residents.
	   Despite his popularity, he has critics who consider his
administration high-handed and who dislike him for taxing the
powerful merchants who make up the hard-liners' power base.
	   The mayor went back to work days after his release. But
according to Iranian law, he is not allowed to work while the trial
is under way.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss voters were set to decide Sunday
whether to outlaw the production and patenting of genetically
modified plants and animals, in a vote which both sides claim could
have catastrophic results.
	   A close outcome is likely in the referendum on ``The Initiative
for the Protection of Life and the Environment against Genetic
Manipulation.''
	   The most recent poll pointed to a defeat for the initiative,
which Swiss industry and government say would force a ``draconian''
shutdown on research in Switzerland, sending highly paid jobs to
other countries.
	   But other studies have shown voters more evenly divided, with
many voters swayed by arguments that tampering with genes poses
``incalculable risks'' for the environment and the prospect of
unethical treatment of animals used in experiments.
	   Environmentalists and consumer activists who back the proposal
say too little is known about the consequences of letting
genetically modified organisms into the food chain.
	   But the issue of jobs is also highly sensitive to the
resource-poor country of 7 million. Despite Switzerland's small
size, it is a leading force in biotechnology.
	   Basel-based pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Roche rank with
competitors such as Monsanto, of St. Louis, among world leaders in
the field.
	   The Swiss pharmaceutical industry and the government say the
initiative would keep the companies from doing some of their best
research in Switzerland.
	   The traditionally environment-conscious German-speaking majority
is expected to be more favorable to the proposal than the French
speakers of western Switzerland.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists charged with filming without government permission were
acquitted by a Yemeni court Sunday.
	   Judge Haikal Ahmed Othman ordered the release of BBC producer
Robin Barnwell, reporter Rageh Ommar and cameraman Frank Smith
after viewing the tapes they filmed and listening to witnesses'
testimony.
	   ``Yemen believes in the freedom of the press, and the press is a
necessity in this age. The world has become a village as a result
of advanced technology and information,'' Othman said before
announcing the verdict.
	   The men were accused of failing to obtain permission from
authorities to travel to areas in western Yemen where kidnappings
have taken place.
	   Dozens of journalists and Yemenis attending the trial, which
began Saturday, cheered the verdict and congratulated the three men
and their lawyer al-Sheik Tareq Abdullah.
	   The journalists were arrested after returning to the capital
San`a after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan tribe near Marib,
170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The Bani Dhabyan have carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure of a British teacher, David Mitchell, his
wife Caroline, and their 14-year old son, Ben.
	   Armed tribesmen who rule over large parts of Yemen have
kidnapped foreigners and demanded concessions from the government
in return for their release. The hostages are usually well treated
and released unharmed.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A nationwide strike by Israel's teachers to
protest changes in their pension plans and the firing of some
colleagues shut down most on the country's schools on Sunday.
	   The one-day strike by teachers belonging to the Histadrut labor
federation affected 1 million students, from kindergarteners to
college students.
	   Non-unionized teachers held a few classes, however. Sundays are
regular school days in Israel.
	   In December, a nationwide strike by public employees, including
teachers, paralyzed much of Israel for five days.

	   The bomb exploded just before dawn, shattering the train as it
passed through a village 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside Sukkur
and 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Karachi, capital of the
southern Sindh province, police said.
	   The 18-carriage express, with a capacity of 1,800 passengers,

Nationwide strike by teachers shuts most Israeli schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A nationwide strike by Israel's teachers to
protest changes in their pension plans and the firing of some
colleagues shut down most on the country's schools on Sunday.
	   The one-day strike by teachers belonging to the Histadrut labor
federation affected 1 million students, from kindergarteners to
college students.
	   Non-unionized teachers held a few classes, however. Sundays are
regular school days in Israel.
	   In December, a nationwide strike by public employees, including
teachers, paralyzed much of Israel for five days.

Tehran mayor goes on trial for corruption, pleads not guilty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with judge's statement, color. &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With supporters gathered outside the
courtroom, Tehran's popular mayor went on trial Sunday to defend
himself against corruption charges that critics say are politically
motivated.
	   Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi arrived in court flanked by his
two lawyers, looking confident and relaxed. During the four-hour
hearing, he pleaded innocent and called the charges against him
``lies.''
	   ``All of the charges against me are absolute lies. I don't
accept any of them,'' he said before a packed courtroom at the Imam
Khomeini Judiciary Complex in central Tehran.
	   Karbaschi, 44, is charged with embezzlement, fraud, and
mismanagement of public funds.
	   The judge, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejaei, a cleric, said he was
not happy about having to try a ``manager of the Islamic Republic
of Iran,'' but that the law must be implemented.
	   ``Nobody is above the law,'' the judge said.
	   The trial was adjourned until Thursday.
	   As Karbaschi left the courthouse, about 200 supporters greeted
him with shouts of ``Long live Karbaschi.'' Another 50 people,
standing nearby, yelled, ``Death to Karbaschi.''
	   Mayor of Iran's capital since 1989, Karbaschi has gained fans by
adding color to the polluted, congested city of 8 million, painting
buses bright colors, building roads, and opening sports and culture
centers.
	   His reforms, however, have also earned him enemies.
	   Karbaschi was arrested April 4 when Chief Judge Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, a hard-liner, accused him of involvement in a
wide-ranging corruption scandal and ordered him detained.
	   But the move was widely seen as a bid to topple key officials
allied with moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who took
office in August. Karbaschi had run Khatami's election campaign.
	   Karbaschi was freed April 15 after a series of street protests
that turned violent, but his arrest ignited a long-simmering power
struggle between moderate and hard-line clerics. His case has
gripped the nation, generating hundreds of stories for and against
the mayor.
	   Despite his popularity, he has critics who consider his
administration high-handed and who dislike him for taxing the
powerful merchants who make up the hard-liners' power base.
	   The mayor went back to work days after his release. But
according to Iranian law, he is not allowed to work while the trial
is under way.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police divers have recovered the body of a
2-year-old boy identified as the missing son of a North Korean
diplomat, a news agency said Sunday.
	   Police said the father has identified the body, which was found
on Saturday in a small tributary to the Moscow River, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. The site was about 2 kilometers (more than a
mile) downstream from where the toddler disappeared May 30 while on
an outing with his father and other diplomats from the North Korean
embassy.
	   Police are investigating the case, but believe it was an
accident, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ With both sides predicting a national
catastrophe if they lose, Swiss citizens voted Sunday on whether to
outlaw the production and patenting of genetically modified plants
and animals.
	   The most recent poll on ``The Initiative for the Protection of
Life and the Environment against Genetic Manipulation'' pointed to
a defeat for the initiative, which Swiss industry and government
say would force a ``draconian'' shutdown on research in
Switzerland, sending highly paid jobs to other countries.
	   But other studies have shown voters more evenly divided, with
many swayed by arguments that tampering with genes poses
``incalculable risks'' for the environment and the prospect of
unethical treatment of animals used in experiments.
	   Environmentalists and consumer activists who back the proposal
say too little is known about the consequences of allowing
genetically modified organisms into the food chain.
	   But the issue of jobs is also highly sensitive to the
resource-poor country of 7 million, which is a leading force in
biotechnology.
	   Basel-based pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Roche rank among
world leaders in the field.
	   The Swiss pharmaceutical industry and the government say the
initiative would shackle the companies research.
	   The traditionally environment-conscious German-speaking majority
is expected to look more favorably on the proposal than are the
French speakers of western Switzerland.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss voters were set to decide Sunday
whether to outlaw the production and patenting of genetically
modified plants and animals, in a vote which both sides claim could
have catastrophic results.
	   Early exit polls published by Swiss television predicted a
two-to-one defeat for ``The Initiative for the Protection of Life
and the Environment against Genetic Manipulation.''
	   That would be a more decisive majority than expected in the
run-up to the referendum.
	   The most recent poll pointed to a defeat for the initiative,
which Swiss industry and government say would force a ``draconian''
shutdown on research in Switzerland, sending highly paid jobs to
other countries.
	   But other studies have shown voters more evenly divided, with
many voters swayed by arguments that tampering with genes poses
``incalculable risks'' for the environment and the prospect of
unethical treatment of animals used in experiments.
	   Environmentalists and consumer activists who back the proposal
say too little is known about the consequences of letting
genetically modified organisms into the food chain.
	   But the issue of jobs is also highly sensitive to the
resource-poor country of 7 million. Despite Switzerland's small
size, it is a leading force in biotechnology.
	   Basel-based pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Roche rank with
competitors such as Monsanto, of St. Louis, among world leaders in
the field.
	   The Swiss pharmaceutical industry and the government say the
initiative would keep the companies from doing some of their best
research in Switzerland.
	   The traditionally environment-conscious German-speaking majority
is expected to be more favorable to the proposal than the French
speakers of western Switzerland.
	   But the television exit polls carried out by the GFS research
institute indicated a defeat for the initiative in German-speaking
areas.

Philippine president-elect to seek constitutional change to spur
</HEADLINE>
investment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada said
Sunday he will seek an amendment of the constitution to allow full
foreign ownership of Philippine businesses by foreigners.
	   Estrada spoke to reporters after meeting Taiwanese tycoon Chang
Yungfa, who has interests in shipbuilding, construction and
airlines.
	   He said he urged Chang to invest in Philippine seaports but that
Chang was apprehensive due to a constitutional limit on foreign
ownership of most businesses at 40 percent.
	   Estrada said many foreign investors have gotten around the limit
by using Filipino dummy companies. But Chang said foreign
businessmen are leery of such arrangements because dummy companies
sometimes break under-the-table agreements designed to get around
the investment law.
	   ``The Philippines should not fear foreign investments,'' Chang
told reporters through an interpreter.
	   Estrada said he would prefer that the incoming Congress convene
as a constituent assembly.
	   Many in the Philippines, including the Roman Catholic Church,
oppose tinkering with the constitution, fearing that politicians
may go too far and limit democracy.
	   Last year, tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists rallied
against plans by President Fidel Ramos' supporters to change the
constitution to allow him to seek reelection. Philippine presidents
are limited to single six-year terms.
	   Estrada said he would only remove constitutional provisions
hindering investment and economic growth.
	   Congress has proclaimed Estrada, a former movie star, winner of
the May 11 presidential elections. He will be inaugurated as the
country's 13th president on June 30.

Hong Kong edges Japan 17-16 in Pacific Rim rugby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hong Kong edged Japan 17-16 Sunday for a 3-1 record
in the four-nation Pacific Rim rugby championship. Japan fell to
1-3.
	   At Tokyo's Prince Chichibu Memorial Ground, Japan led 13-10 at
halftime after stand-off Stephan Miln's penalty goal and a try by
No. 8 Ross Tompson helped it overcome the visitors' four-point
lead.
	   After the break, however, Hong Kong regained its lead with a try
by scrum-half Sean O'Hara.
	   Japan, currently in third place, will meet the United States in
San Francisco Saturday.
	   Hong Kong, front-running in the home-and-away round-robin
tournament, will visit Canada on the same day.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With a border dispute escalating into
bombing raids, hundreds of foreigners scrambled out of Eritrea on
Sunday, fearing it will be engulfed in war with Ethiopia. One of
their main escape routes earlier came under attack for a second
straight day. Ethiopian jets bombed a military-civilian airport on
the outskirts of Asmara on for the second time Saturday, forcing
embassies to step up their exit plans. American, Italian, German
and British planes ferried foreigners out of harm's way late
Saturday and early Sunday after Ethiopia agreed to temporarily halt
bombing. (Eritrea-Ethiopia)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will turn down any further shipments
of humanitarian aid ferried by friendly countries or organizations,
Baghdad newspapers said Sunday. The papers said a Cabinet meeting
chaired by President Saddam Hussein late Saturday told the donors
that Iraq would prefer its supporters to work for the lifting of
trade sanctions instead of sending aid. ``Iraq is not in need of
aid and its people are not so lazy to ask assistance from others,''
the official Al-Qadissiya said, quoting a statement by the Cabinet.
It is not clear why Iraq made the decision when aid shipments have
been gathering momentum and when the government has complained
bitterly about a lack of medicines causing serious health problems
for the 22 million Iraqis. (Iraq-Aid)
	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup four days away, both sides in a
strike by Air France pilots appeared willing Sunday to begin new
talks aimed at ending the walkout now in its seventh day. Airline
officials said Saturday evening they were in contact with the
pilots about resuming negotiations but none had been set. Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin also said Saturday the government was
prepared to intervene but no concrete proposals have emerged. Talks
between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday after the
pilots walked out of negotiations. Meanwhile, public support for
the strike appeared lukewarm. (Air France-Strike)
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid workers were trying Sunday to
assess whether serious disease has broken out in remote villages of
northern Afghanistan devastated during last weekend's earthquake.
The quake killed up to 4,700 people and injured thousands of
others, according to Afghan authorities. An outbreak of bloody
diarrhea was reported in the Chah-ab region, about 60 kilometers
(38 miles) west of Faisabad, said U.N. spokesman Rupert Colville.
Red Cross helicopters postponed some emergency food deliveries and
set out for the region to investigate whether the outbreak might
signal shigella or dysentery. Both diseases spread quickly when
water supplies are polluted. In addition to destroying wells, the
May 30 quake cut channels and pipes carrying spring water to
villages, and landslides accompanying the quake have filled rivers
with mud. (Afghanistan-Quake).
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb gutted a train
traveling through southern Pakistan on Sunday, killing 26 people
and wounding 45 others, many of them seriously, police and
emergency workers said. The bomb exploded just before dawn,
shattering the train as it passed through a village 30 kilometers
(18 miles) outside Sukkur and 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of
Karachi, capital of the southern Sindh province, police said. The
18-carriage express, with a capacity of 1,800 passengers, was
headed toward the northwestern city of Peshawar, they said. Among
the dead were four children aged 5 or younger, police said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details on verdict
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists charged with filming without government permission were
acquitted by a Yemeni court Sunday.
	   Judge Haikal Ahmed Othman ordered the release of BBC producer
Robin Barnwell, reporter Rageh Ommar and cameraman Frank Smith
after viewing the tapes they filmed and listening to witnesses'
testimony.
	   ``Yemen believes in the freedom of the press, and the press is a
necessity in this age. The world has become a village as a result
of advanced technology and information,'' Othman said before
announcing the verdict.
	   Othman said the reporters did not break any laws and were
visiting Yemen legally.
	   ``The authorities were aware of their presence and the films
they shot did not insult the government or the Yemeni people,'' he
said.
	   Othman said that the prosecution accused the three men of
failing to obtain permission from authorities to travel to areas in
western Yemen where kidnappings have taken place but did not
provide enough evidence to support the charges.
	   He said that the law requires only that resident journalists
inform authorities on their movements.
	   Dozens of journalists and Yemenis attending the trial, which
began Saturday, cheered the verdict and congratulated the three men
and their lawyer al-Sheik Tareq Abdullah.
	   ``I'm very proud not only because I won the case but because
this case is historical. This is a victory for Yemen and the Yemeni
people,'' Abdullah said.
	   The journalists were arrested after returning to the capital
San`a after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan tribe near Marib,
170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The Bani Dhabyan have carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure of a British teacher, David Mitchell, his
wife Caroline, and their 14-year old son, Ben.
	   Armed tribesmen who rule over large parts of Yemen have
kidnapped foreigners and demanded concessions from the government
in return for their release. The hostages are usually well treated
and released unharmed.

Pope deplores violence in Kosovo, Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday called on the
world to act against violence and repression in Kosovo, the ethnic
Albanian province of Yugoslavia.
	   He also said he was worried by the growing conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea in Africa.
	   ``Let God spare the dear peoples of Africa, already so troubled,
from further suffering,'' he said after his regular Sunday blessing
in St. Peter's Square.
	   ``Not far from us, in Kosovo, violent options, repression and
the flight of peoples must not leave the international community
inert,'' he said. The violence ``recalls the tragic recent history
of the Balkans.''
	   John Paul called on the parties to take up the road to dialogue,
``longer but more effective for all.''
	   Serb forces have stepped up their campaign to crush Albanian
separatists fighting heavy-handed rule by Serb authorities in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of the
population of 2.2 million.

Russian nukes in safe hands, says U.S. missile forces chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia keeps its deadly nuclear arsenal in safe
hands, watching over it with as much vigilance as the United States
safeguards its own missiles, the commander of America's nuclear
forces said Sunday.
	   Gen. Eugene Habiger, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, toured
weapons sites across Russia over the past week to learn more about
how the world's other major nuclear power controls its most lethal
weapons.
	   ``I want to put to bed this concern that there are loose nukes
in Russia,'' Habiger said in an interview with The Associated Press
before flying back to the United States. ``My observations are that
the Russians are indeed very serious about security.''
	   Habiger's tour, his second to Russia in the past year, included
visits to bases for strategic missiles, bombers and naval forces,
as well as storage sites and silos.
	   He traveled to Siberia, the Far North, and the base of the
Russian space program in Baikonur, Kazakstan, and viewed
operational sites never before open to an American.
	   Habiger said that on the whole he was impressed by the
professionalism and dedication of Russian officers manning the
missile sites, and praised the rigorous physical and psychological
tests they take every few days.
	   ``In some areas the Russians are a lot more conservative than we
are,'' he said.
	   Habiger's visit is part of a series of exchanges between the two
countries' nuclear commands designed to build trust and reduce the
possibility of mishaps. His Russian counterpart, Gen. Col. Vladimir
Yakovlev, made a similar tour of U.S. nuclear weapons sites in
March.
	   Yakovlev, who accompanied Habiger to the airport, said he did
not find it uncomfortable to open such highly-classified sites to
his former Cold War enemies.
	   ``We can't go farther along the road to disarmament without
deepening our mutual understanding,'' Yakovlev said.
	   Habiger, who became commander of U.S. nuclear forces in February
1996, said he considers the danger of an unauthorized launch of a
Russian missile extremely remote, in part because there are more
layers in the Russian chain of command. For instance, three people
must approve the launch of each missile, instead of two in the
United States, and the Russians require the orders to be in
writing.
	   He said that there are some philosophical differences between
the two countries, but suggested that it was more of an operational
than a security issue.
	   ``We tend to rely on technology a lot more than they do.'' he
said. For example, while the Americans rely primarily on sensors
and other technical surveillance to guard their silos, Russians use
armed guards.
	   The U.S. Strategic Command, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska,
controls all American nuclear bombs and missiles, whether based on
land or at sea.
	   Habiger, who piloted his own plane back to the United States,
plans to retire this summer after 39 years of military service. His
successor, Vice Adm. Richard Mies, accompanied him on the tour.

Murder victim found near airport identified as Irish woman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The body of a woman found murdered outside
a golf club in a southern Athens suburb a week ago was identified
Sunday as that of 35-year-old Marie Cronin from Dublin, Ireland,
authorities said.
	   Cronin's body was found hidden underneath bushes outside the
Glyfada golf course, which borders on Athens' international
airport, on May 30. She had been due to return to London, where she
was working for a medical insurance company, later that day, police
said.
	   According to a coroner's report, Cronin died of multiple head
injuries caused by a sharp, heavy object such as an axe or meat
cleaver. She also suffered defensive injuries on her arms.
	   Her family in Ireland became concerned when she did not arrive
in London as scheduled. Her body was reportedly identified by her
brothers.
	   Cronin had arrived in Greece on May 22 for a week-long vacation
on the Saronic Gulf island of Spetses, about 63 kilometers (30
miles) southwest of Athens. She left the island by hydrofoil for
the port city of Piraeus on May 29, and was scheduled to catch a
flight back to London early the next day.
	   No suspects have been arrested in the case.

Netanyahu: troop-pullback accord not imminent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dampening hopes for movement in the stalled
Mideast peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday said no accord was imminent on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   The prime minister told his Cabinet that ``it is not possible to
say we are on the verge of an agreement,'' said a statement issued
after the meeting.
	   Later, the prime minister told reporters: ``We're working toward
reaching an agreement. We're not there yet.''
	   In recent days, speculation had grown that Israel was very close
to a decision on an American initiative _ already accepted by the
Palestinians _ that would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under
full or partial Palestinian control and restrict Jewish settlement
expansion.
	   Under the American plan, as reported last week by Israeli media,
Israel would withdraw troops in three stages over 12 weeks. The
Palestinians currently have full control over 3 percent of the West
Bank and partial control over another 24 percent.
	   However, Sunday's Cabinet statement said there was no agreement
on either a second or third troop redeployment, and that Israel and
the Palestinians still did not agree on reciprocal steps the
Palestinians would take in exchange for the Israeli pullbacks.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom told Israel radio that
U.S.-Israeli discussions were focusing on a third redeployment, and
that the government has a parliamentary majority to approve a
second redeployment as long as the Palestinians fulfill their
obligations.
	   Israeli media reports said American envoy Dennis Ross had asked
the Palestinians to accept some changes in the original U.S.
proposal _ which has been widely reported but never formally
unveiled _ and that Palestinians were rejecting American calls for
a small third-phase pullback of 2 percent.
	   Palestinian officials reiterated Sunday that they would not
agree to changes in the American initiative now.
	   ``It's not up to (Netanyahu) to redesign the peace process in
his own image,'' said senior Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan
Ashrawi. ``We are not willing to renegotiate the American
proposal.''
	   The American plan reportedly calls for an Israeli promise not to
expand Jewish settlements in a significant way, and to allow
sections of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction to be annulled by vote of the 18-member PLO Executive
Committee rather than the much larger Palestine National Council,
as originally demanded by Israel.
	   The Cabinet statement, though, indicated the charter change was
still a sticking point.
	   ``On the matter of reciprocity, we presented the list of
concrete obligations, including the convening of the Palestinian
council to nullify the covenant section. There is still no
agreement with the Palestinians on this,'' the statement said.
	   Right-wing lawmakers have threatened to bring down Netanyahu's
government if he goes ahead with the pullbacks, and Jewish settler
leaders have stepped up a public campaign against troop
withdrawals.
	   In a sign of bitter right-wing opposition to any pullback,
posters were plastered on walls in downtown Jerusalem overnight,
depicting Netanyahu wearing a keffiyeh _ an Arab headdress _ and
emblazoned with the word ``Liar.''

Rescue workers probe earth near Germany's train crash site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Rescue workers dug to depths of four
meters (yards) Sunday for clues to help identify victims in postwar
Germany's deadliest train crash.
	   At least 102 people were killed when high-speed InterCity
Express 884 derailed and slammed into the concrete supports of an
overpass that crashed down onto the jackknifed passenger cars.
	   Rescuers in the northern city of Eschede, 50 kms (35 miles)
north of Hanover, believe it is unlikely they will find more
bodies, and were sifting through sandy dirt for personal effects,
such as jewelry and wallets. So far, just 39 bodies found at the
scene have been identified.
	   Officials expected to call off the search by nightfall, leaving
the tracks to investigators and repair crews. Workers were
preparing new sections of rail to reopen the Hanover-Hamburg
stretch by the middle of this week.
	   Investigators have pointed to the wheel failure as the likely
cause of the derailment, prompting rail officials to pull Germany's
59 original high-speed trains out of service for ultrasound wheel
inspections. Rail delays continued throughout Germany on Sunday.
	   Inspectors said it will take 15 days to complete the tests of
wheels and wheel casings.
	   Federal rail authorities expected to have three first-generation
trains back on the rails at normal top speed of 280 kilometers (175
miles) an hour by Sunday afternoon.
	   Maximum speed on the trains was reduced to 160 kilometers (100
miles) an hour after the accident.
	   Germany's second-generation ICEs, introduced in 1996, have a
different wheel system, and have been left in service.
	   In the small, red-brick village of Eschede, residents laid a
wooden cross Sunday on a road near the crash site and placed a
flower pot on top in memory of the victims.

Iraq will not accept any more aid shipments from abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will turn down any further shipments
of humanitarian aid sent by friendly countries or organizations,
Baghdad newspapers said Sunday.
	   The Cabinet, in a meeting chaired by President Saddam Hussein
late Saturday, thanked those who have ferried aid to Iraq, but
urged them to shift their attention to ending the ``unfair
embargo'' that the United Nations imposed on Baghdad to punish its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``Iraq is not in need of aid and its people are not so lazy to
ask assistance from others,'' the official Al-Qadissiya newspaper
said, quoting a Cabinet statement.
	   It is not clear why Iraq made the decision when aid shipments
have been gathering momentum and when the government has complained
bitterly that a lack of medicine has caused serious health problems
for the 22 million Iraqis.
	   But diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraq
felt humiliated by some small aid shipments that drew extensive
media coverage.
	   The Cabinet statement carried in newspapers seemed to reflect
such hurt pride. ``At one time Iraq used to offer humanitarian aid
to many countries, establishments and personalities,'' it said.
	   The U.N. humanitarian spokesman in Iraq, Eric Falt, said he did
not believe Iraq's decision would have any bearing on humanitarian
goods purchased under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal.
	   Private aid workers from Western non-governmental organizations
based in Iraq said they did not think the decision would affect
their operations.
	   Some 23 flights carrying humanitarian aid have arrived since
January, mostly from Arab countries and others friendly to Iraq.
	   Aid also flowed from the United States, with approximately 80
tons of medicines and medical supplies shipped to Iraq by two U.S.
aid organizations so far this year.
	   The diplomats noted that last month Iraqi officials were shocked
when a Russian plane landed with only 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of
medical supplies.
	   A Jordanian aid plane, whose arrival drew extensive coverage
from official media, landed last Thursday with a delegation of
health officials and no aid.
	   Later, the press reported that Jordanian officials came to
Baghdad in hope of signing contracts to sell more pharmaceuticals
to Iraq under the country's oil-for-food deal with the United
Nations.

	   He also said he hoped that a U.N. conference on fighting drugs
opening Monday would give a ``new and concrete impulse'' toward
cooperation on the issue.
	   Drug trafficking, production and use ``constitute a market of
death, which corrodes and weakens the human being,'' he said.
	   In the morning, the pope embarked on one of his regular parish
visits, this time visiting St. Nicholas of Bari in Ostia, a seaside
community a half-hour outside the city.
	   He went by helicopter because of the distance. He usually
travels to the parishes by car.
	   The visit combined touching and humorous moments. When
9-year-old Giorgio Galante broke down in tears during his welcoming
speech, he was brought up to the pontiff, who embraced and kissed
the boy to comfort him.
	   ``Giorgio Galante spoke with tears, and with these tears he said
more than with beautiful words,'' the pope told a group of
children. ``I will remember this visit as one where a boy welcomed
me with tears, because he was so moved.''
	   Later, a girl scout called John Paul a ``young pope who loves
young people.'' The pontiff, who turned 78 on May 18, responded
with a smile: ``The only thing I can do is pretend to still be
young.''

	   PARIS (AP) - The lady in slinky black pressed close to the
tough-looking stranger and then suddenly turned to aim a savage
kick. Both smiled in romantic rapture, and the crowd danced on.
	   Down along the Seine, among twinkling fairy lights and air as
smooth as nectar on a patch of waterside concrete, the summer-night
tango junkies were at it again.
	   ``I am in paradise here, to feel the magic of Paris at midnight,
the pleasure and scent of a woman,'' exulted a drama teacher who
called himself only Francis. ``There is nothing like tango.''
	   From June to September, each weekend is the same. The World Cup
starts Wednesday in Paris, but from the scant evidence of it along
the Seine, the soccer tournament might as well be opening on the
moon.
	   ``I love going to Argentina, but not for football,'' said
Christian Tribut, a balding retired electronics merchant. ``Tango
is so sensual, so passionate.''
	   As he spoke, his eyes scoured the improvised dance floor for a
likely partner.
	   His friend, Catherine Marie, in a shocking pink blouse and tight
skirt, was intent on her own vigil. She smiled when Francis the
drama coach glided up and bowed. Together, they whirled off.
	   The tango microcosm is one tiny universe along the Seine's old
stone banks. Bongo drummers pound nearby. Wine-swillers sprawl
further along. Lovers of assorted colors and genders stroll past.
	   But the tango corner is an institution, growing more popular
every year since it began in the early 1990s in a little open-air
arena on the Left Bank by the upriver tip of the Ile Saint-Louis.
	   Carlos Gardel, Argentina's fabled and long-dead tango king,
wails old favorites on a battery-powered boom box. Volunteer
organizers sprinkle talcum powder to make it easier to glide.
	   Orange lights reflect off the lapping water against the constant
backdrop of garish purple and green neon of passing tour boats.
	   When it is warm and clear, several hundred dancers jam into the
small space, and skill is required to keep from crippling one
another with arms-out thrusts or spirited kicks.
	   On the rainy pre-World Cup weekend, only the hard core turned
out. The mix was eclectic, and dress was come-as-you-are.
	   A blonde in a clinging satin gown danced with a guy in a sweaty
white T-shirt and plaid golf pants. A young man with a shaved scalp
and an orange silk purse twirled a woman who towered over him.
	   Most were French, but there was also Raffaela, a ravishing
nuclear engineer from Italy. And a pair of real Argentines stole
the show.
	   ``They're not bad, these French,'' allowed a raven-haired Buenos
Aires beauty known to regulars only as Karen. She strapped on black
patent leather pumps with railroad-spike heels and tangoed away.
	   ``It suits us well,'' Catherine Marie explained. ``There is such
communication with your partner, a dialogue with no words. The
tango is like dancing out the tragedy of life, the stupidities of
life.''
	   Jerome Lefebvre, a mover within an association called Le Temps
du Tango, estimated that 600 Parisians dance the tango with some
skill, and most take at least two years to get to a comfortable
level.
	   ``It is the ultimate dance of the couple, with constant
improvisation and infinite liberty,'' he said. ``You can learn it,
but there is always more. You are never finished. Never, never.''
	   Round about midnight, the boom box suddenly spilled out Great
Balls of Fire, and people began to rock.
	   ``That's so you can stretch your legs,'' Francis said, sitting
that one out.
	   ``I love the tango because it is so human, with such sensuality
and the constant awareness of others,'' he said. ``It is a passion,
like a drug. You never want to stop.''
	   Apparently not. The other morning, long after the boom box had
gone, and sun had burned away the magic, and garbage men clattered
past, a lone couple was still dancing the tango in Paris.

World Cup: French coach sees few goals in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Eleven players playing defense.
	   It's a horror scenario for anyone who wants to see more goals
and open, fluid play, but French coach Aime Jacquet sees it coming
anyway _ especially against his offensively-challenged team.
	   ``I'm telling you, they will play with 11 behind,'' Jacquet told
the Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche. ``What do you think? It is
the setup of modern soccer.''
	   France opens its World Cup campaign Friday against South Africa,
and its ineptitude in front of the goal is a major problem. No
striker on the team has been impressive.
	   France got a taste of what's to come against Finland in an
exhibition game Friday, scraping through with a 1-0 win after David
Trezeguet scored a late goal. The Finns kept the French in check
with the type of physical play that is expected to be a fixture in
many of the 64 World Cup matches.
	   ``It was scandalous,'' Jacquet said. ``Did you see what they did
to (midfielder Zinedine) Zidane? ... Are these referees part of
FIFA or not?''
	   Jacquet realizes he will need Zidane to be at his best if France
is to make a challenge for the Cup, and he's worried about his star
player getting injured.
	   ``Opponents will put up blocks,'' Jacquet said. ``So it is the
team with the most imaginative technician that will make the
difference.''
	   Still, Zidane needs someone to set up.
	   The French league's top scorer, Stephane Guivarc'h, has hit only
one goal in his seven internationals, and he has failed to set up a
good partnership with Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff.

Engine troubles cause high-speed train to make emergency stop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Concerned by noises coming from the
locomotive, the driver of a high-speed train made an emergency stop
to unload passengers left jittery by last week's deadly rail crash,
officials said Sunday.
	   The InterCity Express ``Prinz Eugen'' was approaching Regensburg
in southern Bavaria state Saturday at about 3 p.m., en route from
Vienna to Hamburg, when the driver heard unusual noises, said
German railway spokesman Martin Katz.
	   The ``Prinz Eugen'' was one of the first-generation InterCity
Express trains, the same type that derailed and smashed into a
bridge in the northern town of Eschede on Wednesday, killing 102
people.
	   A broken wheel has been identified as the likely cause, and the
``Prinz Eugen'' was making a final run before a mandatory
ultrasound inspection of its wheels. The train had been put back in
service after passing a preliminary sight inspection ordered, and
before the wheels became investigators' focus.
	   Katz said the driver stopped the train, then continued slowly to
the next station at Neumarkt, where 150 passengers were transferred
to other trains.
	   Authorities who later inspected the train confirmed the driver's
suspicions that the noises had come from the engine. They did not
identify the cause.
	   Passengers also said they heard strange sounds, although
inspectors say that was unlikely.
	   ``I don't want to rule out, after what happened in Eschede, that
some passengers might say they thought they heard something before
the train stopped,'' said Katz. ``But passengers wouldn't have been
able to hear anything from the locomotive.''
	   The train was traveling at a reduced speed of 160 kilometers
(100 miles) an hour instated after the crash.
	   Federal rail authorities expected to have the first three
first-generation trains back on the rails at normal top speed of
280 kilometers (175 miles) an hour by Sunday afternoon.

Kosovo militants call for more help to fight Serb forces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with pope, Kinkel, newspaper report on low police
morale, more background &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's rebel army appealed Sunday
for more ethnic Albanians to join them and ``fight for freedom''
from the Serbian forces waging a fierce offensive against them.
	   The call, published in the Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore
in Kosovo's capital Pristina, showed that the Serbs' latest
campaign in the secessionist province has not broken the will of
the outgunned Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The Serbs' latest offensive in the Decani region of western
Kosovo has left at least 50 people dead and 200 missing, according
to ethnic Albanian officials, in addition to sending thousands of
residents fleeing from ruined villages.
	   Serbian officials have characterized it as a response to
increasing attacks by the KLA, a loosely formed group of
self-described freedom fighters who claim to control some 40
percent of the southern province of Yugoslavia's Republic of
Serbia.
	   But the Serbs' stepped-up efforts to wipe out militant
resistance to their authority seem only to have increased the KLA's
backing among the province's young people as well as Kosovo-born
emigres abroad who supply and fund them.
	   ``Come to strengthen our troops against the enemy artillery and
enemy infantry,'' the KLA statement said.
	   It appealed ``for the last time'' to ethnic Albanian political
organizations to give up their policy of a peaceful struggle for
independence and join the KLA.
	   There were no immediate reports Sunday about new clashes in
western Kosovo, which remained sealed off and inaccessible for
foreign journalists.
	   Federal authorities in Yugoslavia, which now consists of just
Serbia and Montenegro, on Sunday escorted more than 40 diplomats
into the besieged region. But journalists were excluded from the
tour, except for the state-run Serbian Radio Television and the
official Tanjug news agency.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the 2.2
million people living in the province, and most demand to secede
from Serbia and Yugoslavia. Western powers are against any change
of borders in the volatile Balkans but want the Serbs to cease
their offensive and give Kosovo the autonomy taken away by Serbia
in 1989 as a way to suppress the independence movement.
	   The offensive that began in late May has stirred increasing
international concern and fears of igniting a wider war in the
Balkans. The United States is expected to reimpose sanctions
against Serbia after a White House meeting on Monday.
	   On Sunday, Pope John Paul II called on the world to act against
violence and repression in Kosovo.
	   ``Not far from us, in Kosovo, violent options, repression and
the flight of peoples must not leave the international community
inert,'' he said at the Vatican. The violence, the pope said,
``recalls the tragic recent history of the Balkans.''
	   The exodus of more than 10,000 Albanians into Albania last week,
and others into Montenegro, also has stirred worry in the West.
	   In Germany, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the Welt am
Sonntag newspaper his country is afraid of being flooded with
refugees, so it is working with international refugee agencies to
assist them in the Balkans.
	   About 400,000 ethnic Albanians already live in Germany.
	   Serbs vow never to allow the secession of Kosovo, which has many
ancient Orthodox monasteries and which they consider to be the
cradle of their history. Ethnic Albanians, who have long objected
to the Serbs' forceful rule in Kosovo, declare their own historical
claim to the land by saying they are descendants of the ancient
Illyrians, the region's first inhabitants.
	   The Serb community in Kosovo is dwindling in numbers and there
have been reports of low morale among the police deployed to fight
the militants.
	   Belgrade-based Dnevni Telegraf reported Sunday that a total of
363 policemen are leaving the force because they do not want to
fight in Kosovo.

Zamorano sustains minor injury, sits out practice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGIO CARRASCO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARIGNAC, France (AP) _ Ivan Zamorano, half of Chile's
high-scoring front line, sat out practice Sunday with what team
doctor called a ``minor'' knee injury.
	   Doctor Eugenio Valdecantos said the injury would not keep the
31-year-old forward out of Chile's World Cup debut against Italy on
Thursday.
	   ``There is no reason for concern,'' Valdecantos said. ``This a
very minor, easy-to-cure injury.''
	   As coach Nelson Acosta directed a two-hour practice session at
the Robert Brettes Stadium in southern France, Zamorano watched
sitting on the sideline, a white bandage and ice around his right
leg.
	   Zamorano did not appear worried as he smiled and waived at
reporters as he walked, limping slightly, to the team bus for the
ride back to the hotel.
	   Valdecantos said the injury is ``a contusion to the right leg
meniscus caused by a bad fall from a jump, a very common injury
among soccer players.''
	   Valdecantos said he ordered Zamorano to rest for one day, which
would also allow the Inter Milan striker to chance to ``cure a
painful scratch to his left heel.''
	   Zamorano sustained the injury Saturday during a practice match
against a Chilean youth team now touring Europe. Chile won 5-0,
with Zamorano scoring one goal.

Singapore association suggests ban for drivers using phones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Going a step beyond tough police restrictions
against using a handheld phone while driving, the Automobile
Association of Singapore recommended Sunday that such errant
motorists be banned from driving altogether.
	   In mid-May, Singapore police announced they would confiscate
mobile phones from motorists caught using them while driving.
Talking on a handheld phone while driving is illegal for safety
reasons, though using a hands-free car phone is not.
	   Those violating the rule are fined 170 Singapore dollars (dlrs
100) and receive demerit points on their licenses in addition to
losing their phones.
	   According to state-run television, the Automobile Association of
Singapore said they support tough new measures by the traffic
police to deter speeding and dangerous driving.
	   These include the mobile phone rule and a recent regulation to
revoke a driver's license from those caught exceeding the speed
limit by 60 kilometers per hour (37 miles per hour).
	   But the automobile association said confiscating phones isn't
enough of a deterrent, since culprits can simply buy another.
	   ``Its better to have something that's practical, something that
people can follow, and something that can be enforced,'' said
Gerard Ee, president of the association. ``It is the attitude of
the driver that one attempts to correct.''
	   More than one-quarter of Singapore's three million people have
mobile phones, and they can be heard ringing everywhere from movie
theaters to church services.

South Africa avoids the follow-on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ South Africa avoided the follow-on
with the penultimate ball before lunch Sunday as it worked on
saving the first cricket test against England at Edgbaston.
	   The visitors were 264 for seven at the break after rain robbed
39 minutes from the fourth morning.
	   South Africa resumed the day on 192 for five, and still trailed
England's 462 by 198 runs.
	   Jonty Rhodes and Lance Klusener came to the rescue of South
Africa in an undefeated 40-run stand for the eighth wicket.
	   They came together at 224 for seven after medium paceman Angus
Fraser had grabbed two quick wickets.
	   Fraser, who claimed the wicket of Daryll Cullinan (78) five
minutes before stumps on the third day, removed Shaun Pollock and
Mark Boucher in the space of 12 balls.
	   Fraser had Pollock (16) caught hooking and two overs later had
Mark Boucher (0) edging a catch to 'keeper Alec Stewart.
	   Jonty Rhodes, fresh from a 78-ball century in his last
first-class outing, held the South African middle order together
with an unbeaten 68.
	   Klusener was on 20.
	   Rhodes was dropped by substitute fielder Ben Spendlove at
long-leg with a difficult catch off medium-paceman Dominic Cork
just before the break.
	   Fraser has taken 3-67 while Cork, who took the first four South
African wickets, has 4-62.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists charged with filming without government permission were
acquitted by a Yemeni court Sunday.
	   Judge Haikal Ahmed Othman ordered the release of producer Robin
Barnwell, reporter Rageh Ommar and cameraman Frank Smith after
viewing the tapes they filmed and listening to witnesses'
testimony.
	   ``Yemen believes in the freedom of the press, and the press is a
necessity in this age. The world has become a village as a result
of advanced technology and information,'' Othman said before
announcing the verdict.
	   Othman said the reporters did not break any laws and were
visiting Yemen legally.
	   ``The authorities were aware of their presence, and the films
they shot did not insult the government or the Yemeni people,'' he
said.
	   Othman said that the prosecution accused the three men of
failing to obtain permission from authorities to travel to areas in
western Yemen where kidnappings have taken place but did not
provide enough evidence to support the charges.
	   He said that the law requires only that resident journalists
inform authorities of their movements.
	   Dozens of journalists and Yemenis attending the trial, which
began Saturday, cheered the verdict and congratulated the three men
and their lawyer al-Sheik Tareq Abdullah.
	   ``This is a victory for Yemen and the Yemeni people,'' Abdullah
said.
	   The journalists were arrested after returning to the capital,
San`a, after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan tribe near

Saudi Arabia offers humanitarian aid to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia on Sunday said it was
planning to send humanitarian aid to Iraq, but the statement came
as Iraq announced it would no longer accept such aid.
	   The official Saudi Press Agency reported the kingdom's first
such offer of aid from Saudi Arabia, which was the launching pad
for a U.S.-led allied coalition that ousted Iraq from Kuwait in
1991.
	   King Fahd has ordered that food and medical supplies be sent to
Iraq, ``to help ease the suffering of the Iraqi people who are in
dire need of food and medicine,'' the agency said. It did not say
how much aid the Saudis had in mind, nor how they wanted to send
it.
	   Iraq's 22 million people are suffering from crippling United
Nations sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
sanctions severely limit the export of oil, Iraq's main earner of
foreign currency.
	   Baghdad newspaper reported Sunday that Iraq had said it would
turn down any further shipments of humanitarian aid ferried by
friendly countries or organizations.
	   Iraq will ask donors to work on lifting trade sanctions instead
of sending aid, the reports said. Iraq gave no reason for the
decision, but diplomats in Baghdad suggested the government felt
humiliated at the publicity given aid shipments to the once wealthy
country. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity.

 &UR; Agony for Toyota as Porsche triumphs again at Le Mans
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE MANS, France (AP) - Porsche won its third successive Le Mans
24 hour race in dramatic fashion Sunday, after the leading Toyota
GT One withdrew with gearbox problems less than 90 minutes before
the end of the contest.
	   A Porsche GT1 driven by Alan McNish of Britain and France's
Laurent Aiello and Stephane Ortelli won the 66th Le Mans race,
having covered the 13.6-kilometer (8.456-mile) circuit 352 times.
	   The winning Porsche covered about 4787 kilometers (2,976 miles)
less than the 4.909.6 kilometers (3,050 miles) recorded by last
year's winner, the TWR Porsche driven by Michele Alboreto. This
year's winners averaged around 199 kph (124 mph).
	   Another Porsche GT1, driven by Germany's Jorg Muller and Uwe
Alzen and Bob Wolleck of France, was second with 351 laps.
	   In third place was the Nissan R390 driven by Japan's Kazuyoshi
Hoshino, Aguri Suzuki and Masahiko Kageyama, with 349 laps.
	   It was all so different only 90 minutes before the checkered
flag was raised.
	   Toyota mechanics - who had begun to sense the manufacturer's
first ever Le Mans win - were in tears as their Toyota GT1 limped
into the pits when more than 30 seconds ahead.
	   The car, being driven by lead driver Thierry Boutsen, officially
withdrew just 70 minutes from the end, with transmission failure.
	   ``Thierry deserved to win after driving so well overnight,''
said Toyota teammate Martin Brundle. ``The whole team has worked so
hard and we are all terribly disappointed to lose the race this
way. It's awful to go out so close to the end.''
	   Only one Japanese manufacturer, Mazda in 1991, has ever won the
Le Mans race.
	   Porsche, the most successful Le Mans mark ever, demonstrated its
renowned reliability to win its 16th contest.
	   The company, which won seven straight Le Mans races in the
1980s, has won the last three contests here.
	   After Mercedes and BMW each lost both of their cars early in the
race Saturday afternoon, the stage soon became set for a scrap
between Toyota, Porsche and Nissan.
	   Boutsen was leading for more than four hours on Saturday, but it
was Porsche that dominated at the halfway stage, when its two cars
were three laps ahead of the field.
	   An early leader, the Toyota was only fifth at the halfway point,
but clawed its way back to the head of the field Sunday morning.
	   Porsche chiefs could only look on as driver error and mechanical
failure left both its cars in the pits for more than half an hour
at 6 a.m.
	   First, the car driven by Muller, Alzen and Wolleck, while in
second place, was in the pits for 31 minutes.
	   The car needed new brakes and a change in undercarriage after
Muller skidded out of control in rain.
	   Within minutes the leading car, the Porsche driven by McNish,
Aiello and Ortelli, was also in trouble.
	   With McNish behind the wheel, the car had a water leak and was
in the pits for 35 minutes.
	   Toyota took advantage, only to fall close to the finish.
	   The fastest lap of the race, 3:41.809 was recorded by early in
the race by Brundle in another Toyota GT1.
	   Brundle's car fell out of the race after 14 hours with engine
failure.
	   The Mercedes of German Bernd Schneider, which was fastest in
practice, fell out of the race with motor failure after just 90
minutes.
	   The best placed prototype was the Ferrari 333 driven by Wayne
Taylor, Eric van de Poele and Fermin Velez, which came eighth.

Fighters beat Marines 6-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigel Wilson singled home two runs in a three-run
fifth inning and Hiroshi Numata hurled a five-hitter as the Nippon
Ham Fighters beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 6-1 at Tokyo Dome Sunday
to move to the top of the Pacific League.
	   Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, hit the single
after three straight walks by Lotte hurler Juichiro Mutoh left the
bases loaded.
	   Numata (2-0) went the distance for the first time in his
three-year pro career.
	   The Fighters moved one game ahead of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks,
who lost to the Kintetsu Buffaloes 1-0 at Fukuoka Dome and fell to
second place.
	   Hiroshi Takamura held the Hawks to six hits for his second
victory against four defeats.
	   Catcher Hideaki Okubo hit a triple and scored the Buffaloes's
only run in the second inning off of Norihiro Nakamura's single
against Brian Williams.
	   Williams, formerly with the Baltimore Orioles, took the loss and
slipped to a record of 1-2.
	   At Seibu Dome, pinch hitter Yoshiaki Kanemura drove in the
winning run in the bottom of the 12th inning with a sacrifice fly
as the Seibu Lions edged the Orix BlueWave 9-8.
	   Trailing 1-8, the Lions scored five runs in the seventh with
five hits and two walks. Domingo Martinez added another run with a
homer in the eighth and the tying run came on third baseman Akihito
Igarashi's error in the ninth.
	   Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester, has 11 homers.
	   In the Central League, Tomohito Itoh pitched a five-hitter and
Takahiro Ikeyama slugged a home run in the fifth inning as the
Yakult Swallows edged the front-running Hiroshima Toyo Carp 2-1 in
Fukushima.
	   Itoh is 1-3 and Ikeyama has eight homers.
	   The Carp still are a half game ahead of the second-place Yomiuri
Giants as the Chunichi Dragons beat the Giants 4-2 at Nagoya Dome
and ended their losing streak at three.
	   The Dragons' Koichi Sekikawa went 3-for-4 and drove in three
runs, including a two-run triple in the third inning.
	   Sun Dong-yol, formerly with the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's
professional league, gave up one hit in the ninth inning for his
10th save against two victories.
	   At Sapporo, Hiroshi Yagi hit a two-run double in the sixth
inning as the Hanshin Tigers beat the Yokohama BayStars 5-1.

Swiss voters reject restrictions on genetic engineering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rejection of initiative. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ After an emotive campaign, Swiss voters
on Sunday decisively rejected a proposal to outlaw the production
and patenting of genetically modified plants and animals.
	   In the run-up to the vote, Swiss industry and government say
would force a ``draconian'' shutdown on research in Switzerland,
sending highly paid jobs to other countries.
	   With results in from more than half of Switzerland's 26 cantons
(states) by mid-afternoon, not a single canton had voted in favor
of the tough restrictions which ``The Initiative for the Protection
of Life and the Environment against Genetic Manipulation'' would
have imposed.
	   For a proposal to be passed, there has to be both a majority of
cantons and of voters in favor.
	   Early exit polls published by Swiss television predicted that 64
percent of the electorate would reject the proposals.
	   Polls before Sunday's vote had pointed to a narrower defeat for
the initiative.
	   Environmentalists and consumer activists who backed it say too
little is known about the consequences of letting genetically
modified organisms into the food chain.
	   In a note to voters, the backers argued that tampering with
genes poses ``incalculable risks'' for the environment and the
prospect of unethical treatment of animals used in experiments.
	   But the issue of jobs is also highly sensitive to the
resource-poor country of 7 million. Despite Switzerland's small
size, it is a leading force in biotechnology.
	   Basel-based pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Roche rank with
competitors such as Monsanto, of St. Louis, among world leaders in
the field.
	   The Swiss pharmaceutical industry said the initiative would keep
the companies and academic researchers from doing some of their
best research, especially medical research involving genetically
modified animals, in Switzerland.
	   In Basel itself, 67.3 percent of voters were against the
restrictions.
	   Switzerland's German-speaking majority was, as expected, more
favorable to the proposal than the western French-speaking states.
In one of these, Neuchatel, 77.5 percent of voters rejected it.

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's Communications Authority and the
Swedish telecommunications giant LM Ericsson AB have signed a dlrs
118 million contract to build a new telephone network, Syrian
newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The government daily Tishrin said the network will initially add
one million new telephone lines as a first stage followed by
another 650,000 lines. The deal was signed Saturday.
	   Ericsson is a world leader in the telecommunications field with
activities in more than 130 countries. It focuses on advanced
systems and products for wired and mobile communications in private

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 120 Egyptian companies will hold a
week-long trade fair in Baghdad beginning June 16 in a bid to
increase the volume of Egyptian exports to Iraq, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported Sunday.
	   It said goods on show will include household utensils,
electronic and electrical appliances as well as medical and food
stuffs.
	   A five-member Egyptian delegation is currently in Iraq to
prepare for the show, the agency said.
	   U.N. figures show that Egypt has exported dlrs 170 million worth
of goods to Iraq since the start of the U.N. oil-for-food deal
program.
	   Egypt plans to boost its share of Iraqi imports under the
current phase of the six-month deal under which Iraq's import bill
is expected to be in the range of dlrs 3.1 instead of dlrs 1.3 so
far.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The volume of Kuwait's foreign trade last year
fell by 5.5 percent from the previous year, reaching 6.78 billion
dinars (dlrs 22.15 billion), Al-Watan daily reported Sunday.
	   The newspaper quoted official statistics as saying last year's
imports were valued at 2.50 billion dinars (dlrs 8.16 billion),
about O.2 percent lower than 1996. Exports, including oil, were
valued at 4.28 billion dinars (dlrs 13.98 billion), down 8.3
percent from 1996.
	   Cars accounted for 9.8 percent of last year's imports, followed
by heavy machinery, spare parts and gold, the newspaper reported.
Other than crude, Kuwait's main exports are petrochemical products.
	   Last year, 13.8 percent of Kuwait's imports came from Japan, and
13.6 came from the United States, according to the statistics.

Medical students in Dar es Salaam suspended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The government has suspended all
445 medical students at Muhimbili University College of Health
Sciences for ``security reasons,'' state radio reported Sunday.
	   Radio Tanzania quoted Vice Chancellor Mathew Luhanga as saying
the students were sent home ``due to prevailing situation at the
college.''
	   On Thursday, riot police dispersed the undergraduate students
after they stormed a conference hall where Health Minister Aaron
Chiduo was meeting university officials, the broadcast said.
	   The students boycotted classes the same day and Friday to
protest the upgrading of the college, formerly a constituent of
University of Dar es Salaam, to a university. The students said
they were not consulted.
	   The government also suspended indefinitely the publication of
three privately-owned Swahili language newspapers for publishing
pornographic cartoons, the broadcast said.
	   It said the cartoons are harmful to the country's culture and
the editors had refused to comply with state requests to tone them
down.
	   Two of the tabloids are published in Dar es Salaam and the third
in the northern town of Arusha. Their editors could not be reached
for comment Sunday.
	   Tanzanian law permits the government to suspend publications if
they are seen to deviate from their declared editorial policies.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Hundreds of angry passengers on Sunday
accused the captain of a Ukrainian cruise ship of cutting their
trip short and forcibly taking them back to Ukraine.
	   The passengers, mainly Russians and Ukrainians, threw messages
in plastic bottles to members of the media, who approached the ship
with small boats, begging for help from their consulates.
	   After restocking food supplies, the ferry left Istanbul for
Odessa, Ukraine, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   The passengers sent distress signals to a Turkish coast guard
boat on Saturday as the ship passed through the Dardanelles, a
strait that passes from the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea.
	   The captain of the Taras Shevchenko refused Turkish calls to
stop, saying everything was calm on board, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   ``These people have stolen our money. We want our money back,''
shouted several passengers as they held huge banners reading
``S.O.S. Help''
	   ``We were supposed to go to 12 ports and we did not,'' Vladimir
Kryzhanovskiy said aboard the ship while it was moored in the
international waters off Istanbul.
	   Russian news agency ITAR-Tass said on Sunday that the problem
surfaced because the tour company which organized the cruise failed
to transfer the money to the shipping company in time.
	   The captain locked the ship's exists to prevent passengers from
boarding supply barges tied up next to the ship.
	   The ship set sail May 30 from Odessa for a three-week
Mediterranean cruise of seven countries and 12 ports. The minimum
ticket price was dlrs 1,500. It reached the Athens port of Piraeus
on June 1. It left Piraeus on Friday, the Greek coast guard said.
	   The coast guard said the ship had 271 crew members and 517
passengers aboard.
	   ``We were even not allowed to go off the boat in Piraeus as we
anchored there for five days,'' said Kryzhanovskiy, a producer with
private ART television based in Odessa, Ukraine.
	   Greek authorities said the ship was on transit status, and that
no legal arrangements had been made for a stop there.

Swiss voters reject restrictions on genetic engineering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rejection of initiative &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss voters on Sunday decisively
rejected a proposal to outlaw the production and patenting of
genetically modified plants and animals.
	   Before the vote, Swiss industry and government said the measure
would force a ``draconian'' shutdown on research in Switzerland,
sending highly paid jobs to other countries.
	   With results in from more than half of Switzerland's 26 cantons
by mid-afternoon, not a single canton had voted in favor of the
tough restrictions, which ``The Initiative for the Protection of
Life and the Environment against Genetic Manipulation'' would have
imposed.
	   Both a majority of cantons and voters have to favor a measure
for it to pass.
	   Early exit polls published by Swiss television predicted that 64
percent of the electorate would reject the proposals.
	   Environmentalists and consumer activists who backed the
initiative said too little is known about the consequences of
letting genetically modified organisms into the food chain.
	   They argued that tampering with genes posed ``incalculable
risks'' for the environment and the prospect of unethical treatment
of animals used in experiments.
	   But the issue of jobs is also highly sensitive to the
resource-poor country of 7 million, which is a leading force in
biotechnology.
	   Basel-based pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Roche rank among
world leaders in the field.
	   The Swiss pharmaceutical industry and the government say the
initiative would shackle the companies research.
	   In Basel itself, 67 percent of voters rejected the restrictions.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Injured Dutch striker Dennis
Bergkamp may miss the Netherlands' first two World Cup finals
qualifying matches as he struggles to reach match fitness following
a lengthy layoff.
	   Bergkamp is recovering from a hamstring injury and has not yet
trained with the Dutch World Cup squad as it prepares for the June
10-July 12 finals in France. He was with the team Sunday meeting
fans at Amsterdam's Arena stadium and was not scheduled to train.
	   ``He is kicking the ball a little on his own, but has not yet
joined team training,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said following
Friday's crushing 5-1 defeat of Nigeria by the Dutch. ``He is
getting better but he hasn't played for six weeks and is missing
match fitness.''
	   Bergkamp is almost certain to miss the opening Dutch Group E
qualifying match, June 13 in St. Denis against Belgium, and may
also be forced out of the second, against South Korea on June 20 in
Marseille. The Netherlands' final group match is against Mexico on
June 25.
	   Bergkamp, who scored 16 league goals for his English club
Arsenal this season has not pulled on a Dutch shirt for any of the
three tune-up matches the Netherlands has played in the last two
weeks.
	   Hiddink has repeatedly said he will not play Bergkamp unless he
is 100 percent certain of his fitness. ``If he starts playing a
minute too soon we could lose him for the whole tournament,''
Hiddink said recently.
	   In his absence, the Dutch scored 10 goals and conceded just two
in their last two warm-up games against World Cup-bound opposition
Paraguay and Nigeria.
	   Bergkamp has scored 33 goals for the Netherlands.

Pakistan says it cannot be forced to sign nonproliferation
</HEADLINE>
treaties &QL; 
 &UR; By ARTHUR MAX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan said Sunday it cannot be
compelled to sign the nuclear arms control treaties, and accused
the U.N. Security Council of ignoring the new reality of South
Asia's nuclear status.
	   The council, which condemned last month's nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan, had taken an approach that was ``manifestly lopsided,
unjust and unrealistic,'' said a statement from the Foreign
Ministry.
	   It also expressed disappointment that the resolution adopted
Saturday did not offer concrete steps toward resolving Pakistan's
dispute with India over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, which
both claim.
	   Nuclear tensions exploded on the Indian subcontinent May 11 when
India tested a series of nuclear devices, demonstrating a
capability to build strategic and tactical nuclear weapons.
	   Pakistan, resisting international pressure not to respond,
detonated its own nuclear devices two weeks later.
	   Both countries demanded entry into the exclusive five-member
club of official nuclear states recognized by international arms
control regimes.
	   The Security Council denied them that legal status and urged
them to sign the nonproliferation treaties, which they have
resisted for decades.
	   ``The council has ignored the reality on the ground,'' the
Pakistani statement said.
	   ``Treaty provisions cannot be enforced on non-parties. Treaty
obligations can only be assumed on a voluntary basis,'' it said.
Trying to impose a treaty ``is by its very nature unequal and
unsustainable.''
	   The statement did not refer specifically to the resolution's
call against deploying missiles capable of carrying nuclear
warheads.
	   Hours before the resolution, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
reiterated his offer to hold ``a meaningful dialogue'' with Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In New Delhi, Vajpayee
welcomed the idea of talks. The two men are to attend a regional
summit in Sri Lanka in July.
	   But leaders of the two countries have met regularly over the
years without breaking new ground. Lower level officials also have
met periodically, but each round of talks has broken down over
unbridgeable difference about Kashmir.
	   The Security Council called on the two rivals to exercise
restraint and find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root
causes of those tensions, including Kashmir.''
	   Pakistan had clearly hoped the international community would get
directly involved in the Kashmir dispute, overriding Indian
objections that the problem is for India and Pakistan to sort out
themselves.
	   Two of the subcontinent's three wars in the last 50 years were
fought over Kashmir, a former kingdom that had a Muslim majority
and a Hindu ruler. Pakistan holds two-thirds of the territory and
India one-third.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with airline official saying ``virtually all'' of
striking pilots fired; airline starts processing applications of
new pilots; PAL cites pilots abandoning aircraft in Bangkok

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines announced Sunday
it was firing all striking pilots who had defied a return to work
order, plunging the financially-troubled airline into one of its
most serious labor crises.
	   The action came after pilots continued a strike and staged a
protest march Sunday, defying airline threats of dismissal unless
they return to work by noon.
	   ``Some pilots were able to beat the deadline but those who
remained defiant were, in accordance with law and jurisprudence,
declared as having lost their jobs with the airline,'' PAL said in
a statement.
	   An airline official said ``virtually all of the airlines'
pilots'' were terminated and they have started processing
applications for new pilots.
	   The strike began Friday, forcing international and domestic
flight cancellations and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.
	   Calling the strike illegal, the airline fired 29 officers of the
620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines Saturday
and warned remaining members would also be dismissed if they didn't
return to work by noon Sunday.
	   Instead of returning to work, the pilots marched around a PAL
compound in metropolitan Manila's suburban Paranaque city,
brandishing placards that read ``Give labor its due'' and ``All is
not well in PAL.''
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of firing pilots
who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours,
regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of
forced retirement, Umali said.
	   PAL called the strike illegal because the Department of Labor
has assumed jurisdiction over the dispute and has barred both sides
from committing any hostile actions.
	   Labor officials called both sides to a meeting Sunday afternoon
but failed to end the dispute.
	   The airline said the strike was embarrassing the country, citing
pilots, who abandoned a PAL plane in Bangkok at the start of the
strike.
	   ``This clearly demonstrates the pilots' total lack of
sensitivity,'' said PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia.
	   PAL scheduled five international and 14 domestic flights on
Sunday, using management pilots.
	   Over the past four years, the airline has incurred annual losses
ranging from 451.4 million pesos (dlrs 11.3 million) to 2.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 62.5 million), in part because of large debts, an aging
fleet and Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL says it faces an ``uncertain future,'' and announced plans
earlier this year to cut expenses by as much as 40 percent, slash
flights, and sharply reduce its work force. The airline hasn't
disclosed an estimate for its manpower reduction, but employees
fear it could be as much as 30 percent.
	   PAL is controlled by Chinese Filipino tycoon Lucio Tan. It had
been completely owned by the Philippine government from 1941 until
it was partly sold in 1992.

 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists charged with filming without government permission were
acquitted by a Yemeni court Sunday.
	   Judge Haikal Ahmed Othman ordered the release of BBC producer
Robin Barnwell, reporter Rageh Ommar and cameraman Frank Smith
after viewing the tapes they filmed and listening to witnesses'
testimony.
	   ``Yemen believes in the freedom of the press, and the press is a
necessity in this age. The world has become a village as a result
of advanced technology and information,'' Othman said before
announcing the verdict.
	   Othman said that the reporters did not break any laws and were
visiting Yemen legally and that the prosecution did not prove its
case against the three men.
	   ``The authorities were aware of their presence and the films
they shot did not insult the government or the Yemeni people,'' he
said.
	   The three men were accused of not informing the government of
their plans to film, but had made clear their intention in their
visa application.
	   Othman said the three journalists also did not break the law by
failing to state they would film where kidnappings have taken
place. He said a law requiring such advance notice applies only to
resident journalists.
	   Dozens of journalists and Yemenis attending the trial, which
began Saturday, cheered the verdict and congratulated the three men
and their lawyer al-Sheik Tareq Abdullah.
	   ``I'm very proud not only because I won the case but because
this case is historical. This is a victory for Yemen and the Yemeni
people,'' Abdullah said.
	   The journalists were arrested after returning to the capital
San`a after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan tribe near Marib,
170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of San`a.
	   The Bani Dhabyan have carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure of a British teacher, David Mitchell, his
wife Caroline, and their 14-year old son, Ben.
	   Armed tribesmen who rule over large parts of Yemen have
kidnapped foreigners and demanded concessions from the government
in return for their release. The hostages are usually well treated
and released unharmed.

World Cup: Offers of help for Gascoigne; crackdown on alcohol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England teammates and recovering alcoholics Tony
Adams and Paul Merson have offered to help dropped midfielder Paul
Gascoigne.
	   And England coach Glenn Hoddle has promised a crackdown on
drinking during the World Cup.
	   The two players, speaking in the Independent on Sunday, said
Gascoigne needed to decide if drinking was wrecking his life.
	   ``I just hope he sorts out his life and can be happy,'' said
Adams, who stopped drinking two years ago. ``Only he can decide if
he has a problem, but if he wants to choose my path then he knows
where I am.''
	   Merson, who plays with Gascoigne on England's Middlesbrough
club, echoed Adams.
	   ``I hope he can find it inside himself to want to do something
about the way things have been with him,'' Merson said.
	   Gascoigne, perhaps the most talented England player of his
generation, was cut from the England side a week ago when Hoddle
said he was out of shape, partly due to his late-night partying and
drinking.
	   On Saturday, England midfielder Teddy Sheringham apologized for
partying until dawn last week in a Portuguese night club. And
teammate Darren Anderton was reported on the fringe of a brawl last
week at a club in Bournemouth, England.
	   Hoddle promised a crackdown.
	   ``I am not going to ban alcohol and on occasion the players will
be allowed a couple of beers or a glass of wine. But only at the
right times,'' Hoddle told the newspaper.
	   ``Alcohol can also affect injuries and that was the
disappointing thing with Paul Gascoigne,'' he added. ``In England
that's what we have had all through our careers _ get in the
players' bar and have a beer. But that's detrimental and won't
happen in France.''
	   The newspaper pointed out that FIFA, the world governing body of
soccer, looks for alcohol during its drug tests.
	   ``The degree of (alcohol) use can be checked in the breath or
the blood and if it was heavy, it may lead to sanctions,'' the
newspaper quoted a FIFA spokeswoman as saying.

World Cup: light training and video viewing before Cameroon game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ When the Austrian team congregates in
front of the television set in their hotel after a training
session, more work lies ahead _ studying a video of resurgent
Cameroon, its first World Cup opponent
	   Austrian ``spies'' were on hand when Cameroon upset Denmark 2-1
last week in Copenhagen. A video of the game was handed to Coach
Herbert Prohaska at Vienna airport on Saturday, just before the
team flew to France.
	   Part of the Austrians' task ahead of its match on Thursday in
Toulouse is to lay out a strategy to contain the young and
aggressive African players.
	   ``We have the tape and we'll be looking at it,'' Prohaska said
Sunday. ``The games against the Netherlands and Denmark have shown
that Cameroon is a strong team we'll have to watch out for.''
	   Cameroon beat the Danes after holding the Netherlands to a
scoreless draw in a World Cup warmup 10 days ago in Arnhem. Even
without star midfielder Marc Vivien Foe _ sidelined since May with
a broken leg _ Cameroon showed the spark that earned it a berth in
the quarterfinals in the 1990 World Cup, the only African side to
advance so far in World Cup history.
	   Austrian forward Anton Polster said part of any winning formula
has to be to play as a team.
	   ``We want to present a solid squad,'' Polster told reporters.
``We're full of energy and are concentrating on what's ahead.''
	   The Austrians are based at a luxury hotel in Arsac, a
picturesque wine-growing town north of Bordeaux and near Margaux,
site of Sunday's press briefing.
	   Prohaska wasn't committing himself publicly to a lineup this
early. But he said ``nine or 10'' of the players he fielded in the
``A'' practice squad _ including Michael Konsel in goal and Anton
Pfeffer, Peter Schottel, Harald Cerny, Roman Mahlich, Anton
Pfeffer, and Dietmar Kuehbauer on the field _ might see action
against Cameroon.
	   In a training session Saturday, Hannes Reinmayr, the Sturm Graz
playmaker, collided with Wolfgang Feiersinger and hurt his knee.
Prohaska said Reinmayr would ``likely'' be fit by the Cameroon game
Thursday. Another team workout was scheduled Sunday afternoon.

Israel's opera company decides against performing Wagner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's only opera company said Sunday it had
concluded that Israeli audiences are not ready to hear works by
German composer Richard Wagner, whose operas blared over
loudspeakers in Nazi death camps.
	   The Tel Aviv-based New Israeli Opera held a public meeting
Saturday to gather audience response to the idea of staging a
Wagner work. The forum _ Wagner, Artist or Symbol _ turned
emotional, with audience members shouting down a singer and pianist
who tried to perform a sample Wagner piece.
	   The public is still too divided over the issue to justify going
ahead, said opera spokeswoman Varda Zimmerman.
	   ``If there is still opposition to Wagner opera, it will not be
peformed,'' she said.
	   Wagner was a self-declared anti-Semite who railed against what
he considered the undue influence of Jews in Germany's music
circles. Adolf Hitler, who came to power 50 years after the
composer's death, considered his music a glorification of a master
race.
	   The New Israeli Opera said the issue of Wagner's works will be
discussed at a future meeting of the opera board. The question has
sparked stormy protest in the past in Israel.
	   When after a 1981 Israel Philharmonic Orchestra concert,
conductor Zubin Mehta announced as an encore the prelude to the
Wagner opera ``Tristan and Isolde,'' the audience cried, ``Shame!''
and an usher rushed to the stage, pulling up his shirt to show
Nazi-inflicted scars.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three British Broadcasting Corp. television
journalists charged with filming without government permission were
acquitted by a Yemeni court Sunday.
	   Judge Haikal Ahmed Othman ordered the release of producer Robin
Barnwell, reporter Rageh Ommar and cameraman Frank Smith after
viewing the tapes they filmed and listening to witnesses'
testimony.
	   ``Yemen believes in the freedom of the press, and the press is a
necessity in this age. The world has become a village as a result
of advanced technology and information,'' Othman said before
announcing the verdict.
	   Othman said the reporters did not break any laws and were
visiting Yemen legally.
	   ``The authorities were aware of their presence, and the films
they shot did not insult the government or the Yemeni people,'' he
said.
	   The three men were accused of not informing the government of
their plans to film, but had made clear their intention in their
visa application.
	   Othman said the three journalists also did not break the law by
failing to state they would film where kidnappings have taken
place. A law requiring such advance notice applies only to resident
journalists, he said.

Junta drafts new law to allow Abacha's presidency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A new law that would clear the way for
military strongman Gen. Sani Abacha to become president has been
drafted by his ruling regime and will soon be passed, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   Quoting a member of the military junta, the Lagos Punch
newspaper said the new law would circumvent existing legislation
that bars armed forces officers from holding political office in
Nigeria.
	   When passed, the law would effectively nullify all legal
opposition to Abacha's eligibility, the newspaper reported, quoting
the unnamed official.
	   In April, Abacha became the only candidate for president in
August elections when he was nominated by all five state-sanctioned
political parties.
	   The nomination process triggered an uproar from opposition
leaders and pro-democracy groups who say Abacha manipulated the
system to eliminate any competition.
	   Anti-Abacha groups have since sought to use legal measures to
stop the military ruler's rise to the presidency.
	   A bid to use the federal courts to block Abacha's nomination was
dismissed on the grounds that Abacha had not yet officially
accepted the presidential nomination.
	   Abacha seized power five years ago after canceling presidential
elections and jailing the presumed winner Moshood Abiola. Although
the military junta has pledged to stand down and allow for a
civilian government, it has repeatedly reneged on the pledge.
	   Under Abacha's rule, Nigeria has become an international pariah,
accused of widespread human rights abuses and rampant corruption.

Taiwan's independence opposition elects die-hard chairman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A one-time political prisoner looked set
Sunday to become the chairman of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party in an election delayed by violence.
	   With a quarter of the 92,504 votes counted, Lin Yi-hsiung led
his main opponent, legislator Chang Chun-hung, by a two to one
margin, the party said.
	   If he wins, Lin will lead the party in December's elections for
lawmakers and the crucial posts of Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors.
Those polls are widely considered a dry run for the 2000
presidential election that represents the DPP's best chance yet to
capture the central government from the ruling Nationalists.
	   Lin supports Taiwan's formal and permanent independence from
China, a view the DPP officially espouses but has softened in
recent years.
	   He can be expected to seek to wrest power over the DPP's
direction from party factions and local political machines, and
expand membership, said You Nai-hsiang, a party commentator.
	   Formerly a local council deputy, Lin was among eight opposition
figures jailed for helping organize a 1978 pro-democracy
demonstration that turned into a violent confrontation with police.
	   While behind bars, Lin's mother and twin daughters were murdered
at his home. The crime has never been solved, but is widely
considered to have been an act of political revenge.
	   The DPP was banned in the years before 1987 when the
Nationalists governed an authoritarian state under martial law. The
Nationalists moved their government to Taiwan after being swept out
of China by Mao Tse-tung's Communists in 1949, and still propose
eventual reunification with China.
	   The DPP last year made major gains at the polls and now governs
over 70 percent of Taiwan's population at the local level. The
party controls about one third of seats in the national
legislature.
	   Party leaders were forced to hold a second round of voting in
the southern city of Kaohsiung after men believed to be supporters
of one candidate for chief of the DPP's Kaohsiung headquarters
overturned ballot boxes on May 24.
	   The men claimed their candidates' opponent was cheating by
allowing supporters to vote more than once.
	   Voting was completed in other areas, but ballot boxes were
sealed and votes were not counted until Sunday. This time, cameras
were set up at all polling places and voting proceedings broadcast
on screens at party headquarters to avoid further controversy.

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful time bomb tore through a
train traveling through southern Pakistan on Sunday, killing 26
people and wounding 45 others, many of them seriously, police and
emergency workers said.
	   The government accused India's intelligence service of
responsibility. India dismissed the charge as ``preposterous.''
	   The train was passing through a village 30 kilometers (18 miles)
outside Sukkur, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Karachi,
capital of the southern Sindh province, when the bomb exploded just
before dawn, police said.
	   The 18-carriage Khyber Mail express, with a capacity to carry
1,800 passengers, was headed from Karachi to the northwestern city
of Peshawar, they said. Among the dead were four children aged 5 or
younger, police said.
	   ``When we arrived, the carriage was destroyed and bodies were
blown to pieces. Many of the passengers were trapped and shouting
for help,'' said ambulance driver Mohammed Hafiz.
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussain said evidence had been
found linking India's Research and Analysis Wing to a spate of
bombings.
	   India and Pakistan routinely exchange accusations after apparent
terrorist actions, but they rarely provide evidence to support
their claims. Both countries also have internal ethnic and
religious conflicts that often lead to killings, bombings and
riots.
	   However, it would be hard to put Sunday's train bomb in an
ethnic context since it did not seem to have a specific target and
the explosive device was more powerful and more professionally
assembled than is usually seen in local disturbances.
	   India is trying to ``destabilize Pakistan through acts of
terrorism,'' said Hussein in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Linking the attack to the heightened nuclear tensions in the
region, Hussein said India ``wants to divert attention from its own
domestic frustrations because its nuclear explosion backfired.''
	   He also said a suspect had been captured in connection with a
theater bombing Friday that killed three people in the eastern city
of Lahore, capital of Punjab province.
	   Another alleged Indian agent had confessed to being involved in
10 bomb blasts within nine weeks earlier this year, said a
statement from Hussain's office.
	   Earlier, the government said it had received intelligence
information that Indian secret service agents would try to
infiltrate Pakistan to conduct terrorist acts between June 5 and 7.
	   The two countries have fought three wars since the South Asian
subcontinent gained its independence in 1947 from the departing
British.

Pakistan seeks Saudi help on nuclear crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Visiting Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif on Sunday sought Saudi Arabia's help in getting the
United States lift sanctions imposed after its nuclear tests last
month, a diplomat said.
	   Sharif asked Crown Prince Abdullah to use Saudi influence with
the United States to end the sanctions, the diplomat said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. He did not elaborate.
	   Sharif arrived here earlier Sunday on the second stop of his
Gulf tour to discuss the consequences of the Indian and Pakistani
nuclear tests and secure credit to maintain oil imports.
	   Pakistan bought dlrs 1.2 billion of petroleum products from Gulf
states during the nine months up to March.
	   Sharif arrived in this Red Sea port city from the United Arab
Emirates, where he met with President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al
Nahyan on Saturday. Sharif is expected to meet King Fahd later
Sunday.
	   He is accompanied by Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan and
Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
	   Led by the United States, several countries imposed economic
sanctions against Pakistan and India in a bid to block foreign
investment and credit to punish them for starting the nuclear
crisis.
	   The two nations have a history of enmity since Islamic Pakistan
was carved out in 1947 from predominantly Hindu India.
	   Fears of a nuclear arms race in the region began after India
tested five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13. Pakistan replied with
six nuclear tests, despite warnings from the U.N. Security Council,
the United States and other nations.
	   Islamabad expects the sanctions to cut off financing for aid
projects from the International Monetary Fund, and to lower
Pakistan's credit rating, making borrowing more expensive. Oil
concessions from the oil-rich Gulf could help offset the effect of
the sanctions.
	   Last week, both Saudi Arabia and the Emirates expressed
understanding for Islamabad's view that its nuclear tests were a
means to preserve its security and territorial integrity. However,
both countries also said the tests increased tension in the region.
	   Sharif will leave Monday for Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Police have arrested 19 people and smashed 16
bookmaking syndicates that accepted bets on horse racing from
people in Macau and the Chinese mainland, the government reported
Sunday.
	   Officers from the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau arrested the
people following raids throughout Hong Kong on Saturday, the
government said in a statement.
	   Betting and bank records seized during the raids indicated that
the turnover of the sydnicates could reach 80 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 10.2 million) for a single horse race, it said.
	   One of the syndicates even accepted bets on soccer matches, the
statement said.
	   Under the law, Hong Kong bookmakers who accept bets from outside
the territory could face charges of money laundering. The maxium
penalty for the offense is 14 years in jail and a fine of five
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 641,000).

confidence Sunday from the 301-member Parliament.
	   Prime Minister Abdel-Karim al-Iryani's Cabinet won 226 votes
while 17 deputies voted against and 26 abstained. The remaining 32
deputies did not attend the session.
	   The vote of confidence, which is a formal approval of the
government, comes less than a week after al-Iryani presented his
policy plan to Parliament, which included a pledge to continue with
a three-year-old program of economic and administrative reforms.
	   In his statement to Parliament last Monday, al-Iryani cautioned
that the Asian economic crisis and the fall in oil prices will have
a negative effect on the economy and further increase the budget
deficit to 36.2 billion rials (dlrs 275 million).
	   Oil revenues, which represent about 40 percent of the country's
total income, are Yemen's main source for foreign currency.
	   The 1998 budget projects oil income will increase 3 percent to
dlrs 1 billion from dlrs 970 million estimated for 1997. The
government aims to raise oil output capacity to 500,000 barrels per
day by 2000 from around 350,000 barrels daily now. Yemen's fiscal
year begins April 1.
	   The World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to Yemen to
support its economic reform program. The government has already cut
back subsidies and stepped up privatization of state-controlled
companies as part of reforms required by the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Still suffering from a devastating 1994 civil war, Yemen has a
foreign debt of some dlrs 10 billion it cannot serve. Most of its
17 million people live in poverty.
	   Al-Iryani took office on May 17, replacing Faraj bin Ghanem who
resigned amid differences with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the
real power in the country, over political and economic reforms.
Ghanem spent less than one year in office.

Security alert in tribal areas ahead of opposition march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladeshi security forces went into
high gear Sunday to prevent possible political clashes during an
opposition march this week against a peace accord that ended two
decades of bush war, officials said.
	   A senior official at the Home (Interior) Ministry said the army,
the paramilitary and the police had been put on alert to prevent
violent confrontations between opposition activists and government
supporters in the southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts during the
two-day protest.
	   The 2,000 Buddhist rebels of the Shanti Bahini or Peace Force
agreed to end their bush war last December after the government
promised them greater control over the region, rich in timber and
natural gas resources.
	   But seven right-wing opposition parties led by former Prime
Minister Khaleda Zia are opposing the peace accord, saying the
government had given away too much to the tribal insurgents.
	   The ruling Bangladesh Awami League of Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, who signed the peace accord with tribal insurgents last
year, has ordered a rival ``Peace March'' to match the opposition
program.
	   '' If the peace accord is scrapped, the region will again plunge
into violence and there will be a blood bath,'' Hasina said at a
public meeting in the capital Dhaka on Saturday.
	   The conflict has claimed nearly 20,000 lives since it started in
1975.
	   Opposition leaders have said hundreds of thousands of people
from across the country will assemble in Dhaka and Chittagong, 176
kilometers (110 miles) southeast of Dhaka, for the grand march.

Israel's opera company decides against performing Wagner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's only opera company said Sunday that
Israeli audiences are not ready to hear works by German composer
Richard Wagner, whose operas blared over loudspeakers in Nazi death
camps.
	   The Tel Aviv-based New Israeli Opera held a public meeting
Saturday to gather audience response to the idea of staging a
Wagner work. The forum _ Wagner, Artist or Symbol _ turned
emotional, with audience members shouting down a singer and a
pianist who tried to perform a sample Wagner piece.
	   The public is still too divided over the issue to justify going
ahead, said opera spokeswoman Varda Zimmerman.
	   ``If there is still opposition to Wagner opera, it will not be
performed,'' she said.
	   Wagner was a self-declared anti-Semite who railed against what
he considered the undue influence of Jews in Germany's music
circles. Adolf Hitler, who came to power 50 years after the
composer's death, considered his music a glorification of a master
race.
	   The New Israeli Opera said the issue of Wagner's works will be
discussed at a future meeting of the opera board. The question has
sparked stormy protest in the past in Israel.
	   When after a 1981 Israel Philharmonic Orchestra concert,
conductor Zubin Mehta announced as an encore the prelude to the
Wagner opera ``Tristan and Isolde,'' the audience cried, ``Shame!''
and an usher rushed to the stage, pulling up his shirt to show
Nazi-inflicted scars.

World Cup: Tunisia is ``ready'' for England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Forget that underdog stuff. After routing
Wales in a World Cup warmup, Tunisia says it wants England.
	   ``We are ready for you,'' Tunisia's Polish coach Henry
Kasperczak said after reflecting on Saturday's 4-0 victory in
Tunis. ``We are fit and ready, the side is knitting together well
and with a week or so to go before the game, I am happy with the
preparations.''
	   Tunisia plays England in the opening match for both teams in
Marseille on June 15, so the exhibition match essentially was an
effort by non-qualifier Wales to help out its neighbor by doing a
little scouting.
	   ``England will win in Marseille, I am sure of that,'' Welsh
striker John Hartson added. ``They will be too strong for Tunisia.
To be fair, we made them look good, it was so hot out there and
after all the traveling we have done and at the end of a long
season for a lot of our lads it was a game too far for us.''
	   But Wales manager Bobby Gould warns that England should be wary
of 25-year-old sweeper Khaled Badra, who scored one goal from 35
yards. Gould said Badra could step straight into the English
Premier League.
	   ``He carried the ball out of defense well. He is strong and
confident on the ball,'' Gould said. ``After witnessing his
performance against us, my advice to England is not to let him get
into range with shooting like that.''
	   That's the kind of talk Kasperczak likes to hear.
	   ``I believe good players will win matches in France and we want
to prove we have good players,'' Kasperczak said. ``We know the
quality of English football, but the important thing now is that
they think ahead and think what we are capable of. We hope they are
now a little worried.''

Pilots' group names 150 airports as unsafe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ International airline pilots have listed 150
airports with major safety problems and singled out 15 _ including
San Francisco, Nice and Hong Kong, _ which they believe are
``critically deficient,'' the Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper said it had been leaked a copy of a report
compiled at a meeting of the International Federation of Air Line
Pilots' Associations, or Ifalpa, in Montreal, Canada in April.
	   ``If airports and airspaces are listed, it means they have
serious deficiencies, not that they are unsafe,'' the Sunday Times
quoted Ifalpa executive directorCathy Bill as saying.
	   ``There are potential dangers, but there are potential dangers
when you get in any plane.''
	   Other airports in the critically deficient category were:
Wellington in New Zealand; Oslo's Fornebu Airport; Suva in Fiji;
Buenos Aires in Argentina; Leticia, Rio Negro and San Andres in
Colombia; Maiquetia in Venezuela; Nauru, one of the Solomon
Islands; Lagos and Port Harcourt in Nigeria and Kabul in Istanbul.
	   The Sunday Times said air crews have complained about landing at
airports in popular tourist destinations, such as Greece, ``to find
inadequate runway lighting and no air-traffic controllers on the
ground.''
	   At Argentina's Mendoza Airport, it said, a pilot reported a
horse on the runway. Another aborted a take-off from Buenos Aires
after seeing children playing in his path.
	   At San Francisco, the Sunday Times said, planes land in pairs on
parallel runways with pilots often relying largely on visual
contact. ``It's been know for pilots to start aiming at the wrong
runway and drift across in front of the other plane,'' it quoted an
unidentified pilot as saying.
	   Nice regularly requests planes to make a circular final approach
using a navigation system that can be inaccurate by hundreds of
feet (meters), the Sunday Times said. Hong Kong is potentially
dangerous because of the proximity of the runway and parallel
taxiway, which can be hazardous in crosswinds.
	   ``I am disappointed that we are on the list,'' Nice Airport's
director Danial Galibert told the newspaper. ``The approach is more
complicated than it used to be and the pilots hated it at first,
but we have tried to get their support. We only use a visual
approach in good conditions.''
	   A British Airways spokesman said the airline was satisfied with
safety standards at the airports it uses, including San Francisco
and Hong Kong.
	   The meeting agreed to blacklist Amsterdam's Schipol Airport
after a report claimed safety standards were being compromised
because of noise restrictions, the Sunday Times said. Pilots say
they are being forced to land in strong crosswinds because noise
restrictions prohibit the use of safer alternatives.
	   Airspace listed as potentially dangerous includes thousands of
square miles (kilometers) in Africa, China and South America _ and
the North Sea, because of the vast amount of civil and military
traffic working for the oil industry below 10,000 feet (3,000
meters).

Ukrainian authorities release plane with radioactive cargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian customs officials have released a
Kazak plane carrying more than 40 tons of metal drums emitting
radioactivity, a customs official said Sunday.
	   The containers were filled with radioactive waste apparently
intended for burial, said Pavel Busyhin, duty customs officer in
the western Ukrainian town of Rivne.
	   An inspection of the plane found all papers to be in ``proper
order,'' he told the Interfax news agency.
	   The Kazakstani Il-76 was detained when it made a refueling stop
in Rivne Saturday. It had been en route to Russia from Germany.
	   The report did not clarify the radioactive waste's origin.

Pakistan seeks Saudi help on nuclear crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif asked Sunday for Saudi Arabia's help in fighting sanctions
imposed after its nuclear tests last month, a diplomat said.
	   Sharif asked Crown Prince Abdullah to use Saudi influence with
the United States to end the sanctions, the diplomat said on
condition of anonymity. He did not elaborate.
	   Sharif arrived in Saudi Arabia on Sunday on the second stop of
his Gulf tour to discuss the consequences of the Indian and
Pakistani nuclear tests and to secure credit to maintain oil
imports.
	   Sharif arrived in the Red Sea port city of Jidda from the United
Arab Emirates. Sharif is expected to meet King Fahd later Sunday.
	   He is accompanied by Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan and
Petroleum Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
	   Led by the United States, several countries imposed economic
sanctions against Pakistan and India in a bid to block foreign
investment and loans to punish it for the nuclear crisis.
	   Fears of a nuclear arms race in the region began after India
tested five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13. Pakistan replied with
six nuclear tests, despite warnings from the U.N. Security Council,
the United States and other nations.
	   Sharif will leave Monday for Kuwait.

Moya leads in men's final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Carlos Moya took the lead over Alex Corretja Sunday
in the men's final of the French Open, winning the first set, 6-3.
	   Moya had a relatively easy time breaking Corretja in the first
game, and again in the seventh.
	   The windy conditions eliminated chances for the long rallies for
which the Spaniards are known. Misplays on serves and volleys
caused both men trouble.
	   Whoever wins, Spaniards will have swept both singles events at
the French Open.
	   Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the women's title Saturday, beating
Monica Seles.
	   Spanish men have won the French Open five times previously, but
have only taken three other Grand Slam titles.
	   Moya already has a major clay court title this year, at Monte
Carlo. Corretja lost to Moya there and in the final of another top
clay court tournament in Hamburg.
	   Moya, seeded 12th, is 28-12 this year. Corretja, seeded 14th,
took a 27-8 record into the final.

Kuwait alarmed at alleged Iraqi remarks about border demarcation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait said Sunday it was ``worried and dismayed''
about reported Iraqi remarks that a post-Gulf War demarcation of
the border between the two countries had no legal standing.
	   Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid also criticized
the remarks, which apparently were made by Iraq's vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, in the Moroccan capital of Rabat.
	   A Kuwait Cabinet statement said Ramadan's statement is ``a
serious threat that uncovers the real aggressive Iraqi intentions
towards Kuwait,'' which Iraq invaded in 1990.
	   The statement also called on the world community to take
``serious and practical steps in order to guarantee'' that the
borders were respected.
	   Ramadan was reported to have told a group of Arab journalists
last week that a U.N. resolution ``that demarcated the border
between Iraq and Kuwait does not have any legal value.'' He said
the United Nations has no mandate to fix borders of its member
states.
	   The remarks were published Thursday by Abu Dhabi's Al-Ittihad
newspaper.
	   Ramadan's office did not immediately confirm if he had made
those comments.
	   Iraqi troops occupied Kuwait for seven months before a U.S.-led
coalition fought the Gulf War to evict them in February 1991.
	   Baghdad, however, formally recognized Kuwait as a sovereign
state only in November 1994. It also recognized the border between
the two countries as demarcated by a U.N. commission after the war.
	   Kuwait has now launched a diplomatic campaign to protect its
rights, the official Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   Following Kuwait's plea to the Arab League to condemn the
``irresponsible'' remarks, Secretary General Abdel-Meguid said on
Sunday that all Arab countries should refrain from ``issues which
can negatively affect Arab relations and slow down
confidence-building between the brothers.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines announced Sunday
it was firing all striking pilots who had defied a return to work
order, plunging the financially-troubled airline into one of its
most serious labor crises.
	   The action came after pilots continued a strike and staged a
protest march Sunday, defying airline threats of dismissal unless
they return to work by noon.
	   ``Some pilots were able to beat the deadline but those who
remained defiant were, in accordance with law and jurisprudence,
declared as having lost their jobs with the airline,'' PAL said in
a statement.
	   An airline official said ``virtually all of the airlines'
pilots'' were terminated and they have started processing
applications for new pilots.
	   The strike began Friday, forcing cancellations of more than 50
international and domestic flights and leaving hundreds of
passengers stranded.
	   Calling the strike illegal, the airline fired 29 officers of the
620-strong Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines Saturday
and warned remaining members would also be dismissed if they didn't
return to work by noon Sunday. The 620 striking pilots represent
the airlines' total pilot force.
	   Instead of returning to work, the pilots marched around a PAL
compound in metropolitan Manila's suburban Paranaque city,
brandishing placards that read ``Give labor its due'' and ``All is
not well in PAL.''
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of firing pilots
who have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours,
regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots in danger of
forced retirement, Umali said.
	   PAL called the strike illegal because the Department of Labor
has assumed jurisdiction over the dispute and has barred both sides
from committing any hostile actions.
	   Labor officials called both sides to a meeting Sunday afternoon
but failed to end the dispute.
	   The airline said the strike was embarrassing the country, citing
pilots, who abandoned a PAL plane in Bangkok at the start of the
strike.
	   ``This clearly demonstrates the pilots' total lack of
sensitivity,'' said PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia.
	   PAL scheduled five international and 14 domestic flights on
Sunday, using management pilots.
	   An airline spokesman said management pilots are qualified to fly
the company's planes, noting that they are senior pilots who train
other pilots.
	   Over the past four years, the airline has incurred annual losses
ranging from 451.4 million pesos (dlrs 11.3 million) to 2.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 62.5 million), in part because of large debts, an aging
fleet and Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL says it faces an ``uncertain future,'' and announced plans
earlier this year to cut expenses by as much as 40 percent, slash
flights, and sharply reduce its work force. The airline hasn't
disclosed an estimate for its manpower reduction, but employees
fear it could be as much as 30 percent.
	   PAL is controlled by Chinese Filipino tycoon Lucio Tan. It had
been completely owned by the Philippine government from 1941 until
it was partly sold in 1992.

	   ROME (AP) _ A small blaze broke out in an office of the Chamber
of Deputies building Sunday but was quickly extinguished, officials
said.
	   A short-circuit involving an air-conditioner caused the fire,
which was fed by papers in the small room on the fifth floor
according to Danilo Bellini supervisor of the fire department's
operations room.
	   The fire caused much smoke, but no injuries or evacuations were
reported, he said. The room was heavily damaged, firefighters said.
	   A guard on hourly patrol smelled something burning and saw
smoke, and sounded the alarm, they said.
	   The Montecitorio Palace, designed in 1650 by Gianlorenzo
Bernini, has been the seat of the chamber since 1871. The chamber
is the lower house of Parliament, which includes the Senate.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) - Soldiers exchanged gunfire early Sunday
in the capital of Guinea Bissau, in West Africa, killing up to 10
people, news reports said.
	   Shooting started at 0530 GMT at the military headquarters in
Bissau and lasted for more than three hours, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   The ten people killed were soldiers, the agency reported.
	   Lusa said the clash may have been triggered by changes in the
military hierarchy last Friday.
	   Guinea's Defense Minister Samba Lamine Mane said in a statement
that troops loyal to the government had brought the situation under
control, Lusa said.
	   An official announcement in Bissau urged people to stay off the
streets.
	   The Portuguese ambassador to Bissau, Francisco Henriques da
Silva, speaking on Lisbon radio TSF, said that calm had returned to
the capital by mid-morning.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony with a population of
nearly a million people, borders Senegal and Guinea-Conakry.

Pope deplores violence in Kosovo, Africa

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday called on the
world to act against violence and repression in Kosovo, the ethnic
Albanian province of Yugoslavia.
	   He also said he was worried by the growing conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea in Africa.
	   ``Let God spare the dear peoples of Africa, already so troubled,
from further suffering,'' he said after his regular Sunday blessing
in St. Peter's Square.
	   ``Not far from us, in Kosovo, violent options, repression and
the flight of peoples must not leave the international community
inert,'' he said. The violence ``recalls the tragic recent history
of the Balkans.''
	   John Paul called on the parties to take up the road to dialogue,
``longer but more effective for all.''
	   Serb forces have stepped up their campaign to crush Albanian
separatists fighting heavy-handed rule by Serb authorities in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of the
population of 2.2 million.
	   He also said he hoped that a U.N. conference on fighting drugs
opening Monday would give a ``new and concrete impulse'' toward
cooperation on the issue.
	   Drug trafficking, production and use ``constitute a market of
death, which corrodes and weakens the human being,'' he said.
	   In the morning, the pope embarked on one of his regular parish
visits, this time visiting St. Nicholas of Bari in Ostia, a seaside
community a half-hour outside the city.
	   He went by helicopter because of the distance. He usually
travels to the parishes by car.
	   The visit combined touching and humorous moments. When
9-year-old Giorgio Galante broke down in tears during his welcoming
speech, he was brought up to the pontiff, who embraced and kissed
the boy to comfort him.
	   ``Giorgio Galante spoke with tears, and with these tears he said
more than with beautiful words,'' the pope told a group of
children. ``I will remember this visit as one where a boy welcomed
me with tears, because he was so moved.''
	   Later, a girl scout called John Paul a ``young pope who loves
young people.'' The pontiff, who turned 78 on May 18, responded
with a smile: ``The only thing I can do is pretend to still be
young.''

Kuwait alarmed at alleged Iraqi remarks about border demarcation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait said Sunday it was ``worried and dismayed''
about reported Iraqi remarks that a post-Gulf War demarcation of
the border between the two countries had no legal standing.
	   Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid also criticized
the remarks, which apparently were made by Iraq's vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, in the Moroccan capital of Rabat.
	   A Kuwait Cabinet statement said Ramadan's statement was ``a
serious threat that uncovers the real aggressive Iraqi intentions
towards Kuwait,'' which Iraq invaded in 1990.
	   The statement also called on the world community to take
``serious and practical steps in order to guarantee'' that the
borders are respected.
	   Ramadan reportedly told a group of Arab journalists last week
that a U.N. resolution ``that demarcated the border between Iraq
and Kuwait does not have any legal value.'' He said the United
Nations has no mandate to fix borders of its member states.
	   The remarks were published Thursday by Abu Dhabi's Al-Ittihad
newspaper.
	   Ramadan's office did not immediately confirm the comments.
	   Iraqi troops occupied Kuwait for seven months before a U.S.-led
coalition fought the Gulf War to evict them in February 1991.
	   Baghdad, however, formally recognized Kuwait as a sovereign
state only in November 1994. It also recognized the border between
the two countries as demarcated by a U.N. commission after the war.

 &UR; Agony for Toyota as Porsche triumphs again at Le Mans
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE MANS, France (AP) - Porsche won its third successive Le Mans
24 hour race in dramatic fashion Sunday, when the leading Toyota GT
One withdrew with gearbox problems less than 90 minutes before the
end of the contest.
	   The Porsche GT1 driven by Alan McNish of Britain and France's
Laurent Aiello and Stephane Ortelli won the 66th Le Mans race,
having covered the 13.6-kilometer (8.456-mile) circuit 351 times.
	   It covered 4,783 kilometers (2,972 miles), less than the 4,909
kilometers (3,050 miles) recorded by last year's winner, the TWR
Porsche driven by Michele Alboreto.
	   McNish's team posted an average speed of 199.324 kph (124.577
mph).
	   ``We were pushing our car to the limit and hoped that the Toyota
would make a mistake,'' McNish said. ``We needed to see if they
could take the pressure. They couldn't.''
	   Another Porsche GT1, driven by Germany's Jorg Muller and Uwe
Alzen and Bob Wolleck of France, was second with 350 laps.
	   ``It is the 50th anniversay of Porsche so it is fitting that it
leaves the race with first and second place,'' McNish said.
	   In third place was the Nissan R390 driven by Japan's Kazuyoshi
Hoshino, Aguri Suzuki and Masahiko Kageyama, with 347 laps.
	   But 90 minutes before the checkered flag was raised, the final
outcome was looking very different.
	   Toyota mechanics - who had begun to sense the manufacturer's
first ever Le Mans win - were in tears as their Toyota GT1 limped
into the pits when 44 seconds ahead.
	   The car, being driven by lead driver Thierry Boutsen, officially
withdrew just 70 minutes from the end, with transmission failure.
	   ``Thierry deserved to win after driving so well overnight,''
said Toyota teammate Martin Brundle. ``The whole team has worked so
hard and we are all terribly disappointed to lose the race this
way. It's awful to go out so close to the end.''
	   Only one Japanese manufacturer, Mazda in 1991, has ever won the
Le Mans race.
	   Meanwhile Porsche, the most successful Le Mans mark ever,
demonstrated its renowned reliability to win its 16th contest.
	   The company, which won seven straight Le Mans races in the
1980s, has won the last three contests here.
	   After Mercedes and BMW each lost both of their cars early in the
race Saturday afternoon, the stage soon became set for a scrap
between Toyota, Porsche and Nissan.
	   Boutsen was leading for more than four hours on Saturday, but it
was Porsche that dominated at the halfway stage, when its two cars
were three laps ahead of the field.
	   An early leader, the Toyota was only fifth at the halfway point,
but clawed its way back to the head of the field Sunday morning
after Porsche suffered problems at daybreak.
	   Porsche chiefs could only look on as driver error and mechanical
failure left both its cars in the pits for more than half an hour
at 6 a.m.
	   First, the car driven by Muller, Alzen and Wolleck, while in
second place, was in the pits for 31 minutes.
	   The car needed new brakes and a change in undercarriage after
Muller skidded out of control in rain.
	   Within minutes the leading car, the Porsche driven by McNish,
Aiello and Ortelli, was also in trouble.
	   With McNish behind the wheel, the car had a water leak and was
in the pits for 35 minutes.
	   Toyota took advantage, only to fall close to the finish.
	   The fastest lap of the race, 3:41.809, was recorded Saturday
afternoon by Brundle in another Toyota GT1.
	   Brundle's car fell out of the race after 14 hours with engine
failure.
	   The Mercedes of German Bernd Schneider, which was fastest in
practice, fell out of the race with motor failure after just 90
minutes.
	   The best placed prototype was the Ferrari 333 driven by Wayne
Taylor, Eric van de Poele and Fermin Velez, which came eighth.
	   The best performance by a GT2 was the Chrysler Viper GTS-R
driven by 11th placed Justin Bell, David Donohue and Luca Drudi,
who completed 317 laps.

Medical students in Dar es Salaam suspended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The government has suspended
every medical student at a Tanzanian university for ``security
reasons,'' state radio reported Sunday.
	   Radio Tanzania quoted Vice Chancellor Mathew Luhanga as saying
the 445 medical students at Muhimbili University College of Health
Sciences were sent home because of the ``prevailing situation at
the college.''
	   On Thursday, riot police dispersed the undergraduate students
after they stormed a conference hall where Health Minister Aaron
Chiduo was meeting university officials, the broadcast said.
	   The students boycotted classes Thursday and Friday to protest
the upgrading of the college, formerly a constituent of the
University of Dar es Salaam, to a university. The students said
they were not consulted.
	   The government also suspended indefinitely the publication of
three privately-owned Swahili language newspapers for publishing
pornographic cartoons, the broadcast said.
	   It said the cartoons were harmful to the country's culture and
the editors had refused to comply with state requests to tone them
down.
	   Tanzanian law permits the government to suspend publications if
they are seen to deviate from their declared editorial policies.

Local elections in Italy choose 73 mayoralties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: results expected Monday morning, time uncertain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ While national politicians maneuver to resuscitate
lifeless reform efforts, Italian voters on Sunday worried about
more direct concerns: whom to put in city hall.
	   The center-right opposition and governing center-left alliance
of former communists and Christian Democrats went head-to-head in
most of the 73 mayoralties up for grabs in run-off local elections.
	   Candidates in the first round on May 24 who captured more than
50 percent of the vote were declared winners.
	   At stake Sunday were provincial presidencies in Treviso in the
north and Caltanissetta and Siracusa in Sicily and mayoralties in
16 provincial seats up and down Italy, including Asti, Cuneo, Como,
Verona, Parma, Piacenza, Lucca, L'Aquila, Frosinone, Isernia,
Matera, Oristano, Enna, Siracusa, Trapani and Ragusa.
	   Results were not expected until sometime Monday morning. Some
3.5 million Italians were eligible to vote. The opposition, led by
media magnate and former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, came out best
in the first round.
	   On Wednesday, Parliament is expected to reconvene to ponder the
fate of constitutional reforms designed to stabilize a political
system than since World War II has produced 55 governments.
	   Party bickering last week prompted most leaders to declare the
18-month reform effort dead. But Massimo D'Alema, leader of the
dominant Democratic Left party and chairman of the reform
committee, has been seeking to revive the effort by sounding out
other party leaders over the weekend, newspapers reported.

India mulls opening insurance sector
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A regulatory body to be set up later
this year will determine how much foreign interest will be allowed
when India's potentially lucrative insurance market is opened to
private companies, the finance minister was quoted as saying
Sunday.
	   Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha proposed the opening of the
state-controlled industry to homegrown private competition in the
annual budget presented last week. Home TV quoted him as saying
Sunday that he would soon introduce legislation to set up an
Insurance Regulatory Authority.
	   Foreign companies are already linking with Indian firms in
anticipation, but it will be up to the regulatory authority to
determine how welcome they will be.
	   Sinha's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has pledged to
protect Indian industry, particularly in the areas of consumer
goods and services. But the finance minister said he had not ruled
out the possibility of foreigners working with Indians to sell
insurance.
	   ``The government is under great pressure, there are many
inhibiting factors, but I believe it is sincere in its promise and
the sector will be opened up'' to private firms in which foreigners
have an interest, said M.J. Augustine, whose Indian firm Dabur
Finance has linked with the U.S. company Liberty International.

World Cup: Three Flos could play in opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ At 1.93 meters (6-foot-4), Tore Andre
Flo and brother Jostein are among the tallest players in the World
Cup.
	   Their cousin, Havard Flo, is 1.85 meters (6-foot-1).
	   ``The whole family is tall, and we call Havard the midget,''
said Tore Andre Flo, who nicely fits his description as Norway's
biggest offensive weapon.
	   Aerial attacks are a Norwegian speciality. That's why the three
Flos could very well fit into coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen's game
plan for Norway's Group A opener against Morocco in Montpellier on
Wednesday.
	   Several brothers have played together in the World Cup. The most
famous pair is Bobby and Jack Charlton, who helped win the World
Cup for England in 1966.
	   But three relatives on the same national team is rare.
	   Olsen still has two more days to think about his starting
liuneup, but he has indicated that he needs strength in the air.
	   ``Morocco has two or there good players in the air, but that's
it,'' Olsen said.
	   On average, one goal is score for every 50 corner kicks in the
World Cup, and Norway hopes to improve that figure.
	   ``I hope it will be easier to score (after a corner) against
Morocco than during our own practice sessions,'' Olsen said.
	   The Flos, who are staying in the same apartment in Norway's team
headquarters at Saint-Andre-des-Eaux west of Nantes, played
together on the same team, Sogndal in Norway, for one-and-a-half
seasons five years ago.
	   ``It would be a dream for us to play again together, but you
have to ask the boss (Olsen) about that,'' said Tore Andre Flo.
	   Tore Andre now plays with Chelsea in England. Havard's club is
Werder Bremen in Germany. Jostein, one of Olsen's favorite players
in the 1994 Cup when Norway was eliminated after the first round,
has returned to Norway and Stromgodset after a stint with Sheffield
United in England.
	   Tore Andre won the European Cup Winners' Cup with Chelsea last
month in Stockholm, Sweden, although Gianfranco Zola scored the
winning goal just 18 seconds after he substituted for the tall
Norwegian against VfB Stuttgart.
	   ``It was absolutely the finest moment in my career,'' Tore Andre
said. ``Only a quarterfinal berth or a medal in the World Cup could
top that. Norway has never reached the quarters'' in two previous
World Cup appearances.
	   Tore Andre Flo has been compared with Kennet Andersson, who was
one of the leading goalscorers in the 1994 finals when Norway's
neighbour Sweden won the bronze medal.
	   ``Tore Andre could be like Kennet four years ago. He can decide
games,'' said Norway's goalkeeper Frode Grodaas.
	   After scoring two goals a year ago in a 4-2 victory against
Ronaldo's Brazil in Oslo, Tore Andre was dubbed ``Flonaldo''. But
the Norwegians' lone man up front _ Olsen is expected to use a
4-5-1 system _ knows the first-round match against the world
champions June 23 will be different.
	   ``Of course we want to beat them again, but we also know it's
very difficult,'' Tore Andre said. ``Brazil is one of the best
teams in the world, maybe the best.
	   ``So maybe our most important matches are against Morocco and
Scotland. I hope that we'll be in a position that we don't need to
beat Brazil. Then I think it will be easier for us. I don't want to
be in that situation that we have to beat Brazil because that's not
easy.''
	   Tore Andre Flo, who clinched Norway's World Cup berth with a
goal in Azerbaijan, believes his side has some advantages compared
with Brazil.
	   ``I think we're physically stronger and maybe we can fight
better,'' he said. ``Brazil is better technically with the ball. We
can't compare with that.''

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Hundreds of angry passengers on Sunday
accused the captain of a Ukrainian cruise ship of cutting their
trip short and forcibly taking them back to Ukraine.
	   The passengers, mainly Russians and Ukrainians, threw messages
in plastic bottles begging for help from their consulates to
journalists who approached the ship in small boats.
	   Consular officials from Ukraine, Russia and Azerbaijan visited
the ship and called on passengers to maintain order, Russian
Interfax news agency quoted Olexander Mishchenko, Ukraine's Consul
General in Istanbul, as saying.
	   After restocking food supplies, the ship left Istanbul for
Odessa, Ukraine, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   The passengers sent distress signals to a Turkish coast guard
boat on Saturday as the ship passed through the Dardanelles, a
strait that passes from the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea.
	   The captain of the Taras Shevchenko refused Turkish calls to
stop, saying everything was calm on board, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   ``These people have stolen our money. We want our money back,''
shouted several passengers as they held huge banners reading
``S.O.S. Help''
	   ``We were supposed to go to 12 ports and we did not,'' Vladimir
Kryzhanovskiy said aboard the ship while it was moored in the
international waters off Istanbul.
	   Another Russian, news agency, ITAR-Tass said on Sunday that the
problem surfaced because the tour company which organized the
cruise failed to transfer the money to the shipping company in
time.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria's Communications Authority and the
Swedish telecommunications giant LM Ericsson AB have signed a dlrs
118 million contract to build a new telephone network, Syrian
newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The government daily Tishrin said the network will initially add
one million new telephone lines as a first stage followed by
another 650,000 lines. The deal was signed Saturday.
	   Ericsson is a world leader in the telecommunications field with

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 120 Egyptian companies will hold a
week-long trade fair in Baghdad beginning June 16 in a bid to
increase the volume of Egyptian exports to Iraq, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported Sunday.
	   It said goods on show will include household utensils,
electronic and electrical appliances as well as medical and food
stuffs.
	   A five-member Egyptian delegation is currently in Iraq to
prepare for the show, the agency said.
	   U.N. figures show that Egypt has exported dlrs 170 million worth
of goods to Iraq since the start of the U.N. oil-for-food deal
program.
	   Egypt plans to boost its share of Iraqi imports under the
current phase of the six-month deal under which Iraq's import bill
is expected to be in the range of dlrs 3.1 billion instead of dlrs
1.3 billion so far.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The volume of Kuwait's foreign trade last year
fell by 5.5 percent from the previous year, reaching 6.78 billion
dinars (dlrs 22.15 billion), Alrs (dlrs 13.98 billion), down 8.3
percent from 1996.
	   Cars accounted for 9.8 percent of last year's imports, followed
by heavy machinery, spare parts and gold, the newspaper reported.
Other than crude, Kuwait's main exports are petrochemical products.
	   Last year, 13.8 percent of Kuwait's imports came from Japan, and
13.6 came from the United States, according to the statistics.

Pilots' group names 150 airports with safety problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in graf 5 that Kabul is in Afghanistan; ADDS in graf
9 that Hong Kong has good safety record &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ International airline pilots have listed 150
airports with major safety problems and singled out 15 _ including
San Francisco, Nice and Hong Kong, _ which they believe are
``critically deficient,'' the Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper said it had been leaked a copy of a report
compiled at a meeting of the International Federation of Air Line
Pilots' Associations, or Ifalpa, in Montreal, Canada in April.
	   ``If airports and airspaces are listed, it means they have
serious deficiencies, not that they are unsafe,'' the Sunday Times
quoted Ifalpa executive directorCathy Bill as saying.
	   ``There are potential dangers, but there are potential dangers
when you get in any plane.''
	   Other airports in the critically deficient category were:
Wellington in New Zealand; Oslo's Fornebu Airport; Suva in Fiji;
Buenos Aires in Argentina; Leticia, Rio Negro and San Andres in
Colombia; Maiquetia in Venezuela; Nauru, one of the Solomon
Islands; Lagos and Port Harcourt in Nigeria and Kabul in
Afghanistan.
	   The Sunday Times said air crews have complained about landing at
airports in popular tourist destinations, such as Greece, ``to find
inadequate runway lighting and no air-traffic controllers on the
ground.''
	   At Argentina's Mendoza Airport, it said, a pilot reported a
horse on the runway. Another aborted a take-off from Buenos Aires
after seeing children playing in his path.
	   At San Francisco, the Sunday Times said, planes land in pairs on
parallel runways with pilots often relying largely on visual
contact. ``It's been know for pilots to start aiming at the wrong
runway and drift across in front of the other plane,'' it quoted an
unidentified pilot as saying.
	   Nice regularly requests planes to make a circular final approach
using a navigation system that can be inaccurate by hundreds of
feet (meters), the Sunday Times said. Although it has had few
serious accidents, Hong Kong is potentially dangerous because of
the proximity of the runway and parallel taxiway, which can be
hazardous in crosswinds.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dampening hopes for movement in the stalled
Mideast peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday said no accord was imminent on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   ``I don't work according to a stopwatch,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after meeting with his Cabinet.
	   The prime minister told his Cabinet that ``it is not possible to
say we are on the verge of an agreement,'' said a statement issued
after the meeting.
	   Later, Netanyahu told reporters: ``We're working toward reaching
an agreement. We're not there yet.''
	   In recent days, speculation had grown that Israel was very close
to a decision on an American initiative _ already accepted by the
Palestinians _ that would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under
full or partial Palestinian control and restrict Jewish settlement
expansion.
	   Under the American plan, as reported last week by Israeli media,
Israel would carry out a second redeployment in three stages over
12 weeks. The Palestinians currently have full control over 3
percent of the West Bank and partial control over another 24
percent.
	   However, Netanyahu said there was no agreement on either a
second or third troop redeployment. The cabinet statement said that
Israel and the Palestinians still did not agree on reciprocal steps
the Palestinians would take in exchange for the Israeli pullbacks.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom told Israel radio that
U.S.-Israeli discussions were focusing on a third redeployment, and
that the government has a parliamentary majority to approve a
second redeployment as long as the Palestinians fulfill their
obligations.
	   Israeli media reports said American envoy Dennis Ross had asked
the Palestinians to accept some changes in the original U.S.
proposal _ which has been widely reported but never formally
unveiled _ and that Palestinians were rejecting American calls for
a small third redeployment of 2 percent.
	   Palestinian officials reiterated Sunday that they would not
agree to changes in the American initiative now.
	   ``It's not up to (Netanyahu) to redesign the peace process in
his own image,'' said senior Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan
Ashrawi. ``We are not willing to renegotiate the American
proposal.''
	   The American plan reportedly calls for an Israeli promise not to
expand Jewish settlements in a significant way, and to allow
sections of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction to be annulled by vote of the 18-member PLO Executive
Committee rather than the much larger Palestine National Council,
as originally demanded by Israel.
	   But Netanyahu and a Cabinet statement, though, indicated the
charter change was still a sticking point.
	   In Jerusalem's Old City, activists from the Ateret Cohanim
settler group fenced off areas and prepared to go ahead with
excavation work in the city's Muslim quarter, captured from Jordan
in 1967 Mideast war and where the group hopes to establish a Jewish
settlement.
	   Right-wing lawmakers have threatened to bring down Netanyahu's
government if he goes ahead with the pullbacks, and Jewish settler
leaders have stepped up a public campaign against troop
withdrawals.
	   In a sign of bitter right-wing opposition to any pullback,
posters were plastered on walls in downtown Jerusalem overnight,
depicting Netanyahu wearing a keffiyeh _ an Arab headdress _ and
emblazoned with the word ``Liar.'' Similar posters with slain
leader Yitzhak Rabin appeared in Jerusalem months before he was
gunned down by a right-wing extremist for making peace deals with
the Palestinians.

Moya leads in men's final by two sets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Carlos Moya took the first two sets of the French
Open final Sunday over Alex Corretja, 6-3, 7-5.
	   Corretja took an early lead in the second set, when he broke
Moya to go ahead 2-1. But Moya evened it in the next game. Corretja
held off two set points at 4-5, then evened the set at 5-5.
	   But two games later, Corretja got into trouble again on his
serve at 5-6. This time, he couldn't hold off Moya, and dropped
behind two sets.
	   In the first set, Moya had a relatively easy time breaking
Corretja in the first game, and again in the seventh.
	   The windy conditions _ with gusts of up to 50 kph (31 mph) _ cut
short the long rallies for which the Spaniards are known. Misplays
on serves and volleys caused both men trouble.
	   Whoever wins, Spaniards will have swept both singles events at
the French Open.
	   Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the women's title Saturday, beating
Monica Seles.
	   Spanish men have won the French Open five times previously, but
have only taken three other Grand Slam titles.
	   Moya already has a major clay court title this year, at Monte
Carlo. Corretja lost to Moya there and in the final of another top
clay court tournament in Hamburg.
	   Moya, seeded 12th, is 28-12 this year. Corretja, seeded 14th,
took a 27-8 record into the final.

Lisbon hotel workers target Sheraton in latest strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Staff at the five-star Lisbon Sheraton
hotel began a two-day strike Sunday, the latest action in the
capital's hotel workers' campaign for bonuses during the world's
fair.
	   Strikes were also planned at the Lisbon Ritz and the city's four
Tivoli hotels on June 18, the Federation of Hotel Workers' Unions
said. The Tivoli chain was also targeted for action last month.
	   Federation spokesman Rodolfo Caseiro said about 95 percent of
Sheraton workers stayed away from work, seriously affecting the
hotel's services.
	   Lisbon hotels have jacked up prices by as much as 35 percent to
cash in on the increased demand during the Expo 98 world's fair in
the Portuguese capital, according to the Association of Portuguese
Hotels.
	   Some 8.3 million visitors, almost half of them foreign, are
expected at Expo 98. The fair opened May 22 and will close Sept.
30.
	   Manuel Botelho, secretary-general of the hotel association, said
workers had been awarded a 3 percent pay hike at the start of the
year.
	   Caseiro said workers were being asked to make sacrifices to cope
with the extra work and ``wanted something in return.''
	   ``Salaries are low, the hotels are full, prices and profits are
up,'' Caseiro said.

Yeltsin, Kohl to meet for broad-ranging talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ In his first trip abroad since Russia's
financial crisis, Russian President Boris Yeltsin arrives Monday to
discuss political, financial, trade and social issues with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   A German government official said Russia's relations with
neighboring Ukraine, the European Union and the NATO military
alliance also would be on the agenda.
	   Yeltsin and his top officials insist their country has rebounded
from last month's collapse in Russian markets, and that they don't
need handouts. However, they have stressed that foreign credit
remains crucial for Russia.
	   Still, investors have said they believe a bailout package may be
unveiled Tuesday, when deputy finance ministers from Germany and
the other Group of Eight economic powers meet in Paris.
	   The German officials said Germany was prepared to plead Russia's
case with the International Monetary Fund, but that there would be
no direct German aid.
	   Yeltsin also is to have breakfast Tuesday morning with
opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder. He returns to
Moscow on Tuesday.

India reiterates no outside mediation in Kashmir dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 6-8 with background on resolution, India's
accusation it violates international law, background on India's
testing moritorium &QL; 
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will not accept outside mediation
to settle its Kashmir dispute with neighboring Pakistan, despite
concern voiced over the volatile issue by the U.N. Security
Council, a foreign ministry official said Sunday.
	   A Security Council resolution, accepted unanimously Saturday by
the 15-member council, called on India and Pakistan to resume
dialogue and find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root
causes of those tensions, including Kashmir,'' the disputed
Himalayan territory.
	   That marked the first time in 30 years that the Security Council
officially mentioned Kashmir in a resolution, the foreign ministry
spokesman said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they gained
independence from Britain in 1947 _ two of them over Kashmir, which
is divided between the two countries.
	   Recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan stalled talks and
raised concern about nuclear proliferation.
	   Saturday's resolution also called on India and Pakistan to
refrain from further nuclear tests, halt weapons programs and sign
nuclear control agreements unconditionally. But India reacted
strongly saying the resolution was against the spirit of the U.N.
charter and international law.
	   ``Attempts to coerce members to accede to international treaties
is contrary to the norms of international law,'' a statement by the
Foreign Ministry said. ``The council's authority to decide on
disarmament matters is questionable and not in conformity with the
U.N. charter.''
	   India has already declared a moratorium on further testing and
has offered talks on no first use of nuclear weapons with Pakistan.
But India is unwilling to sign nuclear arms control treaties saying
they are weighed in favor of existing nuclear powers.

Sectarian balance hangs on Beirut vote

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's first municipal elections in 35
years became a referendum Sunday on Christian-Muslim coexistence in
Beirut and a fight for the leadership of Shiite Muslims in southern
Lebanon.
	   To ensure safe balloting, thousands of troops manned road
intersections and guarded polling stations across the capital and
in the south. No violence was reported, and results, to be
tabulated manually, were not expected until Tuesday.
	   Beirut residents and southerners cast their ballots in 10 hours
of voting, during the third phase of a staggered poll being
conducted over four subsequent Sundays. The first province to vote
was Mount Lebanon on May 24 and the last is the eastern Bekaa
Valley on June 14.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were eligible to vote in Beirut, where
more than 200 candidates contested 24 city council seats whose
sectarian balance became the main campaign issue.
	   In the predominantly Shiite south, 380,000 people were eligible
to vote to fill 1,589 municipal posts. However, the vote there is
being seen as a verdict on who shall lead the 1.2 million Shiites
in a nation of 3.2 million. The militant Iranian-backed Hezbollah
or the pro-Syrian mainstream Amal.
	   Hezbollah on Sunday rotated guerrillas out of front line
positions so they could vote. Elsewhere, wealthy candidates
reportedly flew in some 3,000 Shiites emigrants from Africa to
vote.
	   There was no balloting in the southernmost Israeli-occupied
border zone, home to 200,000 people.
	   In Beirut, whose demography has changed in favor of Muslims
since the last election in 1963, the vote Sunday turned into a test
of the groups' willingness to live together after the devastating
1975-90 civil war.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Sunni Muslim leaders sought to
allay Christian fears of being smothered by the city's Sunni Muslim
majority.
	   The prime minister, a Sunni moderate, is supporting a
half-Christian, half-Muslim ticket that includes some of his
Christian opponents.
	   Opponents accused the Hariri camp of playing on sectarian fears
to drown out the economic and social issues in Beirut, whose
war-wrecked downtown is undergoing major reconstruction by Hariri,
a billionaire businessman.
	   ``Beirut is for all the Beirutis,'' said Widad Zeino, a Muslim
woman who chose the Hariri-backed ticket, but admitted she knew
none of the candidates she voted for.

Cameroon team arrives for World Cup without proper papers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ The Cameroon team arrived for the
World Cup without proper entry papers and without its soccer
federation president, who was held back in the capital Yaounde for
interrogation, a police official said Sunday.
	   The Indomitable Lions landed on a chartered plane in this
southern French city Friday night only to be stopped by airport
police, said a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The official said the players could only present copies of their
entry papers, and not the originals.
	   The squad was held up for a few hours before heading to their
luxurious hotel near Beziers, close to the Mediterranean Sea.
	   The 35-member delegation also arrived without its federation
president, Vincent Onana, who is involved in a judicial case
regarding the sale of 3,000 World Cup tickets.
	   The official notice from World Cup organizers marking Cameroon's
arrival made only a vague mention of the incident, referring simply
to ``administrative formalities'' which delayed the team's journey,
without giving any specifics.
	   The notice, however, did point out that Cameroon is the only
foreign team staying in an accommodation that received ``just one
star from the Michelin guide.'' Still, the team's
castle-turned-hotel includes a recreation room, gym, Jacuzzi and a
sauna.
	   Cameroon plays its first Group B game on Thursday against
Austria. Chile and Italy complete the group.

PREVIEWING THE WORLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; As business embraces soccer, World Cup rivalry transcends
scoreline &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ You've paid a fortune to advertise your company at
the World Cup. Suddenly a player scores, and, in the frenzied
celebration, accidentally kicks your precious sign board in front
of a huge global audience.
	   Bad return on your investment? Not unless the shoe he kicked it
with is sponsored by your main rival.
	   Each World Cup has moments immortalized through video, film and
photographs: Diego Maradona's ``Hand of God'' goal in 1986; Paul
Gascoigne's 1990 tears; or Bebeto and teammates celebrating his
goal in 1994 by pretending to cradle his newborn baby.
	   What price would sponsors have paid to put their logos or names
in the image of those moments?
	   Sponsors are pouring up to dlrs 20 million each for a slice of
the action during this World Cup. And you won't hear them
complaining. The tournament will be the largest ever, with 32
competing nations, and a combined television audience over the
33-day period of around 37 billion.
	   ``By our most conservative estimates, we are guaranteed 7-to-7
1-2 minutes television exposure per match through our boards,''
says Nava Heffler, spokeswoman for MasterCard, one of the World
Cup's official sponsors. ``Imagine how much that would cost under
different circumstances.''
	   According to Eric Kraus, director of communications for
Gillette, another World Cup sponsor: ``If you want to be a global
player, you just have to be part of soccer and the World Cup.''
	   It's a far cry from soccer's lowest point in the 1980s when
hooliganism had governments clamping down on the sport across
Europe.
	   Through clever marketing, the turnaround has been staggering.
	   In 1978, World Cup revenues in Argentina was dlrs 88,000. Now,
it's dlrs 500 million. Analysts say that figure could soar to dlrs
1.6 billion for the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.
	   Other spinoffs for sponsors are also huge, with fans tending to
favor their national team's sponsor when they buy atheltic shoes
and clothes.
	   Teams cash in too: Brazil landed a dlrs 200 million contract
over 10 years with Nike after winning the 1994 World Cup. Nike has
another dlrs 120 million dollar with the U.S. Soccer Federation.
	   In the past failing to get to the World Cup was cause for
national disappointment, but now it also spells financial disaster.
	   In 1994, FIFA took almost 20 percent of the television rights
revenue, ticketing and merchandising and gave dlrs 592,000 to each
team for each game played. That figure is expected to double in
1998.
	   Once considered aloof and confined to hospitality suites,
sponsors these days reflect the daily concerns of fans, sweating
over the fate of stars, and hoping they'll peak at the right time.
	   ``I find myself worrying about Dennis Bergkamp's hamstring,''
says Peter Moore, senior vice president of Reebok. ``Or why Gabriel
Batistuta isn't a certainty in the Argentine side when he's scored
such a glut of goals recently.''
	   Reebok will sponsor 40 individuals at the World Cup, including
Bergkamp and Batistuta. The last thing they want is their player to
be on the sidelines.
	   Shoes these days carry high-tech names such as ``Predator'' or
``Evolution DMX Technology.'' Many will be red, orange or white as
sponsors seek to stand out. Manufacturers talk enthusiastically
about thin films of air under the foot to minimize shock, and
leather design maximizing shooting potential.
	   A new line of Reebok ads has Bergkamp in a Dutch cheese factory
with a hair-net on; Peter Schemichel on a Danish pig farm shoveling
muck; and Eric Wynalda selling second-hand cars in Las Vegas.
	   The message: ``This is what they'd have been doing if our shoes
hadn't made them what they are today.''
	   Aren't they all getting a little carried away? And does your
average supporter notice logos and boards in the heat of battle?
	   World Cup officials say 73 percent of French people watching
World Cup 1994 could recall at least one sponsor, and that 60
percent came away with a ``very favorable'' view of sponsors.
	   When fans complained about a lack of tickets for the World Cup,
many pointed fingers at the sponsors, who have received 436,000
tickets, or 17 percent.
	   Jacques Lambert, director of the World Cup organizing committee,
said: ``It's payback time,'' he says. ``Without sponsors we simply
could not put on an event of this enormity.''
	   So, soccer could hardly be in better shape. Or could it?
	   Many fans lament soccer's transition from its working-class
origins to a global business. Ticket prices have soared to finance
high-tech stadiums and huge salaries. Many fans say they are priced
out of the game.
	   Now that many clubs have gone public on the stock exchange,
defeat doesn't mean just a loss of points, it could also mean
millions being wiped off share value.
	   And then there's always the risk of a conflict of interest.
	   On the verge of a recent comeback, Diego Maradona stopped,
refusing to wear Boca Juniors' Nike-made jersey, insisting on a
different one made by his Puma, with whom he has a personal
contract.

Israeli defense minister meets King Hussein
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
discussed with Jordan's King Hussein efforts to restart Middle East
peacemaking amid new hopes of a settlement.
	   After the meeting, Hussein told Israeli reporters that he was
``comfortable'' and ``optimistic'' of progress in the peace
process, Victor Nahmias, a counselor at the Israeli Embassy, told
The Associated Press.
	   Only Israeli reporters and those assigned by the Jordan's
state-run television and news agency, Petra, were allowed to speak
with Mordechai and Hussein after the meeting.
	   Mordechai later returned to Israel.
	   He had made a similar visit to Egypt last Tuesday to meet with
President Hosni Mubarak.
	   Nahmias said Mordechai is planning to meet with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat soon.
	   He quoted Mordechai as saying that the talks with Hussein and
Mubarak will be followed up with the Palestinians ``so that each
side would cooperate with all the possible means to push the peace
process forward.''
	   Nahmias earlier told AP that Mordechai would brief Hussein on
``the cautious optimism which surfaced recently on the issue of the
second troop deployment in the West Bank.'' He declined to
elaborate.
	   In recent days, speculation had grown that Israel is close to a
decision on an American initiative _ already accepted by the
Palestinian _ that would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under
full or partial Palestinian control and restrict Jewish settlement
expansion.
	   But hopes of immediate progress were somewhat dampened Sunday
when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no accord was
imminent on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Under the U.S. plan, as reported last week by Israeli media,
Israel would withdraw troops in three stages over 12 weeks. The
Palestinian currently have full control over 3 percent of the West
Bank and partial control over another 24 percent.
	   An Israeli statement issued after a Cabinet meeting quoted
Netanyahu as telling his government that ``it is not possible we
are on the verge of an agreement.''
	   Later, Netanyahu told reporters: ``we're working toward reaching
an agreement. We're not there yet.''

Moya wins French Open final

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In an all-Spanish final between clay court
specialists, Carlos Moya defeated his good friend Alex Corretja
Sunday to win his first Grand Slam title, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3.
	   The match was expected to be more competitive, but Moya was
simply the more versatile player. He served better and dominated
Corretja with his powerful forehand.
	   Corretja seemed never to completely find his rhythm after being
broken in the first game of the match.
	   Even before Sunday's results were known, a Spanish sweep of the
singles titles was assured. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the women's
title Saturday in an emotional match against Monica Seles.

Netanyahu: troop-pullback accord not imminent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dampening hopes for movement in the stalled
Mideast peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday said no accord was imminent on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   ``I don't work according to a stopwatch,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after meeting with his Cabinet.
	   The prime minister told his Cabinet that ``it is not possible to
say we are on the verge of an agreement,'' according to a statement
issued after the meeting.
	   In recent days, speculation had grown that Israel was very close
to a decision on an American initiative _ already accepted by the
Palestinians _ that would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under
full or partial Palestinian control and restrict Jewish settlement
expansion.
	   Under the American plan, as reported last week by Israeli media,
Israel would carry out a second redeployment in three stages over
12 weeks. The Palestinians currently have full control over 3
percent of the West Bank and partial control over another 24
percent.
	   The cabinet statement said that Israel and the Palestinians
still did not agree on reciprocal steps the Palestinians would take
in exchange for the Israeli pullbacks.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom told Israel radio that the
government has a parliamentary majority to approve the redeployment
as long as the Palestinians fulfilled security obligations, but
that the U.S.-Israeli discussions were looking ahead to a third
redeployment.
	   Right-wing lawmakers have threatened to bring down Netanyahu's
government if he goes ahead with the pullbacks, and Jewish settler
leaders have stepped up a public campaign against troop
withdrawals.
	   Israeli media reports said American envoy Dennis Ross had asked
the Palestinians to accept some changes in the original U.S.
proposal _ which has been widely reported but never formally
unveiled _ and that Palestinians were rejecting American calls for
a small third redeployment of 2 percent.
	   Palestinian officials reiterated Sunday that they would not
agree to changes in the American initiative now.
	   ``It's not up to (Netanyahu) to redesign the peace process in
his own image,'' said senior Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan
Ashrawi. ``We are not willing to renegotiate the American
proposal.''
	   The American plan reportedly calls for an Israeli promise not to
significantly expand Jewish settlements, and to allow sections of
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction to be
annulled by vote of the 18-member PLO Executive Committee rather
than the much larger Palestine National Council, as Israel
originally demanded.

Rhodes and Klusener rescue South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ England deprived Jonty Rhodes of a
well deserved century but not before the righthander had batted
South Africa to safety in the first cricket test at Edgbaston
Sunday.
	   Rhodes, dismissed for 95, shared a forceful 104-run stand with
Lance Klusener (57) after South Africa had slumped to 224 for
seven.
	   The visitors were eventually bowled out for 343, trailing
England's 462 by 119 runs.
	   England lost opener Mark Butcher (11) but first innings
centurian Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain took England to 29 for
one at tea on the fourth day.
	   The home side enjoys an overall lead of 148 runs.
	   Atherton is on nine and Hussain is yet to score.
	   A draw now looks a likely result with just four sessions left in
the test and the threat of bad weather on the last day, Monday.
	   Rhodes and Klusener took the attack to England after Angus
Fraser had claimed Shaun Pollock and Mark Boucher in a 12-ball
spell.
	   The pair gradually batted South Africa to safety in a near
two-hour alliance. They first avoided the follow-on and then opened
out after the lunch break.
	   Rhodes and Klusener hammered 15 boundaries between them, four of
them by the latter in eight balls from medium-paceman Dominic Cork
after lunch.
	   Cork, who picked up the first four South African wickets, caught
and bowled Allan Donald to finish with 5-93.
	   Cork, returning to the side after a 16-month absence due to
injuries, claimed his first five-wicket haul since taking 5-116
against Pakistan at Leeds in 1996.
	   Fraser, Cork's new ball partner in the absence of the injured
Darren Gough, finished with 4-103.
	   Rhodes, South Africa's in-form batsman, shared two innings
building stands _ with Daryll Cullinan and then Klusener.
	   Cullinan was dismissed for 78 on the third evening to end a
66-run stand with Rhodes.
	   Rhodes, edged Fraser to 'keeper Alec Stewart after a 229-minute
vigil that yielded eight boundaries and a six.
	   Klusener's entertaining 90-ball knock included 11 fours in 117
minutes. Both Rhodes and Klusener were dismissed in the space of
five balls.

Report: Beatings, malnutrition common in Egyptian prisons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Severe malnutrition, skin and respiratory
diseases and torture are widespread in 10 Egyptian prisons, a human
rights group said in a report released Sunday.
	   The Human Rights Center for the Assistance of Prisoners urged
Egyptian authorities to provide better monitoring system for those
prisons.
	   Inmates suffer from severe anemia, tuberculosis and scabies due
to poor hygiene, lack of sun and ventilation, the report said and
charged that prisoners were denied proper medical care.
	   Also, there is evidence of torture from beatings with batons and
electric rods, it said.
	   Naela Gabr, assistant foreign minister for human rights affairs,
refused to comment, saying she had not seen the report yet.
	   The 100-page report says that hopefully public opinion will put
pressure on authorities to change these prisons into ``real
institutions'' for social rehabilitation of prisoners.
	   The Human Rights Center said its report was based on testimonies
of prisoners, detainees, their families and lawyers gathered in the
past year.
	   The 10 prisons listed in the report include four on the
outskirts of the capital, Cairo, and the other six in remote, arid
areas south of Cairo.
	   The report said cells are overcrowded with between 15 and 20
inmates to each cell. Inmates had to drink from buckets of muddy
water and eat rice and beans infested with worms, it said.
	   New inmates are kicked, punched and forced to stand naked for
hours, the report added.
	   The Center said that in the past 12 months, it had sent 441
complaints to the Interior Ministry, the prosecutor general and the
head of the prisons' authority, but received no response.

World Cup: Spain hopes to ride tide of national sporting success
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Riding the wave of major titles in
tennis, motorcycling, soccer and golf, Spain hopes its recent good
sporting fortune will continue at the World Cup.
	   On Sunday, Spaniard Carlos Moya defeated countryman Alex
Corretja in the men's final of the French Open tennis tournament. A
day earlier, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario took the women's trophy.
	   On Saturday, in golf, 18-year-old Sergio Garcia won the British
Amateur Championship. He is expected to be Spain's next great
player, following in the tradition of Seve Ballesteros and Jose
Maria Olazabal.
	   Last month, Alex Criville won the French Grand Prix in the
500-cc motorcycle category. Also in May, soccer powerhouse Real
Madrid won a record seventh European Champions Cup.
	   ``Things seem to be happening for Spain and that gives everyone
that extra bit of confidence,'' defender Rafael Alkorta said.
``They're like premonitions. We are here, too, and hoping to
conquer in France.''
	   In nine World Cup appearances, Spain's best placing was fourth
in 1950. On Saturday it begins its 10th quest when it faces Nigeria
in Group D.
	   Historic underachievers, Spain has had a feeling in recent weeks
of a surge in confidence that _ maybe this year _ this team can
pull it off.
	   ``For talent and technique, we're capable of beating all,'' said
substitute goalkeeper Santiago Canizares. ``We're just need that
moment of fortune which has escaped us in the past.''
	   What's undeniable is that Spain is sailing through its golden
age in international sports.
	   The Spanish national team's last major title was the European
Championship in 1964 when the country was in the midst of the
nearly four-decade Franco dictatorship.
	   Real Madrid won the European Champions Cup in 1966, which drew a
virtual curtain on major international successes for some 20 years.
	   After a featureless 1970s, Spain began to remerge strongly in
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
	   Most notable were Miguel Indurain and Pedro Delgado, who
dominated in cycling with successive triumphs in the Tour de
France. Indurain won five straight times.
	   Then came the massively successful and popular 1992 Olympics in
Barcelona. Spain's soccer team won gold as the country picked up
more than a dozen gold medals, its best performance ever.
	   And, in 1992, FC Barcelona took the European Cup back to Spain.
	   In the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Spain again won more than its
expected share of medals.
	   ``Things are moving,'' said defender Carlos Aguilera. ``We came
here with hopes and enthusiasm to do something major. Let's hope
it's the beginning of some great celebrations for Spanish fans.''

Swiss voters reject tough restrictions on genetic engineering

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ After an emotive campaign, Swiss voters
on Sunday decisively rejected a proposal to outlaw the production
and patenting of genetically modified plants and animals.
	   In the run-up to the vote, Swiss industry and government said
the plan would force a ``draconian'' shutdown on research in
Switzerland, sending highly paid jobs to other countries.
	   By a bigger margin than expected, some 67 percent of voters _
1.25 million people _ threw out the ``The Initiative for the
Protection of Life and the Environment against Genetic
Manipulation.''
	   Not one of Switzerland's 26 cantons (states) voted in favor of
the tough restrictions which it would have imposed.
	   For a proposal to be passed, there has to be both a majority of
cantons and of voters in favor. Only 33 percent, or some 625,000
voters, supported the initiative. Turnout was low, at just over 40
percent.
	   Environmentalists and consumer activists who backed the
initiative say too little is known about the consequences of
letting genetically modified organisms into the food chain.
Tampering with genes poses ``incalculable risks,'' they argued.
	   But the issue of jobs is also highly sensitive to the
resource-poor country of 7 million. Despite Switzerland's small
size, it is a leading force in biotechnology.
	   Basel-based pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Roche rank with
competitors such as Monsanto, of St. Louis, among world leaders in
the field. In Basel itself, some 67 percent of voters threw out the
restrictions.
	   The Swiss pharmaceutical industry, which had warned the
initiative would shackle the companies and academics in their
research efforts in Switzerland, greeted the vote with relief.
	   ``The way is now open for Switzerland's industry and
universities to carry on into the future with their biomedical and
pharmaceutical research,'' Roche said in a statement.
	   ``The people obviously listened to our arguments,'' said
Novartis research chief Paul Herrling.
	   ``For me personally, it means that I can stay in Switzerland,''
said Charles Weissmann, a Zurich-based researcher.
	   Disappointed campaigners for the initiative put a positive spin
on their defeat.
	   ``We'll certainly carry on,'' prominent environmental campaigner
Florianne Koechlin told Swiss radio.
	   The months of debate on the uses and dangers of genetic
engineering had been useful in themselves, Green Party lawmaker
Ruth Gonseth said.
	   The initiative, backed by Switzerland's Green Party and some 60
environmentalist and consumer organizations including the World
Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace, was launched in 1993. The committee
behind the proposal had gathered more than 110,000 signatures
backing it.
	   Sunday's vote against it ranged from some 56 percent in rural,
eastern Appenzell Outer Rhodes to almost 85 percent in the western
Valais and Vaud cantons.
	   The traditionally environment-conscious German-speaking majority
was more favorable to the proposal than the French-speaking
minority, but still delivered a solid no vote.

Palestinian leader urges Arab summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged Arab
leaders Sunday to hold a summit soon to discuss the faltering
Mideast peace process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Arab leaders must come together ``not just to face the stalemate
in the peace process, but also ... to renew Arab cooperation,''
Arafat said at a joint news conference with Sudanese President Omar
el-Bashir in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.
	   His comments were carried by MENA.
	   El-Bashir said Sudan supported the idea of holding a summit.
	   Arafat has been pushing for the summit to pressure Israel to
accept a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13.1
percent of the West Bank.
	   But Arab governments have been unable to agree on a date, an
agenda and participants for a summit.
	   Arafat and el-Bashir are expected to leave for Burkina Faso to
attend a summit Monday of the Organization of African Unity on due
Monday.

Aid workers try to assess danger of epidemics in Afghanistan

<TEXT>
	   FAISABAD, Afghanistan (AP) _ Aid workers were trying Sunday to
assess whether serious disease has broken out in remote villages of
northern Afghanistan devastated during last weekend's earthquake.
	   The quake killed up to 4,700 people and injured thousands of
others, according to Afghan authorities. It smashed houses, buried
wells and swallowed crops and livestock.
	   The United Nations and Red Cross have evacuated 102 of the most
seriously injured people from remote villages, and delivered food
to 31 of the approximately 100 damaged and destroyed villages.
	   An outbreak of bloody diarrhea was reported in the Chah-ab
region, about 60 kilometers (38 miles) west of Faisabad, said U.N.
spokesman Rupert Colville. Red Cross helicopters postponed some
emergency food deliveries and set out for the region to investigate
whether the outbreak might signal shigella or dysentery.
	   Both diseases spread quickly when water supplies are polluted.
In addition to destroying wells, the May 30 quake cut channels and
pipes carrying spring water to villages, and landslides
accompanying the quake have filled rivers with mud.
	   Chris Johnson, a water specialist with the Oxfam relief
organization, said that the remoteness of the affected villages,
and the fact that most people appeared to be staying put, could
help stem any serious epidemic.
	   ``What we're all really worried about is the possibility of a
lot of displaced people concentrating,'' Johnson said.
	   About 700 families were reported to be walking from Malwan,
about 35 kilometers (22 miles) west of Faisabad, to Rostaq, a
provincial center about 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the southwest,
Johnson said.
	   Oxfam has sent a representative to try to find out whether the
approximately 4,000 people are on the move because they are hungry
or because they fear further earthquakes. If they are afraid to go
home, aid workers will have to organize camps for them, Johnson
said.
	   Soldiers of the Taliban religious movement, which governs 85
percent of Afghanistan but not this northeastern corner, stopped a
U.N. World Food Program convoy in Ghazni province in southern
Afghanistan two days ago, said Saeed Bashir Muzaffri, the WFP
coordinator in Faisabad.
	   He said the 40-truck convoy was carrying 600 tons of wheat flour
to Hazarajad in central Afghanistan, where people are suffering
from hunger.
	   Bashir said the food was part of an agreement between the
Taliban and the WFP. The Taliban said they were waiting for a
decision from their leadership, Bashir said.
	   More than 100,000 people are suffering from hunger in central
Afghanistan. WFP got permission only recently for one convoy to
cross the front line into central Afghanistan, and this was to have
been the second convoy under the agreement.
	   Even for short distances, logistics were a nightmare. Officials
said 230 tons of wheat were sitting in Faisabad because the road to
the airport five miles (9 kms) away was washed out.

Officials lower death toll in Germany's high-speed rail crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to LOWER death toll, based on new analysis of remains;
RAISES the number of identified victims. CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By COLLEEN BARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a sign of just how horrible the
deadly train wreck in Eschede really was, officials on Sunday
lowered the death toll to below 100 based on new analysis of human
remains found at the scene.
	   Officials were not sure exactly how many people died because
many of the bodies were so mutilated. After reporting 97 bodies had
been removed from the wreckage of Wednesday's crash, officials now
believe they have found just 93 or 94 bodies or sets of remains,
said police spokesman Juergen Weinrich.
	   Five other people died in hospitals.
	   The high-speed InterCity Express train was traveling 200
kilometers (125 miles) an hour when it derailed and slammed into
the concrete supports of an overpass. The impact sent 200-300 tons
of concrete crashing down the jackknifed passenger cars.
	   The severity of the disaster has made identifying victims a
painstaking process involving forensic dentists, doctors,
fingerprint experts and photographers.
	   Some bodies and remains are so badly mangled that DNA tests will
have to be ordered, and rescuers at the site were sifting through
loose dirt for personal effects, such as jewelry and wallets, that
could help with identification.
	   So far, 60 bodies have been identified.
	   Recovery efforts at the scene in Eschede, 50 kilometers (35
miles) north of Hanover, were wrapping up Sunday, leaving the
tracks to investigators and repair crews. Workers were preparing
new sections of rail to reopen the Hanover-Hamburg stretch by the
middle of this week.
	   Investigators have pointed to wheel failure as the likely cause
of the derailment, prompting rail officials to pull Germany's 59
original high-speed trains out of service for ultrasound wheel
inspections. Rail delays continued throughout Germany on Sunday.
	   Inspectors said it will take 15 days to complete the tests of
wheels and wheel casings.
	   Federal rail authorities expected to have three first-generation
trains back on the rails at normal top speed of 280 kilometers (175
miles) an hour by Sunday afternoon.
	   Maximum speed on the trains was reduced to 160 kilometers (100
miles) an hour after the accident.
	   Germany's second-generation ICEs, introduced in 1996, have a
different wheel system, and have been left in service.
	   In the small, red-brick village of Eschede, residents laid a
wooden cross Sunday on a road near the crash site and placed potted
flowers on top in memory of the victims.

Ukrainian sailors killed in maintenance accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two Ukrainian sailors were killed Sunday
in an accident which occurred during maintenance work on their
ship, anchored off the coast of the northern Greek port of
Igoumenitsa, media reports said.
	   Anatoly Chykhry, the 57-year-old captain of the Ukranian-flagged
dredger ship Zakharyan, and boatswain Leonid Mataidora, 32, were
killed during work on the ship's digging system, reports said. No
further details of the accident were immediately available.
	   Another two of the ship's sailors, whose names were not

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's first municipal elections in 35
years on Sunday became a referendum on Christian-Muslim coexistence
in Beirut and a fight for control over Shiite Muslims, the nation's
largest sect, in southern Lebanon.
	   To ensure safe balloting, thousands of troops backed by armor
manned road intersections and guarded polling stations across the
capital and in the south. Thirteen people were arrested after minor
scuffles, the army said.
	   First firm results are not expected until Tuesday as votes are
counted manually.

	   CLOSE to 1,000 vocational teachers have been laid off, and the
fate of 50,000 students in private vocational schools throughout
the country is hanging in the balance owing to a lack of education
loans.
	   Veerawat Wannasiri, chairman of the Private Vocational Schools
Association, said that teachers in urban vocational schools were a
prime target for lay-offs as economic conditions deteriorated.
	   There are 335 private vocational schools with 17,000 teaching
staff and 466,000 students in total.
	   He said that admissions to vocational schools had dropped 30 per
cent, which had had a direct effect on the employment of teachers.
	   Several private schools, he said, have had to employ marketing
strategies to attract students, otherwise they would not have
sufficient numbers.
	   Somyos Meeprasertkul, president of Uttradit Technology
Institute, said his school offered an installment plan for new
students so that only 50 per cent of tuition fees was required on
admission.
	   The most suitable way to ensure the survival of private
vocational schools, Veerawat pointed out, is to increase student
loans. At least 50,000 students have indicated that they would like
to take out loans for their education.
	   Throughout the country, education loans are in need of an
additional Bt1.5 billion and within the metropolitan area an
additional Bt800 million.
	   He said the Education Ministry had been informed of the current
difficulties. ''Without timely assistance, half of the 50,000
students may have to leave their schools,'' he said, adding that
most of them were students from the North and Northeast regions.
	   Chatchai Phudyaphorn, chief of the Thai-Tech Group, an umbrella
organisation which comprises several private vocational schools,
said he could not guarantee how long his schools could endure the
current crisis.
	   He added that 30 per cent of them had been forced to shut and
predicted that several others would face the same fate within the
next three years if the government did not give a helping hand.

	   CUSTOMS officials on Saturday seized 371 smuggled electronic
game machines worth over Bt50 million from Bangkok shops and
department stores, Customs Department Director-General Somchainuk
Engtrakul said.
	   With support from Army personnel and transportation, nearly 100
officials were deployed to department stores throughout Bangkok,
including Seacon Square, where 138 game machines were seized,
Mahboonkrong (36 seized), Siam Jusco (43), and The Mall's
Ngamwongwon branch (84).
	   Owners of the banned machines were fined, although under the law
they could face up to 10 years imprisonment if convicted.
	   Somchainuk said the department would sell the seized games to
countries which allowed the import of the electronic devices.
	   ''Normally we destroy smuggled items, but since the country is
in dire need of funds, we think selling them would help bring in
some money,'' he said.
	   Somchainuk said the government would further restrict game
operators and players by banning young children from playing the
games and forcing operators to limit service hours.
	   ''Most of the games do not enhance any of the children's skills
and only cause social problems,'' he said.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) - Soldiers exchanged gunfire early Sunday
in the capital of Guinea Bissau, in West Africa, killing up to 10
people, news reports said.
	   Shooting started at 0530 GMT at the military headquarters in
Bissau and lasted for more than three hours, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
	   The ten people killed were soldiers, the agency reported.
	   According to Lusa, the Bafata Movement, the main opposition
party, said in a statement that the clash was a ``violent
pay-back'' inside the ruling party, following the appointment of
the new armed forces chief of staff.

	   THE Bangkok Metropolitan Administration plans to ask for the
temporary use of land plots seized by Siam Commercial Bank to turn
them into community markets to help the unemployed, Deputy City
Clerk Kriangsak Lohachala said on Saturday.
	   The properties, whose previous owners could no longer afford to
pay for them, would also be used as utility plazas to serve as
recreational sites for nearby communities as well as being utilised
as sites for the establishment of new businesses to help the
jobless make a living.
	   Kriangsak said it had yet to be decided whether the project,
scheduled to begin in August at the latest, would initially be run
solely by the BMA at its expense or jointly with the bank through a
joint-venture entity.
	   The first land to be selected is a 10-rai plot in Soi Sua Yai
Uthit off Ratchadiphisek Road in Bang Khen district under a
three-year contract which requires that no permanent large
buildings be built on the property.

Moya wins French Open final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines urgent series, adds quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In an all-Spanish final between clay-court
specialists, Carlos Moya defeated his good friend Alex Corretja
Sunday to win his first Grand Slam title, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3.
	   The match was expected to be more competitive, but Moya was
simply the more versatile player. He served better and dominated
Corretja with his powerful forehand.
	   Corretja seemed never to find his rhythm after being broken in
the first game of the match.
	   ``For two weeks I'll be a king,'' Moya said, referring to the
period before Wimbledon. ``It's an unbelievable feeling to win a
Grand Slam.''
	   Corretja, who earlier in the tournament played a five-hour,
31-minute match over two days that was the longest in the open era,
said he'd gotten tired after the second set.
	   ``It would have been tough, mentally, to go five sets,'' he
said.
	   Even before Sunday's results were known, a Spanish sweep of the
singles titles was assured. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the women's
title Saturday in an emotional match against Monica Seles.
	   Moya, seeded 12th, and Corretja, seeded 14th, reached the final
after the men's field was decimated early in the tournament.
Top-seeded Pete Sampras lost in the second round, and No. 2 seed
Petr Korda lost in the first.
	   Moya knocked off the consensus favorite, No. 3 seed Marcelo
Rios, in the quarterfinals. By contrast, Corretja did not meet one
seeded player until the final.
	   In the first set Sunday, Moya gave a hint of things to come by
breaking Corretja in the first game.
	   The windy conditions _ with gusts of up to 50 kph (31 mph) _ cut
short some of the long rallies for which the Spaniards are known.
Misplays on serves and volleys caused both men trouble.
	   Corretja took an early lead in the second set, breaking Moya to
go ahead 2-1. But Moya evened it in the next game. Corretja held
off two set points at 4-5 to even the set at 5-5.
	   Two games later, Corretja got into trouble again on his serve at
5-6. This time, he couldn't hold off the more powerful Moya, and
dropped behind two sets.
	   In the third, with Corretja coming out to serve at 1-4, the
crowd did the wave to try to breathe some new life into the
contest. Corretja did hold serve, then saved a match point to win
his next service game.
	   But serving at 5-3, Moya set up a second match point with an ace
for 40-0. Corretja netted a backhand service return to end the
match. Moya fell on his back in joy, and Corretja hurdled over the
net to congratulate his friend.
	   Soccer star Pele awarded the trophy to Moya, who saluted
Corretja in his acceptance speech. Then both players joined Pele
for an impromptu romp with a soccer ball, heading it back and
forth.
	   Spanish men have won the French Open five times previously, but
have only taken three other Grand Slam titles.
	   Moya, born and raised on island of Majorca, came into view at
last year's Australian Open, where he defeated Boris Becker in the
first round, then reached the final, losing to Sampras.
	   He gets dlrs 650,000 for winning here.
	   This was the 37th all-Spanish final on the men's tour since
1990.

	   THE group of dissident MPs from the Prachakorn Thai Party will
next week file a lawsuit asking for measures to protect their
rights in case they are eventually ousted from the party, a group
member said on Saturday.
	   Group member Samret Achariyaprasit said the draft of the suit
was complete pending final editing and would be filed towards the
end of next week at the latest.
	   The 12-member group lodged a lawsuit in November last year
calling for a denunciation of a party resolution which was
endangering their party memberships. The Civil Court on Wednesday
accepted the first lawsuit.
	   Samret said all group members would accept the court'Cy join a single party due to their political differences
and acceptance on an individual basis by other parties.
	   Democrat secretary-general Sanan Kachornprasart has maintained
his unclear stance as to whether or not his party would accept all
or any of the dissident members, saying that the final decision
would be made after the current Prachakorn Thai memberships were
finalised by the party in July.
	   Sanan also denied that his party had approached the Chat Pattana
Party to ask it to join the coalition to strengthen the
government's position, saying that the rumour was persisting
because several MPs from both parties had close connections and
used to work together in the past.
	   Prime Minister and Democrat leader Chaun Leekpai refused to
comment on the 12 dissidents' future, saying that it would rest
solely on the Prachakorn Thai decision but he would still accept
them as members of the coalition.

	   PRIME Minister Chuan Leekpai on Saturday urged opposition leader
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to keep politics in the South free from
vote-buying.
	   His comment came after Chavalit began his extensive tour of the
Southern provinces, considered to be the stronghold of Chuan's
Democrat party.
	   ''I hope that [Chavalit's] New Aspiration Party will cooperate
and keep it that way,'' said Chuan, whose party has long won almost
all the parliamentary seats in the region, including 47 out of a
possible 52 in the last general election in Nov 1996.
	   NAP leader Chavalit has been using his two-day trip in the
South, which began on Friday and ended on Saturday, to seek more
support from locals to fulfil his party's new strategies, which
have recently been decided upon.
	   The prime minister hopes that no political party will use social
discrimination as a political tactic, a sentiment echoed by
Democrat secretary-general Sanan Kachornprasart, who said he did
not want to see the division of people either by wealth or region
of origin.
	   When asked about the Democrat's reported estimate that it would
win at least 200 parliamentary seats in the next election, Sanan
said the figure would also depend on other factors and public
acceptance of the party in the future.
	   He refused to predict when the next election would take place,
saying that the government still had enough public support.
''Otherwise there would be a lot of people gathering on the
street,'' he quipped.
	   NAP deputy leader Wan Mohammad Noor Matha hit back at Chuan,
saying that the premier's remarks on vote-buying were not
constructive and he did not approve of them.
	   Speaking at an NAP seminar in Songkhla, Wan Noor said Chuan's
remarks had been meant to flatter himself and cast aspersions on
others. ''His words implied that all 125 NAP MP seats had been won
by vote-buying,'' he addded.
	   Claiming that he could prove that some of the Democrat's 123
parliamentary seats had been secured in that way, the Parliament
speaker said a Democrat minister had had to defect to the NAP
because he had not been able to put up with the rampant vote-buying
in the last general election.
	   He admitted that some NAP MPs had got into Parliament on
vote-buying tactics but insisted it was a very low percentage. He
also attacked the ruling coalition party for accepting a Solidarity
Party MP whose canvassers had been jailed for vote-buying as a
Cabinet member despite its denunciation of him in the past.
	   Wan Noor said it would be a well-run race if the NAP succeeded
in gaining at least 20 seats in the South, adding: ''It could
prevent a political monopoly and stop the delusions of a certain
political party.'' Launching a more robust counter-attack, NAP
deputy secretary-general Areephen Utarasin accused Sanan of
attempting to use his connections with a convicted drug trader and
political figure in Narathiwat to build up strength for his party.
	   Areephen, a leading figure in the NAP's Muslim Wadah group, said
he had also learned that Sanan was scheduled to meet the person,
who he said had recently completed a 20-year jail sentence for drug
offences, at his birthday party on June 27 in Narathiwat.
	   ''Sanan's presence at the party would prove my remarks about the
Democrat Party's build-up plans,'' he added.
	   Areephen, a Narathiwat MP, predicted that the NAP would sweep
all three seats in Yala and win two more in Pattani and Narathiwat.
''We will prove that there are some in the South not obsessed with
the Democrat Party,'' he added.
	   Democrat deputy leader Banyat Bantadtan said the government had
no intention of staying in office until 2000 when its four-year
term would expire.
	   He admitted that political competition in smaller
constituencies, in the South or elsewhere, would under the new
Constitution become much more difficult.
	   ''But we have a slight advantage over other parties, having more
experience in these situations,'' he added.

	   CONVICTS will be sent to work on farms to help solve the problem
of overcrowded prisons across the country, Interior Ministry
spokesman Jakraphan Yomchinda says.
	   ''The Corrections Department still has a vast area to turn into
farmlands. So the ministry has decided that more inmates be
consigned to the farms instead of prisons,'' he said.
	   The scheme is in line with His Majesty the King's initiation of
self-reliance communities, Jakraphan said, adding that it had been
in operation for more than a year.
	   So far the project has covered 26 provinces, mainly Chon Buri,
Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Pathom, Chiang Rai, Nakhon Si Thammarat,
Surin, Chanthaburi, Phatthalung, Prachin Buri, Nakhon Sawan,
Rayong, Pitsanulok, Ratchaburi, Krabi, Petchaburi, Phetchabun,
Trang, Trat, Kalasin, Narathiwat, Sukhothai, Chai Nat, Roi Et, Khon
Kaen, Nan and Buriram.
	   Director of the Corrections Department's vocational investment
division Surang Ekachote said the department had earned at least
Bt10 million from the sale of crops produced at these farms over
the past year.
	   She added that the department planned to send more prisoners to
these farms because at present only 719 inmates were involved in
the programme.
	   ''Compared with the 20,000 inmates we have in jail, there are
only few being sent to work in the fields. Our target is to send
about 1,000 or 1,500 prisoners to the farms,'' she said.
	   The main obstruction in expansion of the project is the lack of
warders, she said.
	   ''We can hardly solve the problem of overcrowding if we do not
have enough warders,'' Surang said.
	   However, the department expects to expand the project to 38
provinces in a short time, she added.
	   According to Surang, convicts who have been selected to join the
programme are those with good records and those who have to serve
one or two more years. These convicts would live on the farms
behind barbed wire.
	   Warders are still needed, even though the department does not
think these well-behaved inmates would escape.
	   ''The best part of it is that most of them already have
agricultural backgrounds, so they can easily adapt themselves to
the new environment. I think the project will benefit the country,
because these inmates will disseminate the self-reliance concept to
people in their communities in the future,'' she said.
	   Basically, however, the project will be used to solve the acute
overcrowding problem, Surang said.
	   ''Normally a 16-metre cell accommodates one prisoner, but now
there are two or four inmates confined in such a miniscule area.
That's why fights break out between them,'' she said.

	   LEADING academics will next week propose to the government that
it immediately establish an unemployment security fund by using Bt6
billion from the Social Investment Fund (SIF) as part of the effort
to prevent social unrest as a result of growing unemployment as the
economic slump persists.
	   Prof Nikom Chantrawitoon, a labour expert who is drafting the
proposal, said the government cannot cite a tight budget as an
excuse for not providing a social security net for workers who are
struggling to survive the economic crisis.
	   ''The government must provide an unemployment security system
for workers who have been laid off because if the economy does not
bounce back, more than half of the workers who have lost their jobs
will go hungry -- what would happen then?,'' Nikom said.
	   The proposal came after the government has come under growing
criticism for failing to provide workers with a social safety net
and accusations that the government is only helping the rich while
ignoring the plight of the poor.
	   Under the Social Security Act 1990, which does not specify the
time frame for the setting up of the unemployment security fund,
the government can issue a Royal Decree to establish an
unemployment security fund if it is deemed necessary, such as
during a period of economic turmoil.
	   Nikom said that since employers and employees are still reeling
from the economic slump, the government should be able to spend
around Bt6 billion from the total Bt20 billion SIF it received from
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to help create an
unemployment security fund. Under the proposal, the government,
employees and employers would contribute 0.5-1 per cent of
employees' salaries to the fund.
	   ''Using only Bt6 billion from the SIF fund, the government would
greatly improve the security of workers who helped to build the
country's economy during the boom. There is every reason to enact
this as these workers deserve support and are not to blame for the
current economic mess,'' Nikom said.
	   The idea to immediately establish the fund came at the end of a
seminar attended by government representatives along with
employees' and employers' groups at the Royal Hotel last Sunday.
	   The Labour Ministry estimates that the number of unemployed will
reach two million this year while the Thailand Development Research
Institute came up with an even higher figure. TDRI's recent report
revealed that by the middle of the year, three million people will
be unemployed.
	   Anunsorn Thamchai, an economist who helped to draft the proposal
said that if the six million workers contributed one per cent of
their monthly salary or Bt100 per month, and the government and
employers contributed the same amount, the proposed unemployment
security fund would receive Bt1.8 billion in contributions every
month.
	   If the fund were used to buy the Government Housing Bank's bonds
which pay 11-13 per cent interest, the fund would earn Bt234
million per month or Bt2.8 billion per year.
	   The unemployed (who had contributed to the fund) would receive
Bt3,000 per month to help pay their living expenses. ''The reason
behind giving them such a tiny amount of money is to create an
incentive for them to look for jobs otherwise they may want to live
on social security for the rest of their lives and take advantage
of others,'' Ansorn said.
	   The unemployed (who had not contributed to the fund) would be
supported through another Bt450 million fund to provide each of
them with a food coupon worth Bt50 per day each for a six-month
period.
	   In addition, a Bt500 million fund would be used to support the
unemployed who wish to start a new business, providing each of them
with around Bt10,000-50,000. Another Bt1 billion would be used for
those who have been unemployed for more than six months who would
be entitled to apply for a Bt100,000 loan with a two per cent
interest rate over a 20-year period.

	   AS THE World Cup fast approaches, the police are clamping down
on soccer gambling operators who are set to earn an estimated Bt30
billion during the four-week competition.
	   Like an epidemic, gambling fever has spread everywhere -- from
private firms to government offices and from schools to local
banks. With such huge stakes being bet, the notorious underground
lottery bookmakers have temporary shifted their focus towards
soccer.
	   Thai Farmers' Research Centre estimates that the 64-soccer
matches would generate as much as Bt30 billion in Thailand as each
Bangkok gambler will spend an average of Bt38,880, 35 per cent more
than during the 1994 World Cup.
	   Central Investigation Bureau deputy commissioner Pol Maj Gen
Chat Kuldilok, acknowledged that lots of lottery bookmakers had
taken up soccer gambling because more money is being spent on this
sport.
	   He said that Police chief Gen Pracha Promnok had instructed the
police to set up a central unit to crack down on the
gambling-related businesses. ''We have asked police in each
jurisdiction to come up with a list of people who are involved in
the gambling business,'' Chat said.
	   Furthermore, the Police Department has also sought cooperation
from banks, the Education Ministry, University Affairs Ministry and
the mass media to help in monitoring the situation.
	   Chat said he had requested the banks check on ''suspicious''
transfers of large amounts of money among their customers.
	   ''As for the media, we plead with them not to tacitly support
gambling. I know some of them even suggest betting prices,'' he
said referring to newspaper columns which provide insights into
soccer matches.
	   But Chat confessed that clamping down on such an illegal
business was a daunting task.
	   Education Ministry deputy permanent secretary Surat Silapanand
concurred that soccer gambling is very popular among students,
especially as there are now web sites available for gambling on the
Internet.
	   He said he had circulated letters to directors,
secretary-generals and rectors of schools, colleges and
universities asking them to prevent the illegal activities among
youngsters.
	   ''Teachers should pay more attention to students during the
World Cup. They have to take special care of their computers,
preventing children from using the Internet to bet on soccer
games,'' he said.
	   Surat said if schools have problems in dealing with mischievous
students, they can call the Student Patrol Division on 215-3537,
215-8221 or 282-1758 at the Police Department or contact any police
station.
	   Education Ministry's Student Patrol Division Nikhom Charumanee,
said that many students would sneak out of their classrooms to
wander around shopping centres, computer game shops and theatres to
bet on soccer matches.
	   He called on all sides to help children to divert their
attention from gambling. ''Student patrols are not enough to deal
with these students, we would like to ask shops to cooperate with
us as well,'' he said.
	   An interview with an underground lottery bookmaker, who prefers
to be called Wad, said that most gamblers are 45 years old or less.
''They are office workers and executives in private companies. They
normally opt to bet Bt10,000 on each match,'' Wad said.
	   To deal with an increasing number of customers, Wad said he had
expanded his network by setting up a special pub. However, he said
the pub is exclusivelyfor ''loyal'' customers.
	   ''We have already screened our customers, so there shouldn't be
any problem. We bet just for fun and most of our clients are
financially sound. We are not destroying the country, or the
cashflow in Thailand,'' he said.
	   Another bookmaker, Suwanna (real name withheld), said that her
customers had urged her to receive bets on the 1998 World Cup.
	   ''I'm not really familiar with it but my son, who is an ardent
soccer fan, will take care of it,'' she said.
	   For her, the difference between underground lottery and soccer
betting is that customers can still negotiate the odds in football
but not in the underground lottery.
	   ''Underground lotteries have standard odds and customers will
win if they bet on the right numbers. But when you bet on soccer,
your chance is based on the ability of the players of the team on
which you are betting,'' she said.
	   Although she received soccer bets, she said she had to be
careful in screening customers to avoid those who would fail to pay
once they had lost.

Kosovo militants call for more help to fight Serb forces

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's rebel army appealed Sunday
for more ethnic Albanians to join them and ``fight for freedom''
from the Serbian forces waging a fierce offensive against them.
	   The Serbs' latest offensive in the secessionist province has
left at least 50 people dead, 200 missing and thousands fleeing
their destroyed villages, according to ethnic Albanian officials.
	   Serbian officials have characterized the flights as a response
to increasing attacks by the Kosovo Liberation Army, a loosely
formed group of self-described freedom fighters who claim to have
wrested control of about 40 percent of the province from Serbia.
	   ``Come to strengthen our troops against the enemy artillery and
enemy infantry,'' read the KLA's statement, published Sunday in the
Albanian-language daily Koha Ditore in Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   It appealed ``for the last time'' to ethnic Albanian political
organizations to give up their policy of a peaceful struggle for
independence and join the KLA.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the 2.2
million people living in the province, and most want to secede from
Serbia and Yugoslavia. Western powers are against any border change
in the volatile Balkans but want the Serbs to cease their offensive
and give Kosovo the autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989 as a way
to suppress the independence movement.
	   Serbs vow never to allow the secession of Kosovo, which has many
ancient Orthodox monasteries and which they consider to be the
cradle of their history.
	   Albanian TV said the Serbs shelled at least two Kosovo villages
Sunday. It also said ethnic Albanian militants blew up the police
headquarters in Ratkoc, and amid fierce fighting between the two
sides all the Serb residents and police had fled.
	   Federal authorities in Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and
Montenegro, on Sunday escorted more than 40 diplomats into the
besieged region. The state-run Serbian Radio Television and the
official Tanjug news agency were the only news organizations
allowed on the trip.
	   The offensive that began in late May has stirred increasing
international concern and fears of a wider war in the Balkans. The
United States is expected to reimpose sanctions against Serbia
after a White House meeting on Monday.
	   On Sunday, Pope John Paul II called on the world to act against
violence and repression in Kosovo.
	   ``In Kosovo, violent options, repression and the flight of
peoples must not leave the international community inert,'' he said
at the Vatican. The violence, the pope said, ``recalls the tragic
recent history of the Balkans.''
	   The exodus of more than 10,000 Albanians into Albania last week,
and another 7,000 to 10,000 into Montenegro, also has stirred worry
in the West.
	   In Germany, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the Welt am
Sonntag newspaper his country is afraid of being flooded with
refugees, so it is working with international refugee agencies to
assist them in the Balkans.
	   About 400,000 ethnic Albanians already live in Germany.
	   Refugees in Montenegro said they walked for three days through
woods before reaching safety. Most are women, children and elderly
men.
	   ``There were 30 soldiers in the barracks who took turns when
they beat us,'' Dervis Alimehaj, of the Kosovo town of Decane, told
Associated Press Television, showing the bruises on his body.
``They also threatened us by putting knives under our throats,'' he
said in the town of Plav in eastern Montenegro, where more than
1,000 refugees have gathered.

Pantani victorious in 1998 Giro after final stage annulled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details, final stage shortened; minor
editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Marco Pantani clinched his first Tour of
Italy Sunday after race judges ruled that the final stage would not
count towards the overall standings.
	   The Italian had virtually wrapped up the 1998 Giro a day earlier
after increasing his lead over Russia's Pavel Tonkov to 1 minute,
33-seconds, and Sunday's stage was expected to be a celebratory
ride.
	   Rainy conditions prompted the jury to annul the day's results
about five hours into the stage to prevent racers from riding too
fast and risk falling on the slippery roads.
	   ``I demonstrated that I am still strong despite everything that
has happened to me,'' Pantani said. ``I am extremely satisfied.
This victory allows me to see this sport as a huge source of
enjoyment.''
	   Pantani, 28, has had a series of cycling accidents, the last
occurring during last year's Giro when a cat ran onto the road in
front of his bike. In 1996 he broke his leg and was sidelined for
the entire season.
	   Before Sunday, Pantani's best result in the Giro was a second
place in 1994. He missed the 1995 and 1996 editions due to
injuries, and pulled out of the 1997 Giro after falling.
	   Competitors were asked to complete Sunday's stage, however,
mostly to please the huge crowds that turned out to cheer Pantani,
race officials said.
	   No times were recorded, but Italian Gian Matteo Fagnini was
first across the finish line.
	   A climbing specialist, Pantani took over the leader's pink
jersey for the first time in his career six days ago during a
roller coaster ride through the Italian Alps.
	   Then he surprised even his biggest supporters Saturday when he
beat Tonkov, the 1996 Giro winner, in an individual time trial, the
Russian's specialty.
	   ``I think I won because I attacked the most and refused to
finish second even if sometimes the conditions did not favor me,''
Pantani said.
	   In celebrations Saturday evening, Pantani's entire Mercatone Uno
team -- riders, trainers and masseuse -- shaved their heads to
imitate Pantani.
	   Switzerland's Alex Zuelle, who was considered the race favorite
after dominating the initial stages, dropped out of contention
Thursday during the Tour's toughest stage -- 239 kilometers (148
miles) up steep mountain roads in scorching heat.
	   ``Pantani is an amazing competitor,'' said Zuelle. ``I didn't
expect him to be so strong.''
	   Due to the rain, the jury shortened Sunday's planned
173-kilometer (107-mile) stage, from Lugano, Switzerland to Milan,
by 16 kilometers (10 miles).
	   Of the 168 riders who started the Giro, 96 completed its
22-stages, covering a total of 3,852 kilometers (2,388 miles).
	   Pantani finished the Tour in 95 hours, 50 minutes, 39 seconds.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Encouraged by the new openness sweeping Indonesia,
a group of Chinese Indonesians launched a political party here
yesterday to campaign for racial equality.
	   ``We want to defend our rights and create true harmony among
Indonesian citizens,'' Ponijan, director of the Widyatara language
school and a founder of the Chinese Indonesian Reform Party
(PARTI), told The Jakarta Post.
	   Ponijan called on the government to start treating citizens of
Chinese descent fairly in political, economic, social and legal
matters.
	   ``The government has so far discriminated against us. It, for
instance, differentiates us on our identity cards,'' Ponijan
claimed.
	   The Chinese Indonesian minority has often been made a scapegoat
in Indonesia, largely because it dominates the economy.
	   Last month, hundreds of Chinese shops were targeted by looters
and arsonists during the riots here which saw over 5,000 buildings
damaged or burned.
	   But with the new government pledging democratic reform, a small
coalition of ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs said that now was the
time to take to the political stage. Chinese Indonesians make up
only 4 percent of the country's 202 million population.
	   The establishment of the new party was announced yesterday by
Ponijan, who was accompanied by National Youth Committee executive
Lieus Sungkharisma, businessmen Julianus Juta and Cecep
Adhisaputra, and F. Alexander Ferry, who is a student.
	   Ponijan strongly criticized the government's record regarding
its citizens of Chinese descent, including a requirement that
ethnic Chinese students provide their parents' proof of citizenship
before enrolling in a university.
	   Ponijan said the party would endorse its own candidates in the
coming general election which President B.J. Habibie has said would
take place next year.
	   He said the party's candidates would not have to be ethnic
Chinese but would be individuals willing to fight for reform and
equal treatment of all citizens.
	   A Chinese Indonesian political party existed early this century
under Dutch colonial rule, but its political clout faded after
Soeharto rose to power.
	   Separately, a number of junior lawyers from the Jakarta Legal
Aid office announced yesterday the establishment of Solidaritas
Nusa Bangsa, a group to battle discrimination. (byg)

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A court on Sunday fined a weekly newspaper
reporter the equivalent of dlrs 2,950 for libeling a former adviser
to the trade minister, but acquitted the newspaper's chief editor.
	   Judge Mohamed Khalifa also ordered the reporter, Moemen Ahmed,
and editor Mustafa Bakry to pay 500 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 147) in
compensation to Rushdy Saqr. They can appeal the sentence.
	   Saqr had filed the libel suit in 1997 in response to articles in
the Al-Osboa newspaper that alleged he was corrupt.
	   The case is the latest by Egyptian government officials or
former officials targeting journalists
	   At present four reporters are serving jail sentences for libel
cases that press groups in Egypt and abroad have condemned as a
setback for press freedom.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Jakarta State Administrative Court has issued
a by-verdict revoking a ban on labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan's book
Rakyat Menggugat (The People's Suit).
	   Azet Hutabarat, who led the team of lawyers processing Muchtar's
appeal, said in a media statement here yesterday that a panel of
judges presided by Marina Sidabutar granted the lawyers' request
and ordered the Attorney General's Office to suspend a ban on the
book's distribution.
	   ``With the court decision, all book shops are now allowed to
redistribute the copies of the book,'' he said.
	   The Attorney General's Office banned the book on Jan. 20, 1997,
after deeming its content jeopardized national stability.
	   Pakpahan and his team of lawyers filed suit demanding that the
decision be overturned and appealed that circulation be continued
while court proceedings were in progress.
	   Thursday's verdict supported the appeal and sources said, given
the current climate, it would signal the way for a final verdict in
favor of Pakpahan.
	   Hutabarat said the panel of judges did not support the decision
to ban the book and argued that its circulation could be beneficial
to readers.
	   He added that the team from lawyers of the Indonesian Legal Aid
Foundation (YLBHI) would also ask the Attorney General's Office to
recommend President B.J. Habibie and the House of Representatives
lift the law on the seizure of printed material because it was
against the 1945 Constitution guaranteeing freedom of opinion.
	   Pakpahan, chairman of the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union
(SBSI), was recently released from the Cipinang prison. He was
jailed for allegedly instigating a riot in Medan, North Sumatra in
1994. (rms)

	   PARIS (AP) _ With the World Cup three days away, Air France
officials held an emergency meeting Sunday with ground personnel
and flight attendants in an effort to keep a crippling pilots' from
spreading.
	   The strike seemed certain to enter its second week Monday, as no
new talks between the pilots and Air France have been set.
	   Air France has said it will take three days for service to
return to normal once the strike ends, meaning the walkout was sure
to disrupt the soccer championship, which begins Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the company met Sunday with ground personnel and
flight attendants, who have expressed concern they have been left
out of salary talks between Air France and the pilots.
	   One of the unions representing ground personnel, the
Communist-backed General Labor Confederation (CGT), warned Friday
of a ``spread of the conflict'' unless Air France included other
airline workers in the talks.
	   Both the pilots and Air France were under pressure to end the
strike from the government, worried about France's image and
embarrassed by the walkout.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday the government was
prepared to intervene but no concrete proposals emerged.
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   Public support for the pilots appeared lukewarm.
	   A poll in Sunday's edition of Le Journal du Dimanche showed just
38 percent of those surveyed were sympathetic to the strike. In
contrast, 79 percent of those polled backed truckers in a strike
last fall.
	   The poll was carried out Friday by the CSA polling agency among
1,004 people. No margin of error was given.
	   The strike has inconvenienced thousands, including foreigners
fleeing the violence in Eritrea who had hoped to return to Europe
on an Air France flight from Djibouti that was canceled Sunday.
	   Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is committed to
transporting the teams from one venue to another.
	   The pilots are protesting pay cuts planned by Air France in
order to save 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) a year the
company says is needed to modernize the company.
	   The obstacles to an agreement are proposed salary reductions and
a plan to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay cut, as well as
a two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots earn less.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Monday.
	   Trains were expected to run on schedule Monday after strikes
disrupted service this weekend. Trains conductors have threatened a
walkout Wednesday.
	   Taxi drivers in Paris planned demonstrations Monday to protest
the killing of a taxi driver last week.

	   JAKARTA (JP): All 12 victims of Thursday's helicopter crash in
the mountainous Viqueque regency in East Timor were given military
funerals in separate ceremonies yesterday.
	   Chief of Udayana Regional Military Command Maj. Gen. Yudomo
Sastro Suhardjo and three other victims were buried at Kalibata
Heroes Cemetery in South Jakarta, in a ceremony chaired by Army
Chief of Staff Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo.
	   The other three were chief of the Wira Dharma Military Command
in East Timor Col. Salamat Sidabutar, assistant for intelligence
affairs to the Udayana Regional Military Command Chief of Staff
Col. Pangandaran Napitupulu, and Lt. Col. Simson G. Sigar, a member

Arifin, said as quoted by Antara.
	   John said Muhammad's body arrived at Salahuddin Airport from
Dili, East Timor, at 10:30 a.m. local time and was taken
immediately to Bima Military District headquarters where his
colleagues paid their last respects.
	   Later yesterday, the body of chief of the East Timor Rajawali
Special Task Force Col. Djody Kusuma Priyambodo, was buried at Maj.
Gen. Sungkono Heroes Cemetery in Surabaya. The military ceremony
was led by Chief of Staff of the East Java Brawijaya Military

Helicopter Production Department at state-owned aircraft maker
IPTN, denied reports that the Bandung-based company manufactured
the ill-fated chopper.

told reporters covering the visit of Papua New Guinea Prime
Minister Bill Skate to the company. (imn/nur/43)

Russian nukes in safe hands, says U.S. missile forces chief

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia keeps its deadly nuclear arsenal in safe
hands, watching over it with as much vigilance as the United States
safeguards its own missiles, the commander of America's nuclear
forces said Sunday.
	   Gen. Eugene Habiger, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, toured
weapons sites across Russia over the past week to learn more about
how the world's other major nuclear power controls its most lethal
weapons.
	   ``I want to put to bed this concern that there are loose nukes
in Russia,'' Habiger said in an interview with The Associated Press
before flying back to the United States. ``My observations are that
the Russians are indeed very serious about security.''
	   Habiger's tour, his second to Russia in the past year, included
visits to bases for strategic missiles, bombers and naval forces,
as well as storage sites and silos.
	   He traveled to Siberia, the Far North, and the base of the
Russian space program in Baikonur, Kazakstan, and viewed
operational sites never before open to an American.
	   Habiger said that on the whole he was impressed by the
professionalism and dedication of Russian officers manning the
missile sites, and praised the rigorous physical and psychological
tests they take every few days.
	   ``In some areas the Russians are a lot more conservative than we
are,'' he said.
	   Habiger's visit is part of a series of exchanges between the two
countries' nuclear commands designed to build trust and reduce the
possibility of mishaps. His Russian counterpart, Gen. Col. Vladimir
Yakovlev, made a similar tour of U.S. nuclear weapons sites in
March.
	   Yakovlev, who accompanied Habiger to the airport, said he did
not find it uncomfortable to open such highly-classified sites to
his former Cold War enemies.
	   ``We can't go farther along the road to disarmament without
deepening our mutual understanding,'' Yakovlev said.
	   Habiger, who became commander of U.S. nuclear forces in February
1996, said he considers the danger of an unauthorized launch of a
Russian missile extremely remote, in part because there are more
layers in the Russian chain of command. For instance, three people
must approve the movement of any warhead, instead of two in the
United States, and the Russians require the orders to be in
writing.
	   He said that there are some philosophical differences between
the two countries, but suggested that it was more of an operational
than a security issue.
	   ``We tend to rely on technology a lot more than they do.'' he
said. For example, while the Americans rely primarily on sensors
and other technical surveillance to guard their silos, Russians use
armed guards.
	   The U.S. Strategic Command, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska,
controls all American nuclear bombs and missiles, whether based on
land or at sea.
	   Habiger, who piloted his own plane back to the United States,
plans to retire this summer after 39 years of military service. His
successor, Vice Adm. Richard Mies, accompanied him on the tour.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie signed yesterday an
International Labor Organization (ILO) convention that guarantees
workers freedom to organize.
	   Decree No. 83/1998 corresponds to ILO Convention No. 87
concerning freedom of association and protection of the rights to
organize.
	   The convention says workers and employers have the right to
establish their own organizations or join existing unions without
prior approval from anyone.
	   Unions must also be given freedom to run their own affairs,
including joining federations or confederations locally or
internationally, free of state interference.
	   While it states that unions must abide by the laws of the
country, the convention also says that laws should not prevent
workers from exercising the rights guaranteed by the conventions.
	   The document, which was enacted by the organization in San
Francisco on June 17, 1948, must still be ratified by the House of
Representatives before it comes into effect.
	   The move came while the ILO is holding its annual meeting in
Geneva. Indonesia is represented by Minister of Manpower Fahmi
Idris at the three-week event which opened last week.
	   Two local unions, FSPSI and SBSI, said last week they had asked
the ILO meeting to put pressure on the Indonesian delegation to
ratify a number of ILO pacts, including Convention No. 87.
	   FSPSI, the Federation of the All Indonesian Workers Unions,
listed three other conventions Indonesia must still ratify: No. 105
on migrant workers, No. 111 on discrimination in employment and No.
138 on minimum wages.
	   Officials of the Ministry of Manpower have said the government
is studying the other ILO conventions.
	   Under the Soeharto regime, workers' movements were tightly
controlled by the government, and all unions had to be affiliated
with the FSPSI.
	   SBSI, the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Union founded by lawyer
Muchtar Pakpahan in 1992, was outlawed and several of its leaders,
including Pakpahan, were jailed.
	   SBSI has since been given official recognition and Pakpahan
released from jail. He was asked to join the Indonesian delegation
to the current ILO meeting. (emb)

	   YOGYAKARTA: A special plenary session of the Bantul council
called to decide whether to dismiss regent Sri Roso Sudarmo had to
be postponed yesterday after Golkar council members abruptly left
the room after hearing testimony from the regent.
	   ``I still can't understand why they just upped and left. The
agreement was that a decision would be taken today,'' said a fuming
H. Ikhwanudin of the United Development Party.
	   He warned that further delay would cause more anxiety in an
already tense situation.
	   A similar tone was also expressed by Antonius Margoyono of the
Armed Forces faction.
	   ``The aspirations of the people of Bantul are quite clear. They
no longer want to be under the direction of Sri Roso,'' he said as
quoted by Antara.
	   ``All the factions, except for Golkar apparently, have come to
the same conclusion, which is to withdraw support for Sri Roso and
replace him immediately,'' Antonius remarked.
	   Sri Roso was summoned by the council yesterday to explain
reports that he would ``contribute'' Rp 1 billion to former
president Soeharto's Dharmais foundation if he could be elected
regent for another term.
	   He was also asked to explain his alleged involvement in the
murder of Bernas journalist Fuad Muhammad Syafrudin. The case
remains unsolved.
	   Fuad was known for his investigative reports uncovering
corruption in the regency.
	   Councillors said they would push for a decision to be reached
today.

	   SURABAYA: The East Java-based Surya daily admitted yesterday
that it had made a mistake in a report which said that opposition
figure Amien Rais was among those earmarked to receive a total of
Rp 260 billion (US$22.6 million) for helping to topple former
president Soeharto.
	   Deputy chief editor Basuki Subianto conceded that his reporters
had made a mistake when they failed to recheck an item found on the
Internet which claimed the New York Times had written that Amien
Rais had received the money.
	   About 200 students from a Muhammadiyah youth group rallied in
front of the daily's office to protest the article.
	   One of the student representatives pointed out in a meeting with
Surya editorial staff that the original New York Times article of
May 20 never mentioned Amien Rais as a recipient.
	   Basuki formally apologized for the mistake and agreed to a set
of corrective measures including printing a half-page apology.
	   The daily also said it would print a special interview with
Amien Rais explaining the matter and would also place quarter page
apologies in the Jawa Pos and Surabaya Pos dailies. (nur)

	   JAKARTA (JP): Former top government officials currently running
four of former president Soeharto's largest foundations said
yesterday they would not relinquish the Rp 2.63 trillion (US$2.39
million) accumulated in the foundations' account to the government,
but would instead continue their various social projects.
	   Sudharmono, Soeharto's close friend and former vice president,
said the foundations were established by Soeharto in a private
capacity and that it was irrelevant whether he was still in power
or not.
	   He also claimed that the four foundations -- Amal Bakti Muslim
Pancasila, Supersemar, Dharmais and Dakab -- received funds on a
voluntary basis and that the former president had never tried to
coerce donors.
	   Sudharmono, secretary of the Amal Bakti foundation, challenged
people to file lawsuits if they were dissatisfied.
	   ``If people have strong suspicions and evidence they can audit
the foundations. We are open to it, as far as it is in line with
the law,'' Sudharmono said during a media briefing at the
foundations' headquarters at Granadi Building in Kuningan, South
Jakarta.
	   Also present were former minister/state secretary Moerdiono, who
is Dakab's deputy chairman, and former minister of cooperatives
Bustanil Arifin, a treasurer of the Amal Bakti foundation.
	   The government has not formally asked for the foundations to
turn over their money, which was often collected with government
support, but the public has been focussing attention on Soeharto's
amassed wealth.
	   ``Symbolically the amount may be big, but in realty it's
meaningless to the government,'' Sudharmono said as he skirted
questions about transferring the funds to the cash-strapped
government.
	   Amal Bakti Muslim Pancasila was established in February 1982
with the purpose of building mosques and financing religious
activities. Its total assets are worth Rp 211.98 billion.
	   Controversy surrounded the collection methods of this foundation
when in November 1982 the government siphoned Rp 50 from the
monthly salaries of low-level Moslem civil servants and Armed
Forces (ABRI) members. Senior ranking officials had their monthly
pay cut Rp 1,000 for the foundation.
	   ``We've built 870 mosques in 26 provinces,'' Sudharmono
defended.
	   The Dharmais foundation was set up in 1975 with the aim of
helping homeless and disabled people and to provide health
services. Its assets are about Rp 733.88 billion.
	   Since 1978, the Ministry of Finance ordered all state-owned
banks to contribute 5 percent of their net profits to Dharmais.
	   ``If it's now considered they no longer need to give donations,
it's OK,'' Sudharmono remarked.
	   The Supersemar foundation was formed in 1974 to provide
scholarships for students from elementary school to post-graduate
schools. Its assets are estimated at Rp 808 billion.
	   ``At least 5,000 students have finished their studies at
universities with our financial assistance,'' Sudharmono noted.
	   The Dakab foundation was set up in July 1985 mainly to finance
the Golkar political faction, which Soeharto heads, for its social
activities. Its assets are worth Rp 836.20 billion.
	   Informed sources told The Jakarta Post yesterday that Soeharto
planned to hold a media conference Tuesday if he felt that people
were widely dissatisfied with Sudharmono's explanation.
	   ``Pak Harto will make his own explanation if he feels that
people still continue questioning his wealth,'' the source,
speaking on the condition of anonymity said.
	   Dharmais, Supersemar and Dakab jointly control 79.29 percent of
publicly listed Bank Duta. The Nusamba Group, also controlled by
the three foundations, also has a 10 percent stake in the country's
biggest carmaker, PT Astra International.(prb)

<SLUG> Westwood wins second straight European event; takes English Open </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   WARE, England (AP) _ England's Lee Westwood won the English Open
Sunday by two strokes over Olle Karlsson of Sweden and Greg
Chalmers of Australia, Westwood's second straight win on the
European Tour.
	   Westwood, the 25-year-old Ryder Cup player, closed with a
4-under 68 to finish on 17-under 271. Karlsson shot 66 and Chalmers
finished with 69, both on 273 on the Marriott Hanbury Manor course.
	   Westwood, who won last week in the TPC of Europe in Hamburg,
Germany, is 40-under par in his last eight rounds and playing as
well as anyone in the world going into the U.S. Open later this
month.
	   ``It's just clicked recently and I'm holing a few putts, which I
wasn't before,'' said Westwood, whose win also moved him atop the
European money list for the first time in his career.
	   ``Life couldn't be better right now,'' he added. ``I'm just on a
wave and trying to ride it.''
	   Westwood, who led Chalmers by one stroke after three rounds,
trailed him by two with 11 holes to play on Sunday. But he birdied
four of the next six holes, dropped a 30-foot par-saving putt on
the 16th, and then got home safely on the final two holes.
	   On Saturday, the Australian lefthander shot a course-record
11-under par 61 to get into contention.

Kosovo crisis could derail high-level Balkan meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Fighting in Kosovo and Yugoslavia's
refusal to allow what it considers foreign meddling in the troubled
province could derail a meeting of Balkan foreign ministers.
	   Foreign Ministers from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia,
Romania and Yugoslavia will attend the two-day meeting that starts
Monday, while Bosnia and Slovenia have sent deputy ministers. They
are nominally to discuss economic cooperation and the region's
communications, energy and transportation infrastructure.
	   But sources close to the foreign ministers said Sunday that
Yugoslavia's refusal to allow any reference to the
Albanian-dominated secessionist Serbian province of Kosovo could
torpedo a joint declaration calling for closer regional
cooperation.
	   Meeting along the shores of the Bosphorous, which separates
Europe from Asia, the foreign ministers will also set the agenda
for a meeting of their heads of state next fall.
	   Yugoslavia has made it clear that it will not accept any
reference to Kosovo in the Istanbul Declaration, something the
other ministers say they will not swallow.
	   Traditional rivals Greece and Turkey have put aside their own
thorny disputes and are working together to try and convince the
Yugoslavs to accept some kind of compromise in order not to
diminish the importance of the meeting.
	   Diplomatic sources said it would be difficult to contain
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mikhailova or Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos should Yugoslavia refuse. Albanian
Foreign Minister Pascal Milo will also have difficulty accepting
any kind of joint declaration with no reference to Kosovo.
	   ``Kosovo can't be ignored, there has to be some reference,''
said one Turkish diplomatic source.
	   A possible compromise would be a reference calling for the
return of thousands of Kosovo Albanians who have fled across the
border during the recent fighting.
	   It would be qualified with a call for a solution inside the the
current borders of Yugoslavia.
	   ``The problem with that is that you can't water down the
statement to the point where it is meatless,'' said another
diplomat.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2.2 million
inhabitants, and most demand to secede from Serbia and Yugoslavia.
Western powers are against any change of borders in the volatile
Balkans, but want the Serbs to cease their offensive and give
Kosovo the autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989 as a way to
suppress the independence movement.
	   ``Where there is a will there is a way,'' said one senior
Turkish diplomatic official.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government appointed nine international
investment banks yesterday to assist in the partial privatization
of 12 state companies.
	   The institutions are Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill
Lynch, Jardine Fleming, Morgan Stanley, Paribas, Credit Suisse
First Boston, UBS/SBC Warburg Dillon Read and Salomon Smith Barney.
	   State Minister for the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri
Abeng said Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers had been selected as
the overall advisors for the privatization program.
	   The decision was reached after a ``vigorous and thorough''
selection process which involved 22 international banks.
	   ``The selection was done through a transparent screening process
based on international practices,'' he said in a media conference.
	   He said the selection criteria were designed together with the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
	   The criteria included the banks' expertise in the respective
industry of the state companies, ability and networking to arrange
a private placement throughout the world and dedication to
Indonesia.
	   The government plans to privatize seven state-owned companies
and divest more shares in five publicly listed state companies in
the 1998/1999 fiscal year in a bid to raise Rp 15 trillion (US$1.5
billion) to support the financially strained state budget.
	   The ambitious program has been endorsed by the IMF, which is
organizing a multibillion dollar economic reform program to help
lift the nation out of its worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   The government's divestment plans in domestic telecommunications
firm PT Telkom will be prepared by Merrill Lynch and Lehman
Brothers; international telecommunications carrier PT Indosat by
Goldman Sachs; cement maker PT Semen Gresik by Jardine Fleming;
mining operations PT Tambang Timah and PT Aneka Tambang by Morgan
Stanley and Paribas. These state companies are already listed on
stock exchanges.
	   The partial privatization of steel maker PT Krakatau Steel will
be assisted by Salomon Smith Barney; toll road operator PT Jasa
Marga by Lehman Brothers; airport management company PT Angkasa
Pura II by UBS/SBC Warburg Dillon Read; plantation company PT
Perkebunan Nusantara IV by Jardine Fleming; port operator PT
Pelabuhan Indonesia II by Goldman Sachs; PT Pelabuhan Indonesia III
by Credit Suisse First Boston.
	   Tanri said the fee for the foreign banks had yet to be
negotiated, but acknowledged that as advisers they normally
received a 1 percent fee.
	   He added the privatization program would be pushed toward
private placements, especially through strategic alliances with new
investors, because of the current bearish sentiment on the stock
exchanges.
	   ``Privatization through strategic investors have good prospects
because they are not short-term investors but looking for long-term
opportunities.''
	   Tanri was strongly criticized early this week over allegations
he had quietly made a deal with the Netherlands-based Ispat
International to sell a 49 percent stake of Krakatau Steel for a
relatively low price of $400 million.
	   Some suspected he was compelled to enter into the deal since
Ispat's local partner was controlled by the late Edy Kowara, father
of Indra Rukmana, son-in-law of former president Soeharto.
	   Tanri strongly denied the rumors.''No one can force me.I'm not
afraid of anybody as long as I'm still within the system.''
	   He referred to the privatization document containing the
privatization procedures and criteria which are open for audit by
the World Bank, IMF and the public.
	   He said that when he received the privatization responsibility
last year, the World Bank country director Dennis de Tray asked him
whether he would be able to cope with pressure from strong persons
to sell the state assets to certain groups.
	   Tanri responded: ``That's why we made this procedure.If they
keep forcing me, I'd rather resign.I can always find another job.''
	   Tanri, the former president director of the giant Bakrie Group,
was appointed as a cabinet member in March by Soeharto. The cabinet
lasted for less than three months because Soeharto abruptly
resigned on May 21 and handed over power to his protege B.J.
Habibie, who then reappointed Tanri to his cabinet.
	   Tanri said the signing of an MOU with Ispat was not a final deal
but merely the second stage of the 12 level process in selecting a
strategic partner for state companies designed for privatization.
	   He also said that a final decision could be made only after a
competitive bidding process involving other prospective investors.
	   It was just a business strategy, he said, adding: ``In business,
opportunity only knocks once.''
	   He explained that he had to make the MOU because of the strong
interest and commitment showed by the chairman of Ispat
International, a New York Stock Exchange blue-chip company with
market capitalization of $3.4 billion.
	   There had been not much interest in Krakatau Steel before and
the management has failed to get a strategic investor during the
past two years.
	   In addition to the solicited investors selected by the
investment banks, unsolicited investors would also be given
opportunities to make due diligence, he said.
	   ``This procedure has been accepted by the World Bank and the
IMF,'' he said.(rei)

Kabila aims to rebuild Congo with national service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila is launching a
new program to help rebuild Congo's deteriorating infrastructure,
including its crumbling roads and electrical grid, state radio
reported Sunday.
	   The campaign will include an effort to recruit thousands of
workers to repair roads throughout the country, the report said.
	   The infrastructure redevelopment project will also receive
support from the European Union, which last week announced plans to
offer more aid to Congo.
	   Tony Lloyd, Britain's foreign office minister for Africa, said
Thursday the EU would increase earlier grants worth dlrs 100
million earmarked for roads and health facilities.
	   ``The EU is ready to assist Congo to develop its infrastructure,
justice, human rights and so on,'' Lloyd was quoted as saying on
Congolese state radio.
	   Kabila's highway and road repair teams may be drawn from a
national youth service he created last year.
	   As one of his first moves after taking power in May 1997, Kabila
established a volunteer national youth service to help rebuild the
country. Hoping to attract as many as half-a-million recruits to
the service, Kabila said the corps of volunteers would work in the
farm fields and on infrastructure development.
	   Congo's transportation network is in dismal disrepair.
	   One year after Kabila's rebel victory ousted longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese-Seko, the former Zaire remains a wreck after years of
neglect.
	   In the capital, Kinshasa, roads are pitted and in some areas
completely washed away by rains.
	   Throughout the country, a highway network built in the 1960s has
all but disintegrated, with some sections completely impassible.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Information Muhammad Yunus revoked a
controversial regulation enacted by his predecessor Harmoko 14
years ago which gave the minister the right to revoke the license
of press publications.
	   Yunus, an Army lieutenant general formerly known as Yunus
Yosfiah, issued a series of new rulings on press and radio
broadcasting which he said were part of ``reformation in the
information sector.''
	   He said that a review of the press law would take time because
it had to involve the House of Representatives, but in the meantime
he had the power to change some of the more restrictive rules as a
temporary measure.
	   Minister of Information Regulation 1/1998 canceled a 1984 ruling
signed by Harmoko in order ``to give legal certainty to the press
so that they can carry out their tasks, functions and obligations
to the best of their ability.''
	   The minister still retains the power to suspend the license of
publications that violate the terms of their permits, but only for
a ``certain period of time''.
	   The decree does not define how long a ``certain period of time''
actually lasts for.
	   The minister can also reprimand publishers, but the ultimate
sanction for publishers must be sought through a court.
	   The government's ability to revoke publication licenses has been
widely seen as a major impediment to freedom of the press. Although
there was no official censorship, editors frequently had to
suppress news and indulge in self-censorship to avoid the axe.
	   Under Harmoko, a former journalist who served as minister of
information from 1983 until last year, several newspapers and
magazines lost their licenses and were closed because they
criticized or offended the government in their reports.
	   The last major clampdown on the press came in 1994, when three
weeklies -- Tempo, Editor and DeTik -- lost their permits.
	   Harmoko, who is now speaker of the House of Representatives,
resisted pressure to lift the restrictions during his last years as
minister, arguing that the power to revoke licenses was necessary
to protect both the public and publishers.
	   Since being appointed to the cabinet by President B.J. Habibie
last month, Yunus has repeatedly promised to respect freedom of the
press, which he said could play an important role in bringing
corruption, collusion and nepotism to an end.
	   He was incredulous when he discovered that to obtain a license a
publisher must fulfill 16 conditions and obtain three different
permits.
	   Yesterday, he rolled back many of the stricter rules introduced
by Harmoko.
	   He simplified licensing procedures and abolished the requirement
that all publications must obtain recommendations from the
Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI) and the Union of Press
Publishers.
	   Now applicants need only meet three conditions to start up a
publication: Fill in an application form, register the company and
present a list of executives.
	   Yunus promised a speedy licensing process. ``If you apply today,
Insya Allah (God willing), the permit will be issued the day after
tomorrow.''
	   He said publishers who had lost their licenses should take
advantage of the simplified procedures rather than seek to win
their old licenses back. ``Tempo can reappear quickly with a new
license,'' he said.
	   He cautioned publishers against paying bribes to obtain
licenses. ``If an official demands a stake in your company, report
him to me,'' he said.
	   Publishing companies no longer need government approval to
appoint or change their editors. All such appointments are now
internal company affairs.
	   The PWI is no longer the only organization allowed to represent
journalists, as it formerly was, but all journalists are still
required to join a professional organization.
	   The government has no objection to journalists joining the
Alliance of Indonesia Journalists (AJI), or establish a new
organization, he said.
	   Membership of AJI cost some journalists their jobs when the
government put pressure on their editors to dismiss them. AJI was
set up in 1994 by young journalists discontented at the ineffective
way in which PWI responded to the government closure of three
magazines.
	   Yunus deregulated radio news broadcasting, which will allow
private stations to produce and manage their own news, and cut the
number of state-run RRI radio new broadcasts which they must relay
from 14 per day to four, including one regional news bulletin.
	   Private radio stations are permitted to work with foreign
stations without first seeking government permission.
	   Media executives immediately hailed Yunus' announcement
yesterday.
	   ``Two thumbs up for the minister and the new decrees,'' Fikri
Jufri, editor of Matra men's magazine and a founding member of
Tempo, said.
	   ``I am proud that Yunus, who is a military officer, is highly
committed to reform,'' he said, adding that the measures were
important to the growth of a healthy and independent press.
	   With regard to Tempo, Fikri said a team had been established to
prepare for the return of the magazine.
	   Former DeTik editor Eros Jarot was cautious, saying the
government still had too much control over the press.
	   The sanctions were vague, and could be interpreted in different
ways, Eros said. ``I trust Yunus' commitment to press freedom. But
he is not going to be minister for 30 years. What will happen to
the press if subsequent ministers are like Harmoko?'' he asked.
	   He said the decree should set a maximum time limit, like one
week, for which the government can freeze a license.
	   Eros said he would prefer to wait for a clearer law rather than
resume publication of DeTik immediately.
	   Mass communications expert Ashadi Siregar hailed Yunus' decision
to end the PWI monopoly and welcomed the establishment of
alternative professional organizations.
	   He said each organization must draw up a code of ethics.
	   ``The PWI code of ethics needs tobe adjusted to the present
conditions,'' he said.
	   Ashadi said the press law must also be reviewed.(rms/emb)

	   JAKARTA (JP): The president of state oil and gas company
Pertamina admitted yesterday that importing fuel and crude oil for
its refineries was causing the company cash flow problems because
of the sharp depreciation in the value of the rupiah against the
U.S. dollar.
	   He said that the recent fall in the value of the rupiah had
significantly increased the subsidy required to keep fuel prices
constant in rupiah terms.
	   ``The problem has arisen because Pertamina has not been
reimbursed by the government for the fuel subsidies it has spent
for the past two months,'' Soegianto said after a ceremony to hand
over a Rp 1.9 billion (US$190,000) donation to cooperatives owned
by students from 28 universities throughout Java.
	   He refused to reveal the size of the outstanding subsidy
payments owed by the government, but analysts put them in the
region of Rp 1.6 trillion. The 1998/1999 state budget allocates Rp
9.5 trillion for fuel subsidies in the current fiscal year.
	   ``It should be noted that the subsidy is not for Pertamina but
for fuel consumers,'' Soegianto said, adding that the company, as
the sole distributor of fuel oils, had used its own money to pay
for recent fuel and crude oil imports in full.
	   He said that Pertamina earned Rp 2.2 trillion from the sale of
fuel each month but had to spend Rp 3 trillion to import fuel and
crude oil to feed its refineries.
	   Although Indonesia is a net oil exporter, it has to import
between 15 and 20 percent of its annual fuel consumption of 52
million kiloliters and 70 million barrels of crude oil to feed its
refineries.
	   Soegianto said the company's cashflow problem had been
exacerbated by the failure of some large private clients, including
the recently bankrupted private air carrier PT Sempati Air, to pay
their debts.
	   Sempati, which is owned by former president Soeharto's youngest
son Hutomo Mandala Putra and Soeharto's crony Mohammad ``Bob''
Hasan, owes Pertamina Rp 50 billion in unpaid aviation fuel bills.
	   ``We are now trying to collect the credit arrears,'' Soegianto
said.
	   Separately, Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
confirmed yesterday that Pertamina was facing financial
difficulties.
	   ``I would be lying if I said that the company was not having
cash flow problems,'' he said.
	   Kuntoro said he had discussed the problem with Minister of
Finance Bambang Subianto, who said Pertamina had not been
reimbursed because the Development and Finance Control Board (BPKP)
had yet to finish an audit of the company.
	   ``You have to understand that bureaucracy cannot always work
speedily,'' Kuntoro said.
	   Kuntoro hinted that the delay in reimbursement by the Ministry
of Finance may also be linked to the further plunge in the value of
the rupiah against the U.S. dollar. Any weakening in the national
currency causes the fuel subsidy to rise sharply in rupiah terms.
	   He said the Rp 9.5 trillion allocated by the government in the
state budget was based on a projected crude oil price of US$14.5
per barrel and an exchange rate of Rp 6,000 per dollar throughout
the current fiscal year.
	   The exchange rate has so far averaged more than Rp 10,000 per
dollar this year.
	   ``The fuel subsidy increases by Rp 5 trillion every time the
exchange rate declines by Rp 1,000 against the dollar,'' he said.
	   Soegianto added that Pertamina also faced difficulty securing
imports because most Indonesian letters of credit (L/Cs) were
rejected overseas.
	   He said even L/Cs issued by state banks were being rejected
overseas.
	   ``If L/Cs issued by state banks are turned down then we have to
open our L/Cs through foreign banks,'' Soegianto said. (jsk)

	   JAKARTA (JP): The police cannot fully guarantee solving all
sexual abuse cases from last month's riots due to several basic
investigation obstacles, an officer said yesterday.
	   One of the critical problems always facing police in such cases
is the reluctance of many victims to report incidents to the
police, City Police spokesman Lt. Col. E. Aritonang said.
	   ``The victims usually feel embarrassed.
	   ``The police have yet to receive any accusations or reports of
sexual abuse during the recent riots,'' he said.
	   He said he hoped victims would report any cases personally or
through other parties, including non-government organizations, so
police could immediately start an investigation.
	   The amount of time passed between the incident and the time the
crime is reported is a major factor affecting the chance that a
case can be successfully completed.
	   ``For instance, if a sex crime occurs and the victim reports it
weeks later, the physical evidence is already gone and the victim's
memory about the incident probably becomes blurred,'' Aritonang
said.
	   The more details the victim can provide, the greater chance the
police have in apprehending the perpetrator, he added.
	   The women's rights group Mitra Perempuan yesterday claimed to
have been informed of more than 20 sexual abuse cases from May 13
to May 15, when looting and burning rocked the city.
	   Although the group did not identify the victims, it said many of
them were of Chinese descent.
	   In a statement, Mitra Perempuan said angry mobs stripped and
molested a number of Chinese-Indonesian women before forcing them
to swim in a pond somewhere in the Daan Mogot area.
	   The group also received reports that a number of women were
raped in front of an onlooking crowd in Glodok, while dozens of
other women were sexually harassed in their homes. (edt)

	   JAKARTA (JP): State oil and gas company Pertamina said yesterday
it would increase Jakarta's fuel supply to avoid fuel shortages as
experienced on Wednesday.
	   Pertamina made the statement following reports that some gas
stations in Jakarta ran out of Premium gasoline on Wednesday. Some
motorists queued up at gas stations through the night.
	   Pertamina president Soegianto said Pertamina would soon dispatch
107,000 kiloliters of Premium gasoline from it refinery in
Balongan, West Java, to add to the supply from its Cilacap refinery
in Central Java.
	   In comparison, the daily demand for Premium gasoline in Jakarta
is 7,583 kiloliters.
	   ``Premium gasoline from Balongan will arrive in Jakarta in two
or three days. Nevertheless, supply from Cilacap will continue,''
Soegianto said after a ceremony to give Rp 1.93 billion
(US$193,000) to student cooperatives at 28 universities throughout
Java.
	   The residue catalytic cracking unit at the Balongan refinery,
which produces Premium gasoline and other fuels, is currently under
repair, Soegianto said.
	   But the refinery can still produce Premium gasoline by blending
low sulfuric wax residue produced at the refinery's crude
distillation unit with imported high octane mogas components.
	   Soegianto acknowledged that some gas stations in the city had
ran out of Premium gasoline Wednesday, but only for four hours
until 5 p.m.
	   The reason for the shortage was that a tanker carrying 14,000
kiloliters of Premium gasoline and automotive diesel fuel from the
refinery in Cilacap, Central Java, arrived late at Tanjung Priok
Port.
	   Soegianto did not say why the tanker arrived late. But
separately Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said
yesterday the tanker arrived at the port at 9 a.m. as scheduled,
but failed to berth because it was overloaded.
	   The ship went on to Merak where it unloaded the automotive
diesel fuel before returning to Tanjung Priok.
	   Soegianto noted that Pertamina had a policy of keeping enough
fuel in reserve to last the country 26 to 28 days.
	   All other parts of the country had enough fuel on Wednesday.
	   ``As a matter of fact, only eight out of 160 gas stations across
Jakarta ran out of Premium gasoline that day,'' Soegianto said.

Jerusalem Post publisher resigns, paper announces major management
</HEADLINE>
reshuffle &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ One month after merging with a major
competitor, The Jerusalem Post announced the resignation Sunday of
its publisher and president, Norman Spector and a major management
reshuffle.
	   Sources at the Post said Spector's resignation, which he said
was for personal reasons, came as a surprise. The former Canadian
ambassador to Israel took over the Post, owned by the Canada-based
Hollinger International chain, last year.
	   Post editor Jeff Barak said Spector would return to Canada as a
columnist for The Globe and Mail, a national Canadian daily,
``writing on provincial, national and Middle East affairs.''
	   In an effort to reduce administrative costs and look for new
revenue opportunities, the Post entered into a strategic alliance
with one of its key competitors last month, the Israel-based
Jerusalem Report, a bi-monthly newsmagazine which covers Israel and
Jewish affairs. As part of the deal, Spector was to become chief
executive officer of the magazine but his resignation will affect
that post as well.
	   Barak said Spector would be replaced by a four-man team which
will report directly to F. David Radler, chairman of the board of
the Post.
	   The new management structure will include publisher Tom Rose of
Hollinger, Paul Staszewinski, who moves from vice president of
finance and administration to president of the newspaper and vice
chairmen Avi Golan, who has served as executive vice president and
Hirsh Goodman.
	   Goodman, who established The Jerusalem Report eight years ago,
returned to the Post, where he once worked as a defense
correspondent, as part of the deal between the two publications.
	   Spector's resignation was to take effect immediately.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Fifty-seven members of the Karawang-Bekasi Islamic
Students Union (HMI) packed the local council chamber Wednesday,
demanding Bekasi regent Mochammad Djamhari resign.
	   The students also asked the council to reject Djamhari's
nomination to be a candidate in November's election for the next
two-year term as regent.
	   According to the union's chairman, Nurul Sumarheni, Djamhari is
thought to be guilty of numerous corruption, collusion and nepotism
violations during his tenure, as reported in many media.
	   ``We need a clean figure,'' Nurul said as quoted by Antara.
	   In a response to the students' demand, the local council
speaker, Wikanda Darmawijaya, said that Djamhari's tenure would
last until Nov. 9 and he has submitted a letter to the council
saying that he would not register his name for the upcoming Bekasi
regent election.
	   Djamhari, who arrived two hours after the meeting between the
councilors and protesters, was deserted by the students as soon as
he tried to defend himself.
	   ``We've been waiting for him for too long. We've given all our
demands to the council members so there's no use talking with
him,'' said one of the students. (bsr)

	   SAWANGAN, Bogor (JP): A three-day celebration of World
Environment Day began yesterday in Cinangka subdistrict in Sawangan
with a personal account of how a community can return to nature to
meet its needs.
	   The event involving artists and local residents was hosted on
the first day by radio broadcaster Debra H. Yatim at her home.
Debra, who is also the deputy with the Komseni public relations
group, is coorganizing the event with the Indonesian Performance
Arts Society (MSPI) and the Ford Foundation, among others.
	   Activities will include musical shows, poetry reading and the
planting of rare fruit seeds.
	   Dialog participants yesterday included former environment
minister Emil Salim and musician Jalu Pratidina.
	   Debra told of her involvement with residents to improve their
environment and enhance their personal welfare.
	   She said the village, despite its official registration of 70
percent farmers, only had three residents doing actual farming
before her project began.
	   ``They were ashamed to call themselves farmers'' because of the
country's larger priority on industry.
	   Privately owned tracts of land in the village measuring up to
one hectare lay overrun with tall grass, weeds and snakes for about
a quarter century.
	   Debra said she called up the landowners and asked their
permission for residents to grow plants on them for free.
	   ``People cannot rely on the government anymore for food,'' Debra
said was her argument.
	   The owners agreed and eventually 10 people worked on the land.
	   ``First, we planted groundnut seeds. The seeds ate away the
roots of the weeds. We harvested the crops after three months and
planted cash crops like green pepper, lettuce and everything you
put in the ordinary salad.
	   ``After six months, farmers can eat the food they grow. It took
me only Rp 900,000 in all for the buying of seeds and clearing of
weeds and grass.''
	   She said residents opted for fertilizers made of organic waste
from their kitchens rather than expensive chemical-based ones.
Youngsters joined in helping make the fertilizers.
	   Debra added that subdistrict residents were also involved in
making recycled paper, for which there was already a sizable
market.
	   ``A hotel will demand 1,000 papers a day.''
	   Given the condition of the country's economy, she said the
efforts were ``the best that can be done today''. (ylt)

	   JAKARTA (JP): Councilors yesterday urged the city administration
to stop dragging its heels and force PT Catur Swasakti Utama, a
subsidiary of the widely-diversified Bakrie group, to fulfill the
terms of a land exchange deal with the city.
	   The councilors said the company, which developed Taman Rasuna
Apartments in Kuningan, South Jakarta, had yet to begin projects to
replace a nursing home and two primary schools demolished when
construction of the apartments began in 1994.
	   Ida Mawaddah Noor from Commission E for social welfare said the
city administration must ensure that the developers fulfilled their
obligation.
	   ``The administration may bring the company to court if they do
not settle the problem,'' she said.
	   Under the terms of the deal, the company was required to provide
the city with a 5,322 square meter plot and build a nursing home on
a 10,000 square meter plot of land to compensate for demolishing
Menteng Atas nursing home.
	   The company, she said, had frequently ignored invitations to
discuss the matter with the administration and had also claimed it
would be unable to begin work on the project while the monetary
crisis persisted.
	   ``I think the company management never had any intention of
keeping their side of the bargain.
	   ``They have taken the administration's assets and given nothing
in return but empty promises,'' Ida added.
	   Fellow councilor Nitra Arsyad said the swap deal had resulted in
great losses to the city.
	   ``The company received city assets and profited from the sale of
apartments but gave the city nothing in exchange,'' he said.
	   ``I think the administration has been robbed. It was a polite
robbery because it was done by well-groomed people,'' Nitra added.
	   No Bakrie executives could be reached for comment last night.
	   The company has been involved in numerous disputes with the city
administration since the apartment project began.
	   The planned development consists of two complexes with a total
of 27 towers. Unit prices range between Rp 125 million and Rp 900
million. The first complex of 16 towers and 3,850 units was
completed early last year. Most apartments have been bought by
expatriates.
	   The administration instructed the company to suspend demolition
of buildings on the site in August 1994 because it had not yet
obtained the necessary permits, the councilors said.
	   But the company ignored the protests and pressed ahead with the
work, Ida added.
	   ``They even demolished parts of the primary schools during
teaching hours,'' she said.
	   Nitra said the city administration had penalized the company for
violating construction regulations.
	   The penalty imposed required the company to build a junior high
school worth Rp 900 million in Cipulir and develop a mosque worth
Rp 400 billion in Petukangan Utara, both in South Jakarta.
	   ``Neither of these projects have begun,'' he said.
	   The councilors also questioned why the administration was so
reluctant to force the firm to fulfill its obligations.
	   ``There might be collusion between the company and officials in
the administration,'' he said. (cst)

Harmoko to call a general election for next year showed they were
insensitive to realities of the country's crisis.
	   ``They have failed to show a sense of crisis,'' Emil said in a
discussion held at the Atma Jaya University. The time set by
Habibie's government for the poll, despite public clamoring for an
earlier date, merely prolonged the uncertainty which had gripped
the country since the resignation of president Soeharto, he added.
	   ``Habibie has said his government is transitional in nature,
that means it must be brief. It must not exist too long since the
market is wondering when the government which is not transitional
will come,'' Emil told about 150 participants of the discussion.
	   ``But, unfortunately, my friends (Habibie and Harmoko) don't
understand that it's a crisis.''
	   Emil called for a general election to be held in December this
year, and for a general session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) to elect a president and vice president in February
next year.
	   Habibie's government, whose legitimacy is still doubted by many,
has kept the market teetering, Emil said, reflected by the rupiah's
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar which still lingered above
10,000.
	   ``The market has yet to see any sign of certainty from the
government,'' according to Emil. He believed the rupiah's weak
exchange rate was now due to a political, not economic, crisis.
	   Emil's view was shared by former transmigration minister Siswono
Yudohusodo, who spoke at a separate discussion on reforms and
business at the Prasetya Mulya Management Institute here yesterday.
	   Siswono said Habibie's government should realize how critical
the situation was, and take action accordingly, including by
holding the general election.
	   Siswono said too much time had been wasted since the economic
crisis began to hit the country in June last year.
	   ``(Now) it's not the question of whether or not you agree with
Habibie, or whether or not you like Habibie,'' he said.
	   Siswono described how difficult it was for Habibie's government
to get the full support of the people, but the national predicament
could not be overcome without this backing.
	   ``When people no longer trust their government, they would be
vulnerable to rumors that could easily lead them to rush banks and
purchase foreign exchange in large quantities,'' he said.
	   Just like Thailand and South Korea, he said, Indonesia now
needed a new government with legitimacy, ``one that people can
trust to cope with the crisis''.
	   Emil suggested that Habibie work to win people's trust by
establishing an independent election team comprising
representatives from political parties that would contest the
elections, as well as from non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
	   Emil said he, together with other opposition figures such as
Moslem leaders Amien Rais and Abdurrahman Wahid, had given Habibie
six months to prepare the elections.
	   ``Don't use people's suffering as an excuse for politicking. I,
Amien Rais and Gus Dur have agreed to give Habibie six months, not
until the end of 1999,'' Emil told journalists after the Atma Jaya
discussion.
	   Emil reiterated that changing the current political laws on
political parties, elections and the structure and position of the
People's Consultative Assembly and the House of Representatives
could be completed by the end of this month.
	   He said Habibie could use his extra presidential power allowed
by No. 5/1998 MPR decree to change the laws if necessary. (aan)

Serb police beat protesters in Pristina; KLA seeks more help

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police used clubs Sunday to
beat and disperse protesters at a rally for Kosovo's independence,
and ethnic Albanian officials said dozens of people were injured.
	   Dozens of plainclothes policemen joined about 100 in uniforms to
violently break up the demonstration by ethnic Albanians in
Pristina, capital of the secessionist province of Serbia where
ethnic Albanians comprise a 9-to-1 majority.
	   At least half a dozen ralliers received serious body injuries,
according to the Kosovo Information Center.
	   The unexpected violence in Pristina came as Serbian forces
pressed their fierce offensive against militants in western Kosovo,
where shelling reportedly continued Sunday.
	   The stepped-up campaign launched in late May has left at least
50 people dead and 200 missing, according to ethnic Albanian
officials, in addition to sending thousands fleeing from ruined
villages.
	   Pristina itself has remained largely free of violence despite
months of clashes this year between Serbs trying to assert their
control over the province and the self-described Kosovo Liberation
Army, made up of ethnic Albanians who want to drive Serb
``occupiers'' out.
	   But on Sunday, seemingly without warning, police charged the
approximately 1,000 protesters gathered for the 57th consecutive
daily rally against the Serbs' violent rule in Kosovo.
	   One protester could be seen bleeding in the street after he was
hit in the head by a policeman's gun butt and then kicked
repeatedly.
	   It was the first beating of protesters in Kosovo since March,
when thousands of ethnic Albanians were attacked for protesting
against an earlier crackdown by government forces on the KLA.
	   Albanian TV in Tirana reported that the Serbs shelled at least
two Kosovo villages Sunday. It also said ethnic Albanian militants
blew up the police headquarters in Ratkoc, and amid fierce fighting
between the two sides all the Serb residents and police had fled.
	   It is not clear how much of a setback the Serb offensive has
dealt Kosovo's clandestine rebel army, which claims to control some
40 percent of the southern province of Yugoslavia's Republic of
Serbia, and which enjoys growing popularity.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army appealed in a statement published
Sunday in the newspaper Koha Ditore for more ethnic Albanians to
join them and ``fight for freedom'' from Serbian forces.
	   ``Come to strengthen our troops against the enemy artillery and
enemy infantry,'' the KLA statement said.
	   It appealed ``for the last time'' to ethnic Albanian political
organizations to give up their policy of a peaceful struggle for
independence and join the KLA.
	   Western powers oppose Kosovo's bid for independence, fearing the
consequences of another border change in the volatile Balkans, but
want the Serbs to cease their offensive and give Kosovo the
autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989.
	   The offensive that began in late May has stirred increasing
international concern and fears of igniting a wider war in the
Balkans. The United States is expected to reimpose sanctions
against Serbia after a White House meeting on Monday.
	   On Sunday, Pope John Paul II called on the world to act against
violence and repression in Kosovo.
	   ``Not far from us, in Kosovo, violent options, repression and
the flight of peoples must not leave the international community
inert,'' he said at the Vatican. The violence, the pope said,
``recalls the tragic recent history of the Balkans.''
	   The exodus of more than 10,000 Albanians into Albania last week,
and another 7,000 to 10,000 into the neighboring Yugoslav republic
of Montenegro, also has stirred worry in the West.
	   In Germany, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told the Welt am
Sonntag newspaper his country is afraid of being flooded with
refugees, so it is working with international refugee agencies to
assist them in the Balkans. About 400,000 ethnic Albanians already
live in Germany.
	   While the United Nations has condemned the Serbs for atrocities,
the Serbs say the KLA has forced entire Serb villages to flee and
is brutally targeting Serb civilians and pro-Serb Albanians. On
Sunday, the pro-Serb Media Center reported the discovery of the
mutilated corpse of an Albanian loyal to federal authorities, with
head and both arms cut off.

	   At first glance, it would difficult to find two cultures further
apart than those of Indonesia and Sweden. Most Swedes like to say
what's on their mind, while Indonesians prefer to avoid such a
direct approach. Most Swedes find that everything in Indonesia
takes time, while most Indonesians accept such a system that,
although slow, is successful.
	   Such comparisons are very simple, and one cannot conclude that
the two countries have nothing in common. Like Sweden, Indonesia
considers itself a fully fledged member of the international
community. Strong in the wider international field, yet aligned
with one ``super power'' or another. Strong in the respective
regional community, yet never forcing ideas on others.
	   Last year, the Indonesian-Swedish Association (ISA) celebrated
its 10th anniversary. On August 19, 1987, ISA was formed by a group
of Indonesians who had obtained university degrees or worked with
Swedish companies in Sweden and Swedes residing in Indonesia to
promote and strengthen relations in the widest sense between the
two countries in many fields, for the benefit of both. What ISA was
looking for was individual characteristics that would provide it
with insights of Indonesia and Sweden.
	   ISA's plans include having strong cooperation with the
Swedish-Indonesian Society (SIS) and the Swedish-Indonesian Society
of Trade and Commerce (SISTC) in Sweden, creating good relations
between Indonesia and Sweden.
	   The areas being promoted are: business and technology, culture,
nature and geography, travel and tourism, education and sport.
	   For business and technology, ISA will arrange visits to Swedish
and Indonesian companies both in Indonesia and Sweden. It will also
arrange business contacts for Indonesian companies offering their
products to Sweden or looking for Swedish partners.
	   ISA will arrange contacts in cooperation with the Swedish
Embassy in Jakarta and the Indonesian Embassy in Stockholm. ISA
will, among others, provide information to Swedish people seeking
information regarding Indonesian government regulations on foreign
investment.
	   ISA can be contacted through its Secretariat, c/o PT Tira
Austenite at telephone number 4602594 and fax number 4602593.

Algerian seeks political asylum in Spain

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An Algerian has asked Spain for political
asylum after fleeing his country with a military helicopter Sunday,
the Foreign Ministry said.
	   The Algerian, whose name was not released by the Ministry, filed
his request on Sunday after landing in the Mediterranean tourist
resort island of Ibiza. His petition will be reviewed by the
Ministry of Interior in the next few months, Joaquin Perez
Villanueva, a foreign ministry spokesman.
	   Perez said he could not give more details because asylum
petitions are confidential. Spain would return the helicopter, he
said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Bandung artists are doing their part in helping to
patch up strained race relations. To help raise awareness about
victims of the May riots, most of whom were Chinese-Indonesians,
they are scheduling performances at Festival Ganesha '98 today.
	   The event at Jl. Ganesha, Bandung, starts at 3:15 p.m. and
features Sundanese arts led by artist Aida Liem.
	   Yesterday's schedule included the barongsay, the performance of
a dragon-like creature which originated from China. Every year,
local governments banned lavish Chinese New Year's celebration and
consequently barongsay, which used to highlight the festival.
	   But in several areas barongsay is a traditional feature of
sea-offering ceremonies and used to wake up people for the dawn
breakfast during the Moslem holy month of Ramadhan.
	   Organizers, including ethnomusicologist Endo Suanda and
installation artist Herry Dim, say the blurred origins of these
arts were proof that ordinary ``natives'' and ``non-natives''
(Chinese-Indonesians) had share close cultural ties close for a
long time.
	   They blamed past ``political engineering'' for contributing to
the social gap which in turn easily flared the May riots.
	   In a letter made available here, Herry said the event was
organized with the Indonesian Youth Committee for Eradication of
Racial Discrimination. (anr)

	   In September 1997 I sent a letter to Post Office Box 5000
(established by former vice president Try Sutrisno to handle
complaints of corruption) about ongoing problems expatriates were
having with a high-level immigration official in Medan. Neither the
office handling the Box 5000 complaints nor the Directorate General
of Immigration ever responded, not even to ask me for further data
to support my complaint. So I welcome the fact that Mr. Ghani has
replied to my references of corruption.
	   This is an opportunity for Minister of Justice Muladi to
demonstrate how serious the reform government is about
investigating complaints of corruption, collusion and nepotism
(KKN) honestly, and how professionally and objectively complaints
will be investigated under his jurisdiction. Will evidence be
weighed impartially by disinterested parties? Will a reasonable
standard of proof be used, rather than a legalistic or absolutistic
standard? Will complainants or witnesses be protected against
retaliation? To be effective, any bona fide investigation of public
wrongdoing must carry an assurance that complainants will not be
penalized for honest ``whistle-blowing''.
	   On Oct. 27, 1997 the U.S. Embassy sent several officials to
Medan to meet with American citizens about this very problem
(immigration corruption). Individuals spoke freely to the embassy
officers about payoffs they had been asked to make to immigration
and police officials. It seems clear that in an amenable forum, one
that is free from the threat of retaliation, people will report
corruption openly and in detail.
	   Since Mr. Ghani has extended a public challenge to me, may I
offer one also? As he surely realizes, some of those who have paid
protection money -- it can only be called that -- to immigration
officials to avoid more prolonged harassment or deportation, may be
reluctant to be identified, for fear of retaliation by those or
other officials in the future. Is the minister of justice, through
Mr. Ghani, willing to ensure that individuals or companies will not
be penalized later for information they give during an official
investigation? If the director general of immigration is really
serious about getting to the facts, let him go out on a limb as
much as Mr. Ghani has asked me to do, by promising protection from
retaliation to those whose names I am being asked to provide. I
respectfully request that minister Muladi promises this promptly
and publicly as an encouragement to others to bear honest witness
to KKN.
	   Is Mr. Ghani's attention focused on combating corruption, or on
combating me? His letter suggests that he may be more interested in
discrediting or discouraging those who comment on corruption, than
in learning what goes on in the immigration offices in North
Sumatra and elsewhere. If others are approached for information
with the same tone, I wonder who will have enough confidence to
speak freely? I could be wrong, but the tone of Mr. Ghani's letter
also suggests to me that he believes I am deliberately making this
all up about immigration corruption, from some malicious motive.
Ironically, one column removed from Mr. Ghani's June 3 letter was
one from a Mr. Manfred Weber of Jakarta, in which he commented,
``As long as the corresponding regulations are being misused by
Indonesian immigration staff to squeeze people for money...'' Dare
I say, I rest my case?
	   I will give Mr. Ghani the data that I sent to Box 5000. The
information is an open secret in Medan, and should be a sufficient
basis to begin a proper investigation here. The allegations I have
made are verifiable. Perhaps Mr. Weber and other readers will also
report their problems to Mr. Ghani.
	   Readers familiar with Indonesia will need to judge for
themselves whether my reluctance to be baited by Mr. Ghani is
evidence that my remarks on corruption are baseless and without
credibility.

	   It was like a whiff of fresh air to note that an awareness is
being created by antismoking campaigners to cleanse the body and
mind of this nation's tobacco smokers, both the active and the
passive ones.
	   News reports say that this country has the dubious distinction
of being the world's fourth-least aware smokers, after China, the
United States and Japan, when it comes to realizing the bad effects
of smoking on a person's health.
	   Strike while the iron is hot says an English proverb. The recent
change in this nation's political arena, which was considered,
hitherto, as unimaginable, has proven the strength and power of the
united students and an awakened mass. Why don't we harness the
energy of the same students to achieve a cleaner, healthier and
more beautifully green country, that has been a land of our dreams.
	   With the country reeling under an unprecedented economic crisis,
time could not be more opportune to educate the masses of this
nation about the need to stop smoking, thereby improving the
quality of their life, as also that of their near and dear ones.
The students could help spread the message in rural areas too.

World Cup: Scots say underdog role a boost against Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-REMY-DE-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Scotland relishes the role
of underdog against defending champion Brazil and will be spurred
on by doubters in the World Cup opener Wednesday, manager Craig
Brown said Sunday.
	   ``The persecution complex suits the Scots. The mentality we have
is 'we will show them,''' Brown said before Scotland's workout
Sunday in their south of France training venue, a session that was
closed to the news media.
	   Scotland and Brazil meet Wednesday at Stade de France outside
Paris in the opening game of the month-long France 98 tournament.
Brown acknowledged that the Scots will have to be in peak form, but
said he was sure they would be up to the challenge.
	   The Scots are accustomed to ``pressure games and big crowds. My
team will not be unnerved by Brazil,'' the manager declared.
	   Striker Gordon Durie said he knew exactly what Scotland must do
to overcome Brazil: ``We must go for the throat.''
	   The Rangers star was on the bench eight years ago when Brazil
beat Scotland 1-0 in the World Cup in Italy. Many people have
written off the Scots at this World Cup, and Durie said he wants to
prove them wrong by pulling off what would be a huge upset.
	   ``We have to attack Brazil in much the same way as they will try
and do,'' Durie said. ``If we sit in and try and defend, then they
have the players who can destroy you.''
	   While stressing that Scotland aimed to disprove the odds, Brown
acknowledged that Brazil was a strong bet to advance to the latter
stages of the World Cup, along with Germany and Spain. Of host
France, he said, ``they will be under a lot of pressure.''
	   Along with Brazil, Scotland has Group A first-round matches with
Morocco and Norway.

	   Chinese-Indonesians are often blamed for an assortment of things
and become the scapegoats whenever anything goes wrong. They are
the easiest target because they are a minority. In normal
circumstances, the not so kind sentiment toward the ethnic Chinese
remains hidden. But in a difficult situation where life becomes
increasingly hard and people get frustrated, the hatred, prejudice
and jealousy that normally stays buried in many native Indonesians
start coming to the surface and run wild without control.
	   I agree with Peter Fanning's comments in his letter of June 4.
The media should wisely create an atmosphere of unity and
understanding among ethnic groups instead of encouraging biased
sentiments to develop.
	   Ethnic Chinese as well as any other ethnic groups that make up
the Indonesian population deserve legal protection. Every citizen
has the right to have a sense of security in the country where
he/she lives. When ethnic Chinese find themselves being victimized,
and their physical safety being threatened and endangered, they
have every right to flee to save their lives. It is logical as well
as in accordance with human rights.
	   Or is the horrible scene of ethnic Chinese being helplessly
victimized, neglected, having their achievements of a lifetime and
hard work destroyed, their shops and houses looted and burned down,
is that what people would like to see?
	   No matter what justification a person seems to think there may
be, it is very indecent and incorrect for us to allow or tolerate
any violent actions against innocent people.
	   In a time of crisis, blaming each other will only make the
country even more vulnerable. While everyone seems to be calling
for reform in every aspect, will there be any room for reform in
the attitude toward and treatment of the ethnic Chinese minority
here?

	   I am writing in response to Sumarsono Sastrowardoyo's letter of
May 30. Mr. Sumarsono prefers to blame the victim rather than look
in the mirror and realize that because of people with an attitude
like his, Indonesia is a country where the ethnic minority is
systematically persecuted and lives under the constant threat of
racial terror.
	   First, it needs to be stated that many Chinese-Indonesians did
not leave the country before the riots broke out, and we all know
the consequences they suffered. Rampaging mobs stopped cars and
motorcycles, and if the passengers were ethnic Chinese, the
vehicles were burned on the spot and the passengers beaten.
	   Reports of rape of Chinese-Indonesian women by rioters are also
widespread. Many ruko (shop-house) were ransacked and burned.
Unfortunately, in such a building the owner and his family often
inhabit the top floor, and if rioters set the bottom floor ablaze
we can only wonder at the fate of its inhabitants trapped on the
top floor. Even private residences were not exempt in last month's
rioting, with whole housing complexes being invaded and ransacked
by mobs.
	   It is easy to see why Chinese-Indonesians would try to escape in
a crisis. They are discriminated against on every level of
government and society. Differentiated from ``natives'' by their
identification card numbers, they must pay extra legal fees to
process even the simplest of documents. They are subject to
restrictive quotas by government as well as private universities
and excluded from employment in the civil service and the Armed
Forces. Is it any wonder that they choose to become entrepreneurs?
	   The differentiation between native and nonnative is especially
ironic considering that some of Indonesia's most famous citizens on
the international level, such as Onghokham, Kwik Kian Gie and Susi
Susanti, are of Chinese descent but they still have to suffer from
this double standard.
	   I think that in the spirit of reform it is time that all
Indonesians contemplate the true meaning of the concepts of human
rights and democracy as well as how to apply them universally and
fairly to all layers and segments of society, including ethnic
Chinese. Until this society does so, real democracy and genuinely
universal human rights will remain an elusive dream and innocent
people will continue to be persecuted.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Just like water gushing forth when a clogged tap
is suddenly opened, the people's craving to set up political
parties is at the height of its intensity.
	   In less than two weeks, at least nine groups have turned into
political parties. The Musyawarah Kekeluargaan Gotong Royong (MKGR)
has declared itself a political party, followed by Partai Karya
Ulama Indonesia (the Indonesian Ulemas Functional Party). The two
groups were previously affiliated to the ruling political grouping
Golkar.
	   They have been followed by Partai Syarikat Islam Indonesia (the
Indonesian Islamic Association Party), formerly part of the United
Development Party (PPP). There is a plan to set up Partai Pekerja
Indonesia (the Indonesian Workers Party). Sri Bintang, meanwhile,
will proceed with his Partai Uni Demokrasi Indonesia (Indonesian
Democratic Union Party) which was illegal under Soeharto's
administration.
	   Other names are also emerging on the list of new political
parties.
	   For over 20 years, the people have been familiar only with three
political parties: a very powerful government party, Golkar and two
other minor parties, the PPP which in the last two years has taken
over the mantle of the main opposition, and the Indonesian
Democratic Party, which is at present badly fragmented.
	   The people actually have only a little understanding about
political parties in the sense that the existing parties still have
to express themselves in a way conforming to the public's demands.
The logical consequence of community members joining a political
party is that both sides -- the public and the parties -- now
assume responsibility.
	   The party will fight for the people's aspirations, listen to
their complaints and even make itself a vehicle to pressure the
government with respect to its own interests. In return, party
members will vote for their party in elections.
	   However, how have political parties fared in recent times? Have
they gained recognition by listening to the public's aspirations,
fighting for their interests and becoming pressure groups?
	   In the latest elections and the General Session of the People's
Consultative Assembly in March 1998, political parties cheated the
people rather than represented them.
	   The public's appeal for a change of leadership was dismissed by
political parties which simply maintained the status quo. When the
era of reform was ushered in by the students, the existing
political parties suddenly claimed that they were also instrumental
behind changing the political landscape.
	   It is clear these parties are rapidly becoming obsolete. The
more conservative they become the quicker people will abandon them.
	   The ball of reform will continue rolling, thanks to the student
movement, which emerged uncontaminated by an interest in power and
forced Soeharto to step down.
	   The emergence of new political parties is an interesting
phenomenon. There are worries that it signifies the return to
sectarian politics that will lead to political instability as in
the 1950s.
	   For sure a party will take, as its point of departure, its main
constituent, for example a religious group. One can find in
Indonesian history since early this century that there have always
been groups acting on behalf of religious groups.
	   However, in this case efforts must be made to maintain the
balance between the interests of a group of people as party
exponents and those of broad segments of the community. The
upcoming elections will tell whether or not parties of this type
will succeed in recruiting large numbers of supporters.
	   As for those who are worried that the 1950s political
instability will return, one must first bear in mind that there are
at least two factors distinguishing the situation in the 1950s from
that of the late 1990s.
	   First, the national education level is much higher now than in
the 1950s. Despite the economic difficulties, the people have
become more critical in deciding which values are really essential
to hold on to. The decision now is to choose between political
parties or basic commodities.
	   Second, the people are still stumbling through the hangover of
political emasculation. A more profound survey must be conducted to
find out whether broad segments of the public are really
enthusiastic about setting up political parties.
	   It may well be that this is only the aspiration of certain
circles, say, the middle class, who have long drawn up a certain
political agenda, be it in the interests of social welfare or in
pursuit of power.
	   Furthermore, in the 1950s the many political parties did not
necessarily lead to frequent riots, violence or even murder of
political rivals. Indonesia's first election in 1995 was the most
democratic one ever. Disputes took place elegantly through writing
discourses and in the parliament without any side resorting to
rallying criminal mobs or inciting destruction. The atmosphere of a
festivity, the New Order rhetoric, was indeed fully experienced in
this first general election.
	   Nevertheless, one must place hope in the newly emerging parties.
They can be expected to listen more closely to the
public'scomplaints and aspirations and should not simply sell their
ideals in the pursuit of power.
	   What is urgently needed now is a party oriented toward the
creation of a more democratic community with social justice, one
that defends the interests of workers and is characterized with
better respect for human rights, for laws and fair trials and also
for the environment.
	   In any case, as researchers at the National Institute of
Sciences have stated, elections are tests of a party's
acceptability and vehicles for the circulation of the political
elite.
	   Political leadership is not a given privilege of a particular
group, but rather the result of hard-won trust from the people
through earnest efforts to listen to their aspirations.
	   Parties or groups of people considering themselves capable of
being involved in a fair competition will have an equal in it.
	   When they do all these things, the political leaders will be
providing the community with political education which is pure and
the public will become politically mature.
	   It is also at this juncture that the rich potential of the
nation, perhaps only buried all these years, will show itself and
be put to a test, leaving finally only new figures sincerely
concerned with the interests of broad, not simply limited, groups
of people.
	   In the end, the nation will act as the fair judge over the
latest turn of events. In its own way, it will express its own
interest and trust in the latest twist of political events.
Obsolete figures who have considerably harmed the interests of the
people need no longer be praised and those who have neglected their
own people will deserve condemnation.
	   As for the new leaders, people will soon find out who is capable
of keeping price increases in check and making basic necessities
readily available.
	   The writer is the chairman of the Jakarta-based Institute for
Press and Development Studies.
	   Window: The emergence of new political parties is an interesting
phenomenon. There are worries that it signifies the return to
sectarian politics that will lead to political instability as in
the 1950s.

	   Barring any major political turmoil and massive social unrest
until an elected government is installed sometime next year to
replace the transitional Habibie administration, the agreement on
the rescheduling of US$80 billion in Indonesian corporate foreign
debt will contribute to gradually strengthening the rupiah's
exchange rate.
	   The immediate impact would be reduced pressures on the rupiah as
debtors will not have to service their foreign debts during the
three-year grace period.
	   Under the agreement, hammered out in marathon talks in Frankfurt
on Thursday, Indonesian companies will be offered foreign exchange
protection and assurance as to the availability of foreign exchange
from a special government-backed agency -- the Indonesian Debt
Restructuring Agency (INDRA). This agency will assume the full
exchange rate risks of dollar-denominated debt repayments but will
not provide any bailout of the private debts. Therefore, the
viability of the scheme depends on a strengthened rupiah. If the
rupiah falls further, the government or INDRA may be left with
massive liabilities.
	   Debtors will be able to make their payments in rupiah to INDRA,
which will repay the debts in foreign currencies. Participants in
INDRA will be entitled to buy U.S. dollars at the best real 20-day
average market exchange rate occurring from the date the program
becomes operational until June 30, 1999.
	   True, the agreement between the Indonesian private debt
negotiation team and international bank creditors created only a
general framework for corporate debt restructuring, within which
Indonesian debtors and creditors will have still to work on a
case-by-case basis.
	   But the creditors' agreement to reschedule $60 billion in
corporate debts for eight years, including a three-year grace
period, and to rollover short-term banking debts up to four years
will sharply curb the demand for dollars, thereby reducing the
pressures on the rupiah.
	   Indonesian debtor companies, many of which are export oriented,
will get some breathing space to consolidate their operations and
restore production and exports to precrisis levels.
	   The export industry will get another boost from the agreement as
it also includes the reopening of trade finance lines for
Indonesian companies. This will reinvigorate imports of industrial
basic materials, so far hindered by the international refusal of
letters of credit issued by Indonesian banks, and revive
international trade and economic activity.
	   The corporate debt scheme will reduce Indonesian external
payments over the next few years and provide corporations with
substantial initial cash flow relief, thus giving them an
opportunity to recover from the current crisis, which has made many
companies technically bankrupt.
	   It is obviously too early to judge the foreign exchange market
reaction to the debt rescheduling deal which will become effective
on Aug. 1. But its initial impact on the process of regaining
international confidence in the country's economy is relatively
positive.
	   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said upon
learning of the agreement on Thursday that they would soon restart
Indonesia's $43 billion international rescue package. The World
Bank said its board would consider releasing up to $1 billion to
help reform Indonesia's battered economy perhaps in the coming two
weeks.
	   We should remember, though, that the debt-rescheduling agreement
is only one component of the multifaceted program to strengthen the
rupiah's rate from about 11,500 to the American dollar now,
compared to 2,400 last July, in order to lead the beleaguered
economy out of its present crisis. The crucial structural reforms,
including the painful measures of phasing out subsidies on food,
fuel and electricity, as stipulated in the agreement with the IMF,
have to be carried out during the three-year bailout program.
	   Of no lesser challenge is that these measures have to be
implemented simultaneously with overall political reform to set up
a clean and strong government that is trusted by the people and the
international market.

	   WARE, England (AP) _ Lee Westwood, encouraged by his new-found
putting stroke, won his second straight European Tour event when he
closed the English Open with a 4-under-par 68 for a two-stroke
victory Sunday.
	   The Englishman, a 25-year-old Ryder Cup player, finished
17-under at 271. Olle Karlsson of Sweden, who shot a 66, and
Australian Greg Chalmers, who had a 69, wound up tied for second
after 72 holes at the Marriott Hanbury Manor course.
	   ``It's just clicked recently and I'm holing a few putts, which I
wasn't before,'' said Westwood, whose win also moved him atop the
European money list for the first time in his career.
	   ``Life couldn't be better right now,'' he added. ``I'm just on a
wave and trying to ride it.''
	   Westwood, who won last week in the TPC of Europe in Hamburg,
Germany, is 40-under par in his last eight rounds and playing as
well as anyone in the world right now.
	   He left immediately after the win to fly to the United States
for this week's Buick Classic in Rye, New York, and the U.S. Open
the following week in San Francisco.
	   ``I set goals and it's nice to keep ticking them off,'' he said.
``The next one has to be a major. I seem to be playing well enough
and I'm looking forward to what is sure to be a tough and tight
course (in the U.S. Open).
	   ``That suits me, I think. Mind you, I think most courses are
suiting me at the moment.''
	   Westwood, who led Chalmers by one stroke after three rounds,
trailed him by two with 11 holes to play on Sunday. But he birdied
four of the next six holes, dropped a 30-foot par-saving putt on
the 16th, and then got home safely on the final two holes.
	   On Saturday, the Australian lefthander shot a course-record
11-under par 61 to get into contention.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Former City Police chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata
visited the 17 suspects of the Trisakti shooting incident at
Military Police Headquarters in Guntur, South Jakarta, yesterday to
give them his support.
	   The 17 officers are scheduled to face a military tribunal today
for their alleged involvement in the shootings which killed four
Trisakti University students during a demonstration on May 12.
	   ``How are you doing, son?'' Hamami asked one of the officers,
First Lt. Agus. ``I'm fine, sir,'' the man replied.
	   ``How's your family?'' Agus answered: ``Fine, but my wife is due
to give birth soon, sir.''
	   Hamami then hugged the officer and said: ``You have to be
strong. God bless you.
	   ``Remember, you have to take care of yourself. Your fight is
still to come. Be honest, be true to yourself. Dare to live.
	   ``I know that being a cop is not an easy thing. We are soldiers.
We can and we must survive through this. No matter how hard the
trials and burdens are, we have to live with them,'' he said.
	   The detained security personnel, in obvious low spirits, seemed
to try to put a good face on the situation as the general walked
around and greeted them.
	   The 17 men, detained since last Saturday, have been identified
as first lieutenants AH, WR, SR and ATH; second lieutenants PY, EKS
and BY; second sergeants DP, JE, TI, AY, CN and PD; and privates
ST, SP, LS and IM.
	   Joining yesterday's 30-minute visit were Jakarta Military Police
Commander Col. Hendardji, City Police spokesman Lt. Col. E.
Aritonang, City Police On-the-Alert Unit commander Col. Arthur
Damanik, City Police Internal Affairs Chief Lt. Col. Mustafa and
City Police Law Agency Chief Col. Iman Sardjono.
	   West Jakarta Police Chief Lt. Col. Timur Pradopo, who is also
charged over the same incident, was not among the 17 men detained
at Guntur.
	   When asked about Timur's whereabouts, Hendardji refused to
comment. ``I'm not answering this one question,'' he said with a
smile.
	   Hendardji said today's hearing would be the first of a series of
hearings open to the public in the court-martial, which could last
up to two months.
	   A reliable source said that the lawyers defending the suspects
included Adnan Buyung Nasution, O.C. Kaligis, Otto Hasibuan, Moh.
Assegaff, Rudhy A. Lontoh, Hotman Paris Hutapea, Denny Kailimang
and Purwaning Yanuar. (edt)

World Cup: Romania arrives with Colombia on its mind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) _ Tired but upbeat, the Romanian national team
arrived in France on Sunday for the World Cup, still focusing on
its opener against Colombia.
	   ``We're in a good mood. Our players are well prepared and
optimistic, despite some problems which we hope we'll be able to
fix before our first game against Colombia'' on June 15, coach
Anghel Iordanescu said.
	   The 22-man side and officials looked tired and upset after the
flight from Bucharest to Toulouse, and their longer-than-expected
bus rid to Albi, 80 kilometers (50 miles) away.
	   Romanian captain and playmaker Gheorghe Hagi waved away
reporters.
	   ``Just leave me alone,'' he said. ``I won't make any statements
for now.''
	   La Reserve Hotel welcomed the team with colorful posters in both
French and Romanian, while stringent security measures failed to
keep three local dogs from roaming the premises and between
reporters' legs.
	   The team arrived without Atletico Madrid defender Daniel Prodan,
who was unable to recover from a left knee injury last month.
	   ``We don't have an adequate substitute for the central marking
defender, which was Prodan's role,'' said Adalbert Kassai, general
secretary of the Romanian Football Federation.
	   He would not say who would replace Prodan, but Iordanescu has
called up Cristian Dulca, who plays for Rapid Bucharest in the
Romanian first division.
	   ``Our first game against Colombia will be the most important for
us. The Colombian players want to avenge their loss, 3-1, at the
'94 World Cup and will spare no efforts to do that,'' Kassai said.
	   All the other players were reported fit, he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Dozens of activists from non-governmental
organization Pijar Indonesia, took over the Semanggi 2 toll road
entrance gate yesterday afternoon because they thought it was
operated by Soeharto's eldest daughter.
	   After a 30-minute occupation of the gate, during which they
allowed an enormous flow of cars to pass through without paying,
the protesters were finally informed that the toll road on Jl.
Gatot Subroto in South Jakarta was in fact run by state-owned
operator PT Jasa Marga.
	   The activists had thought it was managed by PT Citra Marga
Nusapala Persada (CMNP), a privately run toll road construction
company owned by former president Soeharto's daughter, Siti
Hardijanti Rukmana, who is widely known as Tutut.
	   They initially demanded that the government hand over the
management from CMNP to Jasa Marga until they learned that they had
gone to the wrong place.
	   ``We have come to the wrong address. But the most important
thing is the symbolic meaning of our action today, that we want all
toll roads to be fully handled by the state-owned company,'' said
Kuldip Singh, coordinator of the protesters.
	   According to Adityawarman from Jasa Marga, Tutut's company
manages toll roads that link Kebon Nanas in Tangerang and Tanjung
Priok and Jembatan Tiga in North Jakarta.
	   Jasa Marga manages the routes from Cawang, Pluit and the Prof.
Sediyatmo Toll Road to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport,
Adityawarman said.
	   He did not disclose the operators of the other toll roads that
circle the capital.
	   Yesterday's rally started at about 3 p.m. when the activists
marched 500 meters from a bus stop in front of Menara Mulia office
building to the entrance gate.
	   They waved banners that read ``Free the tollway now'' and
``Paying for the toll road equals enriching Cendana's (Soeharto)
family''.
	   They also distributed leaflets saying ``You don't have to pay
for the tollway'' to motorists.
	   All drivers who pass through the gate for free cheered, waved
and grinned as they went on their way.
	   A well-known soap-opera actor, Ari Sihasale, who passed through
in his open-topped jeep with two of his friends, raised his right
palm and shouted ``OK!''
	   The rally attracted passersby and people who worked in the
surrounding offices.
	   Only two military police personnel were seen at the scene.
	   The crowd dispersed peacefully after Adityawarman briefed them
about the operation of the Semanggi 2 toll road.
	   ``But we want Jasa Marga to publicly announce in detail who the
operators are of all the toll roads in the city,'' Kuldip said.

	   BOGOR (JP): The police released three Juanda University students
on Thursday night, hours ahead of schedule, after detaining them
for almost a month on charges of killing a senior police officer.
	   Bogor Police chief Lt. Col. M. Ruslan Riza said the release,
originally scheduled for 9 a.m. yesterday, was conducted at 11 p.m.
Thursday for security reasons.
	   ``We wanted to avoid the possibility of massive demonstrations
by students to welcome their friends' release. We feared it would
cause traffic jams and other trouble,'' Ruslan said.
	   He said the three students -- Tb. Ade, Emon Wahyudi, Syaifullah
-- were fetched by Juanda University rector Abadi Soetisna and one
of his deputies, Amin Soebianto.
	   Abadi said yesterday that the police chief telephoned him that
night and invited him to discuss the release.
	   ``As I was not prepared, I asked Amin to accompany me to the
police station,'' he said.
	   The three students were freed apparently in response to mounting
pressure by fellow students who claim the three are not guilty.
	   The students also demanded that the police restore the three
students' reputations and take action against those trying to
intimidate forensic expert Yuli Budiningsih, who performed the
autopsy of the officer's body and publicly disclosed that Dadang
died of a heart attack.
	   Tb. Ade told a news conference at the university campus in
Ciawi, Bogor, yesterday that Emon was the first student to be
arrested at 11:30 p.m on May 9, the day Second Lt. Dadang Rusmana
was found dead.
	   He said Emon was forced to admit that he mobbed Dadang and to
name his friends involved in the attack. ``Emon mentioned five
names, including mine,'' he added.
	   Ade said he was later arrested in his house in Bogor, while
Syaifullah in his residence in Lampung, South Sumatra, both on May
11.
	   ``We were intimidated and while in police detention were forced
to admit to the mobbing,'' he said.
	   The three students, however, resisted the alleged intimidation.
	   Their lawyer, Apong Herlina of the Jakarta Legal Institute, said
earlier that the students were beaten and threatened at gunpoint to
admit to the crime.
	   ``Emon was paralyzed when my colleagues visited him in
detention,'' Apong said. The paralysis was temporary.
	   National Commission on Human Rights member Clementino dos Reis
Amaral, who visited the students in detention, also confirmed that
the students had been tortured.
	   Apong said she and other lawyers of the institute would soon
file suit against the police over the students' illegal arrest and
detention. The institute claims the students were arrested without
sufficient preliminary evidence.
	   ``The police actually knew Dadang's death was caused by a heart
attack, but they proceeded to arrest the students,'' she told The
Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   She also urged the Bogor Prosecutor's Office to reject the
police dossier since it was compiled while the students were being
tortured and without the presence of a lawyer.
	   Another lawyer, Muhyar Nugraha, asked the police to stop the
investigation. ``It's better for the police to stop the
investigation and drop the case.''
	   The police have not yet submitted the dossier to the
prosecutor's office due to administrative reasons, Bogor Regional
Police deputy chief Lt. Pranowo said.
	   The release of the three students was welcomed joyously by
friends and relatives. (24\jun)

	   JAKARTA (JP): The city office of the Ministry of Education and
Culture has instructed all headmasters in the capital to cease
forcing students to buy particular brands of school uniforms and
accessories.
	   Head of the office Alwi Nurdin told reporters here on Thursday
that schools had been ordered to let students and parents decide
what to buy on their own.
	   ``School principals are now barred from taking part in the
distribution and sale of school accessories, such as uniforms,'' he
said.
	   ``It is the students' and parents' own choice,'' Alwi told a
media conference.
	   Schools only have the right to decide on the color and design of
school uniforms, he added.
	   ``Students are no longer obliged to wear new uniforms, they can
use their brother's or sister's,'' he said.
	   The new policy has also banned schools from forcing students to
buy books other than compulsory texts,'' Alwi said.
	   He said the new policy applied to all schools in Jakarta and had
been introduced to help lighten the financial burden on Jakarta
families during the economic crisis.
	   Last year parents across the country were angered after schools
attempted to force their children to buy shoes from private shoe
company PT Aryo Nusa Pakarti which is owned by Ari Sigit, the
eldest grandson of former president Soeharto.
	   The move, which was allegedly approved by the Ministry of
Education and Culture, received sharp criticism and was postponed
after Soeharto himself expressed his displeasure at the
arrangement.
	   He also told parents not to worry about the availability of
places in the city's elementary, junior and senior high schools.
	   ``There are more than enough,'' Alwi said.
	   An estimated 74,000 places will be left unfilled in elementary
schools after 142,000 new students enter the education system later
this year.
	   The city will create an extra 39,300 places in junior high
schools and 20,000 in senior high school to accommodate an expected
increase in enrollment, including students who have returned home
from overseas because of the monetary crisis.
	   Existing junior and senior high school places number 155,188 and
151,983 respectively.
	   ``Given the surplus we have decided that it will be possible to
accept students from outside Jakarta,'' Alwi said.
	   He promised this year's computerized entrance test system would
be fairer and more transparent than the previous system.
	   ``The new system will allow the organizing committee to control
the procedure and will help avoid collusion between parents and
teachers,'' he said.
	   Alwi also announced that school registration and entrance fees
for poor families would be waived in view of the economic crisis.
	   Pupils must register for kindergarten, elementaryand junior high
school between June 22 and July 4. Student registration for high
school and vocational schools began on April 8 and will end on June
17.
	   Students from outside Jakarta and from overseas who wish to
enter junior and senior high schools in the city can register
between June 15 and 17.
	   The elementary school registration fee is set at Rp 1,750, the
junior high school registration fee is Rp 3,500 and senior and
vocational school registration fees are Rp 4,000. Vocational
schools charge an additional Rp 800 fee for a competency test.

Tehran mayor goes on trial for corruption, pleads not guilty
</HEADLINE>

objection; raises context; background on possible sentence &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi went on
trial for corruption Sunday, and suffered his first setback when
the court refused to declare itself incompetent to hear the case.
	   Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejaei ruled that Karbaschi, 44, had
no basis to claim that his court lacked the jurisdiction to hear
the case, Iranian state-run television reported.
	   Mohseni said that Karbaschi's argument ``is unacceptable to the
court'' the television reported, adding that the judge will explain
his ruling in detail in the next session, scheduled for Thursday.
	   Appearing before the Imam Khomeini Judiciary Complex in central
Tehran, Karbaschi also pleaded innocent and said the charges of
embezzlement, fraud and mismanagement of public funds against him
were trumped up.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by the hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who took office in
August. Karbaschi had run Khatami's election campaign.
	   ``All of the charges against me are absolute lies. I don't
accept any of them,'' the black-bearded Karbaschi told the judge, a
cleric, wearing a white turban and brown robe.
	   The judge said: ``I'm not happy today to try a manager of the
Islamic Republic of Iran, but we know that the law should be
implemented and there are no exceptions. Nobody is above the law.''
	   Karbaschi's arrest on April 4 brought into open a long-simmering
power struggle between moderate and hard-line clerics. Karbaschi
was freed April 15 after a series of street protests turned
violent, forcing Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
considered an ally of hard-liners, to intervene.
	   The case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of stories
for and against the popular mayor.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding any government post. The trial is expected to
last for weeks.
	   Karbaschi arrived in the packed courtroom in his trademark dark
blue suit, flanked by his two lawyers, looking relaxed and
confident.
	   As he left the courthouse, about 200 supporters greeted him with
shouts of ``Long live Karbaschi.'' Another 50, standing nearby,
yelled, ``Death to Karbaschi.''
	   Some 130 citizens attended the trial _ those who arrived early _
along with about 70 journalists. A crowd of several hundred watched
the four-hour hearing on two 28-inch television screens outside the
courthouse, where extra police were assigned to keep order.
	   Karbaschi's troubles began when Chief Judge Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, a hard-liner, accused him of involvement in a wide-ranging
corruption scandal and ordered him detained.
	   In the scandal, more than a dozen senior municipality officials
have been put on trial since last October. Most were accused of _
or sentenced for _ issuing building permits in restricted zones in
return for large kickbacks.
	   As mayor since 1989, Karbaschi has improved the capital's
appearance as well as public services for its 8 million residents.
	   Despite his popularity, he has critics who consider his
administration high-handed and who dislike him for taxing the
powerful merchants who make up the hard-liners' power base.
	   The mayor went back to work days after his release. But
according to Iranian law, he is not allowed to work while the trial
is under way.

Eritreans brace for more Ethiopian warplane attacks

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritreans braced Sunday for more
bombardments by Ethiopian warplanes after a deadline passed for
hundreds of foreigners to flee to safety.
	   Hectic diplomatic efforts were underway to prevent the border
conflict from exploding into a full-scale war.
	   Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and listened for
the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23 fighters that had
bombed their capital's airport Friday and Saturday. None came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the disputed border.
	   Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border town of Zala
Anbessa, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Asmara, defeating
in a daylong battle Eritrean forces which captured the town last
week.
	   Eritrean government spokesman Isaac Yared said the Eritrean
troops retreated voluntarily and unmolested back to their side of
the border. ``They decided it was time to go,'' he said.
	   President Isaias Afwerki is hopeful that a summit of heads of
state of the Organization of African Unity on Monday will yield new
ideas for a negotiated settlement, his spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel
said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left an OAU foreign
ministers meeting Saturday in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso, apparently
for Ethiopia and Eritrea. But her whereabouts Sunday were not
publicly known.
	   Rice is promoting a peace plan for the two feuding Horn of
Africa countries that was drafted by the United States and Rwanda.
	   ``The peace recommendations by the United States and Rwanda
constitute a reasonable basis for a peaceful resolution for the
conflict,'' Rice said Saturday in the West African city.
	   The proposal includes a call to Eritrea to return to positions
held prior to May 6, when current hostilities reportedly broke out
_ in other words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its
territory.
	   Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
however, claims it is rightfully in territory defined by boundaries
drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Gebremeskel said Eritrea broadly agreed with the four-point
peace plan, but he said any accord must include more specifics,
including how and when the border would be demarcated and by whom.
	   ``We need to work out the details to achieve a lasting
solution,'' he said. ``This dispute has gone on for too long
already.''
	   African leaders including presidents Yoweri Museveni, Nelson
Mandela of South Africa, Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti and
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya called Afwerki over the weekend to
encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrean civilians were hoping to avoid war. Ethiopia's army
outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by about three to one.
Eritrea's tiny air force is no match for Ethiopia's.
	   Mokonnen, who uses just one name, said he was afraid, though
optimistic that a peace pact be forged between the one-time allies.
	   ``We are still free. We are still brothers, only a few people
are doing this thing. Our government wants peace, and we are
struggling to solve it peacefully,'' the 27-year-old telephone
operator said.
	   Ethiopian jets bombed a military-civilian airport on the
outskirts of Asmara on Friday and Saturday, forcing embassies to
step up their exit plans.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried more than a
thousand foreigners out of harm's way late Saturday and early
Sunday after Ethiopia agreed to temporarily halt bombing.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   But the two countries dispute more than a half-dozen areas along
their common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered
Eritrea in 1885.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A debt accord between Indonesian debtors and their
foreign creditors failed to lift the ailing rupiah, currency
traders said yesterday.
	   The rupiah closed unchanged at 11,550 against the U.S. dollar in
thin trade, dealers said.
	   In contrast to the rupiah, prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
(JSX) rose slightly as investors responded positively to the debt
deal, stockbrokers said.
	   Currency dealers said the debt agreement, which should have
improved market sentiment, failed to entice offshore funds back
into the currency market because of lingering political
uncertainties.
	   ``The debt accord in itself is positive but political
uncertainties overshadow it,'' a senior dealer with a local private
bank said.
	   The Indonesian debt negotiation team and creditor banks reached
an accord on Thursday which included a comprehensive program to
restructure the private sector's US$80 billion external debt over a
period of eight years. A three year period of grace during which no
principal need be repaid was also granted.
	   However, the dealer said that persistent political and social
uncertainty prevented offshore funds from off-loading dollar
holdings for rupiah.
	   The rupiah closed at Rp 11,550 against the American dollar
yesterday, almost unchanged from where it finished trading on
Thursday.
	   Hundreds of protesters rallied outside the U.S. Embassy in
Jakarta yesterday calling on the Washington not to interfere the
country's domestic affairs.
	   Other anti-American demonstrations have taken place here in
recent days as Indonesia begins painstaking efforts to address the
economic and political crises.
	   However, currency dealers said that an expected resumption of
aid payments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the
weeks ahead should help to bring the rupiah back toward Rp 8,000 to
the dollar.
	   ``The debt accord and the release of the IMF loan are two
positive pieces of news which should help to improve sentiment in
market,'' the dealer said.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) benchmark price index closed
3.18 points up on 409.52 yesterday, with 490.13 million shares
worth Rp 561.27 billion (US$51.09 million) changing hands.
	   A broker with Credit Lyonnais Capital Indonesia said trading
activities were buoyant in the morning in response to the debt deal
but the encouraging signs faded away in the afternoon after most
local investors took profits on the gains made in the morning.
	   ``The slight increase was just market euphoria,'' the broker
said.
	   A broker with Mashill Jaya Securities said that several big
foreign brokerage firms, including Jardine Fleming, Vickers Ballas
Tamara, SBC Warburg and ING Barings had placed more selling orders
than buying ones.
	   ``It shows that foreign fund managers are continuing to avoid
the local market,' the broker said.
	   He added that food maker PT Indofood Sukses Makmur shares fell
Rp 75 to Rp 1,500. The day's high was Rp 1,925 and 116.16 million
shares changed hands. Automotive manufacturer PT Astra
International shares fell Rp 150 to Rp 1,050 on 50.24 million
shares changing hands.
	   Karman Pramurahardjo of Harita Securities said the country's
persistently gloomy economic outlook, spiraling inflation and
political uncertainty posed major problems for foreign investors.
	   ``There are no foreign investors who are willing to put funds in
our dire market,'' he said. (aly)

Yeltsin and Blair hold telephone talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin spoke to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair by telephone Sunday evening to discuss a number
of issues, including the situation in southeast Asia and the unrest
in Kosovo.
	   According to the Kremlin press service, Yeltsin and Blair agreed
that a coordinated effort by the leading states of the world was
needed to curtail the spread of nuclear weapons following a spate
of underground tests by India and Pakistan.
	   The two leaders also agreed that it was necessary to quickly
halt the conflict in the Serbian region of Kosovo, but without
breaching Yugoslavia's territorial integrity, the press service
said.
	   Russia on Thursday proposed that a United Nations force in
Macedonia be used to monitor the border between neighboring Albania
and Kosovo. The U.N. peacekeeping force was sent to Macedonia in
1992 to prevent the spread of ethnic conflicts in other parts of
the former Yugoslavia.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
said yesterday that all contracts signed by the ministry would be
honored, including contracts of work in the mining sector and
production-sharing contracts in the oil sector.
	   ``The mines and energy ministry will not change agreements that
have been signed,'' Kuntoro told reporters.
	   ``We believe a good investment climate can only be created if
businesspeople feel confident about agreements that have been
made,'' he said.
	   Kuntoro noted that there have been growing demands for the
government to review all contracts and agreements made in the past,
apparently referring to the public's demand for a review of all
contracts obtained by former president Soeharto's family and
cronies.
	   The ministry will not review its contracts with any private
companies as long as the contracts were processed and signed in
accordance with the existing regulations.
	   However, Kuntoro recently ordered state oil and gas company
Pertamina to review all its contracts which were obtained by
companies through political and familial connection as well as
other unsavory business practices, including corruption and
nepotism.
	   Pertamina president Soegianto recently said it had thus far
registered 120 companies whose contracts would be reviewed, most of
which were linked to Soeharto's family and cronies.
	   Pertamina has long had a reputation as the country's worst
symbol of nepotism due to its domination by Soeharto's family and
cronies, sometimes in partnership with foreign investors.
	   Soeharto's family and cronies have enjoyed exclusive rights to
import fuel and crude oil for decades. They also control contracts
for the shipment of crude oil, fuel and liquefied natural gas (LNG)
to export markets and for the development of LNG plants throughout
the country.
	   As far as partnership between Soeharto's family and cronies and
foreign investors are concerned, there have also been calls from
the public for the government to require foreign investors to
replace their partners.
	   But Kuntoro said the government would not intervene in the
internal affairs of those partnerships.
	   ``The ministry will not intervene in contracts and agreements
made by businesspeople with each other, and everything will be
referred to their agreements,'' Kuntoro said.
	   He said the ministry was committed to the nationwide
anticollusion, corruption and nepotism campaigns but believed the
campaigns should be conducted in accordance with the existing laws
and transparently.
	   ``All people should be treated with a presumption of innocence
and in compliance with the law,'' Kuntoro said. (jsk)

Moya wins French Open final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with color, Corretja quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Carlos Moya captured the French Open on Sunday,
beating friend, compatriot and fellow clay-court specialist Alex
Corretja 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 for his first Grand Slam title.
	   ``For two weeks I'll be a king,'' Moya said, referring to the
period before Wimbledon. ``It's an unbelievable feeling to win a
Grand Slam.''
	   The all-Spanish final was expected to be more competitive, but
Moya was simply the more versatile player. He served better and
dominated with his powerful forehand. Corretja seemed unable to
find his rhythm after being broken in the opening game.
	   Corretja, who earlier in the tournament played a 5-hour,
31-minute match over two days that was the longest in the open era,
said he'd gotten tired after the second set.
	   ``It would have been tough, mentally, to go five sets,'' he
said.
	   But he appeared to be a happy loser.
	   ``I'm really happy because I've been playing well for the last
two weeks, and I lost to a really good friend of mine,'' he
explained.
	   Even before Sunday's outcome was known, a Spanish sweep of the
singles titles was assured. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the women's
title Saturday, beating Monica Seles.
	   On the winning point, a netted backhand, Moya fell on his back
in joy. Corretja hurdled the net to congratulate his friend, who
earned dlrs 650,000 for the victory.
	   Soccer great Pele awarded the trophy to Moya, who saluted
Corretja in his acceptance speech. Then both players joined Pele
for an impromptu romp with a soccer ball, heading it back and
forth.
	   That light moment got one of the biggest rounds of applause of
the day, certainly more than the sometimes tedious tennis.
	   Spanish men have won the French Open five times previously, but
have taken only three other Grand Slam titles.
	   Moya, born and raised on island of Majorca, came into view at
last year's Australian Open, where he defeated Boris Becker in the
first round, then reached the final, losing to Pete Sampras.
	   Moya, seeded 12th, and Corretja, seeded 14th, reached the final
after the men's field was decimated early in the tournament.
Top-seeded Sampras lost in the second round and No. 2 seed Petr
Korda lost in the first.
	   Moya knocked off the consensus favorite, No. 3 seed Marcelo
Rios, in the quarterfinals. Corretja did not meet one seeded player
until the final.
	   The windy conditions _ with gusts of up to 50 kph (31 mph) _ cut
short some of the long rallies for which the Spaniards are known.
Misplays on serves and volleys caused both men trouble.
	   Corretja took an early lead in the second set, when he broke
Moya to go ahead 2-1. But Moya evened it in the next game. Corretja
held off two set points at 4-5 to even the set at 5-5.
	   Two games later, Corretja got into trouble again on his serve at
5-6. This time, he couldn't hold off the more powerful Moya, and
dropped behind two sets.
	   In the third, with Corretja coming out to serve at 1-4, the
crowd did the wave to try to breathe life into the match. Corretja
did hold serve, then saved a match point to win his next service
game.
	   But serving at 5-3, Moya set up a second match point with an ace
for 40-0. Corretja netted a backhand service return to end the
match.

	   JAKARTA (JP): PT Pudjiadi and Sons Estates expects another big
decline in net profit this year as foreign exchange debts and
declining revenues will likely further hit the publicly listed
hotel operator, the company's senior executive said yesterday.
	   Company president Lukman Pudjiadi said foreign debt repayment,
the decline in the property market and the slowdown in foreign
tourist arrivals would cause a further plunge in revenue.
	   ``This will result in another drop in profit,'' he told
reporters following the company's shareholders meeting. But he did
not speculate on how much the profit would drop by.
	   Lukman said it was really difficult for the company to make any
projection now because of the lingering political uncertainty and
the rupiah's continued decline against the dollar.
	   Pudjiadi, which operates and manages the Jayakarta Tower hotel
in downtown Jakarta, has dollar-denominated debts of US$10.69
million. They to several financial institutions including Bank
Niaga, GHF Hongkong and Daiwa Perdania Bank.
	   ``The loans will mature next year with an interest rate of 8
percent per year,'' Lukman said.
	   He said that the massive riots here last month, where angry mobs
vandalized shops and buildings, had scared foreign tourists already
in Indonesia and would dissuade other foreign tourists from coming
here.
	   ``Since political stability is not fully restored yet, no
foreign tourists are expected to come for the rest of the year.
	   ``With no foreign tourists coming to this country, our earnings
will certainly continue to decline.''
	   The company, which recorded a net loss of Rp 19.6 billion
(US$1.96 million) last year due to massive foreign exchange losses,
also plans to sell its hotel in Dallas, the United States, to
foreign investors to obtain fresh funds.
	   ``But no foreign investors have expressed any interest yet,''
Lukman said, adding that the company's hotel in Dallas was being
offered at US$29 million.
	   The company's revenue increased to Rp38.70 billion last year
from Rp 35.51 billion the previous year. (aly)

Players, FIFA candidates are confident as games, election loom

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The imminent start of the World Cup has brought
brave talk of victory, not only from coaches and players but mostly
from the two candidates vying to win election Monday to the
presidency of FIFA.
	   While coaches lined up their teams on practice fields throughout
France and in neighboring countries, Lennart Johansson arrayed his
team of supporters _ including Brazilian superstar Pele _ to make
one last pitch for votes in his heated battle against Sepp Blatter
for FIFA's top office.
	   ``I'm very confident of victory,'' Johansson, the Swedish
president of the UEFA, said Sunday. ``See what kind of people are
surrounding me.''
	   Both Johansson and Blatter, FIFA's general secretary and choice
of outgoing president Joao Havelange, claim they have enough votes
to carry the day. Right up to the end, there are still contentious
issues to solve, including the method the 192 national federations
will use to cast their votes.
	   Johansson is promising to make FIFA more open, responsive and
democratic, a contrast to the dictatorial style associated with
Havelange. Blatter's platform is much the same, but his ties to
Havelange and late decision to enter the race has Johansson
accusing his opponent of jumping on the bandwagon.
	   ``His program is a bad copy of mine,'' Johansson said.
	   All will be decided Monday at the FIFA Congress, and the outcome
will be greeted with relief for those anxious to shift the focus
from the politicians to players, assuming all is not disrupted by
the continuing Air France strike.
	   The work stoppage entered its seventh day Sunday and the airline
has said it would take three days for service to return to normal
once the matter was settled. That means even if pilots and
management came to an agreement Monday, it would spill over into
the start of the World Cup on Wednesday.
	   With the opening nearing, more teams arrived to settle into
various posh castle-turned-hotel accommodations throughout France.
Germany, one of the favorites and brimming with confidence after a
series of good performances in exhibition games, took up residence
in the hills above the Mediterranean resort of Nice and practiced
late in the day.
	   ``We are on a very, very good direction,'' captain Juergen
Klinsmann said before the team boarded the plane in Frankfurt.
	   Meanwhile, Scotland, faced with the dubious honor of playing
world champion Brazil in the tournament's opening game, was making
the most of its underdog role as it worked out at
Saint-Remy-De-Provence.
	   ``The persecution complex suits the Scots,'' manager Craig Brown
said. ``The mentality we have is, `We will show them.' ''
	   Even Tunisia, which is expected to go home after three games
perhaps without even a point, was sounding an upbeat note.
Preparing for their arrival Monday, the North Africans sounded
eager to make some noise in their June 15 opener against England.
	   ``We are ready for you,'' Tunisia's Polish coach Henry
Kasperczak said, reflecting on a 4-0 victory Saturday over
non-qualifier Wales in Tunis. ``We are fit and ready.''
	   Not ready is famed Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp, who could miss
the Netherlands' first two games with a hamstring injury. Coach
Guus Hiddink said Sunday that Bergkamp, who has scored 33 goals for
the national team, is taking longer than expected to recover.
	   Ivan Zamorano, half of Chile's high-scoring front line, sat out
his team's Sunday practice with a minor knee injury. The team
doctor said the 31-year-old forward was suffering from a
``contusion to the right leg meniscus'' and would be ready for
Chile's World Cup debut against Italy on Thursday.
	   ``There is no reason for concern,'' doctor Eugenio Valdecantos
said. ``This a very minor, easy-to-cure injury.''
	   In England, coach Glenn Hoddle promised a crackdown on alcohol
use by his squad. Three players _ Paul Gascoigne, Teddy Sheringham
and Darren Anderton _ have made headlines recently over their
behavior at nightclubs. Excessive drinking was cited as one of the
reasons Gascoigne was out of shape and dropped from the team.
	   ``I am not going to ban alcohol, and on occasion the players
will be allowed a couple of beers or a glass of wine. But only at
the right times,'' Hoddle told the Independent on Sunday newspaper.
	   ``In England that's what we have had all through our careers _
get in the players' bar and have a beer. But that's detrimental and
won't happen in France.''
	   Actually, the big story in France on Sunday was the final of the
French Open tennis tournament, the final major sporting event
before the calendar clears for the World Cup. The Spanish team,
training in Chantilly, was keenly interested in the outcome, given
that Spaniards Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja were contesting the
title at Roland Garros.
	   ``Things seem to be happening for Spain and that gives everyone
that extra bit of confidence,'' defender Rafael Alkorta said.
``They're like premonitions. We are here, too, and hoping to
conquer in France.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Ministry of Forestry and Plantations has
requested that a 30,000-hectare township project linked to one of
Soeharto's son be put on hold until the developer settles a dispute
with the ministry.
	   Director General of Inventory and Forest Land Use Soebagjo
Hadisepoetro said yesterday that PT Bukit Jonggol Astri, the
developer of the township project located in the Jonggol district
of Bogor, about 30 kilometers to the southeast of Jakarta, had not
fulfilled its obligation to provide forest areas in exchange for
the site used for the project.
	   He said the ministry agreed in 1996 to allow PT Bukit Jonggol to
use 3,100 of state forestry areas as part of its 30,000-hectare
project. Under the agreement, PT Bukit Jonggol Asri agreed to swap
the 3,100-hectare forestry areas with 6,300-hectare forestry areas
in West Java's regencies of Cianjur, Tasikmalaya and Garut.
	   Later, the consortium proposed that it replaced the 3,100
hectares from the government with the same amount of land.
	   But Soebagjo said the 3,100-hectare area given by the consortium
was not a forest area as stipulated in the contract.
	   ``The company has not fulfilled its obligation,'' he told a news
conference. ``We're giving them a one-month dateline starting now.
If they fail to settle the problem, the ministry will revoke the
deal,'' he said.
	   The consortium, set up by Soeharto's second son Bambang
Trihatmodjo with Kaestindo Group, plans to develop a township on
30,000 hectares covering 24 villages in Jonggol.
	   According to the plan, the self-sufficient city would be the
biggest housing project in Greater Jakarta.
	   Soebagjo said ministry officials would soon check the swap deal
with PT Kia Timor Motor in Cikampek, West Java.
	   Under the deal, PT Kia Timor, partly owned by Soeharto's
youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra, would build a 73-hectare car
manufacturing plant in the Perum Perhutani area.
	   Meanwhile, Soebagjo said his office also planed to directly
revoke permits and concessions on plantations which had been
neglected.
	   He said the ministry had ordered its provincial offices in every
province to revoke permits of negligent companies.
	   ``But until now, only East Kalimantan forestry provincial office
has dared to do that,'' he said. (gis)

	   JAKARTA (JP): Members of the Consultative Group on Indonesia
(CGI) will convene in Paris at the end of next month to find ways
to help the country extricate itself from the crisis.
	   World Bank country director Dennis de Tray said here yesterday
that the meeting, to be held July 29 and July 30, would be
``slightly different'' from the usual CGI meetings because the
situation here was totally different from the past.
	   ``We will focus on much narrowed issues -- the monetary crisis
and social safety net issues. In those areas, we are working as
hard as we can to prepare the groundwork for that meeting.''
	   He said the meeting could be used by the government to get more
aid commitments from donor countries, on top of the US$43 billion
bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund, to
finance its huge fiscal deficits.
	   ``It (the government) needs more money than it's going to get.
It needs a huge amount of money. Fiscal debt ... is going to be
large. And how to finance that is going to be a major, major
problem.''
	   De Tray said the meeting in Paris would involve ``different sets
of resources'' than the IMF bailout package. ``That will be a
separate deal.''
	   CGI, led by the World Bank, has provided some $5 billion in
assistance each year to Indonesia since its inception in 1992 when
it replaced the Dutch-led Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia
(IGGI).
	   De Tray said the World Bank had already assembled officials and
individuals from the government, international financial
institutions, donor countries, the private sector and some UN
agencies for a series of informal meetings to assess the situation
and try to help the poor to withstand the crisis through social
safety net programs.
	   At yesterday's meeting, for instance, representatives from the
government presented to the meeting about the government's
proposals to prevent more school dropouts by providing block grants
to primary schools and simple scholarships for junior and senior
high school students.
	   De Tray said a lot of ``long-term friends of Indonesia'' were
eager to help the country, but the problem was how to coordinate
their assistance.
	   He said the World Bank wanted to develop a partnership with the
National Development Planning Board and international agencies to
coordinate foreign assistance.
	   ``When the situation is stabilizing, there will be a tremendous
desire from the international community to step in and help
Indonesia,'' he said.
	   De Tray also reported yesterday about the World Bank's decision
to resume lending to Indonesia with a $225 million rural
development loan.
	   The loan would directly be channeled to subdistricts and
villages through the people's representative body at the village
level, called LKMD.
	   However, de Tray said disbursement of additional World Bank
money -- including $1 billion in a structural adjustment loan to
help reinvigorate the battered economy -- remained on hold, and
would require further review by the bank and the IMF.
	   He said the review, especially to restructure the state budget
and adjust macroeconomic targets to the reality of the situation,
would be conducted together with government officials next week.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The government admitted yesterday it still lacks
reliable data on the ownership and operations of the country's
timber companies, which are often blamed for causing forest fires
and damaging the environment.
	   Minister of Forestry and Plantations Muslimin Nasution,
appointed minister only last month, said that even he and the
ministry's senior officials are unclear about the ownership of the
forest concessions because data left by his predecessor only showed
the names of the operating timber companies.
	   ``The current data only shows the names of the companies but not
their owners' names. The data should be reviewed by adding the
names of the people behind those companies,'' he said.
	   ``It will, therefore, take more time to detect whether they are
involved in KKN (corruption, collusion and nepotism) practices,''
he said when asked about his recent promise to review timber
companies' contracts, particularly those involved in illegitimate
practices such as obtaining logging contracts due to their close
relations with former president Soeharto and his cronies.
	   Muslimin said the ministry was compiling data on names and
operations of all forest concession holders in the country.
	   ``God willing, the names of all forests concessionaires will be
collected and announced transparently to the public in two weeks,''
he promised.
	   Timber and plantation companies are often criticized for their
lack of attention to protecting the environment and also often
blamed for causing forest fires.
	   Muslimin said strict punishments would be imposed on timber
companies found to have violated the sustainable forest management
regulations or caused forest fires.
	   ``The management of those disobedient concessions can be handed
over to state timber companies and cooperatives or offered to the
public through an open bidding system,'' he said.
	   In the future his ministry will employ an open bidding system in
issuing concession contracts to ensure that only those with a
strong commitment to protecting the forest, environment and local
people win the contracts.
	   Former environment minister Emil Salim suggested yesterday that
concession rights be given only to companies which could offer the
most benefits to local people and the state, such as through
contributions of resource rent tax to be used for the reforestation
purposes.
	   Their offers should be made through ``transparent and open
public bidding'', Emil told participants at a discussion on forest
concessions held by Atma Jaya University here.
	   Emil said bidding to select companies entitled to get the
concession rights was a way to return to the power of market
mechanisms lost to the power of the government.
	   However, he said the resource rent tax and the reforestation
fund should be used for replanting only and that the fund must be
embodied into the state budget to ensure the accountability of its
use.
	   Another needed measure was to seriously implement a nationwide
spatial master plan to ensure proper use of land and forests, Emil
said.
	   ``The question to ask in this case for instance is: what will be
the face of East Kalimantan in 2020? How much land is being
allocated for industry, plantations, agriculture, even for
protecting species, etcetera? So the competing uses of the forest
must be settled first through master planning.
	   ``We can't dedicate all our forest for concessions,'' Emil said.
	   The government first began to award forest concessions to
private companies through the 1971 Forestry Law, which granted
concessionaires the sole right to exploit and cultivate forests in
their concession area.
	   There are currently 437 forest concessions in the country.
	   Private concessions -- which cover more than 61 million hectares
of forest -- are mostly in the hands of 50 leading groups,
including Kalimanis Group owned by Mohammad ``Bob'' Hasan, Barito
Pacific Timber owned by Prajogo Pangestu, Sujono Varinata's
Djajanti Group, PT Alas Kesuma owned by Handjaja and Nana Suparna
and Mercu Buana Group owned by Probosutedjo, Soeharto's
half-brother.
	   Informed sources say most of the forest concessions owned by the
50 leading groups are partly owned by Soeharto's family and their
cronies such as Bob Hasan and Prajogo Pangestu. (gis/aan)

	   JAKARTA (JP): Ethnic Chinese businesspeople said yesterday they
were still hesitant to continue their businesses in Indonesia as
political instability remains a threat to their safety.
	   The businesspeople said at a seminar that last month's riots in
Jakarta and other cities reflected the fragility of their status as
Indonesian citizens.
	   ``Ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs are still reluctant to start
their businesses again because they are still traumatized,'' the
Gemala Group chairman Sofyan Wanandi said here.
	   He called for an end to the current political uncertainty, so
that the economy could return to normal.
	   ``How can we start if there are still protests here and there
and ministers and officials are being solicited,'' he said, adding
that the country would collapse in three months if such conditions
persisted.
	   Yesterday's seminar, which adopted the theme reforms and good
corporate governance, was attended by more than 500 businesspeople
of Chinese descent, including several prominent public figures.
	   Speaking at the seminar were former cabinet ministers Emil Salim
and Siswono Yudohusono, economists from the Center for Strategic
and International Studies Djisman Simandjuntak and Mari Pangestu
and noted lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up 5 percent of the population but control
about 70 percent of the economy.
	   The riots, which began here May 13, resulted in massive
destruction of stores and business premises, most of which were
owned by ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, and physical assaults on the
owners and their families.
	   The businesspeople stressed yesterday that much ill-feeling was
still evident from indigenous people toward the Chinese community.
	   ``I built my business for years and it got robbed and burned.
Five years later, after I rebuilt the business, it got robbed and
burned again,'' said an emotionally charged man.
	   Others complained that they were never considered Indonesian
nationals, although they had been citizens of the country all their
lives.
	   ``The ethnic Chinese community is like the government's
mistress, she is the prettiest and perhaps the most loved one, but
she never gets to be taken to a party,'' said political expert
Harry Tjan Silalahi.
	   Harry adopted the North Sumatra family name Silalahi, like many
ethnic Chinese, in an effort to assimilate into the local culture.
	   Sofyan said the 32-year Soeharto regime, which ended May 21,
contributed to the prevailing sentiment regarding the ethnic
Chinese.
	   ``Toward the end of the regime, government moves regarding our
community excluded us from other segments of society,'' said
Sofyan, who in the mid-1960s was active in student demonstrations
that led to the downfall of the then president Sukarno,
	   Nonindigenous entrepreneurs often feel compelled to collude with
government officials to survive, making some of them the main
source of income for the bureaucrats, he said.
	   Former cabinet minister Emil Salim called for the formation of
affirmative policies which would guarantee equal treatment for both
indigenous and nonindigenous Indonesians.
	   ``Who can blame them (ethnic Chinese) for dominating the economy
if they have been prevented from entering other professions?'' he
asked, adding that the government had limited them from serving in
the military or running for public office.
	   Separately, the Forum of Reform Entrepreneurs reported yesterday
that about 110,000 families of Chinese descent had left the country
since the riots erupted.
	   The group's spokesperson Nazar Haroen said 80,000 of the
families said they would return if the political and security
situations stabilized.
	   Twenty thousand families were still indecisive, and the
remaining 10,000 had decided to move to Singapore, Taiwan and Hong
Kong, Nazar said, as reported by the Antara news agency. (das)

	   JAKARTA (JP): Bank Indonesia said yesterday the 50,000 note
carrying former president Soeharto's image was still legal tender
despite rumors it would no longer be honored.
	   ``We hope the public will not believe baseless rumors which say
that transactions will be rejected when using the Rp 50,000 note,
because it is still valid,'' the central bank's legal affairs head
Bambang Setijoprodjo said in a media statement yesterday.
	   He added that there was no grounds to reject the note.
	   Every process of printing new money or the withdrawal of old
from circulation would always be announced in an official statement
and distributed to the public through banks, government
institutions, brochures, posters and the mass media.
	   Soeharto handed over power to his closest aide B.J. Habibie last
month following widespread political unrest and massive student
demonstrations.
	   The central bank also denied press reports that the central bank
intervened in limiting the interest rate increase for time
deposits.
	   The bank said the recent new interest rate policy, which would
be based on the average Jakarta Interbank Offered Rates (Jibor) in
the preceding week at a certain margin, was part of the
government's program to guarantee bank deposits and public savings.
	   ``This means that the banks are free to set the interest rates,
but the guarantee only applies if the rates do not exceed the
maximum level,'' Bambang said.
	   The new policy stipulates that rupiah savings and deposit would
only be guaranteed if the interest rates are limited to 500 basis
points above the average Jibor in the previous week.
	   The foreign exchange savings and deposits would be guaranteed if
the interest rates are set maximally 100 percent above the Jibor
foreign exchange rates in the preceding week.
	   Previously, the saving deposit rates were set at 125 percent of
the Bank Indonesia SBI short-term promissory note rates. (rei)

	   JAKARTA (JP): Bank Indonesia must take its blinkers off in its
single-minded pursuit of stabilizing the rupiah to focus instead on
curbing inflation and breathing new life into dying domestic
businesses, economists advised yesterday.
	   Mari E. Pangestu, executive director of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, said the central bank's policy to
stabilize the rupiah through high interest rates was paralyzing the
domestic economy and resulting in spiraling inflation.
	   ``We should come back to basics (of the main duty of the central
bank) that pursuing monetary policy should have one objective,
namely (controlling) inflation and not back and forth to strengthen
the rupiah's rate,'' Mari said at a seminar hosted by the Prasetya
Mulya School of Management.
	   Although the central bank is using various means and working
hard to defend the rupiah, Mari predicted the currency would remain
weak at about 9,000 to 10,000 against the U.S. dollar toward the
end of this year.
	   It might strengthen to about 8,000, Mari added, only when
political factors were already solved, investor confidence in the
country was restored, corporate foreign debts were settled, the
banking sector regained its health and foreign capital reentered
Indonesia.
	   This reality meant the central bank should from now on use all
of its resources to contain inflation, which affected the lives of
all Indonesians, rather than vainly attempt to prop up the rupiah
value, she said.
	   Currently, when inflation was projected by many to surpass the
100 percent barrier this year, efforts to contain inflation through
a tight monetary policy alone would be insufficient.
	   Cutting interest rates to revive the economy would pose another
problem because of the already high inflation expectation for this
year.
	   ``The policy toward inflation could be pursued by containing
money in circulation and ensuring the availability of goods and
basic services,'' Mari said.
	   She also suggested that the central bank and the government
should help export-oriented firms to ensure the flow of their
products to generate foreign exchange.
	   Indonesia should book a trade surplus this year provided that
factors hindering exports were all addressed properly, Mari said.
	   She also called on the central bank and the government to mend
the destroyed microeconomic fundamentals by creating a market
economy free of distortions, pursuing policy consistency and
restoring the health of the financial sector.
	   Djisman Simandjuntak, another economist at the center and also
president of Prasetya Mulya, suggested that companies first of all
pursue a ``survival strategy'' to weather the crisis.
	   Toward the future, Djisman said, Indonesian corporations should
build a ``good corporate governance'' culture by pursuing
transparency and dismantling all unsavory practices related to
corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   Djisman also suggested that the government, in cooperation with
corporations, dissolve single majority holding of a large company
and spread ownership to more people and different layers of
society.
	   He said it would be fair to require a company with 1,000 or more
employees to comply with all rulings applied to publicly listed
companies.
	   It would also be just, he added, for owners of companies which
use public resources like bank credits and natural resources to
divest their ownership. (das/rid)

	   Alfred Nobel, Greta Garbo, Ingmar Bergman, Ingrid Bergman, ABBA
-- while most people know that these people are Europeans, fewer
probably are aware they hail from Sweden.
	   Despite its comparative low-profile, the country and its people
have a lot to offer.
	   Sweden is the third largest country in Europe. It has 100,000
lakes and half the land is covered by forests. The country's
coastline is 2,700 kilometers long, from Norway in the west to
Finland in the east. Its land borders run 2,200 km.
	   Waterways are intimately associated with Swedish culture,
recreation, businesses and defense policy. Today, water remains an
essential transportation route, and such Swedish goods as motor
vehicles, iron ore pellets and forest products are exported by sea.
Crude oil -- which Sweden lacks entirely -- is among the many
imports that arrive by sea.
	   Sweden's three largest cities -- Stockholm, Goteborg and Malmo
-- are located on the coast.
	   While traditional Swedish maritime sectors such as shipbuilding,
merchant shipping and fishing have declined in importance,
recreational fishing still thrives and anyone is allowed to fish
along the coast. Passenger vessels shuttle tourists and Swedish
vacationers between urban centers and the thousands of archipelago
islands that dot the coastline.
	   Swedish cities have been largely shaped by nature, rather than
taming and dominating it. Stockholm, the capital, occupies hilly
terrain and a number of islands. For most of its existence it was
an impoverished little town, despite Swedish monarchs having
resided there for more than four centuries. About 1.6 million of
Sweden's population of 8.8 million currently live in Stockholm.
	   Two of Sweden's best-known older cities, Uppsala and Lund, grew
up around universities that were founded in the 15th century and
17th century respectively. Many cities and towns experienced a
growth surge in the early years of the industrial era, when many of
today's leading Swedish engineering companies were founded.
	   Many a Swede's paradise is a little red cottage in the country.
Many of them realize this dream; there are 700,000 second homes in
Sweden.
	   The Swedish love of nature is facilitated by the right of common
access, an ancient custom that entitles everyone to roam freely in
forests and meadows without asking the owner's permission. They may
also pick flowers, berries and mushrooms, provided they show
consideration to the environment.
	   Swedish agriculture today is entirely mechanized and very
efficient, employing less than 3 percent of the labor force. Tight
environmental standards have forced farmers to limit their use of
environmentally hazardous substances. Strict regulations on animal
and food imports have helped wipe out certain diseases entirely.
	   Swedes celebrate many special occasions close to nature; for
example, on Walpurgis Eve, April 30, they light bonfires outdoors
and groups of choral singers sing a number of songs which are the
same everywhere in the country; it is said that this evening marks
the end of winter and the coming of spring. On Midsummer Eve, they
desert their cities and join festivities in the countryside. At
Christmas, their homes are decorated with spruce trees, lingonberry
branches and hyacinths.
	   A northern mountain range covers nearly one-fourth of Sweden's
geographic area: a unique wilderness landscape of treeless massifs,
pristine rivers and vast forests. Sweden is bigger than California
and nearly as big as Spain. The warm Gulf Stream in the Atlantic
makes the whole country habitable but only 15 percent of the
population lives in its northern half.
	   With a climate characterized by long dark winters, and short
intensive summers when the sun never sets -- the midnight sun --
the north is not especially suited to agriculture but is cherished
by people who travel there to hike and enjoy the silence. Sweden's
northern mountain fauna includes such protected animals as wolves,
wolverines and bears.
	   The original inhabitants of northern Sweden were the Sami
people, previously called Lapps, who were pushed back as the
Swedish majority population expanded its settlements. About 17,000
Sami live in Sweden but only 3,000 still make their living from
traditional reindeer husbandry. Their herds, about 300,000 animals
in all, graze across large tracts.
	   Swedes consume a lot of energy. About half their electricity is
based on hydroelectric power, primarily from northern rivers, but
Parliament has decided that for environmental reasons, four wild
and scenic rivers in the north will not be harnessed.
	   The rest of Sweden's electricity comes mainly from nuclear
reactors, whose continued use is being widely questioned by the
public. After an advisory referendum in 1980, Parliament decided
that the use of nuclear power should be phased out by 2010.
	   In February 1997 the Inter-Party Agreement on energy policy
concluded that the two reactors in Barseback are to be
decommissioned in 1998 and 2001 respectively. A final year for the
total phasing out of nuclear power has not been determined.

Israeli defense minister raises hope for restarting peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with elaboration of quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
Sunday offered hope for restarting the Middle East peace process,
saying his government colleagues will ``soon'' reach an agreement
on pulling back troops from West Bank.
	   After talks with Jordan's King Hussein, Mordechai told reporters
that he hoped ``Israel and the Palestinians will find a way to move
forward with the peace process.''
	   Hussein, speaking alongside Mordechai, said: ``After hearing
Defense Minister Mordechai I am more optimistic.''
	   Only Israeli reporters and those working for Jordan's state-run
television and news agency, Petra, were allowed at the impromptu
news conference. The Associated Press later obtained a transcript
of their comments.
	   The comments by Mordechai, a dove in the Israeli government,
tempered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's statement earlier
Sunday that no accord was imminent on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Netanyahu told reporters after a Cabinet meeting: ``We're
working toward reaching an agreement. We're not there yet.''
	   Mordechai, however, told the Israeli and Jordanian reporters
that his government will ``soon'' reach an agreement on troops
pullout from West Bank.
	   Asked if that would happen in days or weeks, Mordechai again
said ``soon,'' and refused to elaborate.
	   ``There are some projects and some ideas that need to be
encouraged by everyone _ in the Israeli side, in the Palestinian
side,'' he said. Mordechai returned to Israel later Sunday.
	   In recent days, speculation had grown that Israel is close to a
decision on an American initiative _ already accepted by the
Palestinian _ that would leave 40 percent of the West Bank under
full or partial Palestinian control and restrict Jewish settlement
expansion.
	   Under the U.S. plan, as reported last week by Israeli media,
Israel would withdraw troops in three stages over 12 weeks. The
Palestinian currently have full control over 3 percent of the West
Bank and partial control over another 24 percent.
	   Mordechai had made a similar visit to Egypt last Tuesday to meet
with President Hosni Mubarak, and is planning to meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat soon, Victor Nahmias, a counselor
at the Israeli Embassy, said.
	   Nahmias earlier said that Mordechai's mission was to brief
Hussein on ``the cautious optimism which surfaced recently on the
issue of the second troop deployment in the West Bank.'' He
declined to elaborate.

Kosovo crisis could derail high-level Balkan meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Fighting in Kosovo and Yugoslavia's
refusal to allow what it considers foreign meddling in the troubled
province could derail a meeting of Balkan foreign ministers.
	   Foreign Ministers from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia,
Romania and Yugoslavia will attend the two-day meeting that starts
Monday, while Bosnia and Slovenia have sent deputy ministers. They
are nominally to discuss economic cooperation and the region's
communications, energy and transportation infrastructure.
	   But sources close to the foreign ministers said Sunday that
Yugoslavia's refusal to allow any reference to the
Albanian-dominated secessionist Serbian province of Kosovo could
torpedo a joint declaration calling for closer regional
cooperation.
	   Meeting along the shores of the Bosporous, which separates
Europe from Asia, the foreign ministers will also set the agenda
for a meeting of their heads of state next fall.
	   Yugoslavia has made it clear that it will not accept any
reference to Kosovo in the Istanbul Declaration, something the
other ministers say they will not swallow.
	   Traditional rivals Greece and Turkey have put aside their own
thorny disputes and are working together to try and convince the
Yugoslavs to accept some kind of compromise in order not to
diminish the importance of the meeting.
	   A possible compromise would be a reference calling for the
return of thousands of Kosovo Albanians who have fled across the
border during the recent fighting.
	   It would be qualified with a call for a solution inside the the
current borders of Yugoslavia.
	   Diplomats expressed concern, however, that a compromise
declaration would be too watered down.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2.2 million
inhabitants, and most demand to secede from Serbia and Yugoslavia.
Western powers are against any change of borders in the volatile
Balkans, but want the Serbs to cease their offensive and give
Kosovo the autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989 as a way to
suppress the independence movement.

	   When East Timor Archbishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo stepped up
to accept the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo in 1996, he joined a long
line of distinguished Nobel laureates.
	   Yet Alfred Nobel was Swedish, not Norwegian, and he lived a
long, valuable life in which he amassed a great fortune and
contributed much of it back through the philanthropic activities
and prizes bearing his name.
	   He is the inventor of dynamite, an explosive which played and
continues to play an important role in the industrial development
of the world. Nobel was a thus a benefactor of humankind, and he
stipulated that all winners of the award bearing his name should
share that distinction.
	   Nobel was born in Stockholm in 1833 and moved with his family to
St. Petersburg, then the capital of Russia, when he was 9. His
father was an inventor and industrialist, and Nobel subsequently
lived in several countries, coming to see himself as a citizen of
the world. Even so, he never gave up his Swedish citizenship.
	   Nobel read, spoke and wrote fluently in Swedish, Russian,
English, French and German, and his numerous handwritten letters
attest to this proficiency.
	   His great wealth can be attributed to his ability to combine the
qualities of astute scientist and inventor with those of the
far-sighted and dynamic industrialist.
	   His fortune was founded on his inventions. At his death in 1896,
he held 355 patents, and it was around these that he had
established companies in some 90 locations in 20 countries. Most of
Nobel's capital came from his industrial activities in Britain,
France, Germany, Sweden and Russia.
	   In his will, Nobel stipulated that the major part of his estate
was to be converted into a foundation and invested in ``safe''
securities. The value of Nobel's original capital has increased in
real terms; its market value in 1995 being Swedish krona 2.3
billion (US$345 million). The Nobel Foundation is not connected
with the companies around the world which still bear the Nobel
name.
	   Experience had taught Nobel to dislike and distrust lawyers, and
late in 1895 he made out his final will without any professional
advice of assistance. This will, which superseded two previous
ones, stipulated that the income from his estate should be divided
annually into five equal parts and distributed ``in the form of
prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the
greatest benefit on mankind''.
	   He prescribed that the prizes should be distributed as follows:
	   ``One part to the person or persons who shall have made the most
important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part
to the person who shall have made the important chemical discovery
or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most
important discovery in the domain of physiology or medicine; one
part to the person who shall have produced the in the field of
literature the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency; and
one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best
work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction
of standing armies and for holding and promoting peace
congresses.''
	   He also prescribed that in distribution of the prizes, ``no
consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the
candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize,
whether he is a Scandinavian or not.''
	   Legally, however, the will did not actually bequeath the estate
to anyone, and when it was read in January 1897 it was strongly
contested by some of Nobel's relatives. Furthermore, Nobel had not
approached the different institutions concerned to ascertain if
they were willing to assume responsibility for awarding the prizes.
	   Politicians criticized the idea on the whole, and King Oskar of
Sweden and Norway (the countries were joined in a union at the
time) was skeptical of it for various reasons. More than three
years past before the matter was settled, and it was then decided
to organize the Nobel Foundation as legatee and administrator of
the Nobel fund capital, while different bodies named in the will
agreed to undertake the responsibility of awarding the prizes.
	   There are five special Nobel Committees attached to the
prize-awarding bodies. Each of these has five members, and each
committee may call upon outside experts for additional advice.
	   The joint administrative body is the Nobel Foundation in
Stockholm. The principal task of its Board of Directors is to
administer the funds and other properties deriving from Alfred
Nobel's estate.
	   Those qualified to propose candidates for prizes are: previous
Nobel laureates in their respective fields; members of the
prize-awarding bodies and of the Nobel Committees in the relevant
spheres; professors in the various fields either at specific
universities or those selected through special invitation by the
respective prize-awarding bodies; chairmen of representative
authors' organizations (literature); members of certain
international parliamentary or legal organizations (peace); and
members of parliaments or governments (peace).
	   Anyone proposing himself for a Nobel prize is automatically
disqualified. Only individuals belonging to these bodies have the
right to propose a candidate, not the organization as such. Since
neither the Swedish or Norwegian authorities have any influence
whatsoever on the prize decisions, no official representation or
support in favor a certain candidate is of any avail.
	   Awards are given annually on December 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death. Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or
Medicine, Literature and the Prize in Economic Sciences are
presented by the Swedish monarch in Stockholm, while the Peace
Prize is given the same day in Oslo.
	   The Nobel Prizes are widely recognized as the world's highest
civic honors. Besides spurring recipients and possible candidates
to new efforts, they have served to make scientific and literary
achievements, as well as humanitarian contributions, much more
widely known than otherwise would have been the case.
	   Through his creativity and good works, Alfred Nobel displayed
the very best of the human spirit. The Nobel Prizes are his
continuing legacy to those people who have followed in his worthy
footsteps through their own humanitarian acts.

	   The end of the Cold War and political division of Europe has
changed Sweden's foreign and security policy situation. It has
created new opportunities to participate in the process of
integration and in the emerging new security structure in Europe.
	   Sweden has been a full member of the European Union (EU) since
January 1995. It now participates in the EU decision-making
process.
	   Following dramatic changes in Central and Eastern Europe, Sweden
has taken part in the task of securing democracy and new security
structures for the continent as a whole.
	   Sweden has also taken up observer status in the Western European
Union. It also actively participates in the Partnership For Peace
and has contributed forces to UNPROFOR and IFOR/SFOR in the former
Yugoslavia. It is a member of the UN Security Council for
1997/1999.
	   A strong and independent national defense system is a
fundamental element of Sweden's security policy. Its armed forces
is based on general male conscription.
	   Other basic elements are the promotion of human rights,
democracy and the rule of law, international disarmament and
protection of the environment. There is far-reaching cooperation
between the Nordic countries in social welfare, cultural affairs
and a joint labor market.
	   Industry and economy
	   At the beginning of this century, Sweden was a largely agrarian
economy, and one of the poorest nations in Europe. However, a rich
domestic supply of iron ore, timber and water power, as well as
skilled engineers and a qualified workforce has transformed Sweden
into a modern welfare state.
	   Despite its modest share of GDP (21 percent in 1996),
manufacturing still plays a dominant role in Swedish exports. In
1996, manufactured products accounted for more than 80 percent of
total exports. Large international companies such as Ericsson, ABB,
Electrolux, Volvo and Saab account for nearly 60 percent of
employment in manufacturing and more than 80 percent of exports of
manufactured products.
	   About 460,000 small and medium sized enterprises, mostly in
services and oriented toward the home market, employ close to 1.4
million people. Although these enterprises generally remain small,
they account for most of the net job creation in the private sector
since the mid 1980s.
	   Iron ore mines are situated in the far north, with production
mainly being exported. Cheap hydropower was a major factor in
Sweden's industrial development.
	   Sweden is also a relatively important exporter of technically
more sophisticated productions like telecommunications equipment,
specialized machinery and motor vehicles. Science-based products --
for example pharmaceuticals -- account for about 10 percent of
manufacturing value added.
	   Sweden's vast forests of spruce, pine and other softwoods supply
a highly developed sawmill, pulp, paper and finished wood product
industry. And despite high domestic consumption, Sweden exports
about 60 percent of its forest products.
	   Indonesia
	   The bilateral relations between Sweden and Indonesia are broad
and deep, shown not least by the fact that Sweden was one of the
first European countries to open an Embassy in Indonesia after the
proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia.
	   Today, relations can be said to emphasize trade, with most of
the major Swedish companies represented in Jakarta doing business.
	   Sweden is now offering a larger development cooperation
assistance, which has, in some ways, been concentrated on the
forestry sector. Since Sweden, like Indonesia, has large forest
resources, there is a large scope for cooperation in this area.
Other cooperation projects include air traffic safety, medical
registration systems and quality management developments, among
others.
	   Within the area of cultural exchange, much has been achieved but
much, of course, remains to be done. The interest for Indonesia in
Sweden is growing, shown not in the least by the growing numbers of
Swedish tourists that each year visit Indonesia.
	   Although small, the number of Swedish students studying Bahasa
Indonesia is growing by each year. The Swedish Lund University has
an exchange program with Gadjah Mada University, and Swedish
students can be found in Yogyakarta as well as in Jakarta and other
places. The number Indonesian students to Sweden, enrolling in
everything from master courses to short-term courses, is also
growing.

	   In every country, the people's pride can be especially expressed
during national day celebrations. While the national days of
countries like Indonesia, the Philippines or the U.S. are fairly
common knowledge, the founding of those of other countries might
need to be given in an abridged history lesson for us to understand
the origins of national days.
	   In Sweden, one of the first dates to be held in esteem was
November 6, 1632, observing the death of King Gustavus Adolphus,
who died during the Battle of Lutzen against German Imperial
forces, though this is no longer celebrated.
	   At around the turn of the century (1900), many Swedes wanted
fervently to have a national day, like other countries. But this
enthusiasm was postponed with the advent of WW I.
	   What originally resulted, from private initiatives, was Swedish
Flag Day, which was celebrated on June 6. This date was chosen
because Gustav Vasa, who delivered Sweden from a Middle Ages forced
union with Denmark, was elected King of Sweden on June 6, 1523. It
was chosen because on that date in 1809 the first Swedish
Constitution was signed.
	   For the first time, on June 6, 1916, the king of Sweden
presented the flag to various corporations in a parade at Stockholm
Stadium. The presentation was subsequently moved to Skansen
open-air museum. This was continued until 1983, when June 6
officially became Swedish National Day.
	   And even though this is Sweden's national day, the country does
not take a holiday for it. Instead, holding flag presentations and
ceremonial speeches in many cases is done in the evening. The royal
presentation of flags is still held at Skansen.

	   Swedish Ambassador to Indonesia Mikael Lindstrom was interviewed
earlier this week on his opinion on economic and industrial issues
in Indonesia from the Swedish perspective, now that they are of
such critical importance to Indonesia.
	   Lindstrom mentioned, clearly with some pride, that firms from
his homeland were resolutely sticking to their investments here
despite the recent upheaval and dire economic situation.
	   ``At our regular business gatherings, I see that firms like
Volvo, Ericsson, Electrolux, ball-bearing manufacturer SKF,
welding-equipment supplier ESAB, mining-equipment maker Atlas Copco
and many others are here to stay. I am amazed and heartened that
there has been no mass stampede out.''
	   Lindstrom believed the companies realized the country's huge
economic potential and its strategic place within a shrinking
world.
	   Swedish products are a perfect match for what Indonesia needs,
he added.
	   ``We do not produce much in the way of commodities but we're
high-tech. We focus on distribution of electricity, heavy trucks
and telecommunications. With Indonesia growing very quickly,
companies like Erickson, Skaern or pulp machinery company Kvaerner
saw the potential.
	   ``Indonesia needed these things, and we had the potential to
supply.''
	   He described the relationship as additionally beneficial because
it provides Indonesia with more options than relying solely on the
traditional industrial giants.
	   ``Indonesia does not just have to depend on the U.S., Japan or
Germany. There are no political strings attached to our
relationship, either.''
	   Political ties between the countries are long-standing.
	   ``We have a much older relationship than people understand,''
Lindstrom said at his office in Kuningan.
	   ``There was an Embassy here in 1951, right at the beginning of
the country's independence.''
	   It is a long-term relationship which ``cuts both ways'', he
said.
	   This country was always interesting to us because of Indonesia's
important regional role, such as the Asia-Africa Conference in
Bandung, the founding of ASEAN, the Cambodia conflict and South
China Sea issues.''
	   Lindstrom hoped Indonesia would learn from the downturn to
emerge better and stronger in the future.
	   ``Many countries, including Sweden, have experienced crises. But
it makes us reappraise and forces us to restructure. This kind of
hardship is nothing we ever wish on people, but there can be
constructive, forward effects.''
	   Political and economic turmoil can lead to the pointing of
xenophobic fingers at the outside but he cautioned against an
isolationist stance.
	   ``I hope Indonesia will stick to what it has been doing.
Obviously, there might be parts of the public who don't understand
and there can be that jingoistic element. But the intellectual
establishment understands very well that economic reforms should
maintain Indonesia's participation in the global economic system,
within the framework of the World Trade Organization, and that this
is to the great benefit of the country.''
	   Lindstrom also championed the ``people-to-people'' interaction
of cultural exchanges and tourism as vital in bringing two
far-flung, culturally disparate nations closer together.
	   ``The human dimension is very important. For instance, we have
an academic exchange program with Lund in Sweden and Gadjah Mada
University (Yogyakarta). We often send orchestras and ballet
troupes here, and Indonesia regularly sends dance groups to Sweden.
	   More Indonesians are also choosing Sweden as a stop
off-the-beaten track of Europe's most popular holiday destinations.
	   ``These are people who choose to go a little beyond Rome, London
or Amsterdam. Stockholm is a very beautiful city, and Sweden is
safe, not expensive and the natural areas are good.''
	   As international travel shrinks the world, and once-exotic
destinations now lie within reach of the average traveler,
Lindstrom said more of his compatriots are visiting Indonesia on
vacation.
	   ``Bali is very appreciated for organized tourism, and the people
do discover more than just the tourist trappings.''
	   Lindstrom did not downplay the contribution of the oft-maligned
``backpacker'' set -- 20-something tourists who have saved up to
see the world before they embark on their careers.
	   ``These people are important to the future; they will be the
doctors, lawyers and leaders. Whenever I meet governors or police
chiefs in the provinces, I always emphasize that later on these
tourists will remember the time they spent in, say, Padang, or
Sumbawa.
	   ``This is the whole point of people building relationships.''
	   Set to end his ambassadorial stint this August, after four years
here, Lindstrom has his own fond memories.
	   He also sees a lot more that Sweden can do as Indonesia starts
to get back on its feet.
	   ``There are a whole range of areas where we have capability and
insight. For instance, in Stockholm, there is an international
institute on electoral processes. Clearly, that is something that
people here want to know more about now.''
	   Indonesians can learn from the example of their Swedish
counterparts in areas as diverse as traffic safety and forestry,
gleaning what fits with their needs.
	   ``I think as Indonesia develops, it will be interested in
drawing on the experience of others on how they do things. In
Sweden we always try to identify valuable experiences elsewhere and
this has been a great benefit.
	   ``In the same way, Indonesia will generally do well through
carefully scrutinizing the options, choosing, dissecting and
adapting to its own circumstances.''

U.S. Commerce Secretary seeks Ulster-American business ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley arrived Sunday at the start of a five-day push for new
business links between America and the north of Ireland following a
peace agreement in this British province.
	   ``This region has much to offer _ an educated, skilled and
motivated workforce,'' said Daley, before heading for dinner with
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam at Hillsborough
Castle, her official residence southwest of Belfast.
	   The visit by Daly with a delegation of executives from 17 top
U.S. companies comes two weeks after voters in Northern Ireland and
the Irish Republic ratified the Belfast peace accord.
	   ``President Clinton has been committed to the peace process and
asked me to lead this mission because he believes, as I do, that
peace and economic opportunity go hand in hand,'' Daley said.
	   The trip will highlight the already substantial U.S. business
interests in Northern Ireland and the five counties of the Irish
Republic that border the British-ruled province.
	   Daley made no specific promises of new investment in advance of
consultations with business leaders in Belfast on Monday, Northern
Ireland's second-largest city of Londonderry on Tuesday, and the
western Irish port of Sligo on Wednesday.
	   On Thursday he is scheduled to meet Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern in Dublin before flying back to Washington.
	   Among the delegation are Richard James, European regional
president of The Boeing Co. of Seattle; James Smith, president of
of the industrial group of Fluor Daniel Inc. of Irvine, Calif.;
William Farley, chairman of Fruit of the Loom Inc. of Chicago;
Eugene Murphy, vice chairman of General Electric Co. of Fairfield,
Conn.; John Mitchell, vice chairman of Motorola Inc. of Schaumberg,
Ill.; Arnold Donald, senior vice president of Monsanto Co. of St.
Louis; and Henry McKinnell, president of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals of
New York City.
	   On Monday Daley will address council members at Belfast City
Hall and speak to employees at a factory of the Canadian-owned
aerospace firm Short Brothers PLC, Northern Ireland's largest
private-sector employer and a Boeing subcontractor.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Finland's two-time winner of the world
driving championships, Tommi Makinen, was forced out of the
Acropolis Auto Rally on the opening day Sunday when his Mitsubishi
developed electrical problems.
	   Driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo V, Makinen with co-driver Risto
Mannisenmaki, was dropped from the rally when he did not show up on
time for the second special stage because of the technical problem.
	   Later, organizers had to cancel that stage when thousands of
spectators clogged the roads, making fast driving impossible.
	   Of the 103 cars which set off from the foot of the Athens
Acropolis hill, 80 are still in the gruelling rally.
	   Unlike previous races, this year's rally will end in the western
town of Delphi. The ancient Greeks considered Delphi to be the
center of the world. It was also the site of the oracle that
ancient Greeks consulted for prophesies of the future.
	   Britain's Richard Burns and co-driver Robert Reid in a
Mitsubishi Carisma GT lead the list of participants at the end of
the first day with one hour, 18 minutes, 28 seconds. They are only
two seconds ahead of Colin McRae, also of Britain, with co-driver
Nicky Grist in a Subaru Impreza WRC.
	   Spain's Carlos Sainz, presently at the top of the general
classification for the world driving championship and last year's
Acropolis rally winner, was in sixth place with 59 minutes 37.7.
	   Drivers will cover 1,036 kilometers (647 miles) through Greece's
best and worst roads in the three-day rally.

	   Incoming Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said yesterday it was
unlikely the Ramos administration would deliver on its promise to
post a P1-billion fiscal surplus in the first half of the year.
	   ``It is highly unlikely that we will have surplus by turnover,''
said Diokno.
	   He said he doubted the current deficit in the country's fiscal
position could be reversed less than a month before the new
government takes over.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada is set to take over from
President Fidel Ramos on June 30.
	   Despite a P2-billion surplus posted in April, the country's
fiscal position was still at a deficit of about P11.37 billion.
	   Finance officials have blamed the deficit on poor revenue
collections and incentives granted to investors.
	   Diokno, a budget undersecretary under former President Corazon
Aquino, said there was nothing alarming over a fiscal deficit
during an economic slowdown, ``but we should make up for it.''
	   ``If it is temporary, that's okay.But you should not sustain
it,'' he said.
	   Diokno said a long-running deficit would send signals that
government was incapable of spending within its means.
	   He said any fiscal deficit should only represent 2% of gross
domestic product for the economy to stay healthy.
	   Acting Budget Secretary Emilia Boncodin said earlier a
P5-billion fiscal surplus by the end of the year was hardly
possible unless imports recovered or some state-owned assets were
immediately privatized.
	   A ranking finance official had said a P50-billion deficit that
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted appeared
inevitable, particularly with the incoming administration's plan to
scrap the gross receipts and documentary stamp taxes.
	   In its latest review, the IMF said it did not see any progress
in tax administration and recommended that government tighten its
watch on the country's biggest taxpayers.
	   Collections from the country's top 10 taxpayers dropped 33.5% to
P2.113 billion in the first quarter.
	   The finance official said the Estrada administration would lose
as much as P26 billion should it push through with plans to remove
these taxes.
	   Diokno said, however, he would focus on spending and prioritize
government financing rather than on taxation.
	   ``It is a wrong strategy to focus on taxation to reduce the
deficit,'' he said.
	   He said there was a need for government to rationalize
incentives given to firms registered with the Board of Investments
(BOI).
	   ``The sooner we rationalize (the incentives), the better. We
should reduce them and make them universally applicable rather than
have the BOI and government-chosen winners enjoy the incentives,''
he said.
	   The country's balance of payments (BOP), meanwhile, climbed to a
surplus of $2.05 billion from January to the middle of May.
	   The country's BOP surplus was $1.8 billion by mid-April.
	   Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Managing Director Amando Tetangco
Jr. said the improvement in the current account and inflows from
loans and investments propped up the country's external account.
	   The central bank borrowed $750 million in a club loan and
government raised $492 million from its 10-year global bond in the
period.
	   Tetangco did not give any other details, other than to say the
central bank did not buy any dollars in the foreign exchange market
between the end of April to May 14.

FIFA takes time off presidential race to honor soccer greats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SLOBODAN LEKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA opened its pre-World Cup Congress Sunday, a
two-day session that will be highlighted by the election of its
first new president in 24 years.
	   A tight vote is expected Monday in the bitter race between
Lennart Johansson, the head of Europe's UEFA union, and Sepp
Blatter, FIFA's general secretary, over who will succeed Brazilian
industrialist Joao Havelange as the head of the world's largest
sports federation.
	   ``I'm confident going into tomorrow morning into this
election,'' Blatter said.
	   Johansson, holding a separate press conference, matched him
almost word for word.
	   `I'm very confident of victory,'' said Johansson, showing off a
long table of supporters from each continent, including Brazil's
Pele. ``See what kind of people are surrounding me.''
	   As the anticipated heightened, the world soccer governing body
took time off from its war of succession to honor a dozen great
players and promoters with its own Order of Merit.
	   Those awarded included Germany's former international Gerd
Muller, described as ``one of the deadliest goal-poachers in
football history;'' Brazil's stellar goalkeeper Gilmar, ``the last
line of defense (in the 1950s-60s) where all the spotlight was on
the forwards;'' and U.S. women's national team forward Michelle
Akers, ``an outstanding representative of women's football.''
	   Also awarded FIFA's top medal was South African President Nelson
Mandela for his role in reintegrating his country into world soccer
after an absence from 1976 to 1992 because of its apartheid
policies.
	   ``He is being honored for his tremendous contribution to
reuniting football in his country in the post-apartheid period,''
declared Havelange.
	   The glitzy ceremony appeared designed to cover up deep rifts
that have appeared within FIFA in the past 2 1/2 months, after
Blatter announced he would challenge Johansson for the presidency.
	   While no future president is expected to repeat Havelange's
quarter-century tenure, the ballot may prove crucial in determining
the direction in which world soccer will develop well into the next
century.
	   Johansson has accused Blatter of being Havelange's hand-picked
choice for the top position, while Blatter's camp has denounced
Johansson as a puppet of the powerful German and Italian soccer
federations.
	   The two men are estimated to have spent well over a million
dollars on the rowdy campaign, an unprecedented amount for a
traditionally tightlipped organization where behind-the-scenes
deals are the usual modus operandi.
	   Most analysts agree that Johansson would move to break the
stranglehold that Europe and the South America have maintained over
FIFA by giving African and Asian nations a more prominent voice.
However, Blatter has vowed to bring the World Cup to Africa in
2006.
	   After it admits four new members during its current congress,
the 94-year-old association will number 202 national committees,
more than the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee,
or any other world body.

	   International rating agency Fitch IBCA yesterday said the rising
number of bad loans would affect the earnings outlook of the top
five Philippine banks.
	   Fitch IBCA said non-performing loans would rise beyond 10% of
the total commercial loans by the end of the year, up from 6.7% at
the end of February and 4.7% at the end of 1997.
	   ``Rising non-performing loans and the need to raise higher
specific loan loss provisions will have an adverse affect on bank
profitability,'' Fitch IBCA said in a statement where it assigned
its ratings on the top five banks.
	   It added banks would tend to tighten their credit due to
concerns over problem loans specially foreign currency loans and
loans to the slumping property sector.
	   Fitch, however, said the major banks can weather the financial
crisis given their high capital base and wide net interest margins,
mainly due to large pools of low cost deposit funds.
	   It gave a C/D rating to Bank of the Philippine Islands, Far East
Bank and Trust Co., Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co., and Philippine
Commercial International Bank.
	   ``Fitch IBCA's ratings reflect the banks' deteriorating
operating environment rather than the fundamentals of the banks
themselves,'' it said.
	   Fitch, however, gave a lower rating of D/E to Philippine
National Bank.
	   ``The high interest rate environment has taken a greater toll on
its borrowers than has been the experience of other large banks. It
also appears that PNB maintains exposures to most of the troubled
high profile corporates, and should endure a deterioration from a
lower asset quality base,'' Fitch added.

Tehran mayor goes on trial for corruption, pleads not guilty

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi went on
trial for corruption Sunday, and suffered his first setback when
the court refused to declare itself incompetent to hear the case.
	   Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejaei ruled that Karbaschi, 44, had
no basis to claim that the court lacked the jurisdiction to hear
the case, Iranian state-run television reported.
	   Mohseni will explain his ruling in detail in the next session,
scheduled for Thursday, the television reported.
	   Appearing before a packed courtroom at the Imam Khomeini
Judiciary Complex in central Tehran, Karbaschi also pleaded
innocent and said the charges of embezzlement, fraud and
mismanagement of public funds against him were trumped up.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by the hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who took office in
August. Karbaschi had run Khatami's election campaign.
	   ``All of the charges against me are absolute lies. I don't
accept any of them,'' the black-bearded Karbaschi told the judge, a
cleric, wearing a white turban and brown robe.
	   Karbaschi's arrest on April 4 revealed a long-simmering power
struggle between moderate and hard-line clerics. Karbaschi was
freed April 15 after a series of street protests turned violent,
forcing Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, considered
an ally of hard-liners, to intervene.
	   The case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of stories
for and against the popular mayor.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding any government post. The trial is expected to
last for weeks.
	   As Karbaschi left the courthouse, about 200 supporters greeted
him with shouts of ``Long live Karbaschi.'' Another 50, standing
nearby, yelled, ``Death to Karbaschi.''
	   Some 130 citizens attended the trial, along with about 70
journalists. A crowd of several hundred watched the four-hour
hearing on two television screens outside the courthouse, where
extra police were assigned to keep order.
	   Karbaschi's troubles began when Chief Judge Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, a hard-liner, accused him of involvement in a wide-ranging
corruption scandal and ordered him detained.
	   More than a dozen senior municipality officials have been put on
trial in the scandal since last October. Most were accused of _ or
sentenced for _ issuing building permits in restricted zones in
return for large kickbacks.

	   SINGAPORE-Arianespace, the world's first commercial space
transportation company, has shuddered from the currency turmoil in
Southeast Asia but remained confident it could weather the crisis
and even up its market share in the coming months - thanks partly
to Europe's high expectations stirred by preparations for the
launching of the Euro.
	   In a press briefing here, Arianespace Chair and Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Marie Luton said that although the ''negative
influence'' of the currency crisis ''caused the delay of a certain
number of programs,'' he believed an economic rebound in the region
would not be far ahead.
	   Arianespace controls more than half of the global market share.
	   Luton did not give details on the extent of Asian crisis' effect
on his company's operations, but a senior Arianespace official told
reporters after the briefing that the firm's market contracted by
an average of 15% in the past months. The official stressed,
however, that the satellite business in the region would likely
perk up again in two years.
	   Luton stated that the Asian problem was not very different from
the one experienced in 1992 by Britain and Italy whose respective
currencies - pound and lira - suffered devaluation but recovered
quickly.
	   ''So although we are not economists we are all obliged to make
economic judgments when we are in business and our judgment is that
there is every reason to expect a rebound in the region's
economies,'' Luton maintained.
	   The Arianespace executive said the optimism was largely fueled
by the likelihood of an ''unprecedented period of growth'' for
Europe and the ''efficiencies that monetary union will
bring.''Europe will have a single currency - Euro - by January
1999. The development, Luton pointed out, ''will benefit all
economies and will help the recovery of Southeast Asia.'' Moreover,
Arianespace, according to Luton, acknowledged the immensity of the
Asian market which has 413 million television households - more
than four times larger than the United States.' The figure is
expected to grow to 516 million by 2007 while cable and satellite
homes are projected to reach 160 million in the same year from the
current 82 million.
	   The Asia-Pacific region alone is being served by 34 satellites
in orbit and 26 more are being planned for launch in the next few
years, as against North and South America's combined total of 45 in
orbit and 18 being readied for launch.
	   ''Put into this context, the absolute number of satellites
planned for Asia-Pacific does not seem unreasonable,'' Luton
explained adding that Arianespace has launched 25 satellites in the
region since 1987, or roughly two every year.
	   Arianespace launched four satellites in 1996, five in 1997, and
one this year. Seven more would be launched in the region over the
next two years - including ones for India, Singapore, Indonesia,
South Korea, Laos, and Japan. In the past nine years, Arianespace
has launched two-thirds of the West's telecommunications
satellites.
	   Arianespace, formed in March 1980 and capitalized at 270 million
francs, has 53 shareholders ''representing the technical,
financial, and political capabilities'' of 12 European countries -
France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Arianespace's
headquarters is in Evry near Paris.
	   Arianespace reported global net sales of 4.6 billion francs in
1994, 7.02 billion francs in 1995, and 6.3 billion in 1996.
	   Net profits reached 140 million francs in 1994, 190 million in
1995, and 135 million in 1996.

	   Alsons Cement Corp. (Alcem), the construction arm of Alsons
Consolidated Resources (ACR), posted a 22% increase in its
consolidated sales from P2.3 billion in 1996 to P2.8 billion last
year. This was reported by Alcem officials during the firm's annual
stockholders meeting held recently at the Shangri-La Hotel in
Makati.
	   ``The past year established new milestones for Alcem on the road
toward its singular vision and strategic intent to become a
dominant cement and construction products manufacturer in the
Southeast Asian region,'' Alcem President Tomas I. Alcantara said.
	   Alcem's increase in consolidated sales, according to Alcantara,
came from a 16% increase in cement sales volume, ending last year
with total sales of 1.4 million metric tons (MT). ``The resulting
net income contribution to ACR by Alcem and its subsidiaries was
P225.2 million, or 34% of total net income,'' headded.
	   Citing another achievement, Alcantara reported that last year,
``the company registered the highest levels for both clinker and
cement production in its entire corporate history.'' The firm's
cement facilities at Lugait, Misamis Oriental and Iligan, Lanao del
Norte surpassed their performance in 1996 as their total clinker
production went up by 17% to 1,078, 940 MT, and their cement
production likewise increased by 17% with a total of 1,438,793 MT.
	   The Alcem president also cited the expansion in dealership
network of affiliate Market Developers Inc. which is mainly engaged
in the marketing and distribution of construction products,
industrial equipment and agricultural machinery. ``From 604 dealers
in 1996, we currently have 946 dealers, 245 of which are located in
Luzon,'' he pointed out.
	   ''MADE will mark its strengthened entry to the Luzon market to
handle principally cement distribution in its effort to be the
leading distribution of construction-related materials,'' he said.
	   Alcem continued to diversity into cement-related products
through its subsidiary Alsons Construction Chemicals Inc. (Alchem),
which engaged in the production of 282,323 liters of cement
admixtures and grinding aids last year.
	   Products introduced by Alcem include plasticizers,
superplasticizers and retarders. These products reduce the
water-cement ratio thereby enhancing concrete performance and
workability.
	   According to Alcantara, while the past year was another record
year for operations, Alcem was looking forward to several major
events and prospects in 1998.
	   ``Our expansion plant project in Lugait, Misamis Oriental, the
flagship of our expansionary thrust, will commence operations in
the second half of the year and will serve the bigger market of
Luzon. This presents new opportunities and challenges for us,'' he
pointed out.
	   Elected to Alcem's new board of directors at the stockholder's
meeting were ACR Chair and President Nicasio I. Alcantara; C.
Alcantara and Sons Inc.
	   (CASI) President Editha I. Alcantara; Alcem President Tomas I.
Alcantara; ``Holderbank'' Financiere Glaris Ltd. Executive

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police on Sunday arrested 11 people on
drug charges after an all-night rave party on the island of Evia,
about 60 kilometers (37.5 miles) northeast of Athens, media reports
said.
	   An early morning routine police patrol around the wooded area of
Steni on Evia came across people allegedly leaving a rave party in
the area attended by around 300 people. Eleven people were arrested
after they were found to be in possession of small quantities of
heroin, marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy pills, local media said.

High-speed crash raises the question: Are we going too fast?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Train Derails; BC-Germany-Train Emergency Stop &QL; 
 &UR; By MELISSA EDDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The crash of InterCity Express 884 was
unimaginable.
	   In the confusing hours after the accident, police believed a car
found smashed in the wreckage had plunged from an overpass onto the
speeding train.
	   In fact, the likely cause was a flaw in the train itself: a
wheel had broken. The crash was no longer a freak accident but a
reality check for a country _ and a world _ where people want to go
faster and faster, to get there and back in a day.
	   Investigators still don't know how a wheel on Germany's premier
rail system could have broken, causing the train to derail and
smash into the supports of an overpass. Nearly 100 people were
killed.
	   It was the prospect of swift, yet safe, travel that drew
passengers back to the train in 1991 with the debut of the
InterCity Express, developed as an alternative to the expense of
air travel and the traffic jams of the German autobahn.
	   The trains have been running at top speeds of 280 kilometers
(175 miles) an hour for seven years without major technical
failures. But Wednesday's crash has forced both experts and
passengers to ask: Are we going too fast?
	   Spooked by the ICE wreck, Japan's main railway ordered emergency
inspections of the wheels and axles of its 1,100 high-speed bullet
trains, which run at a similar maximum speed.
	   The French, however, stayed cool. Though their 350 high-speed
trains edge Germany's by about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) an hour,
French officials believe their wheel system _ set at the coupling
between cars _ is more stable than the German model, located at the
end of each wagon.
	   Spain and Korea have opted for the French design, and plans in
the United States to open a high-speed line along the East Coast
also are based on the ``Train de Grande Vitesse.''
	   After the crash, German rail officials ordered all high-speed
trains to slow to 160 kilometers (100 miles) an hour. The original
ICE fleet has been recalled for ultrasound checks of the wheels.
	   Even so, passengers who once marveled at the speed have grown
wary.
	   After a 3 hour, 15 minute train trip Sunday from Essen to
Frankfurt, an American here on business said some of her fellow
passengers were commenting on how fast the train was going.
	   ``I looked out the window and thought, `Wow, this train really
IS going fast,''' said Betty Ann Murphy, 33, an art museum employee
from Washington, D.C.
	   And yet compared to cars and planes, trains are the safest way
to go - at least statistically. In Germany, nearly 11 people die in
traffic accidents per billion kilometers (620 million miles)
traveled. That's compared to three people who die in airplane
crashes over the same distance and fewer than one in trains.
	   Safety was a key concern when Germany built its high-speed
network, covering 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) to connect its
major cities.
	   Monitors in some 60 stations across the country are always in
radio contact with the InterCity Express trains, and can throw an
emergency brake if they lose contact with the train's engineer.
	   But the high speed puts much more stress on the ICE equipment.
Wheels wear down within months and require regular checkups every
two or three trips. As an added precaution, Transport Minister
Matthias Wissmann is now considering adding alarm systems to alert
drivers to problems in the wheels.
	   However, he will not consider permanently slowing the trains
down.

	   Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp. and Caltex (Philippines) Inc.
raised yesterday the prices of three deregulated petroleum products
by an average P0.40 a liter.
	   Gasoline dealers said Shell raised the prices of premium
gasoline by P0.44 to P12.05 a liter, unleaded gasoline by P0.45 to
P11.67 a liter and diesel by P0.34 to P8.36 a liter.
	   They said the adjustments were effective Wednesday midnight.
Pilipinas Shell, a member of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, is the
country's second biggest oil refiner.
	   Caltex, a joint venture of Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp.,
announced that it likewise raised the prices of premium gasoline by
P0.41 to P12.04 a liter, unleaded gasoline by P0.47 to P11.69 a
liter and diesel by P0.33 to P8.35 a liter.
	   The adjustment took effect at 2 p.m. yesterday, the company
said.
	   Pilipinas Shell and Caltex raised their prices a day after
Petron Corp., the country's biggest refiner, marked up its rates.
	   Petron, which is 40% owned by Saudi Aramco, raised the prices of
premium gasoline by P0.42 to P12.03 a liter, unleaded gasoline by
P0.42 to P11.69 and diesel by P0.31 to P8.36.
	   The oil firms said they had to adjust their prices because of
the higher landed cost of crude and the weak peso.
	   The price of Dubai crude went up $0.49 to $12.69 a barrel in May
from the previous month's level.
	   The peso slid to 39.32 last month from 36.43 in April.
	   These adjustments came following an announcement from the Energy
Regulatory Board that it would raise the prices of three
socially-sensitive oil products by an average P0.24 a liter.
	   Under a recently passed oil deregulation law, oil firms can
freely adjust prices of petroleum products except for regular
gasoline, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gasoline, which are
still under government control. -

	   The quality of a man's personality is seen in his upright
posture. The more relaxed a person is, the more he can achieve
centeredness. A stiff posture indicates an underlying menace or
defiance. The upright man learns to stay upright in a correct
manner. His weight descends normally along the strong patterns of
the muscle and bone alignment, without any tension showing anywhere
or any stiffening of the muscles, especially those of the legs.
	   If you stand correctly, you will be centered, balanced - able
and readyto consciously shift from rest to motion. This exercise of
standing is performed by consciously relaxing and allowing the
weight of the upper body to descend naturally, according to the
pull of gravity. Besides being more balanced from correct posture,
you can also determine whether or not you're a candidate for the
battle of the bulge.
	   Fat people are teased and harassed unmercifully when they are
children.
	   Thus, they learn to put on an armor of jovial good humor and wit
to cover their misery, or resort to petulant silence and grumbling.
By the time they mature, because their large digestive machinery
ensures the maximum utilization of food intake, they have gained
considerable size and strength, but most are mentally attuned to
being dominated.When they apply for work, the odds are stacked
against them because they are seen to be sometimes clumsy, slow,
accident-prone, and sweaty. Very fat people may be stared at in the
streets and avoided in buses, aircraft, or pubs, where they take up
too much room.
	   In an upright posture, you can measure the angle that the ribs
make where they join the bottom of the breastbone. If the angle is
greater than average, the abdomen is wide and deep with plenty of
room for large, digestive organs. But if the chest is comparatively
small, the lung capacity is also small. Studies show that this type
has greater strength but a tendency to be fat, with limited
stamina.
	   If the angle is smaller than average, the abdomen is narrow and
shallow with a small digestive system. But the chest is long with
comparatively large lungs. Such people have great stamina, but
their strength is poor, and they tend to be thin.
	   This angle is referred to as the ``Angle of Obesity.''
	   Dr. Victor Baker made extensive researches on the treatment of
heart and circulation with reference to posture and joint mobility.
In 1973, when Dr.
	   Baker was working as a school medical officer in England, he
conducted a study involving 143 children. He chose to work with
children because their degree of obesity had not yet been greatly
affected by their work patterns or posture. The children were
divided into several groups: normal, tending to be fat, fat,
tending to be thin, and thin.
	   His hypothesis of the ``Angle of Obesity'' was well founded, as
ne0 to 130 degrees.
	   Below 70 degrees, the children were skinny; above 110 degrees
they were definitely fat.
	   It is very easy to measure the angle of obesity. Simply run your
fingers down the front of your chest bone until the bone
disappears. Mark a cross on your skin there. Now, run your hand
down the lower border of your ribs on the left side and mark
another cross at the outer edge of this border, approximately where
your elbow touches the side of your chest. Do the same on the right
side. Now measure the angle between the side crosses and the center
cross with a protractor.
	   Anyone with an angle greater than 100 degrees is going to fight
the battle of the bulge all their life. For those with an angle
above 110 degrees, even the smell of food will make them put on
weight.

	   CHINAUTLA, Guatemala (AP) _ Guatemalans in 30 municipalities
turned out in huge numbers Sunday to elect mayors and city
councils.
	   Voting is obligatory in Guatemala, so even people with no
interest in the elections showed up at the ballot boxes.
	   ``I came to vote because I'm registered here, but I don't know
who the candidates are, and I don't know who I'll vote for,'' said
Maria del Rosario Munoz, a 27-year-old Indian in traditional dress
from this town six miles (10 kms) northwest of Guatemala City.
	   The elections Sunday were selecting local officials for 30 of
Guatemala's 320 municipalities, with 395,262 voters registered. The
mayors and town councils will be in power for 18 months, until
general elections next year replace them.

	   In the course of the last month or so, many stock brokerage
firms have been reducing their staff because of the decline in
their trading. To some extent this decline has been self inflicted
with the poor quality of their analytical work, which has tended to
be much too optimistic, with little real understanding of the
implications of the currency crisis and a failure to recognize the
dangers created by excessive over-construction of high-rise
buildings.
	   According to a report quoted on the Internet, there was
remarkably little resemblance between the forecast earnings of
companies which were supposedly analyzed by 12 brokerage houses,
andactual earnings results achieved by those companies. When work
is so obviously seen to be performed in such a sloppy manner, it
has a very disparaging impact on the integrity of underestimating
earnings than of overestimating them. Nobody complains if earnings
are better than indicated but everyone feels cheated when earnings
are below forecasted expectations.
	   An example of the published analytical anomalies is Petron,
which some analysts were estimating to have earnings of anything
between P2.6 billion and P4.6 billion. But, it actually achieved a
loss of P631 million. Such a wide disparity cans only mean that the
analysts concerned were hopelessly incompetent.
	   I have frequently been critical of locals analysts in this
column precisely because they have little regard for the real facts
of life and they tend to be promoters of their inflated dreams.
	   The fact of the matter is that there are very few stocks
available where the return on equity exceeds the costs of capital
which, put in more simple language, means that most shares are
expensive even at today's prices.
	   Furthermore, the shortfall in government revenues can only lead
to higher interest rates later in the year, and this will make most
issues in our stock markets look even more expensive.
	   This is not to suggest that there will not be some expectations
which will go against the trend, but these are more likely to be
found among those companies which have been out of favor for some
time. One such company is House of Investments (HI) which has
survived many crises in the past and which had substantial
interests in some 20 companies, among which is a 51% ownership of
EEI. I believe that there is a very good chance that HI will come
out of the current dull period with flying colors. It has had the
benefit of being out of favor for quite some time and of having
been largely ignored by the fraternity of analysts.

	   NANTES, France (AP) _ While many fans thought it was frustrating
getting tickets for the World Cup, just consider the plight of a
smaller group of people who simply want to attend a wedding during
the tournament.
	   According to FIFA, a couple identified only as Karl and Nadege
sent out wedding announcements with a special insert requesting
them to return their confirmations to attend with copies of their
automobile registration papers.
	   The reason was that the wedding is scheduled as the same day the
Spain-Nigeria match on June 13, and the Saint-Joseph de Porteri
church is within the security perimeter of La Beaujorie Stadium.
	   The requirement was necessary to get clearance for the wedding.
	   Karl and Nadege aren't the only ones who have the hassle. Four
other weddings at the church, all scheduled before the conclusion
of the July 3 quarterfinal in Nantes, must undergo the same
procedure.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Trying to reduce the illegal gambling
in the country, Thai police have established a World Cup gambling
task force in the hopes that it can cut into the 30 billion baht
(dlrs 750 million) expected to be wagered on the tournament.
	   The police also are bracing for an increase in suicides and
robberies in the anticipation that fortunes wagered _ and often
lost _ will lead to desperate acts.
	   Gambling is illegal in Thailand, but the laws are widely
ignored.
	   ``More student crimes will occur,'' said Deputy Minister Somsak
Prisana-nantakul. ``But what we're worried of is suicide by those
who cannot pay their debts.''
	   The case of university law student Rewat Kengsakul has
crystallized fears of how gambling can corrupt the young.
	   Rewat, 18, was arrested in April after using an air-gun to rob a
gold shop to clear a 9,000 baht (dlrs 225) gambling debt. He was
arrested with 33 gold chains in his possession and is currently
awaiting trial.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-ANDRE-DES-EAUX, France (AP) _ One Norwegian fan is staging
his own version of the Tour de France, an economical way to follow
his country's national team throughout its stay in the World Cup.
	   Peter Garden already has ridden his bicycle 1,800 kilometers
(1,100 miles) from Oslo to the team's training camp in the Loire
Valley and plans to follow them on his two-wheeler to Montpellier,
Bordeaux and Marseille.
	   Garden, sponsored by the Norwegian Football Federation, expects
to collect autographs of celebrities and players' jerseys, and then
auction them off on his way home to raise money for a charity that
caters to Third World orphans.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne, dropped from the English World Cup
side because of fitness problems related to late-night partying and
drinking, has been offered help from recovering alcoholics and
former teammates Tony Adams and Paul Merson.
	   ``I just hope he sorts out his life and can be happy,'' said
Adams, who stopped drinking two years ago. ``Only he can decide if
he has a problem, but if he wants to choose my path then he knows
where I am.''
	   Merson, who plays with Gascoigne on England's Middlesbrough
club, echoed Adams in interviews with the Independent on Sunday.
	   ``I hope he can find it inside himself to want to do something
about the way things have been with him,'' Merson said.

	   THE International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the reforms recently
carried out by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) were still not
enough to strengthen the banking sector.
	   The IMF noted that while the BSP increased the minimum
capitalization requirement of banks, it did not necessarily follow
that sufficient protection had been laid over the industry.
	   The institution even urged the Philippine Deposit Insurance
Corp. (PDIC) and the BSP to increase capital in lieu with the
general objective.
	   A ranking government official, who was informed of the results
of the deferred IMF review, disclosed Wednesday night that the IMF
had branded the move as ``little steps.''
	   The official also had one-on-one talks with the Bretton Woods
institution.
	   The IMF pointed out that BSP's directive to lift deposit secrecy
in case of banks granting loans for directors, owners,
stockholders, and related interests (Dosri) was also from the
prescribed modification of the Bank Secrecy Law.
	   The IMF and its sister institution, the World Bank, urged
government to further improve the transparency regulations of the
BSP over the banks' financial sheets. They said this could be done
through the revision of the law which central monetary authorities
and bankers had vehemently opposed.
	   Specifically, the IMF wanted bank examiners to be given direct
access to financial records.
	   The Fund realized current validation schemes of the BSP were
``imperfect''
	   given the more than 2,000 account records stocked in the
archives of PDIC estimated to be at P9 million.
	   ``No examiner should be prohibited from inspecting,'' the
official said.
	   ``With regards to that Dosri rule, they (BSP) moved just a
little bit when there was an opportunity to go miles ahead... The
increase in capital adequacy ratios was just the first step. With
this, you cannot say that you are already sound.''
	   The BSP last March pulled up banks' capital build-up to 60%
depending on the category of the banks. The move was in consonance
with the reform agenda outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Program (MEFP).
	   MEFP paved way to the two-year precautionary arrangement the BSP
and the Department of Finance forged with the IMF.
	   However, the official said PDIC President Ernest Leung junked
the IMF prescription. The suggestion is expected to encounter
similar resistance from the central monetary authority.
	   The official further said the IMF wanted the BSP to fully adopt
the Basle Core Principles which the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) had formulated.
	   The BIS is known as the main central bank based in Basle,
Switzerland.

	   Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello III defended yesterday a move
by government's chief lawyer to set aside a 12-year jail term
against former First Lady Imelda Marcos and acquit her of
corruption charges.
	   ``The duty of the (Office of the Solicitor General) is to
protect the innocent,'' Bello told reporters.''His client is not
only the government but also its people.''
	   The outgoing justice secretary, a Ramos appointee, said there
was nothing ``absurd'' about the solicitor general's recommendation
to the Supreme Court to acquit Mrs. Marcos.
	   ``The solicitor general can take a different position from that
originally taken by the government...in the interest of justice,''
said Bello.
	   Bello has already filed a courtesy resignation, and is set to
leave the justice department by the end of the month.
	   In a 34-page comment sent to the high court, Solicitor General
Romeo de la Cruz said state lawyers reviewed the case and found
that the prosecution failed to submit enough evidence to convict
Mrs. Marcos of the charge.
	   An anti-graft court in 1993 found the widow of the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos guilty of graft and sentenced her to 12 years in
jail.The Supreme Court upheld the verdict last January.
	   Mrs. Marcos had been found guilty of leasing state property to
the Philippine General Hospital Foundation Inc. (PGHFI), a private
foundation she headed, under terms allegedly disadvantageous to
government.The transaction occurred while the Marcoses were still
in power.
	   The property belonged to the Light Rail Transit Authority
(LRTA), which Mrs. Marcos also headed.
	   The two parcels of land were leased to PGHFI at P100,000 a
month.The foundation, through Mrs. Marcos, later entered into an
agreement with two companies that agreed to use the property at
P700,000 a month for 25 years.
	   De la Cruz said state prosecutors failed to establish that Mrs.
Marcos conspired with PGHFI and LRTA to defraud government.He said
the acquittal of then LRTA Vice President Jose Dans should also
work in Mrs. Marcos' favor.
	   The state action was the latest stroke of good fortune for the
Marcos family but it triggered criticisms from anti-Marcos
advocates.
	   ``There's a big question mark now about meting justice on the
Marcoses,''
	   said leftist leader Satur Ocampo, one of thousands of dissidents
tortured by the military during the Marcos era.
	   ``It looks like the political direction is re-accommodating the
Marcoses back to power and setting aside the grievances against
them for plundering the economy and violating human rights,''
Ocampo added.
	   Former Solicitor General Frank Chavez, who prepared the graft
case against Mrs. Marcos, was appalled by the state recommendation
and said he hoped the Supreme Court would stick to its ruling
upholding her conviction.
	   ``It seems to me that they are inching their way back (to
power),'' Chavez said. ``The only problem in this country is you
are presumed guilty until you are proven influential.
	   ``If she is eventually acquitted, then we lose everything. We
lose our right to attain vindication, we lose our right to obtain
justice and we lose the right to be ashamed of ourselves.''

	   Diversified concern Metro Pacific Corp. yesterday said the
consortium developing Fort Bonifacio at the edge ofMakati financial
district was still committed to the multi-billion peso project.
	   ``We have had recent discussions with all the shareholders of
BLC and they remain fully committed to supporting Fort Bonifacio,''
Metro Pacific Chair Manuel Pangilinan said in a statement.
	   Metro Pacific, the flagship corporation of the First Pacific Co.
Ltd. of Hongkong, is the leader in a 12-member Bonifacio Land Corp.
(BLC) developing the 214-hectare former military camp into the
country's next financial hub.
	   Pangilinan was reacting to newspaper reports saying BLC was
considering selling 64 hectares of the land back togovernment,
since it would not be able to pay the remaining P8.8 billion
balance by the end of the month.
	   Another option being considered by BLC was to pay the balance on
a five-year deferred payment scheme, Bases Conversion Development
Authority (BCDA) Chair Victorino Basco said on Wednesday.
	   He said BCDA, which is the original land owner of Fort
Bonifacio, would allow a deferred payment scheme only if BLC put up
a surety bond.
	   Basco was also quoted by newspapers saying BLC was having a
liquidity problem after several of its consortium members backed
out from the project due to the slumping property market.
	   ``Metro Pacific and First Pacific stand firmly behind the
project. First Pacific has significant free cash balances and as
such is in a position to fully support BLC and the Fort Bonifacio
project,'' Pangilinan added.
	   Metro Pacific, however, did not deny that negotiations were
ongoing regarding the payment of the P8.8 billion balance. BLC has
paid more than P20 billion for the right to develop the large tract
of land.
	   Metro Pacific lost 10 centavos yesterday to close at P1.26.

Admirals beat Claymores 26-23

	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Kurt Warner threw two touchdown
passes including the winner with 1:51 to play as the Amsterdam
Admirals defeated the Scottish Claymores 26-23 Sunday in the
season-ending NFL Europe game for both teams.
	   Trailing 23-20, Warner hit Juan Daniels with a 17-yard pass to
seal the victory. The Admirals finished 7-3 and the Claymores ended
2-8.
	   The Frankfurt Galaxy and Rhein Fire of Dusseldorf also finished
7-3 and will play each other on June 14 in the World Bowl in
Frankfurt, the championship game of NFL Europe.
	   The Admirals missed out because of a poorer record in
head-to-head games against the two German teams.
	   Warner, allocated from the St. Louis Rams, put the Admirals
ahead 7-0 with a 4-yard pass to Frank Temming with 7:02 left in the
first quarter.
	   The Claymores tied on a 3-yard run by J.J. Smith late in the
quarter, and then led at halftime on 40-yard, second-half field
goal by Jon Baker. Baker is allocated from the Miami Dolphins.
	   The Admirals went back ahead 13-10 on Malcolm Thomas's 4-yard
run in the third quarter, setting the stage for the wide-open final
quarter before a crowd of 8,762.
	   The Claymores Kory Blackwell returned an intercepted pass from
Warner 29 yards to give the Claymores a 17-13 lead. But the
Admirals Ralph Dawkins scored on a 10-yard to make it 20-17.
	   The Claymores then got a 42-yard field from Baker with 4:40 left
_ and a 30-yarder by Parker with 3:27 to play, to lead 23-20 and
set up Warner's winning pass.
	   Warner hit 12 of 29 for 187 yards with one interception and two
touchdowns.

	   Dr. Leo D. Yao,director of Innovative Technology Modules of
Intel Corp., will conduct a lecture on ``The Evolution of
Microprocessor Technology'' at the De La Salle University today,
12:40 to 2:20 p.m. at the Waldo Perfecto Seminar Room. His talk
will focus on technologies behind the Intel computer chips,
specially from the 1386 to current Pentium microprocessors, which
he helped develop.
	   Yao holds the record of being the first Filipino to achieve the
status of a Fellow at Intel Corp. His outstanding achievements and
ingenuity at work earned him this status. Yao has received four
Intel individual achievement awards.
	   A graduate of Electrical Engineering from San Carlos, Cebu City
in 1962, Yao was a co-inventor of the thermally simulated
capacitance transient techniques and published a number of papers
using the technique to determine the energy levels and emission
rates of deep level impurities in silicon.
	   He holds a master's degree in Electric Engineering from the
University of Minnesota, and a doctorate from the University of
Illinois.
	   Yao joined Intel Corp. in 1978, and has since received different
awards and recognition for his technical contributions to
technology developments. He has co-authored over 30 papers and
issued 20 US patents.
	   HI Earns P26.2M in Q1House of Investments (HI) earned P26.2
million in the first quarter of 1998 from revenues amounting to
P60.7 million.
	   Company officers said that although earnings in the first three
months were lower than the P35.3 million company made in the same
period last year, they represented a turnaround in performance.
	   HI reported a loss at yearend 1997. As with many other firms
throughout Asia, the company was not spared by the Asian financial
turmoil that caused the peso's value to plunge from P26.50 in July
to P40.12 by yearend 1997.
	   This forced bank lending rates to move up from 14% to as high as
35%.
	   HI's construction and infrastructure subsidiary, EEI Corp.,
earned P91.7 million, almost double its net income for the first
quarter of last year.
	   Despite the slowdown of the construction sector in general, EEI
increased its already robust project backlog to around P9.9 billion
as of the end of April 1998.
	   HI's consumer finance subsidiaries BA Savings Bank and First
Malayan Leasing and Finance Corp., however, were adversely affected
byhigh interest rates that prevailed from the last half of 1997 to
the present but which are showing signs of easing up.
	   BA Savings also had lower loan bookings, particularly for auto
loans, due to lower sales by the automobile industry. To further
improve the quality of its receivables, BA Savings continues to
make very conservative provisions for possible loan losses.
	   HI also said that, together with its partners, it has decided to
postpone the implementation of the South Western Cement project in
Malabuyoc, Cebu due to unfavorable investment conditions resulting
from the regional financial crisis and because the project's Korean
contractor encountered financial difficulties. HI decided instead
to invest in existing cement companies through South Western Cement
Ventures Inc., a joint venture with Blue Circle Industries Plc.
	   BM-FAVC/6.5 Firstec Expands OperationsFirst Asia Venture Capital
Inc. (FAVC),a major shareholder of Philippine-based First Asia
Systems Technology Inc. (Fastech) and Dutch-owned Silicon Systems
and Services BV (SS&AMP;S) signed a memorandum of agreement to expand
the business activity of its joint venture company Firstec Silicon
and Systems Inc.
	   ``From a mere IC chip design, Firstec will venture into complete
product design and manufacturing to supply the requirements of a
multinational computer company producing smartcard terminals for
the European market,''
	   saidSaturnino G. Belen Jr., Fastech president and chief
executive officer representing FAVC.
	   Belen said that Firstec's operations would translate to an
export potential for the Philippines of $100 million on its first
year and $180 million in its second year. He added that the project
was significant because Filipinos were responsible for thedesign
and manufacturing effortsunder the supervision of SS&AMP;S.
	   Firstec was established in May last year to provide electronics
systems designs.Under the MOA, both FAVC and SS&AMP;S infused capital
and maintained a 60%-40% ownership structure, respectively.
Additional investments include high-end computers, software for IC
design and lay-out, hardware and software for the Printed Circuit
Board system's design development and implementation. Firstec will
also have its own captive manufacturing line for chip-on-board
assembly which will be housed at the Fastech Manufacturing Complex
in Cabuyao, Laguna.
	   Fastech, a company engaged in electronics system and design, was
one of the participants in the recently concluded Hannover Fair in
Germany where the Philippines waspartner country.
	   Nexus WinsNexus Wins HP Resellers of the Year AwardNexus
Technologies Inc., a leading provider of enterprise computing
solutions, has been awarded as the 1997 HP Reseller of the Year.
The recognition was given in an Award Gala Night which highlighted
the Hewlett Packard Asia Pacific and Japan Key Resellers'
Conference held last month in Barcelona, Spain.
	   A leading HP reseller since 1997, Nexus has focused its
marketing and sales efforts on HP PCs and servers. In receiving the
award, Nexus President Juan Chua commented, ``Our success proves
that the Philippine market has long been ready for enterprise
computing solutions that are known for their reliability, value,
and functionality. HP has been proven on all counts and we are
proud to represent the product in the Philippine market.''
	   Chua also cited HP for its marketing and training support to its
resellers.
	   ``We value our partnership with HP for their significant help,
particularly in the technical training of our marketing, sales, and
support staff,'' he added.
	   The conference was attended by executives of reseller companies,
including selected consumer delegates, all over the Asia Pacific
region.

	   Among the many provinces in the Philippines, Pampanga stands out
when it comes to cuisine. Food is part and parcel of the Pampango
lifestyle, the natives taking pride in their dishes as well as
their confections.
	   )From childhood, the women are taught the basics of cooking, as
the menfolk always look forward to enjoying a good meal, capped by
dessert. In fact, even the men are known to excel in the kitchen.
	   Pampanga is among the top producers of sugar in the country, and
among the best-known sweets from the province are pastillas de
leche, tocino del cielo, turrones de casuy, and tibok-tibok (the
Tagalog version of maja blanca with the exception that the
Pampangos use fresh carabao milk).
	   Tamales is exceptionally good if it comes from Pampanga and this
is very much in demand during the Yuletide season.
	   The Heritage Hotel Manila has invited the charming Pette Jorolan
whose mother established Everybody's Cafe in San Fernando,
Pampanga. Pette recalls how her mother frowned on the use of modern
devices such as blenders and osterizers, preferring to stick to the
almiris (mortar and pestle) for pounding, the itak (cleaver) for
chopping, and well-sharpened knives for slicing. Traditionally,
Pampango cooks do not resort to using instant mixes or additives.
They simply rely on age-old cooking methods to produce authentic
dishes.
	   Many of their dishes have the unmistakable influence of Spain,
as seen in the morcon, relleno, pastel, galantina, cocido, lengua
asado, and bringhe, to name just a few. Even the names are in
Spanish.
	   When traveling through the provinces of Pampanga, it is
customary to stop by pasalubong centers to buy delicacies to bring
home to the family and friends.
	   )From June 10-14, the Heritage Hotel Manila offers the flavors
of Pampanga as prepared by the cooks of Everybody's Cafe. Enjoy a
sumptuous buffet spread served at lunch and dinner at the Riviera
Restaurant. It is also very likely that you will enjoy the fresh
papaya lumpia combining green grated papaya, shrimp, pork,
garbanzos, and bean sprouts complemented by pako (a variety of
fern) salad. During the press lunch, this went over big with
Heritage General Manager Richard Teo, who had two servings, no
less! The Pampango foodfest also showcases selected Pampango
handicrafts, courtesy of the Department of Trade and Industry. This
event is held in cooperation with the Department of Tourism's
Centennial Food Festival.

South Africa arrives for first World Cup appearance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Hundreds of townspeople, including children
holding soccer balls, greeted South Africa's soccer team when it
arrived Sunday in this central French town for its first World Cup.
	   A police motorcade escorted the South African team bus for the
final 10 kilometers (six miles) of the trip, and the crowd cheered
the players when they got off, team manager Augusto Palacios said.
	   ``Wonderful. It was tremendous. The players loved it,'' he said.
	   South Africa will be based in Vichy for the tournament, holding
its training sessions on local sports fields and traveling to
Marseilles, Toulouse and Bordeaux for its three first-round matches
against Pool C opponents France, Denmark and Saudi Arabia.
	   Considered a longshot to advance to the second round, the South
African enter the tournament never having beaten a European or
Middle Eastern country. In their final tuneup on Saturday in
Germany, the South Africans conceded a late goal and settled for a
1-1 draw with Iceland.
	   Benni McCarthy of Ajax Amsterdam scored the South African goal
in the 36th minute, but a 73rd minute strike by Stefan Thordarsen
tied it up for Iceland.
	   South African coach Phillipe Troussier, a Frenchman who took
over in March, has put together a team of mostly European-based
players in hopes of having battle-ready veterans for the
tournament.
	   But the lack of preparation time, and adapting to Troussier's
European-style ball-control system, has caused South Africa
problems in scoring goals in its recent matches. Under Troussier,
South Africa tied Zambia 1-1 and lost 2-0 to Argentina prior to
Saturday night's draw.
	   South Africa plays its first match on Friday against host France
in Marseilles and will be the underdog, a position Troussier says
he likes because it puts pressure on the French to perform in front
of their fans.
	   It is the first World Cup appearance for South Africa, which was
banned from international soccer for 28 years until 1992 because of
apartheid.

	   Filipino seafarers holding the position of radio operators have
called on government to take action and allow them to take third
mate examinations so they can still seek employment even after the
hiring of these operators in vessels could be terminated in 1999.
	   By February 1999, the services of radio operators may no longer
be needed when the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System
(GMDSS) would be fully implemented.
	   Reports indicated that even today, some shipowners are no longer
hiring radio operators as most ships are now using the GMDSS.
	   However, experts said the phasing out of radio operators was not
advisable even on ships that have GMDSS equipment sinceships will
always have problems concerning equipment.
	   Mario Maraviles, a radio operator for Baliwag Navigation, said
he was willing to take up courses like watchkeeping and navigation
and then take examinations so that his license could be converted
to that fora third mate.
	   He added that his experience on board ships should be credited
by maritime schools in order to shorten the schooling period just
in case he decides to study nautical science.
	   Other radio operators also urged government to follow the
counter measures being adopted by other countries like Japan and
Singapore which have transferred radio operators to the deck and
engine department.
	   Another Filipino seaman noted that in the early '90s, some ship
firms trained their radio operators as second mates, studying
navigation and cargohandling during their contracts.
	   Radio operators are calling on government to draft a clear
policy exclusively for them and follow other countries which have
already implemented the conversion of radio operators to deck
officers.
	   They also urges the Department of Education and Sports (DECS) to
stop the schools from offering the GRCO course to prevent the
oversupply of radio operators.

	   The incoming administration of President-elect Joseph Estrada
would be reviewing the provisions of the three-year contract of
Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) which government had granted
earlier this year.
	   Sources said Finance Secretary-in-waiting Edgardo B. Espiritu
has admitted an overhaul in the agreement was a major possibility
owing to the huge amount of the public money involved.
	   However, the sources admitted that termination of the contract
was unlikely to be carried out.
	   ``We will be taking a second look but we cannot rescind the
three-year SGS contract,'' a well-placed source from the Estrada
camp said.
	   SGS, a private inspection firm based in Geneva, Switzerland, was
hired by government during the '80s to conduct pre-inspection on
shipments bound for Philippine ports of entry.
	   Government cannot assess incoming cargo abroad due to issues on
sovereignty.
	   Sources noted that Espiritu was considering fully terminating
the agreement when it expires in year 2000.
	   ``Hopefully, the modernization of the Bureau of Customs (BOC)
would have been finalized by that time,'' another source said.
	   Customs officials as well as key executives of industry
organizations admitted to The Business Dailythat the reforms which
government started to apply earlier this decade were still too
underdeveloped to back the BOC's independence in checking
shipments.
	   ``They (BOC) still badly need SGS' valuation schemes,'' an
executive of a manufacturing firm said.
	   Under thenew contract, the BOC would adopt the Selective
Pre-shipment Inspection and Advance Clearance System (Spacs) which
is considered the ``exit program of government from SGS''.
	   Customs Commissioner Guillermo L. Parayno Jr. said the system
facilitates the principle of ``cargo clearance before the
shipment's arrival'' through a selective pre-shipment inspection
and an advanced cargo clearance process.
	   Moreover, Spacs would be the last reform and modernization
program the BOC would complete prior to the termination of SGS'
services.
	   With these in place, release of shipments will be faster and
import inflows are kept on track via an ``intelligence data base,''
Parayno said.
	   He strongly dismissed reports that former Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo promised Congress not to extend the contract of
SGS after March 1998.
	   ``We have an exit program and we have determined that we have
made good in our reforms. There was really much improvement
achieved. There was a need to fit in a new service to face the
challenge as we are still behind the pack which we must lead,''
Parayno said.
	   Parayno claimed the new contract was cheaper -- 20% lower than
the previous cost. Government was paying P4 billion annually under
the old contract.
	   On the other hand, shift of current export value to transaction
value will be pushed through by government under the Asean Free
Trade Area convention.
	   A uniformed tariff of 3%-5% in the region will be applied in the
region in year 2004.
	   The change in the valuation method was strongly opposed by local
manufacturers as this would result in a cut-throat competition with
their foreign counterparts as imports will be priced lower than the
locally-made commodities.
	   However, Parayno noted the shift will not phase out the local
industries, but rather, make the latter globally competitive as
international trade would be further opened.

	   The once formidable Lakas-NUCD may be losing Muntinlupa Rep.
Manuel Villar -one of its top bets for House Speakership - although
not to its political arch-foe but to an inactive and lesser known
party.
	   Meanwhile, Lakassecretary general andPresidential adviser on
political affairs Gabriel Claudio also denied that the party had
already picked its official candidate for Speakership.
	   A veteran lawmaker who spoke on condition that he not be named
said Villar was contemplating using the stagnant Partido ng Masang
Pilipino (PMP) as vehicle for his bid for Speakership.
	   PMP wasfounded by President-elect Joseph Estrada and Sen. Miriam
Defensor Santiago during the 1992 national and local elections. The
party later coalesced with the Laban ng Makabayang Pilipino of Sen.
Edgardo Angara and the Nationalist People's Coalition of Sen.
Edgardo Maceda.
	   Many members of Laban and NPC are now with Laban ng Makabayang
Masang Pilipino (Lammp), Estrada's new political party and Lakas'
arch-rival in the recent elections.
	   ``We don't want to joint Lammp since we'll be treated as mere
second-rates.
	   As the revived PMP, we will be the first among equals,'' a
supporter of Villar at the House of Representatives said.
	   Rumors of Villar's plan to bolt Lakas were bolstered by his
absence at the party's meetings on May 22 and 29.
	   Newly-elected legislators from the Liberal Party, Promdi, Aksyon
Demokratiko and Reporma were also reportedly being wooed by the
Pro-Villar bloc.
	   Lakas boasts of 110 members in the House or enough to elect a
Speaker while Lammp only has 80 members but is relying on the swing
votes from ``closet Lammps.''
	   Sources said it was Estrada himself who told Villar in one of
their meetings ``to get out of Lakas and join PMP.''
	   Some lawmakers who had already expressed support for Villar were
Reps.
	   Marcial Punzalan (Lakas, Quezon), Ralph Recto (Lakas, Batangas),
Angelino Sarmiento (Lakas, Bulacan), Lualhati Antonino (Lammp-South
Cotabato), Herminio Teves (Lakas, Negros Oriental), and ''first
termer'' Aniceto Saludo, Jr. (Lammp-Southern Leyte).
	   Aside from Villar, Lakas' other nominees to the post of Speaker
areDeputy Majority Leader Manuel Garcia, Maguindanao Rep. Simeon
Datumanong, Leyte Rep. Sergio Apostol, Quezon City-Rep. Feliciano
Belmonte, Iloilo Rep.
	   Narciso Monfort,and Quezon Rep. Narciso Suarez.
	   Lammp on the other hand is choosing among Makati Rep. Joker
Arroyo, Isabela Rep. Gilberto Duavit and newly-elected Bohol Rep.
Ernesto Herrera.
	   In denying that Lakas had already anointed a candidate for
Speaker during a meeting recently, Claudio said the party merely
issued a resolution ''for the Lakas congressman to support and
rally behind one common candidate for speaker who should be a
bonafide member.''
	   Claudio also admitted that most of the members of Lakas were
questioning the loyaltyof Villar to the party.
	   ``There were some who would like to be clarified on the actual
status and intentions of Congressman Villar, and there were some
who wanted to be clarified why he did not attend last night's
(Wednesday) caucus,'' Claudio said.
	   Only 70 of the 110 Lakas congressmanattended the party caucus
last Wednesday. Claudio maintained that the Villar case was barely
discussed at the caucus which focused on Lakas' and Lammp's
drafting of a ''common legislative agenda which will support and
help the incoming administration.''

	   The Lakas party has decided to defer actions against the plan of
President-elect Joseph Estrada to abolish the pork barrel to
prevent a direct confrontation with the incoming administration.
	   The decision was reached during Wednesday's party caucus in
Arlegui where some 100 Lakas members, including 67 winning
candidates, met with Pres.
	   Fidel V. Ramos.
	   In an interview, Rep. Sergio Apostol (Lakas, Leyte)yesterday
said the President asked party members to refrain from making
premature statements on the issue so as not to undermine ongoing
talks on the proposed national unity government.
	   ``The consensus was to defer action on the matter and wait for
definite action on the part of Estrada,'' Apostol said.
	   He explained the party can only take definite actions when
Estrada formally assumes the presidency and when a new Speaker has
already been installed in the Lower House.
	   ``The President has in fact discouraged party members from
making any moves on pork barrel issues,'' the Leyte solon, who is
also aspiring for the Speakership, said.
	   In a party statement released yesterday, Pres. Ramos and Speaker
Jose de Venecia emphasized the need for the Filipino people ``to
unite behind Estrada during a period when the financial storm in
Asia has already triggered an economic collapse in Indonesia,
Thailand and South Korea.''
	   Lakas solons, who have bonded themselves into an informal bloc
called ``blockbusters,'' reportedly wanted the party and Pres.
Ramos to make a definite stand against the scrapping of the
countrywide development fund (CDF) and the congressional initiative
allocation (CIA) derisivelyknown as pork barrels.
	   Rep. Danilo Suarez (Lakas, Quezon) and Apostol, acknowledged
leaders of the group, said they will with reason with Estrada and
stress the importance of retaining the pork barrel in funding
infrastructure projects.
	   Rep. Margarito Teves (Lakas, Negros Oriental) said the pork
barrel need not be totally abolished. The fund, he said, can simply
be reduced by 25% if the objectiveis to have money for agriculture.
	   Estrada, however, said he was determined to keep his campaign
promise of abolishing the pork barrel, allegedly the source of
graft and corruption.
	   The President-elect said the budget for pork will be reduced to
fund his administration's program to modernize agriculture.
	   The Lakas leadership likewise said it was backing the call for a
government of national unity in both houses of Congress under an
Estrada presidency.

	   The National Development Co. (NDC) said it would push through
with the privatization of the Philippine Phosphates Fertilizer
Corp. (Philphos) and the Philippine Associated Smelting and
Refining Corp. (Pasar).
	   NDC General Manager Mariano Salazar said they will submit a plan
to the next secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI), which will include options on how to attract bidders for the
privatization.
	   As of end-November last year, Philphos and Pasar have
outstanding debts amounting to P43.8 billion and P30.7 billion,
respectively.
	   ``The Committee on Privatization has already approved the
privatization and NDC is just waiting for the valuation which is
expected to be released within the month,'' Salazar said.
	   He said the decision on the sale of state-owned corporations
should be well-timed as government may not allow privatization if
the market is down.
	   Government has a 41.91% stake in Pasar, while 27.78% is
distributed among mining companies Marcopper Mining Corp.,
Maricalum Mining Corp., Philex Mining Corp. and Lepanto
Consolidated Mining. The 30% share of the total equity belongs to
the Japanese investors Marubeni Corp., Sumitomo Corp., and Itomu
Corps.
	   Other government-owned corporations in line for privatization
under the Estrada administration include National Power Corp.and
the Philippine National Bank (PNB).

Opole residents demonstrate to remain a province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people in
southwestern Opole province formed a ``human chain'' Sunday,
demanding their region remain a province when the country's inner
boundaries are redrawn under the government's administrative reform
plan.
	   The provincial reform aims to shed the last of Poland's
communist-era bureaucratic system by reducing the number of
governmental regions from 49 to 12, thereby granting local
governments more power.
	   If the plan goes through as scheduled, as of next Jan. 1, Opole
province, would join with the industrial region of Katowice to
become part of a larger Silesian province.
	   Opole residents, who believe their farming region should remain
independent, joined hands Sunday along a 90-kilometer (56 mile)
stretch of highway linking their provincial capital Wroclaw to
Katowice.
	   Parliament voted Friday to reduce the number of provinces to 12,
but lengthy parliamentary debates and continuing protests forced
the government to add three additional regions to the plan, one of
which would be Opole.

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has expressed her surprise at the
long march programme of the opposition BNP towards the Chittagong
Hill Tracts (CHT) where a peaceful environment is prevailing
following the signing of the CHT accord.
	   Addressing the inaugural function of the Dhaka University Alumni
Association Convention on Saturday, the Prime Minister said that
she had formed the government of consensus to build the country and
included four ministers from other political parties depriving her
own party people who sacrificed a lot in the past to bring the
party into power.
	   ``We want to build the country and to change the fate of the
common people and, therefore, we believe in the politics of
participation and consensus,'' Sheikh Hasina said.
	   She said that responding to her call to join the government of
consensus, two persons joined the government initially and the two
others joined recently. ``But it's unfortunate that the main
opposition party has launched movement against us,'' she said.
	   The Prime Minister said that they (BNP) was pressing for
scrapping the CHT peace accord and the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty.
	   Sheikh Hasina said that there had been disturbance in the CHT
and it was her government which could bring about peace there by
signing the peace accord.
	   ``It will be possible now to develop the one-tenth of the
country because of the signing of the peace accord,'' she said
adding: ``But the peaceful environment there has disturbed this
peace in the minds of some persons and they have planned to go to
the CHT to set ablaze the peace accord.''
	   Without mentioning the name of any party or person, Sheikh
Hasina said that according to the press report, they had planned to
start the 'long march' in a convoy of about 1000 vehicles.
	   The Prime Minister said that disturbance and bloodshed would
start again in the CHT if the peace accord was scrapped. ``I wonder
how a sane person can desire such a situation,'' she said.
	   Add: Hasina
	   UNB adds: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said no level headed
person can go for a long march against peace, nor want resumption
of warlike situation in the CHT region.
	   ``If the peace agreement is rescinded, the region will again
plunge into violence and blood-bath, a situation none can desire,''
she said.
	   About campus violence, she said the government is determined to
wipe out all kinds of terrorism from the campuses and taking strict
action in this regard.
	   ``The situation has improved a lot,'' she said adding that the
government will never hesitate to take action against the
terrorists whichever party they might belong.
	   ``We've never patronised terrorism and will never do so in
future,'' the Prime Minister said and urged all irrespective of
party affiliation to cooperate in further improving the situation
on the campus.
	   She said the present government has no need to give shelter to
the terrorists, nor use the students in power politics.
	   She added: ``We've a well-knit, strong political organisation
... we also believe that people is the source of all power.''
	   The inaugural function, presided over by Alumni Association
president Prof Muzaffar Ahmed, was also addressed, among others, by
the oldest alumnus Prof Sirajul Haque (1923-27 academic year), DU
Vice-Chancellor and chief patron of the association Prof AK Azad
Chowdhury, convenor of the convention preparatory committee and
former Finance Minister AMA Muhit and another alumnus Din Mohammad
Khan (1956-60 academic year).
	   The Prime Minister said in the past the student forces were used
by the military dictators for capturing and consolidating power.
	   They have given firearms to the innocent students and used them
for their narrow political interest, she said adding, but Awami
League had no need to use the student for political gain.
	   Hasina said in 1993, she imposed a moratorium on the activities
of Chhatra League although, she said, it is not a political wing of
Awami League, rather an individual institution.
	   There is no existence of student front in the constitution of
Awami League.
	   Chhatra League was born a year before the birth of Awami League,
she added.
	   ``Even though, I suspended the activities of Chhatra League and
requested other parties, including BNP, to stop activities of their
student fronts. But my cry was went in vain,'' she added.
	   ``This (Dhaka) University had a glory and tradition, this
university has been considered as the Oxford of the East,'' she
said adding ``being a student of this university I feel proud. But
it had lost its glory and the student had lost their respectable
position.''
	   Now all will have to work together to regain the lost glory of
the students, restore peaceful atmosphere on the campus and regain
the confidence of the people on students.
	   The Prime Minister said the government has attached special
importance to the expansion of education and kept highest budgetary
allocation for education sector.
	   ``We want to remove illiteracy from the country by the year
2006,'' she said elaborating the measures of the government in this
regard.
	   Addressing the function, the oldest alumnus Prof Sirajul Haque
spoke against campus politics saying ``we should give up grouping
and politics for improving campus environment.''
	   Everybody should remain alert in the present situation, said the
oldest alumnus advising all to be a bit sacrificing for greater
interest.
	   VC Prof AK Azad Chowdhury said terrorism and financial scarcity
are the two main problems of Dhaka University.
	   In last two years, the campus situation was improved, he said
and added the situation will improve further if emphasis can be
laid on socio-economic causes behind the terrorism.
	   He pointed out that moral degradation, socio-economic
discrimination, unemployment, lack of tolerance among political
parties, lack of democratic mentality and delay in trial of
terrorists and flexibility towards terrorism are the main causes
behind the deterioration of campus situation.
	   Ministers, MPs, teachers, former students and elite of the city
attended the inaugural function while the alumni passed the whole
day at the green lawn of TSC to enjoy the function and recall the
memories of the old days.

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japan's best barely managed a 1-0
win against France's Second Division Gueugnon in a warmup game
Sunday ahead of the World Cup.
	   Forward Masashi Nakayama headed in a goal early in the first
half.
	   Japanese coach Takeshi Okada declared his disappointment. ``I'd
have liked to win 2-0 or 3-0,'' he said after the game in this
lakeside resort that will serve as Japan's base camp during the
tournament.
	   Okada changed all his players except one for the second half,
even using 17-year-old Daisuke Ichikawa, who has been dropped from
the roster but is traveling with the team.
	   ``We wanted the players to get used to the game,'' Okada said.
	   Midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi, captain in place of injured
defender Masami Ihara, said the main purpose of the game was to
help the players improve their physical condition.
	   ``We also wanted to reconfirm the way we were going to approach
the game,'' he said. ``With every game, the team is getting into
good form.''
	   Okada acknowledged Japan's opener against Argentina was sure to
be far tougher. ``Naturally, we're going to have to play more
defense,'' he said.
	   Gueugnon captain Richard Trivino said he was so impressed with
the Japanese he believes they have a chance against Argentina.
``Anything is possible,'' he said.
	   Gueugnon coach Alain Dessoly also praised the Japanese team.
``France and Japan will go to the finals; how's that?'' he joked.
	   Yamaguchi said all the Japanese players realize Argentina is
heavily favored. ``But we hope to give them one heck of a
surprise,'' he said.

Junta opponents say 62 arrested during protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ At least one protester was killed and 62
others were arrested during recent anti-government demonstrations
in Nigeria, a leading opposition group said Sunday.
	   The Joint Action Committee for Nigeria did not say where or how
the one person was killed, but claimed it was linked to police
efforts to break up protests last week.
	   The demonstrations in the commercial capital of Lagos and the
nearby university town of Ibadan were held to mark the second
anniversary of the unexplained killing of Kudirat Abiola, wife of
imprisoned politician Moshood Abiola.
	   Authorities in Ibadan had arrested at least seven student
leaders on the eve of the June 4 anniversary.
	   While most of the 62 arrests announced Sunday took place in
Lagos and Ibadan, a number of Joint Action Committee members were
also detained in the northern city of Kano, the group said in a
written statement issued Sunday.
	   Elsewhere, authorities in southern Nigeria ordered three small
college campuses closed in anticipation of more civil unrest.
	   Student activists have vowed to stage large protest marches on
Friday to mark the fifth anniversary of Gen. Sani Abacha's military
coup.
	   June 12 marks the day in 1993 when Abacha canceled presidential
elections and launched his military takeover. Abacha has since been
accused of rampant corruption and widespread human rights abuses.
	   It was about this time when Moshood Abiola _ the apparent winner
of the elections _ was arrested and charged with treason for
declaring himself president.
	   In an attempt to avoid a repeat of anti-Abacha violence on June
12, authorities ordered colleges in Ife, Ilorin and Ogbomosho shut.
	   The military has vowed to step down in favor of an elected
civilian government, but repeatedly reneges on the promise.

Blair calls Clinton and Yeltsin as pressure mounts on Serbs over
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Starting a week of international pressure on
Yugoslavia over Kosovo, British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Sunday
spoke to U.S. President Clinton and they agreed to send a ``strong
message '' that a Serb offensive in the restive province is
unacceptable, an aide said.
	   Blair, current president of the European Union, also had a
30-minute phone call with President Boris Yeltsin, urging the
Russian leader to use his influence with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to stop Serb forces' ``barbarism'' against
civilians, the aide added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Milosevic had
``crossed the threshold'' this week with offenses by Serb troops
against ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the population
n Kosovo.
	   ``The use of tanks, of artillery, of the might of the military
army against civilian centers of population is wholly unacceptable
within the modern Europe,'' said Cook, answering questions at the
end of a weekend meeting of 1,200 voluntary workers and others from
the EU and neighboring countries.
	   The London meeting, called the People's Europe, was held ahead
of a summit next week of the 15-nation EU.
	   Cook, saying Milosevic must be kept guessing, refused to say
what steps the EU or the six-national Contact Group, which monitors
Yugoslavia and includes Russia and the United States, might take.
	   But there was speculation that the Blair is seeking to get
Russia to agree on possible military intervention in Kosovo.
	   British newspapers reported that Blair told a Cabinet meeting
last week the British troops might have to be sent to Kosovo,
saying ``we have to be'' prepared to use force.
	   In Kosovo, ethnic Albanian officials said the Serbs' latest
offensive has left at least 50 people dead and 200 missing, and
sent thousands fleeing from ruined villages in the west of the
territory, which is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   The issue will be discussed by foreign ministers of the
15-nation EU in Brussels on Monday, by NATO defense ministers on
Thursday, and in London on Friday by foreign ministers of the Group
of Eight top industrialized nations - the United States, Russia,
Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
	   ``We want to make sure that he (Milosevic) is kept guessing as
to what might actually happen,'' said Cook. ``But we want him to
know that he cannot go on this way and expect us to turn a blind
eye. We are not going to do that.''

Full American team trains together for first time since assembling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ For the first time since
the Americans assembled in California nearly a month ago, all 22
U.S. players trained together Sunday at the squad's practice site.
	   Frankie Hejduk, who has been bothered by a hamstring injury,
returned Saturday, and Tab Ramos, who's been slowed by a sore right
calf, and Ernie Stewart, hampered by a bad right ankle, rejoined
the group Sunday.
	   It was the first time since U.S. coach Steve Sampson called the
players together on May 11 in San Diego that they practiced as a
full squad.
	   The isolation at Chateau de Pizay in southern France is starting
to get to some players, despite only arriving a day earlier and
even though they say it's good for their concentration.
	   ``We're far away from the World Cup hoopla,'' playmaking
midfielder Claudio Reyna said. ``A lot of guys, me included, would
like to be closer to the action and feel the World Cup spirit.''
	   Reyna is the offensive soul of the American team, having been
handed the reigns of the squad by coach Steve Sampson.
	   The 24-year-old son of an Argentine father and a Portuguese
mother had even more pressure dumped on him in April when Sampson
cut ``captain-for-life'' John Harkes and insinuated that Reyna's
on-field freedom was one of the reasons.
	   ``I do feel pressure and I do feel responsible for how the team
does,'' Reyna said. ``I still don't feel I had any part to do with
him being released.''
	   Many interpreted Sampson's subsequent comments to mean that he
felt Reyna was intimidated by Harkes' presence and didn't have the
confidence to perform at his best.
	   Sampson has tried to install a five-man midfield for over two
years, and after dropping Harkes, broadened it to six with Reyna as
the central figure.
	   ``I think it is an alignment that gives him more freedom, not
that he couldn't play in another formation or system,'' Sampson
said. ``But when there are at least two holding midfielders behind
him, it gives him the freedom to attack more, and a player with
that kind of freedom welcomes it, and you saw the result in
Austria.''
	   The United States dominated the Austrians in Vienna, with Reyna
scoring one and setting up the other two in a 3-0 victory on April
22.
	   With Reyna in the lineup, the Americans beat Kuwait 2-0 last
month. But when he sat out exhibition games against Macedonia and
Scotland, the U.S. team wound up with a pair of scoreless ties.
	   ``There are certain players that need to play well for us to
succeed as a team,'' Sampson said, ``and he is one of them.''

	   Brisk preparations are afoot to make the long march to the
Chittagong Hill Tracts a grand success. The two-day long political
showdown by the Opposition BNP and its allies is scheduled to begin
from Dhaka towards the hill district of Khagrachhari on Tuesday.
	   With only two days left for the grand programme, the BNP and its
front organisations have made massive preparations to mobilise
thousands of party workers from different districts and lead them
towards Khagrachhari.
	   The Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh, and the Jatiya Party
(Zafar-Moazzem) have also prepared their workers to join the march
separately.
	   Coinciding with the opposition programme, the ruling Awami
League is preparing to stage peace rallies throughout the country
on June 9 and 10. An announcement in this regard will be made by
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a public meeting today.
	   The local units of the BNP in different areas are also making
preparations to bring out peace processions coinciding with the
long march. The opposition parties apprehend that there might be
clashes during the long march in many areas. They fear that Feni
district, through which the marchers will proceed, may be a hot
spot. Meanwhile the rival groups in Feni have also engaged
themselves in clashes centring on the issue of long march. On
Thursday night houses of two leaders of the BNP and the Awami
League were burnt down by the activists.
	   The long march programme was earlier announced by the Leader of
the Opposition, Begum Khaleda Zia, on the conclusion of a token
hunger strike at the Palton ground in Dhaka on May 12.
	   The programme is being organised to oppose the enactment of laws
making provision for a regional council and the hill distinct
council in line with the peace accord signed on the Chittagong Hill
Tracts by the Awami League government.
	   According to the schedule, Begum Khaleda Zia will lead the march
from Dhaka towards Chittagong while Deputy leader of the Opposition
Professor Badruddoza Chowdhury will lead the march from Chittagong
to the Khagrachhari hill district headquarters.
	   Meanwhile, the long march supervisory committee headed by BNP
leader Oli Ahmed held a meeting with the sub-committee members at
the Minto Road office of the Leader of the Opposition last evening
to study the latest situation.
	   The liaison committee for the political and professional groups
also held a meeting in this connection with M. Shamsul Islam Khan,
MP, in the chair yesterday.
	   A joint meeting of different sub-committees formed in connection
with the long march will be held at 29, Minto Road office at 11 am
today.
	   The BNP has already instructed its district units to mobilise at
least one bus from each thana to fetch its workers for the march.
The Dhaka city unit has also arranged accommodation for the large
number of workers who will throng the capital to join the long
march. The party office, community centres and educational
institutions will be used as shelters for the outside workers.
	   The BNP and its front organisations on Saturday organised
processions and rallies at the district level to mobilise public
support for the long march.
	   UNB adds: The opposition camp says, it will absolutely be a
peaceful march, but warned of serious consequences if any
obstruction is created on their way.
	   The government is learnt to have sent necessary instructions to
the district administration to remain alert.
	   Additional police forces are being deployed all along the route
that will pass through thana and district headquarters on June 9-10
(Tuesday-Wednesday) to avert any untoward incident.
	   The Chittagong Metropolitan Police have sought an extra 1,000
police personnel from the headquarters to step up the security
measures.
	   Political sources hinted that strategies of the BNP, the Jamaat
and their allies were engaged in behind-the-scene parleys to
prepare themselves for a follow-up action programme.
	   Opposition leaders are working on two sets of programme, both
soft and tough, to match the situation. This may even mean keeping
an option for a tough programme forcing the government for a
mid-term election.
	   The post-Long March programme may range from countrywide
protests to shutdowns, a close aide of Begum Zia said. ``This is
just the beginning,'' he added.
	   If things go well and end peacefully, the BNP marchers are
scheduled to assemble at the Khagrachhari Outer Stadium, where
Begum Zia will address a public meeting.
	   City Jamaat-e-Islami leaders yesterday called upon all the
patriotic people to take part in the historic long march to make it
a grand success.
	   A meeting of the presidents and secretaries of all the city
thana units of the party yesterday reviewed the preparation of the
long march. The Jamaat City Ameer A T M Azharul Islam presided over
the meeting held at its Paltan office.
	   Our Staff Correspondent from Chittagong adds: BNP organised a
mass procession in the port city and held a public meeting at
Laldighi crossing yesterday to drum up support for the march
towards hill tracts.
	   Chittagong(north) unit of the party told the newsmen that at
least five thousand volunteers would be deployed at key points on
way to Khagrachhari from Mirerswari. Reception centres will be set
up on the way to welcome the marchers.
	   Earlier on Friday, BNP leader Abdullah-Al Noman visited
Khagrachhari and held public meetings at all thana headquarters to
make the long march programme a grand success. He also held a
meeting with the Minister without port folio Kalparanjan Chakma and
the Deputy Commissioner of the district seeking their cooperation
for a peaceful long march.
	   The district administration and the police authorities
separately held meetings with the unity council and the ruling
party in a bid to keep the situation under control. Our Rangamati
Correspondent reports: Parbatya Sarbadaliya Oikya Parishad (the all
party unity council) held a meeting today to make the long march
programme a success.
	   They decided to welcome the marchers in the morning of June 10
at the district entry point at Goderpar and at the pourashava gate
of Manikchhari.
	   A grand rally will also be held at the old court building ground
of the district at 11 am.
	   According to our Bandarban correspondent, preparations have been
completed to mobilise party workers from all the six thanas of the
district and transport them by 30 to 40 buses to Khagrachhari and
Rangamati.
	   District Awami League president Prasanta Kanti Tanchainga and a
Jana Sanghati leader said they were in favour of peace and would
not follow any course of confrontation or counter programme.
	   Council of Hill People (CHP) at a meeting has urged all
patriotic people, students, youths, freedom fighters,
intellectuals, journalists, lawyers and other professionals to make
the long march on June 9 a success.
	   A meeting of the Council was held yesterday at Reserve Bazar,
Rangamati with its central chairman Jalal Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury
Alamgir in the chair.

	   Dhaka Electric Supply Authorities (DESA) , in a drastic move to
save electricity, have asked major industries to shut down for six
hours every day. Industry sources said that it would cause at least
13 per cent production loss if they failed to run industries for
six hours.
	   It seems that the DESA has taken the measures keeping in view
the requirement of increased power for domestic purposes during
ensuing world cup football.
	   The DESA in a letter sent on May 25 to the management of various
industries asked they should keep their operations suspended from 5
p.m. to 11 p.m. every day.
	   ``Acute shortage of electricity during the peak hours has been
the main cause for such directives,'' one DESA official said on
Saturday.
	   He said similar notices had been served on different companies
including British American Tobacco Bangladesh Limited, Philips
Bangladesh Limited and all other enterprises located in Dhaka's
Tejgaon industrial area.
	   Energy ministry officials said Bangladesh required more than
2,200 megawatt of electricity every day but the country generates
only 1700 megawatts.
	   They said the situation turned worse during summer, severely
affecting water supply as well. ``We are trying to improve power
management through efficient rationing and redistribution of supply
as per priority,'' one official said. In an avergae 600 m.w
loadshedding is recorded everyday.
	   Others said the government had asked the DESA to ensure maximum
possible power supply in Dhaka.
	   ``We received the DESA notice asking not to use electricity in
the pick hours. They also warned that if the order is not obeyed
the connections will be cut off,'' said Mahmudur Rahman, chief
corporate manager of B.A.T.
	   ``There will be at least 13 per cent production loss if we close
for six hours, as we used to remain open round the clock,'' Rahman
told The Independent. .
	   ``There will be a revenue loss of six million Taka per day.''
	   DESA officials said the peak hour demand for electricity in the
city's industrial areas, having 416 garment factories and many
others, was 87 megawatt but they could supply less than 50 per cent
only.
	   The government has also asked shopping centres in the capital to
close down by 7 p.m. Electricity connections to many shops have
already been cut off for defying the order, DESA officials said.
	   Operators of irrigation pumps supplying water to agricultural
farms have been asked to switch on between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.
	   ``The garment sector in the country is losing about 2.4 billion
Taka every month for acute crisis in power supply,'' said an
industrialist.
	   ``The frozen food sector is losing about 10 million Taka per
month,'' another businessman said.
	   The commercial rate for using electricity in normal hours is
2.45 Taka per unit (1,000 watts) and in pick hours (from 5 p.m. to
11 p.m.) is 5.7 Taka, DESA officials said.
	   ``We are ready to pay more than double rates but still we are
not getting power,'' another industrialist said.
	   ``Production in manufacturing units have been declining fast due
to frequent power failure and load-shedding,'' he said.
	   Haider said export-oriented industries might not meet their
production targets and run into problems with the importers.
	   Shop owners said their sales turnover had fallen by up to 60 per
cent as they were forced to pull down shutters by 7 p.m.
	   ``Most of the customers prefer the evening time for shopping,''
a trader at Dhaka's New Market said.
	   The government is under serious pressure from various groups,
including students, to ensure uninterrupted power supply during the
forthcoming soccer World Cup.
	   ``Even we are receiving threats over telephone that power plants
will be set ablaze if electricity supply is not ensured during the
World Cup matches,'' one DESA official said.
	   Officials blame the precarious power situation partly on long
delays in overhauling the old plants and in setting up new ones.

	   JARJOU, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas took turns Sunday to
leave the front lines in southern Lebanon and vote in municipal
elections that is likely to endorse their fight against Israeli
occupation.
	   Candidates backed by the pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah group are
contesting most of the 1,589 posts in southern Lebanon, a
predominantly Shiite region.
	   ``I voted for Hezbollah's candidates because they are defending
our land and offering public services with or without municipal
elections,'' said Umm Mohammed, a veiled mother of two children.
	   The roads from Jarjou and other villages in Iqlim al-Tuffah
province were festooned with the Hezbollah's banners and flags as
well as portraits of Iran's late revolutionary leader, Ayatollah
Khomeini.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah is a Hezbollah mountain stronghold that faces
the part of South Lebanon that Israel occupies with the help of a
Lebanese militia. Hezbollah has led the fight to oust the Israelis.
	   ``Today's voting is part of the resistance against Israeli
occupation,'' said Fawzi Darwish, a 34-year-old businessman in
Jarjou, which is only 400 meters (yards) from Israeli outposts at
Sojod. Darwish said he voted for pro-Hezbollah candidates.
	   No voting was held in the Israeli-occupied area.
	   Zeinab Khafaja, who lost her guerrilla brother to a battle
against the Israelis, said it was her holy duty to vote for
Hezbollah.
	   ``It's a vote between the good and evil,'' said the 35-year-old
mother of four.
	   Hezbollah fighters also participated in the elections, leaving
their weapons at the front line to walk unarmed to the polling
booths.
	   Guerrilla leaders rotated the fighters to make sure that the
front line was not unmanned at any time, said Haj Adnan Naameh, a
Hezbollah official, in nearby Jubaa, home to 4,000 people.
	   ``The fighter has a primary right to vote,'' he said.
	   The front lines were generally quiet Sunday and voting was
peaceful as troops in armored vehicles patrolled the villages and
guarded polling stations.
	   But the electoral battle was heated between Hezbollah and the
pro-Syrian mainstream Amal movement, also a Shiite group. The
victorious group will be seen as the voice of the nation's Shiites
who number 1.2 million among Lebanon's 3.2 million people.
	   Besides the Shiite fight, the elections _ the first municipal
polls in 35 years _ also are seen as proof that Lebanon's
Christians and Muslims are willing to join hands in building
democracy after the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   Voting was also held Sunday in Beirut, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northwest of Jarjou. The vote was the third segment of the
four-stage elections organized over four consecutive Sundays.

announced on June 10, the index rose by 81.21 points or 11 per cent
to 778.41 from previous day's close at 697.20.
	   With the hope that the forthcoming budget would contain some
incentives to boost the country's capital market, the small
investors seemed to be more confident to inject their money in
recent days, a market expert opined.
	   ``The trading at the DSE improves at the news that the
government will reduce corporate tax for listed companies from
current tax rate of 35 per cent,'' he said .
	   On the day, shares of 149 listed securities were transacted with
141 in gains, seven in loss ,while one remained unchanged.
	   Some 663,380 shares and debentures valued at Tk 7.78 crore
changed hands on the day against 734,657 shares and debentures
worth Tk 7.52 crore on the previous day.
	   Chick Tex (116,500), Quasem Drycells (55,600), Shinepukur
Holdings (37,850), Ashraf Textiles (29,000), Eagle Star Textiles
(22,450), Dynamic Textiles (21,540), Beximco Pharma (28,900),
Beximco Synthetic (20,080) and Rose Heaven Ball Pen (46,000) were
among the volume leaders.
	   The major gainers included IDLC (Tk 127.34), Aziz Pipes (Tk
102.60), Singer Bangladesh (Tk 270.42), National Tubes (Tk 113.42),
Aman Sea Food (Tk 124.25) and Apex Foods (Tk 138.97).
	   There were no significant losers yesterday except Beximco Tex
(Tk 62.00).
	   Market capitalisation on the day stood at Tk 70.01 billion
equivalent to US dollar 1.51 billion at the close of the
yesterday's trading against previous day's close at Tk 62.70
billion or US dollar 1.35 billion.

Serb police beat protesters in Pristina; KLA seeks more help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton-Blair conversation, comments by British,
Yugoslav and German officials; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police used clubs Sunday to
beat and disperse protesters at a Kosovo independence rally,
injuring at least a half-dozen ethnic Albanians.
	   Dozens of plainclothes policemen joined about 100 in uniforms to
violently break up the demonstration by ethnic Albanians in
Pristina, capital of the secessionist province of Serbia where
ethnic Albanians comprise a 9-to-1 majority.
	   The unexpected violence in Pristina came as Serbian forces
pressed their fierce offensive against militants in western Kosovo,
where shelling reportedly continued Sunday.
	   The stepped-up campaign launched in late May has left at least
50 people dead and 200 missing, according to ethnic Albanian
officials, in addition to sending thousands fleeing from ruined
villages.
	   Pristina itself has remained largely free of violence despite
months of clashes this year between Serbs trying to assert their
control over the province and the self-described Kosovo Liberation
Army, made up of ethnic Albanians who want to drive Serb
``occupiers'' out.
	   But on Sunday, without apparent warning, police charged the
approximately 1,000 protesters gathered for the 57th consecutive
daily rally against the Serbs' violent rule in Kosovo.
	   One protester could be seen bleeding in the street after he was
hit in the head by a policeman's gun butt and then kicked
repeatedly.
	   It was the first beating of protesters in Kosovo since March,
when thousands of ethnic Albanians were attacked for protesting
against an earlier crackdown by government forces on the KLA.
	   Albanian TV in Tirana reported that the Serbs shelled at least
two Kosovo villages Sunday. It also said ethnic Albanian militants
blew up the police headquarters in Ratkoc, and amid fierce fighting
between the two sides all the Serb residents and police had fled.
	   It is not clear how much of a setback the Serb offensive has
dealt Kosovo's clandestine rebel army, which claims to control some
40 percent of the southern province of Yugoslavia's Republic of
Serbia, and which enjoys growing popularity.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army appealed in a statement published
Sunday in the newspaper Koha Ditore for more ethnic Albanians to
join them and ``fight for freedom'' from Serbian forces.
	   ``Come to strengthen our troops against the enemy artillery and
enemy infantry,'' the KLA statement said.
	   Western powers oppose Kosovo's bid for independence, fearing the
consequences of another border change in the volatile Balkans, but
want the Serbs to cease their offensive and give Kosovo the
autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989.
	   The offensive that began in late May has stirred increasing
international concern and fears of igniting a wider war in the
Balkans. Pope John Paul II called on the world Sunday to act
against violence and repression in Kosovo.
	   The United States and others are deliberating on what steps to
take, with a reimposition of sanctions against Yugoslavia and
military intervention both under consideration.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke to U.S. President
Clinton on Sunday and they agreed to send a ``strong message ''
that a Serb offensive in the restive province is unacceptable, a
Blair aide said.
	   ``The use of tanks, of artillery, of the might of the military
army against civilian centers of population is wholly unacceptable
within the modern Europe,'' British Foreign Minister Robin Cook
said earlier.
	   The exodus of some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians into Albania last
week, and another 7,000 to 10,000 into the neighboring Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, also has stirred worry in the West.
	   A group of foreign diplomats was escorted into the besieged
region of Kosovo Sunday. There was no immediate word on their
impressions.
	   The state news agency Tanjug quoted Yugoslav officials as
telling them the KLA had increased its attacks on police to
coincide with the start of recent talks between Serbian and ethnic
Albanian officials. The rebels clearly want to end talks that might
compromise their independence battle, they said, blaming the
militants for armed attacks that have killed 53 civilians and 18
policemen this year.
	   Nonetheless, foreign powers have not given up hope for
diplomatic efforts to end the crisis. Wolfgang Ischinger, a German
Foreign Ministry official, met in Belgrade with Yugoslav officials
Sunday and demanded that they hold talks with Kosovo Albanians with
``unbiased international observers'' present.

World Cup: South Africa arrives for first World Cup appearance

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Hundreds of townspeople, including children
holding soccer balls, greeted South Africa's soccer team when it
arrived Sunday in this central French town for its first World Cup.
	   A police motorcade escorted the South African team bus for the
final 10 kilometers (six miles) of the trip, and the crowd cheered
the players when they got off, team manager Augusto Palacios said.
	   ``Wonderful. It was tremendous. The players loved it,'' he said.
	   South Africa will be based in Vichy for the tournament, holding
its training sessions on local sports fields and traveling to
Marseilles, Toulouse and Bordeaux for its three first-round matches
against Pool C opponents France, Denmark and Saudi Arabia.
	   Considered a longshot to advance to the second round, the South
African enter the tournament never having beaten a European or
Middle Eastern country. In their final tuneup on Saturday in
Germany, the South Africans conceded a late goal and settled for a
1-1 draw with Iceland.
	   Benni McCarthy of Ajax Amsterdam scored the South African goal
in the 36th minute, but a 73rd minute strike by Stefan Thordarsen
tied it up for Iceland.
	   South African coach Phillipe Troussier, a Frenchman who took
over in March, has put together a team of mostly European-based
players in hopes of having battle-ready veterans for the
tournament.
	   But the lack of preparation time, and adapting to Troussier's
European-style ball-control system, has caused South Africa
problems in scoring goals in its recent matches. Under Troussier,
South Africa tied Zambia 1-1 and lost 2-0 to Argentina prior to
Saturday night's draw.
	   South Africa plays its first match on Friday against host France
in Marseilles and will be the underdog, a position Troussier says
he likes because it puts pressure on the French to perform in front
of their fans.
	   It is the first World Cup appearance for South Africa, which was
banned from international soccer for 28 years until 1992 because of
apartheid.

World Cup dreams for Corretja
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Alex Corretja did not have much success on the
tennis court Sunday, but he hopes his nifty footwork after the
men's final of the French Open impressed his national team's coach.
	   Only days before the start of the World Cup tournament, Corretja
showed off his soccer skills as he accepted the runnerup's plate.
	   After losing to Spanish compatriot Carlos Moya in the final,
Corretja knocked around a ball with soccer great Pele. Edson
Arantes do Nascimento _ better known as Pele _ was on the court to
present the awards to the men's finalists.
	   Pele also gave Moya and Corretja soccer balls. Moya started
heading the ball back and forth with Pele, who then did the same
with Corretja _ who also showed off by bouncing the ball off his
knees and feet for a while.
	   Corretja then booted the ball high into the stands.
	   When asked about his soccer skills, Corretja joked he would like
to talk with Spanish coach Javier Clemente.
	   ``Maybe I'm going to ask Clemente if he wants me for the team,''
Corretja said with a smile. ``Because I can see myself doing quite
well with the ball.''
	    &UR; --- &QC; 
	    &UR; BIRTHDAY GIRL: &LR;  A day before her 16th birthday, Nadejda Petrova
of Russia gave herself a nice present. Petrova became the French
Open girls singles champion Sunday in her first Grand Slam.
	   But Petrova is in no hurry to follow in the footsteps of other
Russian teen sensations such as Anna Kournikova and Marat Safin by
moving from the juniors to the professional ranks.
	   ``I think you have to get there step by step, not so fast,'' she
said.
	   On the boys' side, Fernando Gonzales of Chile became a double
champion. Gonzales won the boys' singles and the doubles with Jose
De Amas of Venezuela.
	   These are not the first Grand Slam titles for the 17-year-old
Gonzales, who won the U.S. Open boys' doubles last year. He also
plays Davis Cup for Chile, teaming with Marcelo Rios _ who was the
No. 3 seed among the men this year at Roland Garros.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DOUBLE THE FUN: &LR;  Martina Hingis and Jana Novotna are sticking
to a winning combination. The pair won the women's doubles title
Sunday at Roland Garros when they beat Lindsay Davenport and
Natasha Zvereva.
	   Hingis and Novotna, who won 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), are having so much
fun they're staying together.
	   ``We said we'd play Wimbledon and probably continue for the rest
of the year,'' Novotna said.
	   ``No reason not to play together if we keep winning like this,''
Hingis added.
	   The two got together when Hingis' Australian Open doubles
partner, Mirjana Lucic, came down with chicken pox before the start
of the French Open. Hingis and Lucic won the Australian Open
doubles title, making this the second Grand Slam title in doubles
for Hingis this year.
	   In the men's doubles final, the top-seeded team of Jacco Eltingh
and Paul Haarhuis from the Netherlands beat Mark Knowles and Daniel
Nestor.
	   Eltingh had teamed with Jonas Bjorkman to win the Australian
Open doubles title over the Australian team of Todd Woodbridge and
Mark Woodforde.
	   Haarhuis opted to miss the Australian tournament because his
wife was expecting their first child.

	   Commerce and Industries Ministers Tofail Ahmed has urged the
least developed countries ( LDCs) to organise themselves to realise
their rightful demands, particularly in securing duty-free market
access and opening up to trading opportunities.
	   The minister said this while briefing the permanent
representatives of LDCs to the United Nations in New York
yesterday, according to a message received here yesterday.
	   He hoped that in the upcoming substantive session of the ECOSOC
the LDCs will take united initiative for the implementation of the
preferential treatment for LDCs.
	   Permanent representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations
Anwarul Karim Chowdhury chaired the meeting.
	   Referring to the mandate of the seventh annual ministerial
meeting of LDCs at the UN last year Tofail said Bangladesh Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina had carried out this mandate given by the
ministers of 48 LDCs. While explaining the role of Bangladesh as a
coordinator of LDCs, Tofail referred to the letter written by Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina to British Prime Minister Tony Blair prior
to the G-8 summit in Birmingham on May 17 last.
	   This was in response to a mandate given to her by LDCs at the
seventh annual ministerial meeting in New York, he said.
	   Tofail drew attention of the permanent representatives to the
final outcome of the Birmingham summit and said all the proposals
of Sheikh Hasina had been positively reflected there.
	   He said the announcement provided for duty-free access for the
goods from LDCs, mostly on an autonomous basis, undertook to help
LDCs to make markets of industrialised countries more attractive to
foreign capital flows, recommended the OECD to propose a text by
1999 to unite aid to LDCs and supported speedy implementation of
high indebted poor country ( HIPC) initiative of the international
financial institutions.
	   Earlier, the minister had a meeting with US permanent
representative to the UN Ambassador Bill Richardson. They discussed
issues of mutual interest.

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Defender Moreno Torricelli may be cut from
Italy's World Cup team because of an injured right ankle and
possibly replaced by striker Enrico Chiesa, coach Cesare Maldini
said Sunday.
	   A final decision about Torricelli's exclusion will be made
Monday following a another series of examinations.
	   Torricelli, 28, of Italian league champion Juventus, has been
sidelined the last seven days because of a sore ankle and did not
play the warmups against Sweden on Tuesday nor against a French
regional selection on Sunday.
	   The defender was not expected to be in the starting lineup
Thursday in Italy's Group B opener against Chile.
	   Chiesa, of Parma, already is with the Italian team. He was
brough to France as a possible replacement for Alessandro Del
Piero, who's recovering from a right thigh strain and is expected
to stay with the team.
	   Chiesa's possible inclusion would raise to five the number of
Italy's strikers and reduce defenders to six.
	   The final lists of 22 World Cup players have been submitted to
FIFA by the June 2 deadline but the teams still can replace injured
players until June 10.

	   NARSINGDI, June 6: The installation work on the 41-km
transmission line of Titas Gas at a cost of Tk 308 crore and 57
lakhs between Narsingdi and Siddhirganj has been completed.
	   The 20-inch diameter line has been sunk 28 feet deep under the
Sitalakhya river bed through 'directional drilling' procedures.
	   With this, the third Natural Gas Development project of the
Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company, planned to supply
additional 25 crore cubic feet of gas a day to the outskirts of the
capital, has almost been completed.
	   The work on the project got off to a start in July '94 with the
financial assistance from ADB and the OECE.
	   The Singapore-based American firm Charington Asia Ltd. has taken
up the job of connecting the pipeline with the main supply across
the river.
	   The next phase of the project includes extension of Demra and
Joydebpur city gate stations, construction of regulatory and
monitoring stations at Ghorashal, Palash, and Ashuganj Zia
Fertiliser factories as well as increasing gas supply facilities to
Dhaka and other places.
	   It will now be possible, Titas sources said, to supply gas to
the under-construction 210-mw power station at Siddhirganj as well
as proposed 190, 36 and 200-mw power stations at Haripur after the
construction of the Narsingdi-Siddhirganj pipeline.
	   This will, the sources said, also help to supply gas to the four
barge-mounted power plants.

	   Convenor of the association Rezaul Haque Chowdhury Mustaq spoke
at a press conference at the Jatiya Press Club yesterday. Vice
president of the association Munir Hossain, member secretary Md
Zahirul Haque, members Komol Sarker, MA Wazed and president of
Bangladesh Tanti League Khagendra Chandra Debnath were present.
	   The association convenor said they came to learn from some
sources that the existing alternative assistance for export of
Jamdani was going to be reduced in next budget. He said it would
adversely affect the promising Jamdani industry of the country.
	   Mustaq said some entrepreneurs had taken the risky initiative of
taking the Jamdani to foreign market. He said they had achieved
some success in creating market for Jamdani in India, the Middle
East, the UK and the USA. He said export of Jamdani could reduce
the existing trade imbalance between Bangladesh and India. He said
reduction of alternative assistance for the export of Jamdani would
nip in the bud the possibility.
	   The association convenor demanded extension of the time limit
for remittance of money from Jamdani export to 180 days from
existing 120 days. He also demanded giving the facility of drawing
90 per cent money through LC to the exporters of Jamdani in case of
export through purchase order which other exporters of the textile
sector were now enjoying. He demanded release of alternative
assistance money to the exporters of Jamdani within shortest
possible time.
	   Mustaq also demanded steps against terrorists who were
threatening the Jamdani industry.
	   He said Tk 26 crore was earned through export of Jamdani from
February to April last year. He said the amount of export of
Jamdani increased substantially following the alternative
assistance.
	   He said about 15,000 weavers are involved in Jamdani industry
whose livelihood would be endangered if the alternative assistance
to the export of Jamdani was reduced. He said reduction of
alternative assistance would mean destruction of Jamdani industry
like Muslin industry.

	   The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) has requested a
Singapore-based sea liner not to impose surcharge as CPA has taken
some urgent measures to ease congestion.
	   The CAP made the request in a letter on Thursday to Sea
Consortium Pvt Ltd, who last week threatened to slap congestion
surcharge on the country's main seaport from June 16, officials
said yesterday.
	   A senior official of the CPA, reached by phone from Dhaka, told
APB that they had taken some urgent measures to normalise the port
operations after the threat by the feeder liner.
	   The Sea Consortium in a letter to the CPA said they had decided
to impose the penal surcharge on Chittagong Port from June 16 if
the congestion was not removed by June 14.
	   It complained that they have to wait at outer-anchorage for days
just for berth in the port while loading and unloading take much
more time compared to other ports, causing them to bear extra
costs.
	   After receiving the letter, the CPA asked the importers to clear
their containers from the port sheds within 10 days of unloading,
lowering the time-limit from 28 days, or pay fines.
	   The officials said delays in clearing the imported containers
are one of the major causes of congestion in the port as the
importers have a tendency to use the sheds as gowdowns.
	   Also, the port authorities have taken necessary measures to
ensure round-the-clock port activities, they said.
	   Chittagong Feeder Trade Committee, the Singapore-based
association of feeder liners, had imposed congestion surcharge on
the port earlier, which took heavy toll on the country's
businesses.
	   According to an estimate by the Shipping Ministry, the exporters
and importers had to pay around 7 million US dollars extra for the
surcharge, apart from the transport costs.

	   MYMENSINGH, June 6: Installation work of a 60-megawatt
barge-mounted power plant, financed by the Asian Development Bank,
has begun at Shambhuganj.
	   Officials said ADB is bearing 70 per cent of the costs,
totalling Tk. 250 crore. The rest will be shared by the government
and five Palli Bidyut samities.
	   A consortium of Mitsubishi Engineering and Shipbuilding Company
of Japan and a European firm is implementing the turbine-driven
power plant on 30 acres of land on the bank of river Brahmaputra.
	   A German company is in charge of overall supervision of the
project and a Chinese firm will work on transmission line, the
officials said.
	   A French firm is making the ``Open Cycle'' generator for the
unit in France. It will be brought into the country and mounted on
a barge at the project site.
	   The project is expected to be completed by April next year.
Initially, the power plant will generate 60 megawatt electricity,
but its capacity will be raised up to 180 MW in phases, Project
Manager Helal Uddin told APB.
	   The electricity from the plant, one of a number of its kind
planned across the country, will be thrown into the power-hungry
national grid through the local Kewatkhali grid.

Serb police beat protesters in Pristina; KLA seeks more help

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Clinton-Blair conversation, comments by British,
Yugoslav and German officials; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police beat protesters with
clubs as they worked to break up a Kosovo independence rally
Sunday.
	   At least half a dozen demonstrators were seriously injured,
according to the Kosovo Information Center, which is allied with
the separatist ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province.
	   More than 100 uniformed and plainclothes police broke up the
demonstration by ethnic Albanians in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo.
	   The unexpected violence in Pristina came as Serbian forces
pressed their fierce offensive against militants in western Kosovo,
where shelling reportedly continued Sunday.
	   The stepped-up Serbian campaign launched in late May has left at
least 50 people dead, 200 missing and thousands fleeing their
destroyed villages, according to ethnic Albanian officials.
	   Pristina itself had remained largely free of violence despite
months of clashes this year between Serbs trying to assert their
control over the province and the self-described Kosovo Liberation
Army, made up of ethnic Albanians who want to drive Serb
``occupiers'' out.
	   But on Sunday, seemingly without warning, police charged the
approximately 1,000 protesters gathered for the 57th consecutive
daily rally against Serbian rule.
	   One protester could be seen bleeding in the street after he was
hit in the head by a policeman's gun butt and then kicked
repeatedly.
	   It was the first attack on protesters since March, when
thousands of ethnic Albanians were attacked for protesting an
earlier crackdown by government forces.
	   Albanian TV in Tirana reported that the Serbs shelled at least
two Kosovo villages Sunday. It also said ethnic Albanian militants
blew up the police headquarters in Ratkoc, and, amid fierce
fighting between the two sides, all the Serb residents and police
had fled.
	   It is not clear how much of a setback the Serb offensive has
dealt Kosovo's clandestine rebel army, which claims to control some
40 percent of the southern province of Yugoslavia's Republic of
Serbia, and which enjoys growing popularity.
	   The KLA appealed in a statement published Sunday in the
newspaper Koha Ditore for more ethnic Albanians to join them and
``fight for freedom'' from Serbian forces.
	   ``Come to strengthen our troops against the enemy artillery and
enemy infantry,'' the statement said.
	   Western powers, fearing another border change in the volatile
Balkans, oppose Kosovo's bid for independence, but want the Serbs
to cease their offensive and give Kosovo the autonomy taken away by
Serbia in 1989.
	   The offensive that began in late May has stirred increasing
international concern and fears of igniting a wider war in the
Balkans. Pope John Paul II called on the world Sunday to act
against violence and repression in Kosovo.
	   The United States and others are deliberating on what steps to
take, with a reimposition of sanctions against Yugoslavia and
military intervention both under consideration.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke to U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Sunday and they agreed to send a ``strong message ''
that a Serb offensive in the restive province is unacceptable, a
Blair aide said.
	   ``The use of tanks, of artillery, of the might of the military
army against civilian centers of population is wholly unacceptable
within the modern Europe,'' British Foreign Minister Robin Cook
said earlier.
	   The exodus of some 20,000 Kosovo Albanians into Albania last
week, and another 7,000 to 10,000 into the neighboring Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, also has stirred worry in the West.

World Cup: ``Backup'' forwards give Brazil added scoring punch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Ronaldo is practically
everybody's choice to win the high-scoring honors for Brazil at the
World Cup. The problem is, he's not scoring.
	   Bebeto is Brazil's No. 2 striker, a spot he inherited after
Romario was cut from the squad with an injured calf muscle. But the
1994 Cup champion isn't finding the net either.
	   Is coach Mario Zagallo worried? Hardly. He has a ``backup'' pair
of strikers in midfielders Giovanni and Rivaldo, two converted
forwards who have picked up the scoring slack and given Brazil an
offensive punch it hasn't had since the storied Cup team of 1982.
	   The duo from Spain's FC Barcelona were at it again Sunday, when
Zagallo held an intra-squad scrimmage that pitted starters against
reserves in a simulation of next Wednesday's opener against
Scotland.
	   With Ronaldo getting tight coverage, Giovanni got loose in the
penalty area to tap in the first goal in a 2-0 victory for the
``A'' team. Rivaldo also scored and put another ball on the
crossbar with a delicate lob shot that drew applause from the fans
that flocked to watch the Brazilians practice.
	   The script has been similar in other practice games ever since
Brazil came to France last month, in quest of an unprecedented
fifth World Cup title.
	   In a 1-1 exhibition game tie last week with Spain's Atletico
Bilbao, Rivaldo got the Brazilian goal. When Brazil beat Andorra
3-0, Giovanni and Rivaldo each tallied, along with lateral defender
Cafu.
	   Giovanni knows he could have a rare opportunity to shine as
opposing defenders concentrate on stopping Ronaldo, the two-time
FIFA Player of the Year.
	   ``Our adversaries will pay a lot of attention to Ronaldo. The
marking will be tough,'' Giovanni said. ``That means more spaces
will be open for us.''
	   Zagallo has had high praise for Giovanni in training camp, where
he has shown tactical discipline in marking and creativity on
offense. This week, Zagallo said Giovanni would get extra duties as
playmaker and offensive coordinator.
	   ``It's a new function,'' the coach said. ``I want him to be our
third attacker.''
	   That's something Giovanni knows well, ever since he burst on to
the national scene by leading Santos to the finals of the 1995
Brazilian championship, where it lost to Botafogo.
	   But it's also quite a turnaround for the 26-year-old Amazon
native. Giovanni was a surprise on the 22-player roster _ not that
anyone doubted his talent, but Giovanni often seemed cool and
distant during games. Many felt he was included simply because of
his good on-field relationship with Rivaldo, a Zagallo favorite.
	   While Rivaldo will get defensive chores in Brazil's midfield, he
also has played up front on various top-line teams, including
Corinthians, Palmeiras and Spain's Deportivo La Coruna. His goals
led Barcelona to the Spanish first-division title this year.
	   When Brazil lost Romario, Zagallo didn't call a direct
replacement but instead summoned Emerson, an extra midfielder. With
Giovanni and Rivaldo as possible backups for Ronaldo, Bebeto,
Edmundo and Denilson, who needed one more?
	   For Ronaldo, his current scoring drought is not a concern.
	   ``The team is evolving every day. We have very few things to
improve,'' he said. ``We don't have to worry about our adversaries
_ they have to worry about us.''

	   The reckless use of DDT and heptachlor, the two highly-toxic
pesticides of the so-called dirty dozen family, are heavily
contaminating the underground water in the rural areas, creating
the health hazards for the people.
	   A study conducted by the National Minor Irrigation Development
Project (NMIDP) in collaboration with Bangladesh Atomic Energy
Commission (BAEC) found the sub-soil water of different regions of
the country having traces of toxic residues of pesticides - DDT and
heptachlor which are banned and allowed only for restricted use in
Bangladesh.
	   In most cases, heptachlor residues were found to be beyond the
World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended level of 0.03 microgram
per litre. One of the samples contained heptachlor residue of 0.789
microgram per litre while DDT in another sample measured 1.527
microgram per litre.
	   The sampling spread all over the country and sites adjacent to
sugarcane growing areas where heptachlor applications are
sufficiently permitted, said Ruhul Amin, a senior scientific
officer of the Institution of Food and Radiation Biology (IFRB).
	   He said the total residues of DDT found in some of the water
samples were less than permitted PPB (parts per billion). But, Amin
said, the question is that DDT is not permitted for food and
agriculture use.
	   The presence of DDT and heptachlor residues indicates that the
contraband highly toxic pesticides are still being used
indiscriminately, the study said.
	   The water samples were collected specially from the country's
irrigation-based areas including Laksam, Burirchar and Sarulia in
greater Comilla district, Gopalpur and Ghatail in Tangail,
Gobindaganj and Peerganj in Rangpur, Charbangshi in Noakhali,
Mirershawarai, Patia, Satkania and Rauzan in Chittagong and
Durgapur in Mymensingh.
	   NMIDP, a government project, supplied 169 samples from these
areas to the institution of food and radiation biology (IFRB) of
BAEC to analyse both underground as well as surface water quality.
	   Heptachlor formulation is registered for restricted use only in
sugarcane cultivation in the country.
	   Former chairman of BAEC M A Quayum said percolation of
carcinogenic pesticides including DDT and heptachlor into human
body may lead to cancer and neurological problems.
	   He said the traces of DDT and heptachlor in the underground
water of the country is a threat to human safety as billions of
people survive on tubewell water.
	   Human health would be affected by dreadful diseases if
underground water contamination is not checked by minimising the
use of toxic pesticides in agriculture, Quayum said.

	   Dhanmondi, the first planned elite residential area of the
capital, as dreamt by city fathers in the fifties, has now turned
into one of the busy and crowded place due to the mushroom growth
of schools, colleges, clinics and business establishments.
	   ``It looks more like a business centre than a residential place
for families to live in tranquillity and peace,'' said a senior
resident living in this area for the last 40 years.
	   About 140 schools, coaching centres and training institutes,
kindergartens, primary schools, high schools and colleges are
functioning in the area.
	   There are also several universities teaching business, computer,
medical education, agriculture etc. They are functioning in this
residential area claiming affiliation to universities in the UK and
the US and promising certificates acceptable to those universities.
	   Some of the universities here have been offering Doctor of
Philosophy (Ph D) and also Master of Science (MS) degrees to their
students ignoring their minimum standard.
	   Important universities in the area include the People's
University of Bangladesh, Darul Ehsan Medical College and
University, Asian University of Bangladesh, Dhaka International
University, Asia Pacific University, and the Bangladesh University
of Business, Agriculture and Technology.
	   Even the offices of the National University of Bangladesh and
Open University run by the government are located there.
	   Some of these universities seem to be more eager to exploit the
students than imparting them education at reasonable cost.
	   Sources said about 75 per cent of the educational institutions
now functioning in the area had no approval of the Ministries of
Education, Housing and Public Works and Environment, RAJUK, the
Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), and WASA.
	   Although such commercial ventures were not allowed to operate in
the residential areas, they are running business 'by their own
rights' almost totally ignoring traffic jams, snatching, terrorism
and other social evils that have followed their growth in the once
peaceful place of dignified living.
	   Tuition fees in the primary and English medium schools up to O
level are so high that they are above the reach of the middle
income people. And yet these schools are running to their full
capacity.
	   Some of the English medium schools have a fleet of transport
vehicles. One school which has 27 buildings and branches in the
city has up to 200 microbuses according to a source. The tuition
fees in these schools average Tk 3,000 to Tk 4,000 per month and in
some cases even up to Tk 5,000.
	   There are also madrasas, technical schools, language schools,
computer training centres, research centres, professional and human
resources development institutions, staff colleges of banks and
rest houses of public corporations. Some of these institutions have
residential facilities and own multi-storeyed buildings in the
Dhanmondi area and also its adjoining areas like Rayer Bazar, West
Dhanmondi, Jhikatala, Kalabagan, Sukrabad, Lalmatia, Mohammedpur,
Crescent Road and Green Road.
	   About 80 per cent of the students enrolled in these institutions
are outsiders attending classes from different parts of the city
and from the outskirts of the city.

	   The government will distribute rice free of cost among the poor
and destitute people in union levels for four months from the next
year.
	   ``The government has taken the step for the welfare of the poor
people,'' said State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief
Talukdar Abdul Khaleq here on Friday.
	   Addressing the annual conference of Relief and Rehabilitation
Employees Association, he informed that for the project vulnerable
group feeding cards will be distributed in every union.
	   He told the function, apart from building infrastructure, the
government has taken up the programme to distribute free of cost
rice through VGF cards in the natural disaster affected areas.
	   ``From the next year the programme of distributing free rice for
four months will be extended all over the country,'' he added.
	   Association president and plaintiff in Bangabandhu murder case,
AFM Mohitul Islam presided over the conference, said an official

	   The deed writers of the country called upon the government to
realise their 6-point demand by June 13 next, otherwise they will
go for indefinite strike throughout the country.
	   The call was made at a press conference of the Bangladesh Deed
Writers Association held at the Registration Complex in the city
yesterday afternoon.
	   The written statement of the association read out by Mukter
Hossain, Organising Secretary, said that a total of two lakh deed
writers and stamp vendors are working in the country.
	   The government, following publishing of DOLA (Department of Land
Administration) Report which stressed the need for modernising the
registration system of the country, has been trying to implement
the recommendations of the report reportedly to unemploy the deed
writers and vendors, the association leaders said.
	   The leaders also called for cancelling the DOLA Report saying
that it would create a lot of problems in selling and buying the
land for which the country would lose a good amount of revenue from
the registration of land. At present, the government earns taka 900
crore from the registration.
	   The 6-point demand of the association includes cancellation of
DOLA Report, continuing of present stamp-vendor deeds, cancellation
of form system, formation of deed writers council, building of
office for vendors at every sub-registrar office and offering 10
per cent commission to the stamp vendors for selling the same.
	   The press conference was attended, among others, by Elahi Box
Mondol, President of the association, Abdur Rouf, Secretary
General, Salim Reza, Vice President, Faridul Islam Bahadur, Awlad
Hossain and others.

World Cup: Shakpore gets OK for Italy trip for shoulder
</HEADLINE>
examination &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELINCOURT STE.-MARGUERITE, France (AP) _ His team's backline
already in disarray, Nigeria coach Bora Milutinovic gave permission
Sunday for injured defender Jero Shakpore to fly to Italy and have
his injured shoulder examined by his club doctor.
	   Nigeria has been outscored 12-1 in its last three World Cup
tuneup matches, and Milutinovic has five days to fix the problem
before the Super Eagles open Group D play against Spain.
	   Shakpore, who turned 19 last month, hurt his left shoulder in
Friday's 5-1 rout by the Netherlands. He could be sidelined up to
five weeks.
	   ``My doctor said there is hope (to play in the World Cup) with
the right treatment,'' said the Reggiana defender, who will fly to
Italy on Monday to meet with the club doctor.
	   ``I am very sorry about what happened with Jero. It's impossible
to change bad luck,'' Milutinovic said. ``We need to concentrate on
defense and this doesn't help.''
	   If Shakpore is ruled out _ which seems likely _ Milutinovic may
replace him on the 22-man roster with Mobi Oparaku, a defender for
Belgian club Kapellen.
	   Oparaku and another non-roster player, midfielder Steve Musa,
are with the team at its 16th-century chateau training headquarters
on the outskirts of Elincourt Ste.-Marguerite, about 90 kilometers
(55 miles) north of Paris.
	   Milutinovic conducted a light practice in the rain Sunday with
players who did not see action against the Netherlands. The real
work gets underway Monday, with practices twice a day.
	   Nigeria made the second round of the World Cup in 1994, then won
the Olympic gold medal in 1996. Those successes caused some to
consider Nigeria an outside contender at this year's World Cup.
	   But the defeat by the Netherlands after other poor performances
has brought calls from the Nigerian public and news media for
Milutinovic's ouster, even though he just took over in December.
	   Milutinovic was unwilling to talk much about the rout by the
Netherlands.
	   ``We haven't had good results but we'll be ready for the (World
Cup) games,'' he said. ``I know my players are upset, but you have
to believe.''

	   Leaders of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists (BFUJ)
and Dhaka Union of Journalists (DUJ) yesterday expressed
indignation over the closure of the office of daily Reporter
without prior notice.
	   In a joint statement BFUJ President Amanullah Kabir, Secretary
General MA Aziz, Acting President of DUJ Abu Saleh and General
Secretary Ruhul Amin Gazi alleged that the Editor and Director of
the daily Ershad Mazumdar has kept the office under lock and key
since June 4.
	   They also alleged that the office was closed with an ill motive
to deprive the journalists of their dues and legitimate claims.
	   The BFUJ and DUJ leaders condemned such a step and demanded of
the person concerned to resolve the problems with the journalists
and employees by immediately reopening of the office of the daily.

	   A two-member Bangladesh delegation, led by Home Minister Rafiqul
Islam, left here at midnight Friday to attend the UN General
Assembly Special Session on World Drug Problem, beginning in New
York on Monday.
	   The three-day special UN General Assembly session will assess
the international drug problems and develop a strategy to combat
the menace in the 21st century.
	   The session will mark the 10th anniversary of the 1998 United
Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances.
	   Six main themes to be considered at the session are: precursor
chemicals, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), judicial cooperation,
money laundering, drug demand reduction and elimination of illicit
crops and alternative development.
	   The session will set out a comprehensive global strategy,
designed to tackle simultaneously all aspects of the drug problem.
	   It will further put forward a bold objective aiming at
simultaneous reduction of both illicit supply and demand for drugs
by 2008.

Spanish players are doing something right
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ They travel together, play video games together,
practice together, party together. And win together.
	   They're nice guys, too.
	   What is it about these Spanish players?
	   ``We're cool, you know,'' says Alex Corretja.
	   Whatever it is, an ever-growing crop of Spanish players keeps on
getting better. On Sunday, Carlos Moya, perhaps the most promising
of the bunch, won the French Open title in straight sets over
countryman Corretja.
	   A day earlier, the dependable Arantxa Sanchez Vicario assured a
Spanish sweep when she beat Monica Seles for her third title at
Roland Garros.
	   And there were many others to take note of in Paris: Felix
Mantilla, who reached the semis; Albert Costa, Alberto Berasategui
and Francisco Clavet, who all got to the round of 16.
	   ``We have, around, millions of guys on the tour now,'' Corretja
said.
	   The players' box, often a site of tense coexistence between
rival clans, looked like a family picnic on Sunday. Moya's family
hugged Corretja's family when the match was over. Arantxa was
there, and so was her mother. Everybody was happy.
	   In fact, loser Corretja was pretty cheery, too. He hurdled the
net after the match to congratulate his buddy. He knocked around a
soccer ball on the victory stand with Moya and Pele, the soccer
great.
	   And he came into the post-match news conference with a big
smile.
	   ``I'm really happy because I've been playing well for the last
two weeks, and I lost to a really good friend of mine,'' he said.
	   Why are the Spanish players so close? One reason is that they
grow up together. The Spanish tennis federation has developed a
tiered system of training centers. Talent is spotted in youngsters,
and developed early on.
	   All the top players are based in Barcelona, meaning three of the
four men's semifinalists this year live in the same town.
	   And in contrast to some American stars, who travel and mix only
with their own entourage, the Spanish players spend a lot of time
together on the tour. Moya, Mantilla and Corretja all went out for
ice cream and video games to celebrate their quarterfinal wins.
	   The solidarity on tour helps the players do well, Corretja says.
	   ``You have a lot of trouble going around and seeing people who
just want to beat you,'' he said. ``It's great if you have some
friends who can help you once you feel sad, or if somebody just
beat you, and you go to the hotel and just feel alone in the
room.''
	   At 21, Moya seems to have the brightest future of the bunch.
	   He stormed into prominence at the 1997 Australian Open, beating
defending champion Boris Becker in the first round, then beating
Michael Chang, and getting all the way to the final, where he lost
to Pete Sampras.
	   He also got a lot of attention in Australia for his long-haired,
dashing good looks. But mostly, he showed that a so-called
clay-court specialist also can win on the harder surfaces.
	   Moya has more all-court weapons than some of his compatriots,
and will move to the No. 5 ranking this week.
	   ``If I win Wimbledon, maybe I'm No. 1, huh?'' he said with a
smile, knowing his chances of winning on grass are remote.
	   Corretja has yet to win a Grand Slam title, but has at least
shown he has the perserverance to do it. He's perhaps best known
for his marathon match against Sampras at the 1996 U.S. Open, when
he took the American to a fifth-set tiebreaker, then lost on a
double fault after Sampras had vomited on court.
	   Now Corretja just wants to keep up with buddy Moya.
	   ``Geez, he just won a Grand Slam already,'' he said. ``I've got
to push a little bit.''

	   Historic 7th June will be observed today commemorating the
launch of mass movement on six-point demand that culminated in
independence of Bangladesh.
	   On this day way back in 1966, worker Manu Miah and several
others were killed, in police firing in Dhaka during a hartal
enforced by Awami League in the then East Pakistan, to press home
the historic 6-point charter of demands.
	   President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina issued separate messages highlighting the significance of
the day and the demands in national life.
	   In his message President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed said the
historic six-point demand is a charter of flourishing national
entity, and guiding the people towards the fight for protecting
their interests.
	   The subsequent movement, the President said, had unified the
people of all strata with a national spirit leading to emergence of
Bangladesh as an independent state.
	   In her message Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for building
a developed and glorious Bangladesh to realise the dreams of the
martyrs of historic 7th June.
	   The Prime Minister said on this day in 1966, Manu Miah, Shafiq,
Shamsul and a number of unnamed people were killed by police and
EPR firings during a hartal, called by Awami League to press for
realisation of the historic 6-point demand.
	   Hasina said the 6-point demand had shaken up the foundation of
the Pakistani autocratic rule and exploitation in this country.
	   The Prime Minister said the autonomy movement, initiated by the
Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, had
gradually found its way towards the desire for independence and
armed struggle.
	   To observe the day, Awami League and its front organisations
have chalked out elaborate programmes.

World Cup: Germany arrives brimming with confidence

re-aggravating thigh injury. &QL;

	   NICE, France (AP) _ Three-time champion Germany arrived Sunday
in France brimming with confidence that it may become only the
second nation after Brazil to win four World Cup titles.
	   ``We are on a very, very good direction,'' captain Juergen
Klinsmann before the team left Frankfurt.
	   Arriving in the south of France, the team was whisked off the
plane straight onto a bus to take it to the German training
headquarters at Mas d'Artigny, just outside St-Paul-de-Vence in the
hills above the Mediterranean resort of Nice.
	   Dozens of German fans, including many couples with children,
waited in vain in catch a glimpse of their soccer heroes.
	   Aboard the special Lufthansa flight, team members were presented
with silver key rings bearing the date July 13 _ one day after the
Paris final _ the date they will return home if they win the title.
	   The players were also served desert made in the shape of soccer
balls and shoes.
	   The Germans trained in the early evening at a stadium in Nice
and will play a tuneup game against a local team Monday.
	   All but midfielder Christian Ziege, slowed by a cold, took part
in Sunday's workout, witnessed by about 100 fans. Defender Thomas
Helmer appeared to re-aggravate a right thigh injury and received
massage therapy on the field from team medical personnel.
	   It was not immediately known how serious the injury was.
	   The Germans arrived on the heels of an impressive 7-0 thrashing
of lowly Luxembourg on Saturday in Mannheim. One week ago, Germany
posted a convincing 3-1 victory over World Cup qualifier Colombia.
	   German soccer writers were quick to point out that two years ago
Germany posted a similarly lopsided victory (9-1) over
Liechtenstein, also in Mannheim, just before leaving for England to
capture the European Championship title.
	   But coach Berti Vogts does not have to rely on superstition. The
team, led by Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff and Ulf Kirsten, seems to
be peaking at the right time.
	   ``My players are more refreshed now than a week before,'' Vogts
said before team departed.
	   Germany is one of the perennial World Cup favorites and Vogts
and his players are not showing any false modesty, expecting to
reach at least the semifinals.
	   The Germans will train in Nice and fly to their games. They open
against the United States on June 15 in Paris, followed by
first-round games against Yugoslavia on June 21 in Lens and against
Iran on June 24 in Montpellier.

	   As the France World Cup, the biggest football jamboree, is
nearing on June 10, the football fans in the country are in great
anxiety about the uninterrupted watching of the games.
	   The BTV has already announced to telecast live 56 matches. But
frequent power failure due to short-production of electricity in
the country has threatened the uninterrupted viewing of the
matches.
	   The anxiety has been surfaced in a survey by Democracy Watch.
	   The survey showed that 80.70 per cent spectator will react
against the failure of the government for load shedding during the
World Cup matches.
	   The World Cup is bringing a major rescheduling in the daily
works of the majority of the urban people.
	   Office-goers, examinees, students and even housewives are
sketching new plans of their daily works to accommodate the World
Cup fixture.
	   Some 42.4 percent of the respondents agreed that regular works
would be hampered by the World Cup while 51.8 percent answered
negative.
	   Some 51.6 per cent respondents favoured rescheduling of
examinations during the matches and 47.4 per cent against.
	   Over 86 per cent female respondents will watch the matches while
the male percentage is about 90.
	   Brazil is the top favourite team with 43.7 per cent vote
followed by Argentina with 33.5 per cent, Italy 8.5 and Germany 3.5
and 5.8 per cent supported the other teams.
	   The survey was conducted on May 24-25 at different areas of
Dhaka and Chittagong.
	   Some 486 people were interviewed on various aspects of the forth
coming World Cup.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A group of Eritrean diplomats and their
families arrived in Cairo Sunday from Ethiopia, saying Ethiopian
authorities refused to let them carry anything more than their hand
bags.
	   Border tensions between the two African nations gained
international attention after Ethiopian jets bombed an airport near
the Eritrean capital of Asmara on Saturday.
	   With rising possibility of a war, Eritrea ordered its diplomats
to evacuate their posts in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and
the city of Mekele, and a group of 57 Eritreans arrived in Cairo
from Addis Ababa aboard the Egyptian carrier Egyptair.
	   The diplomats said Ethiopian authorities allowed them to leave
with only hand bags. The Eritreans are currently being held in
Cairo airport's quarantine section pending clearance by the Health
Ministry.
	   The diplomats and their families are expected to return to
Asmara.
	   Egyptair on Sunday announced it is resuming flights to Addis
Ababa after Ethiopian aviation officials informed them their routes
and airport were secure.

	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ Six ethnic Albanian children who
survived a dangerous three-day walk across the mountains from
Kosovo on their own were reunited Sunday with their joyful mothers.
	   ``It is incredible that I'm in the arms of my mother again,''
said 6-year Rexh Sasa of a reunion that her mother had given up
hope for.
	   The children's story provided a rare bright moment in the grim
exodus of what Albanian officials say is 20,000 Kosovo refugees to
their destitute neighboring country in the past week.
	   Another 7,000 to 10,000 ethnic Albanians have fled the Serb
offensive into Montenegro, the other republic left in Yugoslavia
besides Serbia.
	   Many of the villages the refugees left behind are reported badly
damaged or destroyed, and some people died as a result of the
arduous trek.
	   The six children, ranging in age from 4 to 14, left the besieged
village of Decani in western Kosovo as part of a group of over 100
refugees late Wednesday.
	   ``We had to leave _ Decani is completely destroyed by the
Serbian artillery,'' said 34-year-old Fale Caca, mother of four of
the children. ``Because of the Serbs, it has ceased to exist.''
	   On Thursday, the children became separated from the others when
the Serbian military attacked them with grenades, bombs and sniper
fire, according to the ethnic Albanians' account.
	   As of Sunday, Caca said, the extent of any casualties to the
rest of the fleeing group still wasn't known.
	   One of her daughters was the oldest of the missing children. A
small piece of bread she was carrying was all the children had to
eat during the ordeal.
	   ``I was very scared but I didn't want to tell them, otherwise
they would be more scared than me,'' said Shipe Caca, 14, who held
her 4-year-old brother in her arms for most of the trip.
	   A man from the border town of Bajram Curri, 28-year-old Xhevdej
Beqiri, found the children in the mountains on the Albanian side on
Saturday _ exhausted, hungry and with blisters on their bare feet.
He brought them to his apartment, where 25 Kosovo residents now are
staying, including 16 children.
	   The two mothers, who had made their way with the others to the
Albanian border town of Tropoja on Friday, were brought to the
children on Sunday.
	   ``I never believed I'd see my four children again,'' said the
weeping Caca, trembling with emotion. ``It was the most beautiful
gift that God has given me.''

World Cup: Despite denials, suspicions persist over doping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   L'ETRAT, France (AP) _ Official denials didn't quite erase
suspicions Sunday that an Argentine player may have tested positive
for a banned substance in a doping control conducted by the World
Cup team.
	   Coach Daniel Passarella and a player, Juan Veron, angrily denied
any doping after an Argentine radio station reported the case and
suggested that the midfielder was involved.
	   However, the team's physician, Dr. Luis Seveso, looked nervous
and contradicted himself at the news conference Saturday, fueling
the impression that something had happened.
	   ``It's possible that some substance might have showed up, but it
is well known that several players had the flu,'' Seveso said.
	   Other than Veron, offensive midfielder Marcelo Gallardo and
defender Pablo Paz are known to have the flu.
	   Seveso added that no doping had been uncovered and challanged
journalists ``to say what banned substance was involved.''
	   ``People are talking a lot of nonsense,'' he declared.
	   Later, the physician announced he was planning Saturday night to
``visit each room and tell the players not to take any medicine
without my consent.''
	   Passarella said he was ``tired of denying silly rumors. Lets
talk about soccer, please.''
	   Most of the 200 Argentine journalists who followed the team to
France for the month-long World Cup believe there was a drug
violation involving an anti-flu medicine, although probably not
serious enough to prompt sanctions.
	   On Sunday, team officials closed the team headquarters in this
village in the south of France to the news media until Tuesday.
	   The Argentine Soccer Association has acted with a strong hand in
doping cases, mindful of previous incidents that disrupted the
World Cup team.
	   At the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Diego Maradona
tested positive for ephedrine, a banned stimulant, and was
suspended for 15 months. Argentina was eliminated in the second
round.
	   In 1991, Maradona was suspended for 15 months by FIFA and the
Italian soccer federation for using cocaine. Another Argentine
international, Claudio Paul Caniggia, was also banned for 15 months
for using cocaine.
	   Neither Maradona nor Caniggia are in the current team.

England in control of the Edgbaston test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ England deprived Jonty Rhodes of only
his second test and then took control of the first cricket test at
Edgbaston.
	   England, despite losing wickets in search of quick runs,
remained in an unbeatable position at stumps on the fourth day
Sunday.
	   Rhodes was dismissed for 95 after a forceful 104-run eighth
wicket stand had saved face for South Africa.
	   England, 170 for eight, enjoyed an overall 289-run lead after
dismissing South Africa for 343. The home side scored 462 in its
first innings.
	   The highest South Africa has scored in the fourth innings to win
a test was 297. It was achieved against Australia at Melbourne in
1952/53.
	   Mike Atherton followed up his first innings 103 with a resolute
near three-hour 43 and shared two stands with Alec Stewart (28) and
Graham Thorpe (43).
	   England lost Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain cheaply, but
captains past and present _ Atherton and Alec Stewart _ combined
for a 49-run stand before the latter was dismissed.
	   This was followed by more than a run-a-ball 68 for the fourth
between Atherton and Thorpe before medium paceman Lance Klusener
bowled them both in the space of 13 balls.
	   Klusener followed up his 57 in South Africa's innings with 3-27.
He took 3-8 in 17 balls as England, well placed on 148 for three,
lost five wickets in as many overs.
	   Rhodes and Klusener came together after South Africa had slumped
to 224 for seven. The pair took the attack to England after Angus
Fraser had claimed Shaun Pollock and Mark Boucher in a 12-ball
spell.
	   The pair gradually batted South Africa to safety in a near
two-hour alliance. They first avoided the follow-on and then opened
out after the lunch break.
	   England dropped South Africa off the hook, dropping both
batsmen. Rhodes' miss was costly, as he went on to score 31 more.
South Africa was 248 for seven, still 15 runs short of following
on.
	   Rhodes and Klusener hammered 15 boundaries between them, four of
them by the latter in eight balls from medium-paceman Dominic Cork
after lunch.
	   Cork, who picked up the first four South African wickets, caught
and bowled Allan Donald to finish with 5-93.
	   Cork, returning to the side after a 16-month absence due to
injuries, claimed his first five-wicket haul since taking 5-116
against Pakistan at Leeds in 1996.
	   Fraser, Cork's new ball partner in the absence of the injured
Darren Gough, finished with 4-103.
	   Rhodes, South Africa's in-form batsman, shared two innings
building stands with Daryll Cullinan (78) and then Klusener.
	   Rhodes edged Fraser to 'keeper Stewart after a 229-minute vigil
that yielded eight boundaries and a six.

	   A checkpost has been set up in the city to identify and issue
warnings to the motor vehicles emitting black smoke and generating
high sound.
	   Jointly run by the Department of Environment and the Bangladesh
Road Transport Authority (BRTA), the checkpost was inaugurated by
the Minister for Forest and Environment Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury at
Manik Mian Avenue in front of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban yesterday.
	   At the checkpost, the officials will first paste a sticker on
the faulty vehicles and ask for rectification. Next, the owner of
the faulty vehicle will be warned that, if the defect is not
rectified then the licence of the vehicle will be cancelled. The
licence will be finally cancelled if the vehicle's defect is not
removed.
	   Sajeda Chowdhury, who pasted stickers on several vehicles,
called upon the city dwellers to create public awareness against
the bad effect of air and sound pollution caused by faulty motor
vehicles.
	   ``It is impossible for a small Ministry to keep the city free
from pollution,'' she said adding that it needed cooperation of all
concerned to stop the pollution.
	   We are proceeding towards death by inhaling smoke emitted by the
motor vehicles in the city, Sajeda said.
	   The children were growing up amid a great hazard due to the air
pollution, the Minister said and added ``it is shameful that
traffic police in the capital have to perform their duty wearing
masks''.
	   Ahbab Ahmed, Secretary, Ministry of Forest and Environment, AN
Hussain, Chairman of the BRTA and AR Khan, Director General of the
Department of Environment also spoke on the occasion.
	   AN Hussain said that several other checkposts will be set up in
the city soon. Checkposts will also be set up in other metropolitan
cities, he added.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dampening hopes for movement in the stalled
Mideast peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday said no accord was imminent on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   ``I don't work according to a stopwatch,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after meeting with his Cabinet.
	   The prime minister told his Cabinet that ``it is not possible to
say we are on the verge of an agreement,'' said a statement issued
after the meeting.
	   Later, Netanyahu told reporters: ``We're working toward reaching
an agreement. We're not there yet.''
	   Israel's army radio however, citing sources close to the
premier, said the American plan for a troop withdrawal will likely
to brought to Cabinet for a vote before the end of the week. The
radio reported that Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh,
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and U.S. Ambassador Edward
Walker were meeting later Sunday to discuss aspects of the deal.

	   The Workers and Employees Union of the Social Marketing Company
(CMC) has called upon the company authorities to accept their
demands including the reinstatement of 53 sacked workers and
withdrawal of cases against others.
	   The sacked workers included 29 women. Eight others including two
women were arrested earlier.
	   The Organising Secretary of the union Jamaluddin in a press
release yesterday said they were fighting for their survival. The
workers and employees of the company would begin a hunger strike at
the city's Paltan Maidan on June 12 if the authorities failed to
accept their demands.
	   He said that the company's top-heavy administration exploited
about 75 per cent of the management cost and it was now sacking
workers and employees as a part of cost-cutting measures.
	   Jamaluddin particularly blamed two management officials for the
crisis and called upon the management to accept their demands
immediately.

World Cup: Substitute Inzaghi scores three goals in Italy's tuneup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio and Christian Vieri teamed
in a tuneup game Sunday as they rehearsed Italy's possible
offensive tactic for the World Cup opener against Chile.
	   However it was second-half substitute Filippo Inzaghi who scored
three goals in a 7-0 victory of the ``Azzurri'' against the
regional amateur selection of Oise.
	   It was Italy's final warmup before Thursday's match with Chile
and Inzaghi's outstanding performance possibly posed a problem for
coach Cesare Maldini.
	   Vieri, the leading scorer in the Spanish league with Atletico
Madrid, was somewhat slow and unimpressive during the first half at
Italy's training camp in Senlis.
	   Baggio, a 31-year-old veteran who's starting in his third World
Cup, scored two beautiful goals and produced his usual imaginative
play.
	   Two other of four first-half goals against Oise were tallied by
Chelsea's midfielder Roberto Di Matteo.
	   Maldini said the game, in which he rotated 21 of the players
available, was not a decisive test for the match with Chile.
	   ``It was not intended to decide who must play or sit on the
substitutes bench,'' Maldini said after the tuneup. ``Inzaghi is in
the roster and may be used. Vieri is not yet at 100 percent after
missing the warmup with Sweden (because of stomach problems).''
	   ``Our midfield is the sector which must do much better. I was
not satisfied,'' the coach said.
	   Inzaghi, 24, of Italian champion Juventus of Turin, tallied 16
goals in league matches this year, second only to teammate
Alessandro Del Piero who had 21.
	   Del Piero, just recovered from a right thigh strain, is expected
to be replaced by Roberto Baggio in Italy's first World Cup match
at Bordeaux. He may regain his place on the starting 11 in the next
match against Cameroon.
	   Offensive midfielder Francesco Moriero, of Inter Milan,
alternated with more defensive Angelo Di Livio in a possible option
for the match with Chile.
	   Commenting on reports that Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano may be
sidelined with a knee injury, Moriero said he hoped for a quick
recovery by his Inter teammate.
	   ``I know that he desperately wants to play against Italy. He is
a key player for Chile. I hope he will be starting in Bordeaux
although he could be an additional threat for us, in addition to
(Marcelo) Salas,'' Moriero said.
	   Meanwhile, Maldini was considering the possibility to add
Parma's striker Enrico Chiesa to the Italian list to replace
injured defender Moreno Torricelli.
	   Team officials said that Torricelli may be axed from the Italian
team Monday following a round of medical examinations, including
scanning, to determine the extent of his right ankle injury.

Group of 43 Haitians washes ashore in Jamaica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A group of 43 Haitians trying to reach
Miami landed instead on a beach in one of Jamaica's northern resort
areas, police reported Sunday.
	   The group of 36 men, 6 women and a 7-month-old baby were at sea
for nine days on a 30-foot (9-meter) sailboat and had gone six days
without food, authorities said. Staff at the Golden Seas Beach
Hotel in Oracabessa on the north coast, found the Haitians after
they landed Saturday morning.
	   Hotel officials said the migrants were hungry but in good
health. The Haitians told police they left from Port-au-Prince, the
Haitian capital, on May 29 but had run out of food three days
later.
	   Bad weather blew them off course, they said.
	   The migrants were being housed in a shelter in nearby Port Maria
while immigration officials interviewed them and considered
requests for refugee status.

Police capture reputed head of Caribbean cartel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associates Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ One of Colombia's last remaining major
drug bosses has been captured in the northern port of Barranquilla,
his appearance altered by hair implants and his pockets full of
cash, the deputy national police director announced Sunday.
	   Caribbean cartel leader Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, alias ``The
Snail,'' allegedly smuggled tons of cocaine to Europe and the
United States since 1991. He has been indicted in Miami federal
court on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, said the
police official, Gen. Luis Ernesto Gilibert.
	   He said Colombia's foreign ministry would decide whether to
extradite Gamboa for trial to the United States under last year's
law that reinstated extradition.
	   The 43-year-old Orlandez was arrested Saturday, ringed by
bodyguards and carrying false identification documents and dlrs
U.S. 5,000 in cash, police said. He faces charges of murder,
kidnapping and illicit enrichment in Colombia. Police did not
provide details of the murder and kidnapping charges, saying only
that they were related to ``settling of accounts with drug
traffickers.''
	   Orlandez was arrested in 1993 on drug-trafficking charges and
held for 23 months on before authorities were forced to release him
because convictions could not be obtained in any of five cases
against him.
	   Police say Orlandez was one of the last of a nearly extinct
generation of Colombian drug traffickers: kingpins whose large
cartels vertically controlled the cocaine trade from processing to
smuggling to sales abroad. Today's leading traffickers, by
contrast, keep a low profile and operate in much smaller
organizations.
	   Paraded before reporters in Bogota on Sunday, Orlandez looked
worried and unkempt. He wore a blue T-shirt, khaki pants and
sandals, was thin and had hair implants, appearing nothing like the
overweight, balding Orlandez of police wanted poster photos.
	   Gilibert called him ``a highly dangerous individual ... This man
coordinated the largest drug shipments to the United States from
the Atlantic coast and has many years in the drug business.''
	   Orlandez was the last of five major figures of the Caribbean
coast cartel captured this past year, effectively dismantling the
organization, the police general said.
	   More than 5 tons of cocaine shipments owned by Orlandez have
been seized in Miami, New York, Lake Charles, Louisiana, Panama and
other locations since 1991, police said.

Russian Communist leader says chaos is in the offing in his
</HEADLINE>
country &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The leader of the Communist Party
of the Russian Federation said Sunday that President Boris Yeltsin
has installed in his country ``a feudal mafia,'' following the
disappearance of the Soviet Union.
	   ``In my country, nobody is building capitalism. We are victims
of the constant robbery and looting of our national resources''
Gennady Zyuganov said at a press conference in the central
headquarters of the Argentine Communist Party.
	   He predicted ``a chaotic situation if Yeltsin sticks to his
present economic model.''
	   According to Zyuganov, 20 million people are now unemployed in
Russia ``and another 15 million are leading a miserable life.''
	   Zyuganov said he intends to reinforce links with Latin American
leftist organizations. He arrived Saturday from Brazil and is
scheduled to fly Sunday night to Cuba for a two-day visit.
	   ``In the case of Cuba, our relations have been very strong for a
long time, and we plan to strengthen them'', he said.
	   Zyuganov depicted the current United States economic blockade
against Cuba as ``a political anachronism'' and praised the Cuban
people ``for being able to reform their system without sacrifying
its social achievements.''

Eritrean diplomats flee Ethiopia

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A group of Eritrean diplomats and their
families arrived Sunday in Cairo from Ethiopia, saying Ethiopian
authorities refused to let them carry anything more than their hand
bags.
	   Border tensions between the two Horn of Africa nations escalated
after Ethiopian jets bombed an airport near the Eritrean capital of
Asmara on Saturday.
	   With rising possibility of a war, Eritrea ordered its diplomats
to evacuate their posts in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and
the city of Mekele. A group of 57 Eritreans arrived in Cairo from
Addis Ababa aboard the Egyptian carrier Egyptair.
	   The Eritreans were being held in Cairo airport's quarantine
section pending clearance by the Health Ministry. The diplomats and
their families are expected to return to Asmara.
	   Egyptair on Sunday announced that it was resuming flights to
Addis Ababa after Ethiopian aviation officials informed them their
routes and airport were secure.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP ) _ To the strains of ``Let It Be,'' Paul McCartney
will on Monday say a public farewell to his wife, Linda, at a
memorial service at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, a historic London
church overlooking Trafalgar Square.
	   McCartney's office said two other former Beatles, George
Harrison and Ringo Starr, have been invited to the evening service,
but there were no plans for them to sing together.
	   Mrs. McCartney, a longtime crusader for vegetarianism and an
acclaimed photographer, died from breast cancer April 17. She was
56.
	   McCartney will be accompanied by their children, Heather, 36,
his wife's daughter by her first marriage, and Mary, 27, Stella,
26, and James, 21.
	   ``I believe there will be a brief mourning and then a
celebration of Linda's life,'' writer Carla Lane, a longtime friend
of the family, said Sunday. ``Paul does not want it to be a morbid
affair.''
	   Ms. Lane said she would represent hundreds of animal activists
who plan to gather in the square during the service.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dampening hopes for movement in the stalled
Mideast peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Sunday said no accord was imminent on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   ``I don't work according to a stopwatch,'' Netanyahu told
reporters after meeting with his Cabinet.
	   Netanyahu told his Cabinet that ``it is not possible to say we
are on the verge of an agreement,'' said a statement issued after
the meeting.
	   Later, Netanyahu told reporters: ``We're working toward reaching
an agreement. We're not there yet.''
	   Israel's army radio however, citing sources close to Netanyahu,
said the American plan for a troop withdrawal will likely be
brought to Cabinet for a vote before the end of the week. The radio
reported that Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat and U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker were
meeting later Sunday to discuss aspects of the deal.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ One of Colombia's last remaining major
drug bosses has been captured in the northern port of Barranquilla,
his appearance altered by hair implants and his pockets full of
cash, the deputy national police director announced Sunday.
	   Caribbean cartel leader Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, alias ``The
Snail,'' allegedly smuggled tons of cocaine to Europe and the
United States since 1991. He has been indicted in Miami federal
court on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, said the
police official, Gen. Luis Ernesto Gilibert.
	   He said Colombia's foreign ministry would decide whether to
extradite Orlandez for trial to the United States under last year's
law that reinstated extradition.

Brazilian defender hurt, misses practice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Brazilian defender Andre Cruz
sat out Sunday's practice with a sore thigh muscle but it probably
wasn't a serious injury.
	   ``Yesterday I was fine, and this morning I had a pain in the
back of my thigh. That would worry anybody,'' said Cruz, a reserve
for starting fullback Aldair.
	   Cruz said the results of MRI test Sunday were negative.
	   ``There was no swelling, no lesion, no nothing,'' he said.
``I'll treat it with massages and take it day-to-day.''
	   Cruz, 29, plays for AC Milan in Italy's first division. After a
long recuperation from a leg injury, he was left off Brazil's World
Cup squad but later summoned to replace the injured Marcio Santos.
	   A leg injury also was the reason that star striker Romario was
cut from the team last week.
	   Brazil opens the Cup on Wednesday against Scotland.

	   JARJOU, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas took turns Sunday to
leave the front lines in southern Lebanon and vote in municipal
elections that is likely to endorse their fight against Israeli
occupation.
	   Candidates backed by the pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah group are
contesting most of the 1,589 posts in southern Lebanon, a
predominantly Shiite region.
	   Hezbollah fighters also participated in the elections, leaving
their weapons at the front line to walk unarmed to the polling
booths. Guerrilla leaders rotated the fighters to make sure that
the front line was not unmanned at any time, said Haj Adnan Naameh,
a Hezbollah official, in nearby Jubaa, home to 4,000 people.
	   ``The fighter has a primary right to vote,'' he said.
	   The front lines were generally quiet Sunday and voting was
peaceful as troops in armored vehicles patrolled the villages and
guarded polling stations.
	   But the electoral battle was heated between Hezbollah and the
pro-Syrian mainstream Amal movement, also a Shiite group. The
victorious group will be seen as the voice of the nation's Shiites
who number 1.2 million among Lebanon's 3.2 million people.
	   Besides the Shiite fight, the elections _ the first municipal
polls in 35 years _ also are seen as proof that Lebanon's
Christians and Muslims are willing to join hands in building
democracy after the devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   Voting was also held Sunday in Beirut, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northwest of Jarjou. The vote was the third segment of the
four-stage elections organized over four consecutive Sundays.
	   ``I voted for Hezbollah's candidates because they are defending
our land and offering public services with or without municipal
elections,'' said Umm Mohammed, a veiled mother of two children.
	   The roads from Jarjou and other villages in Iqlim al-Tuffah
province were festooned with the Hezbollah's banners and flags as
well as portraits of Iran's late revolutionary leader, Ayatollah
Khomeini.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah is a Hezbollah mountain stronghold that faces
the part of South Lebanon that Israel occupies with the help of a
Lebanese militia. Hezbollah has led the fight to oust the Israelis.
	   ``Today's voting is part of the resistance against Israeli
occupation,'' said Fawzi Darwish, a 34-year-old businessman in
Jarjou, which is only 400 meters (yards) from Israeli outposts at
Sojod. Darwish said he voted for pro-Hezbollah candidates.
	   No voting was held in the Israeli-occupied area.
	   Zeinab Khafaja, who lost her guerrilla brother to a battle
against the Israelis, said it was her holy duty to vote for
Hezbollah.
	   ``It's a vote between the good and evil,'' said the 35-year-old
mother of four.

Schumacher wins chaotic Canadian Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Michael Schumacher overcame a penalty for
veering wildly out of the pit lane, then zoomed away from his final
pit stop to win a chaotic Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday.
	   In a stunning knockout of the powerful McLaren drivers,
polesitter David Coulthard and Formula One points leader Mika
Hakkinen left early with mechanical problems. Canadian Jacques
Villeneuve was knocked out after briefly taking the lead, returning
for the final few laps to finish last among those left running.
Only 10 of 22 cars completed the race.
	   The victory on a cold, overcast day sent Schumacher, the
two-time series champion, ahead of Coulthard for second place in
the point standings with 34. He trails Hakkinen by 12 points with
10 races remaining.
	   Schumacher was given a stop-and-go penalty on lap 33 for
sideswiping Villeneuve's Williams teammate, Heinz-Harald Frentzen,
on his way out of the pit lane.
	   He drove brilliantly to make up ground, passing rival Damon Hill
for second with a fantastic move, then taking the lead from
Giancarlo Fisichella when the Italian made a pit stop on lap 44.
	   After a 7.2-second pit stop, Schumacher emerged from the pit
lane just in front of Fisichella, slamming the gas and holding his
ground in the same spot where he collided with Frentzen earlier.
	   No one could catch Schumacher's Ferrari on the 12-turn,
2.75-mile (4.43-kilometer) road course thereafter. With the
McLarens and most of the other contenders watching on television,
Schumacher polished off his second victory of the season and 30th
of his career.
	   His average speed was 113.31 mph (182.35 kph).
	   Schumacher is the only driver other than Hakkinen and Coulthard
to win this season.
	   Fisichella was second in his Benetton. Schumacher's teammate,
Eddie Irvine, got his fourth third-place finish of the year in a
Ferrari.
	   If Formula One was looking for a little excitement, the series
found it in treacherous Senna Curve on the first lap.
	   Hakkinen was knocked out with mechanical problems on the restart
that followed a wild, first-turn skirmish. Several cars got
together, and Alexander Wurz's Benetton barrel-rolled three times
before landing off the course on its tires.
	   The Saubers of Jean Alesi and Johnny Herbert were involved,
along with Jarno Trulli. Ralf Schumacher's Jordan Honda stalled on
the starting grid.
	   There was more trouble on the restart, when Hakkinen slowed and
got shuffled to the back. Ralf Schumacher spun in front of several
cars going into the first turn, and Alesi, Trulli and Toranosuke
Takagi got tangled up and knocked out.
	   Coulthard slowed on lap 18, giving Michael Schumacher the lead,
and separate crashes involving Herbert and Mika Salo brought out
the caution. Schumacher made a pit stop while Coulthard headed for
the garage.
	   As he drove out of the pits, Schumacher sideswiped Frentzen near
the pit exit, sending him off the track and his Williams team into
a frenzy. Villeneuve passed Fisichella for the lead as they charged
back to the first turn on the restart, but locked his brakes and
ended up driving across the grass and off the track.
	   Villeneuve, the defending series champion, is still without a
podium finish this season and hasn't won in nine races.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With their crippling strike about to enter its
second week, Air France pilots offered Sunday to work for free to
fly World Cup ticket holders to the soccer championships.
	   The unexpected gesture came as the conflict appeared to harden
Sunday night, with Air France management expressing exasperation
with the pilots who walked off the job a week ago.
	   No new talks were in sight, and the conflict appeared certain to
enter its second week Monday. Air France said the strike had
already cost one billion francs (dlrs 166 million).
	   France's flagship carrier has said it will take three days for
service to return to normal once the strike ends, meaning the
walkout was sure to disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the main SNPL pilots' union,
proposed that Air France organize special flights for World Cup
ticket holders and said the pilots would fly them for free so the
fans would not miss the soccer championship.
	   Air France reacted quickly and said it would study the measure.
	   Despite the goodwill gesture, the situation was stalemated
Sunday night.
	   Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the director general of Air France, said
the airline had ``exhausted its capacity of understanding with
regard to the pilots.''
	   Meanwhile, the company met Sunday with ground personnel and
flight attendants, who have expressed concern they have been left
out of salary talks between Air France and the pilots.
	   One of the unions representing ground personnel, the
Communist-backed General Labor Confederation (CGT), warned Friday
of a ``spread of the conflict'' unless Air France included other
airline workers in the talks.
	   Both the pilots and Air France were under pressure to end the
strike from the government, which is worried about France's image.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday the government was
prepared to intervene but no concrete proposals emerged.
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   Public support for the pilots appeared lukewarm.
	   A poll in Sunday's edition of Le Journal du Dimanche showed just
38 percent of those surveyed were sympathetic to the strike. The
poll was carried out Friday by the CSA polling agency among 1,004
people. No margin of error was given.
	   The strike has inconvenienced thousands, including foreigners
fleeing the violence in Eritrea.
	   Air France is the official World Cup carrier and is committed to
transporting the teams from one venue to another.
	   The pilots are protesting pay cuts planned by Air France in
order to save 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) a year the
company says is needed to modernize the company. The strike already
has cost double that amount.
	   Obstacles to an agreement are proposed salary reductions and a
plan to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay cut, as well as a
two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots earn less.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Monday.
	   Trains were expected to run on schedule Monday after strikes
disrupted service this weekend. Trains conductors have threatened a
walkout Wednesday.
	   Taxi drivers in Paris planned demonstrations Monday to protest
the killing of a taxi driver last week.

Red Wings wary of Washington in finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ If experience is worth anything, the Detroit Red
Wings probably have an edge over the Washington Capitals in the
Stanley Cup finals.
	   ``We know how important this is,'' forward Darren McCarty said
after practice Sunday. ``We may never get back here again. And we
know what we'd be missing.''
	   The Red Wings, bidding to become the first team to repeat as Cup
champions since 1992, are in the finals for the third time in four
years. And coach Scotty Bowman is aiming for his eighth Cup, which
would tie him with his mentor, Toe Blake.
	   The Capitals, meanwhile, are in the Cup finals for the first
time in their 24-year history.
	   The best-of-7 series begins with games Tuesday and Thursday
nights at Joe Louis Arena. Games 3 and 4 are scheduled for Saturday
and June 16 in Washington.
	   ``Probably the hunger is still there,'' forward Kris Draper
said. ``We're not excited. We just want to go back there and win it
again.''
	   A popular theory has it that repeating a championship is perhaps
the most difficult feat in all of sports. The quest has been
especially difficult for Detroit.
	   Just six days after sweeping the Philadelphia Flyers for the
team's first Cup triumph in 42 years, defenseman Vladimir
Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, suffered
career-ending injuries in a limousine accident. Later in the
summer, goalie Mike Vernon was traded.
	   ``We had a lot of distractions during the year,'' Draper said.
``But everyone was focused on one thing: winning and getting back
to the Stanley Cup finals.''
	   Detroit went 44-23-15 for 103 points through the regular season,
finishing third overall in the league. With Chris Osgood running
hot and cold in goal, the Red Wings needed six games to eliminate
Phoenix, St. Louis and Dallas in each of the first three rounds.
	   ``I think there's a lot of people who counted us out early
because of the circumstances of losing a couple of players,''
defenseman Bob Rouse said. ``That just made the other guys that
much more hungry to prove them wrong.''
	   Still, nothing really matters now except Washington. The
Capitals might be new to the finals, but they have the NHL's
hottest playoff goalie in Olaf Kolzig.
	   Kolzig leads all goalies in the postseason with a 1.69
goals-against average, four shutouts and a 12-5 record.
	   ``Kolzig has been hot all year,'' Detroit coach Scotty Bowman
said. ``He covers a lot of net and he's consistent. And he's got to
have a lot of confidence after beating a guy like (Buffalo goalie
Dominik) Hasek.''
	   Detroit was 2-0 against the Capitals this season. The Red Wings
defeated Washington 2-0 at Joe Louis on Jan. 11 with Osgood in
goal. Backup Kevin Hodson was in goal for the Red Wings' 4-2 win at
Washington on Feb. 1.
	   But that was before Brian Bellows was signed as a free agent and
Esa Tikkanen was acquired from Florida in March. Washington, which
had not won a playoff series in four years, sailed into the Cup
finals with those two in the lineup.

U.N. relief flights drop food in southern Sudan from northern base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ United Nations relief flights have begun
operating from the government-controlled city of el-Obeid for the
first time, dropping aid to thousands in the country's war-torn
south, the U.N. office in Khartoum said Sunday.
	   Operations began Saturday when flights dropped 16 tons of relief
to 26,000 people in the Bahr al-Ghazal province, about 800
kilometers (500 miles) south of Khartoum, a U.N. statement released
in Khartoum said.
	   Before Saturday, relief operations came from Lokichokkio, in
nearby Kenya, prompting complaints by Sudan's government that
relief flights were being used to transport aid to rebels.
	   Moving relief operations to a government-held town means the
central government in Sudan can monitor the relief operations.
	   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy and
development in the predominantly Christian, African and animist
south, which has traditionally been dominated by the Muslim and
Arabized north.
	   An estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines.
	   The United Nations says about 500,000 people in southern Sudan
are in desperate need of emergency relief.
	   The U.N. statement said the World Food Program purchased 4,300
tons of grains in northern Sudan and most has been transported to
el-Obeid in preparation for further drops.
	   It said the WFP moved some employees and a crane to el-Obeid and
set up a warehouse and a communications system there.
	   The move would ``decrease the expense'' of emergency deliveries
because of el-Obeid's proximity to Bahr al-Ghazal, the statement
said.
	   El-Obeid lies about 670 kilometers (415 miles) north of Wau, the
capital of Bahr al-Ghazal while Lokichokkio lies about 920
kilometers (570 miles) south.
	   Relief operations from Kenya, which included between eight to 10
flights per day, used up 130,000 liters (33,800 gallons) of fuel.
The United Nations did not say how much will be used from el-Obeid.
	   Also Sunday, Sudanese army spokesman Gen. Abdel-Rahman Khatim
denied rebel troops have taken control of the garrison town of Ulu
in southern Sudan, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of
Khartoum.
	   ``Military operations are still continuing in the area'' but
government forces are in ``full control,'' Khatim told reporters.
	   The leading southern rebel group, the Sudan Peoples' Liberation
Army, had claimed Tuesday that it had taken control of the town.

Pilots' group names 150 airports with safety problems

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ International airline pilots have listed 150
airports with major safety problems and singled out 15 _ including
San Francisco, Nice and Hong Kong, _ which they believe are
``critically deficient,'' the Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper said it had been leaked a copy of a report
compiled at a meeting of the International Federation of Air Line
Pilots' Associations, or Ifalpa, in Montreal, Canada in April.
	   Problems cited in the survey included natural hazards and
shortages of air traffic controllers.
	   ``If airports and airspaces are listed, it means they have
serious deficiencies, not that they are unsafe,'' the Sunday Times
quoted Ifalpa executive director Cathy Bill as saying. ``There are
potential dangers.''
	   The 12 other airports in the critically deficient category were:
Wellington in New Zealand; Oslo's Fornebu Airport; Suva in Fiji;
Buenos Aires in Argentina; Leticia, Rio Negro and San Andres in
Colombia; Maiquetia in Venezuela; Nauru, a central Pacific island;
Lagos and Port Harcourt in Nigeria; and Kabul in Afghanistan.
	   The Sunday Times said air crews have complained about landing at
airports in popular tourist destinations, such as Greece, ``to find
inadequate runway lighting and no air-traffic controllers on the
ground.''
	   At Argentina's Mendoza Airport, it said, a pilot reported a
horse on the runway. Another aborted a takeoff from Buenos Aires
after seeing children playing in his path.
	   At San Francisco, the Sunday Times said, planes land in pairs on
parallel runways with pilots often relying largely on visual
contact. ``It's been known for pilots to start aiming at the wrong
runway and drift across in front of the other plane,'' it quoted an
unidentified pilot as saying.
	   Nice regularly requests planes to make a circular final approach
using a navigation system that can be inaccurate by hundreds of
feet (meters), the Sunday Times said. Although it has had few
serious accidents, Hong Kong is potentially dangerous because of
the proximity of the runway and parallel taxiway, which can be
hazardous in crosswinds.
	   ``The approach is more complicated than it used to be and the
pilots hated it at first, but we have tried to get their support,''
Nice Airport's director Danial Galibert was quoted as saying. ``We
only use a visual approach in good conditions.''
	   In Venezuela, Rafael da Lima, a pilot with 25 years' experience
told The Associated Press that Maiquetia Airport was ``very
dangerous.'' He complained of late orders from air traffic
controllers on when to bank away from a mountain before landing,
and inadequate radar.
	   A British Airways spokesman said the airline was satisfied with
safety standards at the airports it uses, including San Francisco
and Hong Kong.
	   The Montreal meeting blacklisted Amsterdam's Schipol Airport
after pilot complaints of being forced to land in strong crosswinds
because noise restrictions prohibit safer alternatives.
	   Airspace listed as potentially dangerous includes thousands of
square miles (kilometers) in Africa, China and South America _ and
the North Sea, because of the vast amount of civil and military
traffic working for the oil industry below 10,000 feet (3,000
meters).

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritreans braced Sunday for more
bombardments from Ethiopian warplanes after a deadline passed for
hundreds of foreigners to flee to safety.
	   Meanwhile, hectic diplomatic efforts were underway to prevent
the border conflict from exploding into a full-scale war.
	   Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and listened for
the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23 fighters that had
bombed Asmara's airport Friday and Saturday. None came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the disputed border.
	   Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border town of Zala
Anbessa, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Asmara, defeating
in a daylong battle Eritrean forces which captured the town last
week.
	   Eritrean government spokesman Isaac Yared said the Eritrean
troops retreated voluntarily to their side of the border. ``They
decided it was time to go,'' he said.
	   President Isaias Afwerki is hopeful that a summit of heads of
state of the Organization of African Unity on Monday will yield new
ideas for a negotiated settlement, his spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel
said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left an OAU foreign
ministers meeting Saturday in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso, apparently
for Ethiopia and Eritrea. She returned to the United States on
Sunday.
	   Rice was promoting a peace plan for the two feuding Horn of
Africa countries that was drafted by the United States and Rwanda.
	   The proposal calls, 10th graf pvs.

Report: Eritrea, Ethiopia willing to accept cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea are
willing to implement a Libyan plan for a cease-fire and deploy an
African peacekeeping force on their border, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Sunday.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed in either
Ethiopia or Eritrea, whose border tensions have erupted into air
bombing raids, raising the specter of a full-fledged war.
	   MENA said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi received messages of
peace from the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea in which they
``expressed their willingness'' to accept the Libyan plan.
	   The messages were carried by an official of an African group who
met with the leaders of the two countries this week, MENA said.
	   The African organization is called the Sahel and Saharan
Countries, or the ``coastal and desert countries,'' which groups
Libya, Sudan, Chad, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Gadhafi currently
holds the chair.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritreans braced Sunday for more
bombardments from Ethiopian warplanes after a deadline passed for

	   Meanwhile, hectic diplomatic efforts were under way to prevent
the border conflict from exploding into a full-scale war.
	   Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and listened for
the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23 fighters that had
bombed Asmara's airport Friday and Saturday. None came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the disputed border.
	   Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border town of Zala
Anbessa, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Asmara, defeating
in a daylong battle Eritrean forces which captured the town last
week.
	   Eritrean government spokesman Isaac Yared said the Eritrean
troops retreated voluntarily to their side of the border. ``They
decided it was time to go,'' he said.
	   President Isaias Afwerki is hopeful that a summit of heads of
state of the Organization of African Unity on Monday will yield new
ideas for a negotiated settlement, his spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel
said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left an OAU foreign
ministers meeting Saturday in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso, apparently
for Ethiopia and Eritrea. She returned to the United States on
Sunday.
	   Rice was promoting a peace plan for the two feuding Horn of
Africa countries that was drafted by the United States and Rwanda.
	   The proposal calls on Eritrea to return to positions held prior
to May 6, when current hostilities reportedly broke out _ in other
words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its territory.
	   Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
however, claims it is rightfully occupying territory defined by
boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 two years
after Eritrean rebels helped the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime.
	   Gebremeskel said Eritrea broadly agreed with Rice's four-point
peace plan, but he said any accord must include more specifics,
including how and when the border would be demarcated and by whom.
	   ``We need to work out the details to achieve a lasting
solution,'' he said. ``This dispute has gone on for too long
already.''
	   Several African leaders called Afwerki over the weekend to
encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Ethiopia's army outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by
about three to one. Eritrea's tiny air force is no match for
Ethiopia's.
	   Mokonnen, a 27-year-old telephone operator who uses just one
name, said he was afraid, though optimistic that a peace pact would
be forged between the one-time allies.
	   ``We are still free. We are still brothers, only a few people
are doing this thing. Our government wants peace, and we are
struggling to solve it peacefully,'' he said.
	   Ethiopian jets bombed a military-civilian airport on the
outskirts of Asmara on Friday and Saturday, forcing embassies to
step up their evacuation plans.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried more than a
thousand foreigners out of harm's way late Saturday and early
Sunday after Ethiopia agreed to temporarily halt bombing.
	   But the two countries dispute more than a half-dozen areas along
their common border.
	   Also Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
leaders of both countries were willing to implement a Libyan plan
for a cease-fire and deploy an African peacekeeping force on their
border,
	   The report could not be independently confirmed in either
Ethiopia or Eritrea.
	   MENA said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi received messages of
peace from the leaders who ``expressed their willingness'' to
accept the Libyan plan.

Mexican army clashes with rebels; at least 11 dead

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Rebels opened fire Sunday on an army patrol
in western Mexico. Eleven people were killed in a subsequent
shootout, the military said.
	   Five people were wounded, and 21 others were arrested, the
military said. No soldiers were injured.
	   The soldiers were on an anti-drug patrol early Sunday in El
Charco, 260 kilometers (160 miles) south of Mexico City, where they
spotted three men with large weapons, the army said in a statement
from the nearby resort of Acapulco.
	   When the soldiers ordered the men to surrender, they opened fire
and ran into the schoolhouse, where more rebels shot at the
soldiers, the military said.
	   The military said the men's clothing, weapons and way of
operating indicated they were members of the Popular Revolutionary
Army, or EPR, a guerrilla group that sprung up near El Charco two
years ago. The military seized 14 AK-47s and a 9 mm pistol.
	   Local authorities said the military sealed off the entire area.
	   Santiago Abad Margarita, an aide to the mayor in the municipal
seat of Ayutla, said he traveled to El Charco with the mayor Sunday
morning, but the soldiers wouldn't let them enter the town.
	   ``We talked with a general from the Acapulco military zone, but
he told us it was in their hands, and we as municipal authorities
didn't have anything to do with it,'' he said. ``We have no idea
how the people of the town are doing.''
	   It was not immediately clear how many people live in El Charco.
	   The EPR appeared in June 1996, on the first anniversary of a
massacre of 17 peasants by police in the nearby town of Aguas
Blancas, which like El Charco, is in Guerrero state.
	   The rebel group says it is fighting for political, economic and
social justice for Mexico's poor. The government has said it
considers the EPR rebels common criminals and claims they lack
support among civilians.
	   EPR attacks in the southern Pacific coast states of Guerrero and
Oaxaca in 1996 killed four civilians and seven guerrillas.
	   For a time, the rebels held a series of clandestine news
conferences, several featuring a masked rebel leader who called
himself Comandante Francisco. But the group had launched no attacks
in about a year.
	   Army reports published in November by the weekly news magazine
Proceso said members of the EPR operated in 17 of Mexico's 31
states and killed 26 soldiers and police in 1996.
	   A number of other scattered confrontations between the EPR and
army patrols in those states killed at least six soldiers and five
rebels in early 1997.
	   Though it has ruled out talks with the EPR, the government is
trying to restart peace negotiations with a separate rebel group,
the Zapatista National Liberation Army. The Zapatistas staged a
brief armed uprising in the southern state of Chiapas in early
1994.

Air France pilots offer to work for free to fly World Cup fans

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With their crippling strike about to enter its
second week, Air France pilots offered Sunday to work for free to
fly foreign World Cup ticket holders to the soccer championships.
	   The unexpected gesture came as the conflict appeared to harden
Sunday night, with Air France management expressing exasperation
with the pilots who walked off the job a week ago.
	   No new talks were in sight, and the conflict appeared certain to
enter its second week Monday. Air France said the strike had
already cost one billion francs (dlrs 166 million).
	   France's flagship carrier has said it will take three days for
service to return to normal once the strike ends, meaning the
walkout was sure to disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the main SNPL pilots' union,
proposed that Air France organize special flights for foreign World
Cup ticket holders and said the pilots would work without pay so
the fans would not miss the soccer championship.
	   Air France reacted quickly and said it would study the measure.
	   Despite the goodwill gesture, the situation was stalemated
Sunday night.
	   Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the director general of Air France, said
the airline had ``exhausted its capacity of understanding with
regard to the pilots.''
	   Meanwhile, the company met Sunday with ground personnel and
flight attendants, worried that they have been left out of salary
talks between Air France and the pilots.
	   One of the unions representing ground personnel, the
Communist-backed General Labor Confederation (CGT), warned Friday
of a ``spread of the conflict'' unless Air France included other
airline workers in the talks.
	   Both the pilots and Air France were under pressure to end the
strike from the government, which is embarrassed by the conflict.
	   Rene Monory, the president of the French Senate, said Sunday the
pilots were giving the country a ``lamentable image.''
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday the government was
prepared to intervene but no concrete proposals emerged.
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   Public support for the pilots appeared lukewarm.
	   A poll in Sunday's edition of Le Journal du Dimanche showed just
38 percent of those surveyed were sympathetic to the strike. The
poll was carried out Friday by the CSA polling agency among 1,004
people. No margin of error was given.
	   The strike has inconvenienced thousands, including foreigners
fleeing fighting in Eritrea.
	   The pilots are protesting pay cuts planned by Air France in
order to save 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million) a year the
company says is needed to modernize the company.
	   Obstacles to an agreement are proposed salary reductions and a
plan to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay cut, as well as a
two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots earn less.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Monday.
	   Trains were expected to run on schedule Monday after strikes
disrupted service this weekend. Trains conductors have threatened a
walkout Wednesday.
	   Taxi drivers in Paris planned demonstrations Monday to protest
the recent killing of a taxi driver.

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Backup quarterback Wally Richardson
passed for two touchdowns and 165 yards to lead the England
Monarchs over the Barcelona Dragons 28-20 Sunday, in the
season-ending NFL Europe game for both teams.
	   England held a one-point margin going into the fourth quarter,
when Don Silvestri kicked a 51-yard field goal and Rob Hart added
another of 31 yards to seal their victory. The Monarchs finished
the season 3-7, while the Dragons ended 4-6.
	   England led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter, with starter
George LaRocca connecting on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Reggie
Jones and Richardson, who took over when LaRocca was injured,
completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to Alan Allen.
	   Barcelona roared back in the second quarter. Jim Ritchey threw
touchdown passes of 22 and 10 yards each to Marco Martos, and Jesus
Angoy kicked a field goal to give the Dragons a 17-14 halftime
lead.
	   Richardson put England on top for good with a 24-yard touchdown
pass to Shawn Turner with 8:17 in the third quarter.
	   After Angoy trimmed the lead to 21-20 on a 41-yard field goal
with 45 seconds to go in the quarter, Silvestri and Hart replied
with a pair of their own _ with 3:16 and 1:45 left respectively in
the fourth quarter. Silvestri's field goal was worth four points
because it was longer than 50 yards.
	   Richardson completed 12 of 24 passes, while Ritchey connected on
16 of 36 passes for 166 yds. Ritchey was sacked six times.

Pilots' group names 150 airports with safety problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Venezuela airport officials in grafs 12-14 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ International airline pilots have listed 150
airports with major safety problems and singled out 15 _ including
San Francisco, Nice and Hong Kong, _ which they believe are
``critically deficient,'' the Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper said it had been leaked a copy of a report
compiled at a meeting of the International Federation of Air Line
Pilots' Associations, or Ifalpa, in Montreal, Canada in April.
	   Problems cited in the survey included natural hazards and
shortages of air traffic controllers.
	   ``If airports and airspaces are listed, it means they have
serious deficiencies, not that they are unsafe,'' the Sunday Times
quoted Ifalpa executive director Cathy Bill as saying. ``There are
potential dangers.''
	   The 12 other airports in the critically deficient category were:
Wellington in New Zealand; Oslo's Fornebu Airport; Suva in Fiji;
Buenos Aires in Argentina; Leticia, Rio Negro and San Andres in
Colombia; Maiquetia in Venezuela; Nauru, a central Pacific island;
Lagos and Port Harcourt in Nigeria; and Kabul in Afghanistan.
	   The Sunday Times said air crews have complained about landing at
airports in popular tourist destinations, such as Greece, ``to find
inadequate runway lighting and no air-traffic controllers on the
ground.''
	   At Argentina's Mendoza Airport, it said, a pilot reported a
horse on the runway. Another aborted a takeoff from Buenos Aires
after seeing children playing in his path.
	   At San Francisco, the Sunday Times said, planes land in pairs on
parallel runways with pilots often relying largely on visual
contact. ``It's been known for pilots to start aiming at the wrong
runway and drift across in front of the other plane,'' it quoted an
unidentified pilot as saying.
	   Nice regularly requests planes to make a circular final approach
using a navigation system that can be inaccurate by hundreds of
feet (meters), the Sunday Times said. Although it has had few
serious accidents, Hong Kong is potentially dangerous because of
the proximity of the runway and parallel taxiway, which can be
hazardous in crosswinds.
	   ``The approach is more complicated than it used to be and the
pilots hated it at first, but we have tried to get their support,''
Nice Airport's director Danial Galibert was quoted as saying. ``We
only use a visual approach in good conditions.''
	   In Venezuela, Rafael da Lima, a pilot with 25 years' experience
told The Associated Press that Maiquetia Airport was ``very
dangerous.''
	   But Gen. Concepcion Alberto Fuentes, director of Maiquetia
airport, denounced the report. He noted that U.S. officials spent a
month checking conditions at the airport ahead of a visit to
Venezuela last Ocotber by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   ``If there was any problem with security, the presidiential
airplane would not have landed,'' he said.
	   The airport's director of operations, Francisco Ramirez, said
there has not been a major accident there for at least a decade.
	   A British Airways spokesman said the airline was satisfied with
safety standards at the airports it uses, including San Francisco
and Hong Kong.
	   The Montreal meeting blacklisted Amsterdam's Schipol Airport
after pilot complaints of being forced to land in strong crosswinds
because noise restrictions prohibit safer alternatives.
	   Airspace listed as potentially dangerous includes thousands of
square miles (kilometers) in Africa, China and South America _ and
the North Sea, because of the vast amount of civil and military
traffic working for the oil industry below 10,000 feet (3,000
meters).

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritreans braced Sunday for more
bombardments from Ethiopian warplanes after a deadline passed for
hundreds of foreigners to flee to safety.
	   Meanwhile, hectic diplomatic efforts were under way to prevent
the border conflict from exploding into a full-scale war.
	   Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and listened for
the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23 fighters that had
bombed Asmara's airport Friday and Saturday. None came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the disputed border.
	   Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border town of Zala
Anbessa, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Asmara, defeating
in a daylong battle Eritrean forces which captured the town last
week.
	   Eritrean government spokesman Isaac Yared said the Eritrean
troops retreated voluntarily to their side of the border. ``They
decided it was time to go,'' he said.
	   President Isaias Afwerki is hopeful that a summit of heads of
state of the Organization of African Unity on Monday will yield new
ideas for a negotiated settlement, his spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel
said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left an OAU foreign
ministers meeting Saturday in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso, apparently
for Ethiopia and Eritrea. She returned to the United States on
Sunday.
	   Rice was promoting a peace plan for the two feuding Horn of
Africa countries that was drafted by the United States and Rwanda.
	   The proposal calls on Eritrea to return to positions held prior
to May 6, when current hostilities reportedly broke out _ in other
words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its territory.
	   Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
however, claims it is rightfully occupying territory defined by
boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 two years
after Eritrean rebels helped the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year military regime.
	   Gebremeskel said Eritrea broadly agreed with Rice's four-point
peace plan, but he said any accord must include more specifics,
including how and when the border would be demarcated and by whom.
	   ``We need to work out the details to achieve a lasting
solution,'' he said. ``This dispute has gone on for too long
already.''
	   Several African leaders called Isaias over the weekend to
encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Ethiopia's army outnumbers, 16th graf pvs.

Jacobs spoils Morgan-Irwin duel for first PGA victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALPHARETTA, Georgia (AP) _ John Jacobs picked up his first U.S.
PGA victory on Sunday, shooting a 5-under-par 67 to beat the senior
tour's two most dominating players in the Nationwide Championship.
	   The cigar-smoking Jacobs, who had never won on either the senior
or regular tours, finished with a 10-under 206 total, edging Hale
Irwin by one stroke and finishing two shots ahead of Gil Morgan and
Leonard Thompson.
	   Irwin and Morgan have ruled the senior circuit this year, each
winning three events.
	   Irwin came to the Golf Club of Georgia as the top money winner
with dlrs 1,051,850, having finished in the top five in all eights
tournaments he's played, while Morgan had dlrs 853,818 in earnings
and seven top-10 finishes.
	   But Jacobs spoiled the expected Morgan-Irwin showdown, moving
into the lead for good with a birdie at No. 17 and using his power
off the tee to secure the victory at 18.
	   ``It's pretty special to beat Gil Morgan and Hale Irwin when
they're playing well,'' said Jacobs, who picked up the largest
check of his career, dlrs 202,500. ``But it bothers me when people
say they're dominating the tour. They're not that much better than
a lot of other guys out here.''
	   Morgan began the final round tied for the lead with Bob Eastwood
at eight under and remained on top with birdies at 10 and 12. But
he fell apart down the stretch, bogeying three of the last five
holes.
	   ``Pressure was one factor, and some unfamiliarity with the golf
course hurt, too,'' said Morgan, who lost any chance to force a
playoff when he hit his second shot at 18 into the water. ``I
didn't leave myself with some very good shots coming in.''
	   Irwin, who started the day four shots off the lead, got to 10
under with three straight birdies, including a 50-foot (15-meter)
putt at No. 12 that had playing partner Walter Morgan bowing in
admiration.
	   But Irwin, playing his first senior event in four weeks,
couldn't keep the momentum going. An errant tee shot at 15 wound up
a bogey when he missed a 12-foot (3-meter) putt, and he squandered
potential birdie chances at 16 and 18.
	   ``I had a long ways to go,'' he said. ``I was a little too deep
in the field to pass as many guys as I needed to.''
	   Jacobs was three shots behind Gil Morgan and Eastwood at the
start of the round, a margin he wiped out by overpowering the front
nine for five birdies. Sticking mostly with his irons, he made five
birdie putts of less than 10 feet (3 meters) and made the turn with
a 31.
	   Jacobs bogeyed 14 to drop back to nine under, then secured the
victory with a brilliant 6-iron at the 199-yard 17th. The ball
rolled less than 2 feet (half a meter) from the hole and he tapped
in for birdie.
	   ``That was the nicest shot I've made in years,'' he said. ``It
went right where I aimed it.''
	   At the 533-yard (487-meter) 18th, Jacobs had no qualms about
going for the green in two, and he actually put his second shot
over the green when a 4-iron carried some 235 yards 215 meters). He
chipped down a slope and two-putted for the clinching par.

Appleby holds on to win Kemper Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON SIRAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POTOMAC, Maryland (AP) _ Stuart Appleby said he was a good wind
player and proved it Sunday, staying upright for a 72 to win the
Kemper Open by one stroke over Scott Hoch on a day when all other
challengers were blown off the leaderboard.
	   Appleby finished at 10-under-par 274 on a blustery TPC at
Avenel, with Hoch at 275 and five players at 278, including Fred
Funk, who led after each of the first three rounds.
	   ``It was so windy and firm and fast out there today,'' Appleby
said. ``I knew the back nine was going to be tough and that there
would be a lot of wedges to 30 or 40 feet (nine or 12 meters) and
two putts for par. I just stayed patient.''
	   The 27-year-old Australian stepped to the 17th tee at 10-under
with Hoch in the clubhouse at 9-under after he made a 4-foot
(1.22-meter) birdie putt on the final hole for a 70.
	   With the wind whipping at his pants, Appleby played a bold shot
on the water-guarded 195-yard par-3 to within 5 feet (1.52 meters)
but missed the putt that would have all but wrapped up the
tournament.
	   Playing the final hole knowing he needed par for his second PGA
Tour victory, Appleby rose to the occasion as he had all day,
despite a light rain that started as he walked off the tee.
	   A solid long iron from 214 yards (195.61 meters) put Appleby
safely on the green, and all he needed to do was two-putt from 15
feet to win.
	   ``That iron on the last hole was the day,'' he said.
	   No one's fortune was tossed about more mightily than Funk, who
shot a 77 to finish at 278 along with Mark O'Meara, Brad Fabel,
Clark Dennis and Tommy Tolles.
	   Funk, a local favorite who grew up in Maryland, lost all hope
early when made bogeys on the first and third holes and then had a
triple bogey on No. 4, driving into the water.
	   Appleby, meanwhile, played steady golf in very difficult
conditions, playing deft knockdown shots under the wind as he
balanced two birdies and two bogeys on the front nine and had two
bogeys and a birdie on the back side.
	   Of those who started the final round within four strokes of the
lead, Chris DiMarco shot a 79, Tolles had a 74 and Dennis shot a
73, as did Fabel.
	   Only O'Meara, who closed with a 69, and Hoch with a 70 broke par
among the contenders.
	   Tolles squandered his chance when he wisely laid up on the par-5
sixth hole, but then hit his third shot into the water and made a
double bogey. DiMarco stayed into the hunt until he made a 5 on the
par-3 ninth hole, missing the green and then three-putting.
	   And Fabel got into contention with an eagle of the par-5 13th
hole, but made three bogeys in the last five holes.
	   Appleby won more than dlrs 1 million on the U.S. PGA Tour last
year and is rapidly emerging along with Lee Westwood and Jim Furyk
in that group of great young under-30 players just a notch below
Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Justin Leonard, Phil Mickelson and David
Duval.

	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Backup quarterback Wally Richardson
passed for two touchdowns and 165 yards to lead the England
Monarchs over the Barcelona Dragons 28-20 Sunday, in the
season-ending NFL Europe game for both teams.
	   England held a one-point margin going into the fourth quarter,
when Don Silvestri kicked a 51-yard field goal and Rob Hart added
another of 31 yards to seal their victory before a crowd of 10,800.
The Monarchs finished the season 3-7, while the Dragons ended 4-6.
	   England led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter, with starter
George LaRocca connecting on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Reggie
Jones and Richardson, who took over when LaRocca was injured,
completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to Alan Allen.
	   Barcelona roared back in the second quarter. Jim Ritchey threw
touchdown passes of 22 and 10 yards each to Marco Martos, and Jesus
Angoy kicked a field goal to give the Dragons a 17-14 halftime
lead.
	   Richardson put England on top for good with a 24-yard touchdown
pass to Shawn Turner with 8:17 in the third quarter.
	   After Angoy trimmed the lead to 21-20 on a 41-yard field goal,
Silvestri and Hart replied with a pair of their own _ with 3:16 and
1:45 left respectively in the fourth quarter. Silvestri's field
goal was worth four points because it was longer than 50 yards.
	   Richardson completed 12 of 24 passes, while Ritchey connected on
16 of 36 passes for 166 yds. Ritchey was sacked six times.

Dominican president to present drug-control plan to United Nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican President
Leonel Fernandez left Sunday for a United Nations meeting, where he
will present a regional drug-control proposal for the western
Caribbean.
	   He will present the plan Monday at a meeting of the
organization's General Assembly in New York City.
	   Drug experts say cocaine smuggling through the Dominican
Republic and adjacent Haiti has increased recently. U.S. officials
have estimated that 25 percent of the cocaine reaching the United
States comes by way of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
	   A United Nations report released Friday claimed money laundering
in the country has tripled in the last three years, with most of
the money finding its way into real estate, car sales and shipping
deals.
	   After his presentation, Fernandez will meet with U.S.-based
members of his Dominican Liberation Party and with Dominican
community leaders in New York City.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritreans braced for more bombing Sunday
by Ethiopian warplanes after a deadline passed for hundreds of
foreigners to flee to safety. Hectic diplomatic efforts were under
way to prevent the border conflict from exploding into a full-scale
war between the two East African nations. Eritreans scanned
cloudless blue skies Sunday and listened for the high-pitched
whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23 fighters that bombed their capital's
airport Friday and Saturday. But none came. Skirmishes were
reported, however, along the two countries' disputed border.
Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border town of Zala
Anbessa, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of Asmara, after a
daylong battle with Eritrean forces who captured the town last
week. (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   PARIS (AP) _ With their crippling strike about to enter its
second week, Air France pilots offered Sunday to work for free to
fly foreign World Cup ticket holders to the soccer championships.
The unexpected gesture came as the conflict appeared to harden
Sunday night, with Air France management expressing exasperation
with the pilots who walked off the job a week ago. No new talks
were in sight, and the conflict appeared certain to enter its
second week Monday. Air France said the strike had already cost one
billion francs (dlrs 166 million). France's flagship carrier has
said it will take three days for service to return to normal once
the strike ends, meaning the walkout was sure to disrupt the World
Cup, which begins Wednesday. (AIR FRANCE-STRIKE)
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Afraid of surrendering Swiss leadership
in biotechnology, voters Sunday decisively rejected a proposal to
outlaw the production and patenting of genetically modified plants
and animals. Some 67 percent of the voters struck down the
initiative, which government and business leaders argued would
force a ``draconian'' end to research in Switzerland and send
highly paid jobs to other countries. The Swiss-based pharmaceutical
giants Roche and Novartis, both leaders in biotechnology
innovation, praised the vote. ``The way is now open for
Switzerland's industry and universities to carry on into the future
with their biomedical and pharmaceutical research,'' Roche said in
a statement. ``The people obviously listened to our arguments,''
added Novartis research chief Paul Herrling. (SWITZERLAND-GENE
VOTE)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With demand for illegal drugs rising,
leaders of the world's major drug-producing and drug-consuming
nations open a three-day conference Monday to discuss how to fight
the scourge. U.S. President Bill Clinton, who delivers the opening
address, has pledged to cut drug use by half in the United States _
the world's leading drug consumer _ by 2007. Latin American leaders
say their efforts to curtail drug production and trafficking will
fail unless Americans curb their appetite for drugs. The presidents
of Mexico, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia are expected to deliver
that message at the conference. The goal of the U.N. General
Assembly's ``special session on drugs'' is to endorse target dates
for governments to enact legislation on issues such as money
laundering, judicial cooperation, reducing demand for drugs and
stamping out cultivation of illicit crops. (UN-DRUG SUMMIT)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's former President Suharto
turns 77 on Monday, but there will be no celebration for the man
who last month surrendered his 32-year iron grip on the world's
fourth most populous nation. Forced to quit after mobs went on a
rampage and angry protesters demanded he be tried for corruption,
Suharto has said nothing publicly since his May 21 resignation. In
contrast, his successor, new President B.J. Habibie, can't seem to
get enough of the limelight and is basking in the glory of rolling
back many of Suharto's draconian ways. Suharto remains holed up at
his private home in Jakarta, guarded by the powerful military from
growing calls for retribution against him and his super-rich
family. (INDONESIA-SUHARTO'S BIRTHDAY)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Tori Amos, Ivana Trump, fast ferry and Banff
television festival. Some items may also have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tori Amos knows she's not for everybody.
	   ``I'm an acquired taste _ I'm anchovies,'' the 34-year-old
singer says in the June 25 Rolling Stone magazine. ``And not
everybody wants those hairy little things. If I was potato chips, I
could go a lot more places, but I'm not.''
	   The daughter of a Methodist minister, Amos was a precocious
talent who at age 5 became the youngest-ever student at Baltimore's
prestigious Peabody Conservatory. She also was a precocious rebel.
At 11, Peabody threw her out for musical insubordination.
	   As a young woman in Los Angeles trying to make it in music or as
an actress, she did some commercials before forming the doomed band
Y Kant Tori Read, whose first album tanked after a review in
Billboard called her a bimbo. She didn't leave her apartment for a
week.
	   ``I cried constantly; I was on my knees,'' Amos said. ``From
child prodigy to musical joke in twenty years _ how do you
reconcile that?''
	   About the time her debut solo album ``Little Earthquakes'' came
out in 1992, Amos moved to Britain. ``Under the Pink'' followed in
1994 and ``Boys for Pele'' came out in 1996. Her latest record is
``From the Choirgirl Hotel.''
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Socialite Ivana Trump doesn't want to pay the
private investigator she hired to spy on then-husband Donald Trump
and the woman he left her for, Marla Maples.
	   Maples later married Trump but has since split with the
millionaire real estate mogul.
	   Lawyers have failed to arrange a settlement in the lawsuit by
investigator James Mintz in a case that could reveal embarrassing
details of the bitter 1990 divorce battle, including details of
Trump's finances and his relationship with Maples while still
married.
	   ``It's a case that really re-rears ugly heads,'' Ivana Trump's
lawyer, Gary Lyman, says in Sunday's New York Post. ``This is
something I'd love to settle.''
	   Mintz is seeking payment of his dlrs 250,000 bill _ now up to
dlrs 400,000 with interest. Ivana Trump contends he overcharged her
and violated a dlrs 100,000 cap on spying services.
	   ``She thinks people see a deep pocket and they go for the
jugular,'' Lyman said.
	   If no settlement is reached, the case will go to trial in
Manhattan this summer.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A ferry trying to smash the record for the
fastest Atlantic crossing by a passenger vessel had completed a
third of its 3,125-mile (5028-kilometer) journey in about one day,
organizers of the race said Sunday.
	   Following a brief delay, the Catalonia departed New York Harbor
at 6:35 a.m. Saturday, headed for Tarifa, Spain.
	   Weighing 400 tons, the fast ferry can carry 900 passengers at a
speed of 45 knots, or 51 mph (82 kph). It is scheduled to arrive in
Tarifa on Tuesday morning.
	   If successful, the Catalonia will become the latest winner of
the Hales Trophy, held since 1990 by Hoverspeed Great Britain. The
coveted award is given to commercial ships that average the highest
speed while traversing the Atlantic.
	   Previous trophy winners include the Lusitania and the Queen
Mary.
	   To capture the prize, Catalonia must top Hoverspeed's average
speed of 36.65 knots. Captain Leonel Torres has said the fast
ferry, owned by Argentine-based Buquebus and built by Incat of
Australia, can average 43 knots.
	   ___
	   ALTA, Alberta (AP) _ There are bound to be a lot more arguments
over the TV remote control at this year's edition of the Banff
Television Festival.
	   The 19th annual installment of the festival has reached a new
high in attendance with more than 1,600 people _ producers,
directors, actors and TV executives _ descending on this idyllic
Rocky Mountain resort town.
	   There were also a record number of entries _ 989, up from 722
last year _ submitted in the international competition from 40
countries for the Banff Rockie Awards.
	   The festival has major themes such as exploring public figures
and their private lives, and the impact of television on human
rights issues. Entries are seen by a seven-member international
jury of TV professionals from Australia, Canada, France, Japan,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.
	   Festival President Pat Ferns said the Monica Lewinsky story and
debate over the role the media played in the death of Princess
Diana lent themselves ideally to the festival.
	   ``We're trying to brand ourselves as the Olympics of
television,'' Ferns said. ``It is where the U.S. competes with the
rest of the world on an even playing field, and it is the most
comprehensive awards program in the world.''

Moderate earthquake hits northeast of Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.4 hit areas north of Tokyo Monday morning, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake, which hit at 8:02 a.m. (2302 GMT Sunday), was
centered about 50 kilometers (31 miles) underground in southern
Ibaraki prefecture, or state, northeast of the capital, the
Meteorological Agency announced.
	   There was no danger of tsunami _ undersea waves triggered by
volcanic activity or earthquakes _ arising from the temblor, the
agency said.
	   About one hour after the quake Ibaraki police had received no
reports of damage or injuries, said police spokesman Yasuo Hasuda.
The quake was also registered in six other prefectures, as well as
Tokyo, the agency said.
	   An earthquake of magnitude 4 can shake houses and buildings and
cause hanging objects, such as lamps, to swing.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA took time off from its war of succession to
honor a dozen soccer greats and promoters of the game in various
parts of the world.
	   While the battle between Lennart Johansson and Sepp Blatter over
the presidency of the world body enters its final round, the
organization bestowed its prestigious Order of Merit on Germany's
former striker Gerd Mueller, Brazil's goalkeeper during the
1950s-60s Gilmar, and Michelle Akers of the U.S. women's national
team.
	   Larbi Ben Barak, the first great African player _ known during
the 1930s-40s as the ``Black Pearl of Casablanca'' _ received a
posthumous award.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela was honored for his role
in reintegrating the country into international soccer, after it
had been banned from competing during the apartheid regime.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   COUDRAY-MONTCEAU, France (AP) _ There was a sense of deja vu
among the leadership of the Bulgarian national squad when they
learned that an early morning fire had damaged the kitchen of the
hotel they were supposed to move into later Sunday.
	   Upon arriving at their training headquarters 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Paris, the Bulgarians were faced with the
possibility of having to search for new accommodations, much as
they had at the European Championship two years ago in England.
	   At that time, the team was traumatized when they were forced to
vacate their base camp in the seaside resort of Scarborough because
players said they hated the atmosphere in the hotel chosen by their
leadership.
	   But the damage caused by Sunday's blaze proved minimal, and the
hotel _ together with its kitchen _ will continue to operate
normally, management said.
	   ``It is a nice place, I've been here before,'' commented Ivan
Slavkov, president of the Bulgarian Football Union.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian midfielder Francesco Moriero said
Sunday he loves the ``creative'' Latin American soccer and predicts
that Brazil and Argentina will be the most likely World Cup
finalists.
	   ``Of course I think Italy also has big chances to reach the top
four in the competition,'' the Inter Milan player said.
	   He also expressed ``a lot of respect'' for Chile, Italy's first
opponent in Group B on Thursday.
	   ``It's a humble but determined team, and includes a pair of
great strikers, (Ivan) Zamorano and (Marcelo) Salas,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Thirty million guilders (dlrs 15
million) isn't enough _ at least that's what Ajax Amsterdam has
told English league champion Arsenal regarding its bid for
midfielder Ronald de Boer.
	   ``A transfer is out of the question and will stay that way,''
Ajax financial director Maarten Oldenhof said Sunday, according to
Dutch television news' textual service. It was not clear when Ajax
rejected the bid. A club spokesman could not immediately be reached
for more details.
	   De Boer and his twin brother Frank, who both will play for the
Netherlands in the World Cup finals which start Wednesday in
France, have contracts until 2004 at the Amsterdam powerhouse but
both have made no secret of their desire for a transfer.
	   ``Until that time (2004), we will not let him go, whatever
offers we get,'' Oldenhof said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ About 400 vocal Italian fans watched
Italy's 7-0 victory against the regional selection of Oise in a
tuneup game Sunday.
	   It was Italy's last warmup before its World Cup debut against
Chile at Bordeaux Thursday.
	   However the big event of the region was elsewhere, at nearby
Chantilly, where thousands of people attended the prestigious Prix
de Diane horse race.
	   Italian fans were especially supportive of especially
second-half substitute Filippo Inzaghi, who scored three goals
against the French amateurs.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri says that scoring goals is
not his obsession _ an unexpected remark by a striker who led the
Spanish league in scoring this year.
	   ``I don't think one must judge you from the number of goals,''
the 24-year-old forward of Atletico Madrid said Sunday. ``I always
engage at 100 percent. If I don't score but I play at my best,
nobody can blame me.''

World Cup: As South Korea prepares for Mexico, striker nurses knee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ South Korea is recharging its strength to play
Mexico in its opening France 98 match. Advancing to the second
round is the goal, but chances may ride on whether striker Hwang
Sun-hong recovers from a knee injury.
	   The South Koreans, which arrived in Paris on Friday, are quietly
preparing, practicing and planning in a remote area in the
outskirts of Paris in the hopes of optimizing their chances of
winning the nation's first match in five World Cup appearances.
	   While Belgium is regarded as the other ``weakling'' in Group E,
South Korea figures to have its best chance of a first-round
victory against South Korea. The Netherlands is the seeded team in
the group.
	   ``Our team expects to win against Mexico,'' Chun Hanjin, the
South Korean team's vice-manager, said Sunday. ``The odds of
winning against the Netherlands are ... somewhat lower. And Belgium
is a decent opponent.''
	   South Korea is counting on the Mexicans' similar physique and
style of play to lean in its favor, Chun explained. Asia's No. 1
team is also leery of any team from Europe.
	   ``Belgium is still a European team so we'll have to be
cautious,'' said Chun. ``Asian football has not shown its strength
against a European team.
	   ``There are many older players on the Belgian team but in Korea
we call Belgium 'Old Fox.' It is older and maybe not so fast but it
has experience and is sly. They know the game.''
	   Korea's chances of beating Mexico next Saturday (June 13) in
Lyon may have been dented when veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong
injured his knee in a tackle during a 1-1 draw against China on
Thursday.
	   ``His injury is not that serious,'' said Chun. ``He seriously
injured his right knee a long time ago so he's worried about this
new injury to his left knee. But he had it checked out and there's
no physical injury as such.''
	   ``He says it bothers him a little, though.''
	   Hwang said on Friday the accident would not prevent him from
playing.
	   However, coach Cha Bum-kun feels it will be impossible for the
29-year-old striker to play against Mexico, South Korea's press
officer Song Ki-ryong told The Associated Press.
	   ``Hwang says 'yes' and Cha says 'no,''' said Song, who gives
South Korea a 30 percent chance of advancing to the second round.
``But Cha has the final say. For the moment I'm not sure what the
final decision will be.''
	   In the meantime, the 2002 World Cup co-hosts are just relaxing.
	   ``For the moment we are just taking it easy,'' said Chun.
``We're all getting some rest. Besides there is nothing else to do
around here. We're in a pretty remote area.''

1998 French Open: Spaniards shined; women had the drama
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ They may not have played scintillating tennis, but
Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja ended the French Open on a happy
note: two buddies smiling and hugging, then knocking around a
soccer ball with Pele on center court.
	   Still, the men's final, won by Moya over a shakier and less
versatile Corretja, was an anticlimax. This year, the drama was on
the women's side, and much of it came before the final weekend.
	   But the last two days did make one thing clear: Spanish players
are expanding their dominance on the red clay of Roland Garros.
	   At 21, Moya seems to have the brightest future of them all.
	   He stormed into prominence at the 1997 Australian Open, getting
all the way to the final before losing to Pete Sampras.
	   Though the Spaniards grow up on clay courts, Moya has a better
serve and more varied weapons than some of his compatriots, and
that showed in his decisive 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 victory Sunday. He'll
move to the No. 5 ranking this week.
	   ``If I win Wimbledon, maybe I'm No. 1, huh?'' he said with a
wink, knowing his chances of winning on grass are remote.
	   One thing is obvious about the Spanish players: they are good
friends, and that solidarity helps them on the tour. They travel
together, play video games together, practice together, party
together _ and win together.
	   The players' box, often a site of tense coexistence between
rival clans, looked like a family picnic on Sunday. Moya's family
hugged Corretja's when the match was over. Arantxa Sanchez Vacario,
crowned women's champion a day earlier, was there, and so was her
mother. Everybody was happy.
	   In fact, loser Corretja was pretty cheery, too. He hurdled the
net after the match to congratulate his friend.
	   ``I'm really happy because I've been playing well for the last
two weeks, and I lost to a really good friend of mine,'' he said.
	   Fans reserved their biggest cheers for Pele, who presented the
winner's trophy and then joined both players for an impromptu romp
with a soccer ball.
	   ``The feelings I'm having right now are unbelievable,'' said
Moya, who won dlrs 650,000. ``I cannot explain with words. You have
to feel it. You have to be there.''
	   Moya, seeded 12th, and Corretja, seeded 14th, reached the final
after the men's field was decimated early in the tournament.
Top-seeded Pete Sampras lost in the second round and No. 2 Petr
Korda in the first. Moya ousted No. 3 Marcelo Rios in the
quarterfinals.
	   The women's field, by contrast, stayed strong until the end, and
had more than its usual share of compelling stories.
	   There was the curious meltdown of Martina Hingis, who may be
developing a Pete Sampras-like allergy to the Parisian clay.
	   Hingis lost last year in the finals to Iva Majoli. She then won
the next three Grand Slams, but back here this year, she folded in
the semis to a newly energized Monica Seles.
	   ``I just probably put too much pressure on myself,'' she said.
``I really want to win this tournament.''
	   Sampras probably would advise her to stop wanting it.
	   He, too, has never won here, and he's been trying a lot longer.
This year, his ninth try, was his worst loss ever. He went down in
the second round to a 21-year-old from Paraguay, Ramon Delgado,
ranked 97th in the world.
	   Another interesting development was the fast-improving Williams
sisters. They both did well here _ Venus reached the quarterfinals
before losing to Hingis, and Serena lost a tight fourth-round match
to eventual champion Sanchez Vicario.
	   Hingis' easy defeat of Venus Williams put to rest, for a moment,
the talk of a rivalry for the ages. But there is time; both are
only 17.
	   The 16-year-old Serena, meanwhile, looked strong until she came
within two points of victory over Sanchez Vicario. Then she folded,
showing she's got some more maturing to do.
	   The best story among the women, though, was Seles. She came to
Roland Garros to get away from painful memories at home of her late
father and coach, Karolj Seles, who died three weeks ago of cancer.
	   She might have been expected to lose early, given how distracted
she'd been. But instead, she turned adversity into her ally.
	   Her straight-set victory over Hingis, powered by laser-sharp
groundstrokes that constantly brushed the lines, was one of the
best matches of the tournament.
	   Wearing her father's ring around her neck, Seles lost a tough
three-set final to Sanchez Vicario, who, in a gracious acceptance
speech, said: ``I'm so sorry I beat you.''
	   Not all the excitement was on the women's side. A Russian
qualifier named Marat Safin, ranked 116th, came out of nowhere to
beat Andre Agassi and defending champion Gustavo Kuerten before
losing in the fourth round to local hero Cedric Pioline.
	   Safin has a killer serve, a feather-light drop shot and a dry
sense of humor. At only 18, he looks to have a very bright future,
too.

Porsche pressure proves too much for Toyota at Le Mans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE MANS, France (AP) _ Porsche has proven that experience and
not just endurance is key to success at the Le Mans 24 Hour race.
	   Two hours before the end of the race, Toyota seemed set for its
first Le Mans triumph, but pressure from two Porsche cars, followed
by a late Toyota disaster, sent the crown to the German constructor
for a record 16th time.
	   Porsche simply refused to give up hope, perhaps knowing that Le
Mans is famous for wrecking high hopes at the most unexpected time.
	   Porsche, which won seven straight Le Mans races in the 1980s,
has now won the last three contests here.
	   The Porsche GT1 driven by Alan McNish of Britain and France's
Laurent Aiello and Stephane Ortelli went on to win the contest
Sunday afternoon, speeding round the 13.6-kilometer (8.456-mile)
circuit 351 times.
	   ``When we were behind near the end we were pushing our car to
the limit and hoped that the Toyota would make a mistake,'' McNish
said. ``We needed to see if they could take the pressure. They
couldn't.''
	   Another Porsche GT1, driven by Germany's Jorg Muller and Uwe
Alzen and Bob Wolleck of France, was second with 350 laps.
	   In third place was Kazuyoshi Hoshino, Aguri Suzuki and Masahiko
Kageyama in a Nissan R390, the first time three Japanese drivers
have shared a single podium at Le Mans.
	   ``There's so much experience in this Porsche camp.'' McNish
added. ``We know that this race is never over until the checkered
flag goes up.''
	   Sunday morning Thierry Boutsen, Ralf Kelleners and Geoff Lees
gave the Toyota GT1 the lead in the 20th hour.
	   In fact, the key moment came 85 minutes from the end when flames
suddenly appeared from the Toyota's gearbox after it had turned the
Mulsanne Corner.
	   Soon, many in the Toyota pit were in tears as it became clear
that the Le Mans prize would again be heading Porsche's way.
	   ``We were 44 seconds behind when that happened,'' McNish
recalled after the race. ``But you never know what might happen at
this race.''
	   The Toyota team was desolate after the race.
	   ``Thierry deserved to win after driving so well overnight,''
said Toyota teammate Martin Brundle. ``The whole team has worked so
hard and we are all terribly disappointed to lose the race this
way. It's awful to go out so close to the end.''
	   Only one Japanese manufacturer, Mazda in 1991, has ever won the
Le Mans race.
	   But Toyota technical director Andre de Cortenze, who tasted
victory with Peugeot in 1992 and 1993, vowed to return in 1999.
	   ``We have proved that we know how to win the Le Mans,'' he said.
	   After Mercedes and BMW each lost both of their cars early in the
race Saturday afternoon, the stage soon became set for a scrap
between Toyota, Porsche and Nissan.
	   Boutsen led for more than four hours on Saturday, but Porsche
dominated at the halfway stage, when its two cars were three laps
ahead of the field.
	   The Toyota car was only fifth, but clawed its way back to the
head of the field Sunday morning after Porsche suffered problems at
daybreak.
	   The Mercedes of German Bernd Schneider, which was fastest in
practice, fell out of the race with motor failure after just 90
minutes.

Dollar hits 140 yen in Tokyo, stocks down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar broke through 140 yen in early
Tokyo trading Monday, hitting another seven-year high. Tokyo stock
prices fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 140.28 yen in early trading, up 0.86 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo for a level not seen here since June 20, 1991.
	   On Friday, the dollar rose as high as 139.93 yen in New York
before setting at 139.75 yen. In thin weekend trading Sunday,
however, it also broke through 140 yen in New York.
	   The dollar's strength derived from fresh evidence of a robust
U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported on Friday the
nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of 4.3 percent in
May.
	   Also supporting the U.S. currency was the diminishing likelihood
the deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations will make a strong statement criticizing the current dollar
level, traders said.
	   Officials from the G-7 _ the United States, Japan, Germany,
Italy, Canada, Britain and France _ are scheduled to meet in Paris
on Tuesday.
	   Persistent pessimism over Japan's economy also continued to
weigh on sentiment among many investors, who have shifted to the
U.S. and German currencies in recent weeks.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 39.91 points, or 0.26 percent, to 15,283.52 at the start of
Monday's trading session. On Friday, the average lost 103.04
points, or 0.67 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 2.82 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,199.12. The
TOPIX closed down 5.56 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond was unquoted in early trading. It's yield closed
Friday at 1.165 percent, with a price of 112.31 yen.

Sorenstam wins Michelob Light Classic third time in four years
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ This time, Annika Sorenstam won the LPGA
Michelob Light Classic the hard way.
	   Sorenstam was a three-stroke winner last year and ran away for a
10-stroke victory in 1996. On Sunday, it took birdies on two of the
last three holes to force a playoff before she beat Donna Andrews
on the second extra hole.
	   ``Normally, it seems like when I win I'm up there and I kind of
keep the lead the last few holes,'' said Sorenstam, who closed with
a 4-under-par 68, while Andrews, the second-round leader, had a 70.
``I had to go for every putt, because if I didn't she was going to
win.''
	   So far, this hasn't been a normal year for Sorenstam. She won
six tournaments last year when she was named LPGA player of the
year, and has 13 career victories. But this victory, worth dlrs
90,000, was her first of the year.
	   ``It means a lot just getting some of the burden off my back a
little bit,'' Sorenstam said. ``I've been playing well, I just
haven't been able to pull through.
	   ``One bad round has held me back, but not this week.''
	   Trailing by one stroke on the final hole in regulation,
Sorenstam came up with her best shot of the day. An approach from
about 90 yards (82 meters) left her less than a foot (meter) from
the cup and she tapped in for birdie to force the playoff.
	   Andrews thought Sorenstam had holed out the shot for the win.
	   ``She hit a great shot,'' Andrews said. ``I was glad just to
have a chance.''
	   Andrews had opened the door on No. 18 when she clipped a tree
with her second shot. She left her third shot short of the green,
but then chipped to about 5 feet (1.5 meters) and made the putt for
par.
	   The only playoff hole was No. 18 due to TV considerations. Each
parred the first extra hole.
	   ``Annika looked at me after we'd played it once and said `We
could be here all day, as consistent as you and I are,' '' Andrews
said. ``She's right. It's a hole you're going to make par on 90
percent of the time.''
	   The second time around, though, Andrews left a downhill birdie
attempt from about 15 feet (4.5 meters) a bit short and to the
left. Sorenstam then drilled a 4-footer (1.2-meter) for the
victory.
	   Andrews built a two-stroke lead with a 6-under-par 66 in the
second round of the event, which was shortened to three rounds by
rain. She trailed Sorenstam by one after six holes, and led by
three after 11.
	   ``I knew I needed to make a lot of birdies to even have a
chance,'' Sorenstam said. ``She didn't make any mistakes. She was
just a radar.''
	   Andrews has finished second in her last three tournaments. She
also took over the top spot on the money list ahead of Liselotte
Neumann with her check of dlrs 55,855 and a total of dlrs 465,434.
	   Sorenstam is third on the list with dlrs 387,765.
	   ``You know what?'' Andrews said. ``I think if I finished second
in every tournament I'd be happy.''
	   It's been an emotional time for Andrews, playing her first
tournament after a two-week break. Last week, a 4-year-old horse
she owned died in complications from pregnancy, and she choked up a
bit after the final round.
	   ``I felt like there was a little angel on my shoulder,'' Andrews
said. ``Even when I hit bad shots, they ended up in good spots.''
	   Sorenstam birdied the first four holes to share the lead even
though Andrews birdied two of the first four. She even led by a
stroke after Andrews bogeyed No. 8. She followed that with a bogey
and double-bogey, blowing a 2-3 foot (.6-1 meter) putt on No. 9 to
fall back by two.
	   When Andrews holed out a putt from the fringe on No. 11, she had
a three-stroke lead. Sorenstam made a 20-foot (6.1-meter) birdie
putt on No. 13 and another birdie on No. 16 cut the gap to one.
	   Tour rookie Sara Hallock shot a 69 to finish third at five
under. Pat Hurst and Lorie Kane finished six strokes back, Hurst
with a final-round 69 and Kane with a 67.
	   Jackie Gallagher-Smith was the only other player below par,
closing with a 72 to finish at one under.

Hanson says criticism fuels support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Maverick legislator Pauline Hanson on
Monday dismissed an attack on her views by Prime Minister John
Howard, saying criticism only increases her support.
	   Last week Howard abandoned his strategy of ignoring Hanson,
labeling her views dishonest, deranged and fanning racist
sentiments.
	   He was referring to her speech last week in which she claimed a
``collusion of Aboriginal separatists, the United Nations and the
disloyal and self-seeking globalists'' was seeking to dismember
Australia and set up taxpayer-funded Aboriginal states.
	   But in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio
Hanson brushed off the criticism, saying support for her was
strong.
	   ``I think the general public just see me as one of them, they
just see me as an ordinary woman getting up and trying to have a
go,'' Hanson said.
	   ``And every time John Howard or anyone else comes out and has a
go at me, they feel as if they are taking it personally and they
don't like it.
	   ``It's like the `Aussie battler,' at least she's getting up
having a go, at least she's prepared to stand up for what she
believes in and she is only saying what we think, so every time
they knock her, hey mate, they're knocking me.''
	   The term ``Aussie battler'' describes a working class Australian
struggling to make a living.
	   Hanson said she was only voicing the views of her supporters who
are concerned about issues like unemployment and crime and wanted
to see all Australians treated equally.
	   Economic issues were more important than race issues, said
Hanson, who has called for a cutoff of Asian immigration and for an
end to welfare programs specific to Aborigines.
	   ``Australians are a very tolerant people and they realize that
Australia is a multi-racial country, (there are) people from all
different parts of the world that come here for a better way of
life,'' she said.
	   ``All we are saying is `Well look, welcome, but come here and be
Australian ... because otherwise it will only divide us as a
nation, divide us as a people.'''
	   Hanson said even if her One Nation Party only won a single seat
in the Queensland election on Saturday she will be ``the proudest
woman in Australia.''

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Diplomatic efforts are under way to
prevent the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia from
exploding into full-scale war, with officials hoping that Monday's
summit of African leaders will produce new ideas for a settlement.
	   American, Italian, German and British planes ferried more than a
thousand foreigners out of harm's way late Saturday and early
Sunday after Ethiopia agreed to temporarily halt bombing of a
military-civilian airport on the outskirts of Asmara.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice left a meeting of
OAU foreign ministers Saturday in Ouagadougu, Burkina Faso, to
return to the United States. Rice is promoting a U.S.-Rwandan peace
plan for the two feuding Horn of Africa countries.
	   The plan includes a call for Eritrea to return to positions held
before May 6, when current hostilities reportedly broke out _ in
other words, to withdraw from what Ethiopia considers its
territory.
	   But Eritrea, wedged between northern Ethiopia and the Red Sea,
claims it is rightfully occupying territory defined by boundaries
drawn by Italy when it occupied Eritrea in 1885.
	   African leaders, including the presidents of South Africa,
Djibouti, Uganda and Kenya, called Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki over the weekend to encourage a negotiated settlement.
	   Eritrean civilians were hoping to avoid war. Ethiopia's army
outnumbers Eritrea's 40,000-strong force by about 3 to 1. Eritrea's
tiny air force is no match for Ethiopia's.
	   In Asmara, Eritreans scanned cloudless blue skies Sunday and
listened for the high-pitched whoosh of the Ethiopian MiG-23
fighters that had bombed their capital's airport Friday and
Saturday. But none came.
	   Skirmishes were reported, however, along the two countries'
disputed border. Ethiopia said Sunday it had reoccupied its border
town of Zala Anbessa, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southwest of
Asmara, after a daylong battle with Eritrean forces who captured
the town last week.
	   Eritrean government spokesman Isaac Yared said Eritrean troops
had retreated to their side of the border. ``They decided it was
time to go,'' he said.
	   Mokonnen, who uses just one name, said he was optimistic that a
peace pact would be forged between the one-time allies.
	   ``Our government wants peace, and we are struggling to solve it
peacefully,'' the 27-year-old telephone operator said.
	   Also Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
leaders of both countries were willing to implement a Libyan plan
for a cease-fire and deploy an African peacekeeping force on their
border,
	   The report could not be independently confirmed in either
Ethiopia or Eritrea.
	   MENA said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi received messages of
peace from the leaders who ``expressed their willingness'' to
accept the Libyan plan.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991, and Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   But the two countries dispute more than a half-dozen areas along
their common border, which was drawn by Italy after it conquered
Eritrea in 1885.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico has arrested the man suspected of
leading the Gulf drug organization, a newspaper reported Sunday.
Authorities would not confirm the report.
	   According to the newspaper Reforma, agents of the federal
attorney general's office arrested Salvador Gomez, known as ``El
Chava,'' early Friday morning in Matamoros, across the border from
Brownsville, Texas.
	   According to the newspaper report, Gomez was accompanied by one
of his lieutenants and a federal highway policemen. They were also
arrested, and the three were flown to Mexico City, Reforma said.
	   Gomez, a former policeman, is reported to head the Gulf drug
organization, based in Matamoros, having risen from the ranks and
assumed leadership in 1997 by shooting his strongest rival in the
face.
	   The competition occurred after former cartel boss Juan Garcia
Abrego was captured in 1996 and deported to the United States. He
was sentenced to life in prison for smuggling 15 tons of cocaine
into the United States.
	   Under Garcia Abrego, the Gulf organization once was Mexico's
second-largest drug group, smuggling hundreds of tons of Colombian
cocaine into the United States each year.
	   The dominant drug gang now is the Arrellano Felix group, based
in Tijuana.
	   ___
	   CHINAUTLA, Guatemala (AP) _ Guatemalans in 30 municipalities
turned out in huge numbers Sunday to elect mayors and city
councils.
	   Voting is obligatory in Guatemala, so even people with no
interest in the elections showed up at the ballot boxes.
	   ``I came to vote because I'm registered here, but I don't know
who the candidates are, and I don't know who I'll vote for,'' said
Maria del Rosario Munoz, a 27-year-old Indian in traditional dress
from this town six miles (10 kms) northwest of Guatemala City.
	   The elections Sunday were selecting local officials for 30 of
Guatemala's 320 municipalities, with 395,262 voters registered. The
mayors and town councils will be in power for 18 months, until
general elections next year replace them.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ One of Colombia's last remaining major
drug bosses, Caribbean cartel leader Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, was
captured in the northern port of Barranquilla, the deputy national
police director announced Sunday.
	   His appearance had been altered by hair implants and his pockets
were full of cash.
	   Orlandez, alias ``The Snail,'' allegedly smuggled tons of
cocaine to Europe and the United States since at least as early as
1991. He has been indicted in Miami federal court on charges of
drug trafficking and money laundering, said the police official,
Gen. Luis Ernesto Gilibert.
	   He said Colombia's foreign ministry would decide whether to
extradite Orlandez for trial to the United States under last year's
law that reinstated extradition.
	   The 43-year-old Orlandez was arrested Saturday, ringed by
bodyguards and carrying false identification documents and dlrs
U.S. 5,000 in cash, police said. He faces charges of murder,
kidnapping and illicit enrichment in Colombia.
	   More than 5 tons of cocaine shipments owned by Orlandez have
been seized in Miami, New York, Lake Charles, Louisiana, Panama and
other locations since 1991, police said.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The leader of the Communist Party
of the Russian Federation said Sunday that President Boris Yeltsin
has installed in his country ``a feudal mafia,'' following the
disappearance of the Soviet Union.
	   ``In my country, nobody is building capitalism. We are victims
of the constant robbery and looting of our national resources''
Gennady Zyuganov said at a press conference in the central
headquarters of the Argentine Communist Party.
	   He predicted ``a chaotic situation if Yeltsin sticks to his
present economic model.''
	   According to Zyuganov, 20 million people are now unemployed in
Russia ``and another 15 million are leading a miserable life.''
	   Zyuganov said he intends to reinforce links with Latin American
leftist organizations. He arrived Saturday from Brazil and is
scheduled to fly Sunday night to Cuba for a two-day visit.
	   ``In the case of Cuba, our relations have been very strong for a
long time, and we plan to strengthen them'', he said.
	   Zyuganov depicted the current United States economic blockade
against Cuba as ``a political anachronism'' and praised the Cuban
people ``for being able to reform their system without sacrifying
its social achievements.''

Air France pilots' strike enters second week

	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking Air France pilots have offered to work for
free to fly foreign fans to the World Cup, but their walkout showed
no sign of ending Monday as it entered its second week.
	   The unexpected gesture came as the conflict appeared to harden
Sunday night, with Air France management expressing exasperation
with the pilots who walked off the job June 1.
	   No new talks were in sight, and Air France said the strike
already had cost 1 billion francs (dlrs 166 million).
	   France's flagship carrier says it will take three days for
service to return to normal once the strike ends, meaning the
walkout was sure to disrupt the World Cup, which begins Wednesday.
	   Christian Paris, spokesman for the SNPL, the main pilots' union,
proposed that Air France organize special flights for foreign World
Cup ticket holders and said the pilots would work without pay so
the fans would not miss the soccer championship.
	   Air France said it would study the measure.
	   Despite the goodwill gesture, the conflict was deadlocked Sunday
night.
	   Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the director general of Air France, said
the airline had ``exhausted its capacity of understanding with
regard to the pilots.''
	   Meanwhile, the company sought to contain the strike by meeting
with 19 unions representing other airline workers who feel left out
of salary talks between Air France and the pilots.
	   Both sides are under pressure to end the strike from the
government, which has offered to intervene but has not put forward
concrete proposals.
	   Rene Monory, president of the French Senate, said Sunday the
pilots were giving the country a ``lamentable image.''
	   Talks between Air France and the pilots were suspended Saturday
after the pilots walked out of negotiations.
	   The strike has inconvenienced thousands, including foreigners
fleeing fighting in Eritrea.
	   The pilots are protesting planned pay cuts of 500 million francs
(dlrs 83 million) Air France says are needed to modernize the
company.
	   Obstacles to an agreement are proposed salary reductions and a
plan to give pilots stock in exchange for the pay cut, as well as a
two-tier pay scale in which younger pilots earn less.
	   Only about 25 percent of Air France's flights were expected to
take off Monday.
	   Trains were expected to run on schedule Monday after strikes
disrupted service this weekend. Trains conductors have threatened a
walkout Wednesday.
	   Taxi drivers in Paris planned demonstrations Monday to protest
the recent killing of a taxi driver.

Dollar hits 140 yen in Tokyo, stocks turn mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei trading figures, bond price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar broke through 140 yen in early
Tokyo trading Monday, hitting another seven-year high. Tokyo stock
prices turned mixed in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 140.28 yen in early trading, up 0.86 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo for a level not seen here since June 20, 1991.
	   On Friday, the dollar rose as high as 139.93 yen in New York
before settling at 139.75 yen. In thin weekend trading Sunday,
however, it also broke through 140 yen in New York.
	   The dollar's strength derived from fresh evidence of a robust
U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported Friday the
nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of 4.3 percent in
May.
	   Also supporting the U.S. currency was the diminishing likelihood
deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations will make a strong statement criticizing the current dollar
level, traders said.
	   Officials from the G-7 _ the United States, Japan, Germany,
Italy, Canada, Britain and France _ are scheduled to meet in Paris
on Tuesday.
	   Persistent pessimism over Japan's economy also continued to
weigh on sentiment among many investors, who have shifted to the
U.S. and German currencies in recent weeks.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 12.33 points, or 0.08 percent, to 15,335.76 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading. On Friday, the average lost 103.04
points, or 0.67 percent.
	   The Nikkei average started lower on small-lot selling as the
yen's weakening discouraged some investors, but later reversed
course after a round of buying.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.35 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,200.59
points. The TOPIX closed down 5.56 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.160 percent from Friday's finish of 1.165
percent, driving its price up to 112.34 yen from 112.31 yen.

Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict shows regional leaders follow their own
</HEADLINE>
agenda &QL; 
 &UR; With Eritrea-Ethiopia &QL; 
 &UR; AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The unexpected outbreak of hostilities between
Ethiopia and Eritrea serves as a strong reminder that former rebel
leaders groomed by the United States to form the vanguard of an
``African renaissance'' are following their own agenda _ and it is
not necessarily to contain Islamic fundamentalism or promote
regional stability.
	   Ethiopia's May 13 warning to Eritrea to withdraw from its
territory or face the consequences was the first public indication
that their months-long discussions about the border separating the
two nations in the Horn of Africa had run aground.
	   Feisty and much smaller Eritrea, an Italian colony from 1885 to
1941, replied that it had violated no boundary but would gladly
submit to international mediation. Eritrea came under a United
Nations mandate after World War II, was annexed by Ethiopia in
1962, and went on to fight a 30-year war of liberation.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice, widely considered
the godmother of the Clinton administration's ``new'' African
policy, twice rushed to Ethiopia and Eritrea to talk sense to Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi and President Isaias Afwerki.
	   But the former rebel comrades-in-arms went ahead last week and
bombed each other anyway. Eritrea claims Ethiopia hit its main
military airport first; Ethiopia says it only retaliated for an
Eritrean airstrike on Mekele, the capital of its northern Tigray
region, in which it said 44 civilians were killed.
	   Scholars of Eritrea and Ethiopia doubt that contested border
areas are the real reason behind the conflict. They say the
marriage of convenience that brought Isaias' Eritrean People's
Liberation Front and Meles' Tigray People's Liberation Front
together to oust Ethiopian military ruler Col. Mengistu Haile
Mariam in 1991 has hit the rocks.
	   Isaias, 51, wants to show his younger colleague Meles, 46, _ and
the world _ that he can go it alone, without bowing to all the
conditions attached to international aid. Although he supports a
market economy, Isaias heads a highly centralized one-party state.
	   Meles, a member of the northern Tigray minority who has promoted
ethnic-based federalism and pays lip service to multipartyism, has
been harshly criticized by the majority Amharas and Oromos for
giving up Eritrea _ and its two Red Sea ports of Assab and Massawa
_ in return for Isaias' help.
	   It is also thought that Meles may be trying to show hard-liners
within his own movement that he is not soft on Eritrea, which he
apparently believed he could keep in hand, especially when both
countries shared a common currency, the birr.
	   But Eritrea's creation of the nakfa late last year forced
Ethiopia to peg all cross-border transactions, including use of
Assab's port, in hard-to-come-by dollars since neither of the two
African currencies is convertable.
	   Senior U.S. officials have not customarily intervened so
publicly in African conflicts.
	   But Rice, a protegee of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, is the prime mover behind the policy to contain _ or
unseat _ Sudan's National Islamic Front government.
	   A key element in this policy is a U.S.-underwritten association
of countries headed by former rebels, including historically
Christian-dominated Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda and Rwanda. The first
three have common _ and troubled _ borders with Sudan.
	   There is concern that a drawn-out conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea will undermine the U.S.-financed informal alliance of
countries headed by former rebels that is the cornerstone of the
policy.
	   These countries include Christian Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and
Rwanda, and the leaders of all four pride themselves on their
independence of mind.
	   The first three have common _ and troubled _ borders with Sudan.
	   Eritrea, one of the world's poorest countries, has been hosting
the National Democratic Alliance of ousted former Sudanese Prime
Minister Sadiq al Mahdi, which attacks northeastern Sudan.
	   Reports _ which have landed a local correspondent for the French
news agency Agence France-Presse in an Asmara prison without charge
for more than a year _ indicate that Eritrean troops have been
fighting alongside the DNA.
	   Ethiopia offers haven to the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army, which Uganda also supports.
	   Rwanda, the co-author with the United States of a
so-far-unsuccessful four-point Eritrea-Ethiopia peace proposal, has
close ties with Eritrea, from which it has purchased at least 12
Soviet-era tanks with which to fight Hutu rebels.

Pilots' group names 150 airports with safety problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to CORRECT name of Amsterdam's airport to Schiphol,
sted Schipol; CLARIFY Amsterdam included on list of 150 airports
with major safety problems. The newspaper did not publish the
complete list of 150 airports. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ International pilots have listed 150 airports with
major safety problems and singled out 15 _ including San Francisco
and Hong Kong _ that they believe are ``critically deficient,'' the
Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper said it received a leaked copy of a report
compiled at an April meeting of the International Federation of Air
Line Pilots' Associations in Montreal.
	   The airport safety problems noted in the survey range from
natural hazards to shortages of air traffic controllers to
regulations that restrict pilots' maneuverability.
	   ``If airports and airspaces are listed, it means they have
serious deficiencies, not that they are unsafe,'' the Sunday Times
quoted federation executive director Cathy Bill as saying.
	   ``There are potential dangers, but there are potential dangers
when you get in any plane,'' she said.
	   Other airports in the critically deficient category were: Nice,
France; Wellington, New Zealand; Fornebu in Oslo; Suva in Fiji;
Buenos Aires, Argentina; Leticia, Rio Negro and San Andres in
Colombia; Maiquetia in Venezuela; Nauru, a central Pacific island;
Lagos and Port Harcourt in Nigeria and Kabul in Afghanistan.
	   The Sunday Times said air crews have complained about landing at
airports in popular tourist destinations, such as Greece, ``to find
inadequate runway lighting and no air-traffic controllers on the
ground.''
	   In San Francisco, the Sunday Times said, planes land in pairs on
parallel runways, with pilots often relying largely on visual
contact. ``It's been known for pilots to start aiming at the wrong
runway and drift across in front of the other plane,'' it quoted an
unidentified pilot as saying.
	   San Francisco International Airport spokesman Daniel D'Innocenti
said the parallel runway situation was an approved maneuver.
	   ``I'm sure there's an occasion when the pilot drifts into
another runway,'' D'Innocenti said. ``But there are so many safety
valves involved... .There's never been a time when it's an unsafe
condition.''
	   At Argentina's Mendoza Airport, it said, a pilot reported a
horse on the runway. Another aborted a take-off from Buenos Aires
after seeing children playing in his path.
	   The airport in Nice, regularly requests planes make a circular
final approach using a navigation system that can be inaccurate by
hundreds of feet (meters), the paper said. Although it has had few
serious accidents, Hong Kong is potentially dangerous because of
the proximity of the runway to a parallel taxiway _ a situation
that can be hazardous in crosswinds.
	   ``I am disappointed that we are on the list,'' Nice Airport's
director Danial Galibert told the newspaper. ``The approach is more
complicated than it used to be and the pilots hated it at first,
but we have tried to get their support. We only use a visual
approach in good conditions.''
	   A British Airways spokesman said the airline was satisfied with
safety standards at the airports it uses, including San Francisco
and Hong Kong.
	   The director of Maiquetia airport, which serves Caracas,
criticized the report. Concepcion Alberto Fuentes said that U.S.
officials checked conditions before a visit last year by President
Clinton.
	   ``If there was any problem with security, the presidential
airplane would not have landed,'' he said.
	   The meeting agreed to include Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport to
the list of airports with major safety problems after a report
claimed safety standards were being compromised because of noise
restrictions, the Sunday Times said. Pilots say the restrictions
force them to land in an area of severe crosswinds.
	   Airspace listed as potentially dangerous includes thousands of
square miles in Africa, China and South America _ and the North
Sea, because of the vast amount of civil and military traffic
working for the oil industry below 10,000 feet (3,048 meters).

Serb police beat protesters in Kosovo's capital

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces pressed their campaign
against separatist rebels in the Kosovo countryside, while police
swinging clubs beat protesters at an independence rally in the
provincial capital.
	   At least six ethnic Albanians were injured Sunday when more than
100 police broke up the demonstration in Pristina, which had
largely escaped the violence that has convulsed the secessionist
province of Serbia in recent months.
	   Meanwhile, Serb forces reportedly continued shelling suspected
militant positions in western Kosovo as part of a stepped-up
campaign that has killed at least 50 people, according to ethnic
Albanian officials, and 200 others have been missing since late
May.
	   The violence has sent thousands of refugees fleeing ruined
villages, some to neighboring nations and has aroused alarm among
Western powers that a war is in the making that could spread to
other Balkan states.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the 2.2 million
inhabitants of Kosovo, and most demand to secede from Serbia, which
along with Montenegro makes up Yugoslavia. Western powers oppose
any change of borders, but want the Serbs to cease their offensive
and give Kosovo the autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Sunday and they agreed to send a ``strong message'' that
the Serb offensive is unacceptable, a Blair aide said.
	   The United States and others planned deliberations this week on
what steps to take. British newspapers said the powers might
discuss military intervention.
	   In Washington, a top U.S. senator said Sunday that Kosovo ``has
the potential to become another Bosnia.''
	   ``We cannot allow this slaughter to occur. Once again the
Serbians are out of control. Something should be done,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said on CNN's ``Late Edition.''
	   Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, said he would not rule out
the use of American troops. He said the United States should
``always be reluctant to use military force,'' but ``I'm not saying
we should not consider troops if it continues the way it is
going.''
	   In Turkey, there were fears that the violence in Kosovo could
derail a meeting of Balkan foreign ministers.
	   Foreign Ministers from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia,
Romania and Yugoslavia will attend the two-day meeting that starts
Monday, while Bosnia and Slovenia have sent deputy ministers. They
are nominally to discuss economic cooperation and the region's
communications, energy and transportation infrastructure.
	   But sources close to the foreign ministers said Sunday that
Yugoslavia's refusal to allow any reference to the
Albanian-dominated secessionist Serbian province of Kosovo could
torpedo a joint declaration calling for closer regional
cooperation.
	   In Pristina, the relative peace was shattered Sunday when police
charged the approximately 1,000 protesters gathered for the 57th
consecutive daily rally against the Serbs' violent rule in Kosovo.
	   One protester could be seen bleeding in the street after he was
hit in the head by a policeman's gun butt and then kicked
repeatedly.
	   Albanian TV in Tirana reported that the Serbs shelled at least
two Kosovo villages Sunday. It also said ethnic Albanian militants
blew up the police headquarters in Ratkoc, and amid fierce fighting
between the two sides all the Serb residents and police had fled.
	   It was not known how much of a setback the Serb offensive has
dealt the province's clandestine rebels, known as the Kosovo
Liberation Army. The militants claim to control about 40 percent of
the southern province of Serbia.
	   The rebels, who are winning increasing support among Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, appealed in a statement Sunday in the newspaper
Koha Ditore for more fighters to join them.
	   ``Come to strengthen our troops against the enemy artillery and
enemy infantry,'' the KLA statement said.
	   Pope John Paul II called on the world Sunday to act against
violence and repression in Kosovo.

Australian dollar slides towards record low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar continued its
plunge toward 12-year record lows Monday despite attempts by the
Reserve Bank of Australia to halt its slide.
	   ``The Australian dollar will remain under pressure until
something fundamental changes in Asia,'' said Commonwealth Bank
senior manager for foreign exchange Kurt Magnus.
	   By late morning the local currency hit a near 12-year low of
59.77 U.S. cents, a level not seen since 1986.
	   The Australian dollar fell as low as 60 U.S. cents during
offshore trading Friday night. It closed in Sydney at 60.51 U.S.
cents.
	   Dealers said the central bank intervened in the market as
recently as Monday morning to attempt to prop up the ailing
currency by buying Aussie dollars.
	   ``We've got it on good authority that the RBA's been in to
smooth and test the currency and take some heat out of the
market,'' Macquarie Bank foreign exchange associate director Brent
Aggar said.
	   The RBA has already spent about U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion (3 billion
Australian dollars) in a largely futile attempt to prop up the
currency.
	   The Australian dollar's record low of 57.10 US cents was struck
in July 1986.

From militia to movement, Hezbollah faces uncertain future

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's Hezbollah, a shadowy band of
Islamic militants that has transformed itself into a formidable
populist movement, should be the envy of guerrilla groups anywhere.
	   Its dedicated fighters number only in the hundreds, yet they are
threatening to oust the Israeli army, one of the world's toughest,
from the rocky hills of Lebanon's south. Its spies have infiltrated
Israel's allied militia. And its struggle has won surging
popularity across a country whose name still evokes images of
discord and civil war.
	   But an Israeli withdrawal _ an idea touted more and more by an
Israeli government conscious of the war's unpopularity at home _
may pose Hezbollah its greatest challenge since it was forged from
the chaos and strife of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
	   Ironically, victory over Israel could amount to a setback.
	   ``The war has given the party a great deal of power, a great
deal of prestige and a great deal of recognition,'' said Farid el
Khazen, a professor at the American University of Beirut. ``Without
the war, Hezbollah will be deflated.''
	   Already, its leaders are pondering what comes next, and the
speculation drives to the heart of Hezbollah's identity.
	   Having transformed itself from a militia to a movement, can it
overhaul itself yet again? More important, what shape will
Hezbollah take in the unruly tumult of Lebanese politics: charity
organization, political party or grassroots movement?
	   Its success in remaking itself could point the way for other
radical Islamic groups to integrate themselves into Arab societies
by forgoing violence for perhaps more effective politicking.
	   Today's Hezbollah is a far cry from the feared group linked to
the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine barracks, which killed 240
Americans, and the kidnapping of more than 50 foreigners amid the
anarchy that defined Lebanon during its 1975-90 civil war.
	   Abroad, the attacks brought Hezbollah a notoriety it is still
trying to live down despite its steadfast denials of any role. The
U.S. State Department, for one, insists it still engages in
terrorism. At home, its zeal in smashing up Beirut bars and banning
card-playing at cafes as un-Islamic bolstered a robust image as a
collection of religious fanatics.
	   In recent years, however, Hezbollah has gone from issuing
religious edicts declaring Lebanon's government criminal to running
candidates in elections for parliament.
	   It neither can nor wants to shed its image as a religious party
representing Shiite Muslims, Lebanon's largest sect. But its
leaders routinely speak out about unemployment and the rising cost
of living, complaints voiced by other opposition parties.
	   And from years of secrecy and shunning outsiders, the group now
runs a sophisticated press office, its well-dressed functionaries
carrying cellular phones and volunteering an electronic mail
address. It owns a television and radio station, publishes a weekly
newspaper and advertises an Internet site. It even backs a soccer
team.
	   ``The tools of Hezbollah have changed and the way it works has
changed,'' said Nayef Kraim, the group's spokesman.
	   By far, though, Hezbollah draws its greatest support from
success on the battlefield. With Syrian and Iranian backing, it
launches dozens of raids every month aimed at an Israeli army that
has controlled southern Lebanon for 20 years as a way of guarding
Israel's northern frontier.
	   In April, Hezbollah attacked Israel and its Lebanese allies 117
times, the largest number of raids in more than a decade.
	   The attacks followed Israel's declaration that it would withdraw
if it received security guarantees _ a proposal that Hezbollah read
as a sign of approaching victory. While not saying it will stop
fighting Israel, Hezbollah has made clear that once Israeli forces
withdraw, the Lebanese army will take over in the south _ a promise
many in Lebanon read as a tacit pledge to end the war.
	   But that success makes many ponder the future. Even Hezbollah
cadres acknowledge the uncertainty.
	   ``We don't expect to be heroes forever,'' said Mohammed Hijazi,
a director of a Hezbollah-run hospital in Beirut.
	   The Lebanese government will likely demand that Hezbollah
surrender its weapons. The war's end may require, as well, a
departure from the martial image the group has long fostered: Its
fighters are called ``mujahideen,'' or religious warriors, and its
banner features a fist clutching a Kalashnikov rifle.

	   Publicly, the movement does not worry.
	   ``Hezbollah has become a part of the Lebanese fabric, and it has
a part in the political and social reality,'' Sheik Naim Kassem,
the group's deputy leader, said in an interview. ``Its role is not
limited to the resistance to the occupation only.''
	   Indeed, Hezbollah spends tens of millions of dollars a year _
made possible by Iran _ to run nine schools and three hospitals,
provide drinking water to Beirut's Shiite Muslim slums and rebuild
homes damaged in the fighting with Israel.
	   For some, that helping hand could ensure Hezbollah's continued
popularity among the poor.
	   ``People love the people who serve them,'' said Adel Ollaik, who
runs a Hezbollah hospital in Nabatiyeh, a southern town within
sight of Israeli positions. ``After the war, Hezbollah will succeed
more because the social institutions will become stronger.''
	   Others see the charity work as only a step in Hezbollah's
pursuit of its political ambitions, unfettered by the burdens of
waging war but coping with a loss of the popularity won in the
struggle.
	   The movement still supports the creation of an Iranian-style
Islamic state in Lebanon, but it rarely declares so in public. In
interviews, its leaders say Hezbollah will push the idea through
dialogue, not force, and acknowledge that the reality of 18 sects
in a country still scarred by communal war rules out an Islamic
state soon.
	   The new arena is the 128-seat parliament, where seven Hezbollah
members already sit. Like other Islamic parties, they rail against
the corruption and cronyism endemic to Lebanese capitalism.
	   The war's end could make possible another step in the movement's
moderation: from militants to successful guerrillas to a grassroots
movement competing in Lebanese politics _ a transformation some
call its ``Lebanonization.''
	   But without the support it derives from the war, Hezbollah will
inevitably become more vulnerable, many say.
	   ``Hezbollah's leadership today is very pragmatic and very much
in tune with Lebanese communal politics,'' said Khazen, the
university analyst. ``They are efficient, well-organized and they
play the game well.''
	   ``But the game,'' he added, ``will become more competitive.''

Better trained, Hezbollah ups pressure on Israel in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Lebanon-Hezbollah's Future &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Across the war-scarred wadis of
southern Lebanon, Hezbollah was once notorious for sending waves of
zealous fighters in reckless, frontal assaults on Israeli army
positions.
	   Many were simply mowed down.
	   Today, Israeli soldiers patrolling the south face a far more
sophisticated opponent. Hezbollah's guerrillas are better trained
and better organized and have a far better chance of getting home
alive.
	   The militia's striking transformation stands as the driving
force behind a possible Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon,
which Israel has controlled either by itself or through proxies for
20 years as a way to protect its northern territory from guerrilla
attacks.
	   ``One thing that makes Hezbollah stand out is that they are good
students,'' said Timur Goksel, spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers in
Lebanon who has served in the south since 1979. ``They take their
lessons very carefully, and they learn from their mistakes.''
	   Hezbollah is thought to have anywhere from 300 to 1,000 trained
fighters, with many more armed supporters. Other than night-vision
equipment, much of their arsenal is low-tech: sniper rifles,
mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and Soviet-designed rockets.
	   Their intelligence has improved markedly, and supporters have
successfully infiltrated the demoralized South Lebanon Army, a
militia trained and equipped by Israel, security officials say.
	   As important is the group's ability to sustain losses. Sixty-six
guerrillas were killed last year, among them the 19-year-old son of
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader.
	   Just 39 Israeli soldiers were killed over the same period, but
the figure was higher than in past years and has led in part to the
war's growing unpopularity inside Israel.
	   Across Lebanon, volunteers collect money for the guerrillas, who
are known collectively as the Islamic resistance.
	   But the big money comes from Iran, which is believed to
contribute dlrs 10 million to dlrs 20 million a month to Hezbollah.
Twenty percent to 25 percent of that goes to fighting the war.

Bulls 96, Jazz 54
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The blowout was so complete it was historically
stunning.
	   The Utah Jazz broke the record for fewest points in an NBA game
since the inception of the shot clock as they were humbled 96-54 by
the Chicago Bulls on Sunday in Game 3 of the NBA Finals. The
wretched, sickly effort by the Jazz left them walking off the court
appearing to have their confidence completely shattered.
	   The Bulls had the highest margin of victory in NBA Finals
history and actually were doubled over laughing as the fourth
quarter was being played out.
	   Utah's 54 points broke the NBA record of 55 set earlier this
season by the Indiana Pacers and was 17 fewer than the Finals
record of 71 by Fort Wayne in 1955 and Boston in 1981.
	   The victory gave Chicago a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 series,
with Game 4 set for Wednesday night.
	   That will give the Jazz two full days to ponder their plight and
try to figure out how they could become so hideous so quickly.
	   And this time, they can't blame Karl Malone.
	   After shooting 14-for-41 over the first two games of the series,
Malone made his first six shots and finished 8-for-11 for 22
points.
	   But the rest of the team shot a combined 13-for-59, with Howard
Eisley (0-for-6), Bryon Russell, Greg Ostertag (1-for-7 each) and
Jacque Vaughn (0-for-6) among the biggest offenders.
	   The Jazz also gave a new meaning to the term sloppy, finding
every way imaginable to turn the ball over. Utah, which had 13
turnovers in Game 1 and 20 in Game 2, had 26 turnovers this time _
including seven by Malone and five by John Stockton _ which led to
22 Chicago points.
	   The Bulls got bigger-than-usual contributions from Ron Harper
and Scott Burrell and 24 points out of Michael Jordan. Toni Kukoc
added 16 points, Scottie Pippen and Burrell had 10 each and every
player on the team scored at least two.
	   It was so one-sided that Jordan amused himself during a
fourth-quarter timeout by clowning with courtside reporters and
watching the scoreboard video screen as fans did a limbo dance.
	   Yes, it was that much of a laugher.
	   Malone sat out the entire fourth, just like Jordan, and watched
Chicago go ahead by as many as 42 as the Bulls topped the old
record margin of 35 by the Washington Bullets against Seattle in
1978.
	   Chicago also surpassed its own team record of a 33-point margin
of victory in Game 1 of the 1992 Finals against Portland.
	   The Bulls broke this one open with a pair of first-half runs, a
12-0 spurt bridging the first and second quarters and a 12-2 run to
close the first half that gave Chicago a 49-31 halftime lead.
	   So complete was Utah's breakdown that the Jazz allowed the Bulls
to make two steals in the final six seconds of the second quarter.
	   Kukoc hit a corner jumper to make it 47-31, and Burrell swiped
the inbounds pass. He missed a jumper and the Jazz rebounded, but
Harper quickly stole the ball again and Burrell went to the free
throw line for two more points after Stockton committed a
loose-ball foul with 0.3 seconds left.
	   The lead reached 23 early in the third, 28 late in the third and
was at least 30 for most of the fourth.
	   With 2:21 left, Jud Buechler's second 3-pointer of the night
gave the Bulls a 40-point lead.
	   Malone hit Utah's first five shots and scored his team's first
10 points en route to shooting 6-for-6 for the quarter. But his
teammates combined to shoot 1-for-16 _ including 0-for-4s for
Russell, Ostertag and Jeff Hornacek _ and the Bulls closed the
quarter with a 8-0 run to lead 17-14 going into the second quarter.
	   Pippen scored the next two baskets to extend the run to 12-0,
and the Bulls would go ahead by a dozen points twice in the quarter
_ the second time at 41-29 on a fastbreak layup by Kukoc following
Malone's first miss _ an airball baby hook.
	   Utah's frustration started boiling over, from Malone vehemently
arguing on offensive foul that negated his seventh straight basket
to coach Jerry Sloan going ballistic as the referees called 14 of
the first 20 fouls on his team.
	   By the end, all the Jazz could do was sit quietly on the bench
and wallow in their misery as Chicago won its seventh straight home
game in the Finals and dropped Utah to 4-3 on the road in this
year's playoffs.
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  Phil Jackson coached his 149th playoff game, moving ahead
of Lenny Wilkens for third place on the career list. ... Ostertag
replaced Greg Foster in Utah's starting lineup. It was Ostertag's
first start since Feb. 10. ... Eddie Vedder of the band Pearl Jam
sang the national anthem. ... Harper yelled ``Rogaine'' at Malone
while he was shooting free throws in the second quarter, a
reference to the TV ad about the hair-restoration drug that
features Malone.

Japan's trade surplus soars tenfold in first 20 days of May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world jumped more
than tenfold in the first 20 days of May as a failing domestic
economy slashed demand for foreign products, the Finance Ministry
said Monday.
	   Japan's merchandise trade surplus _ the amount of goods the
country exports minus its imports _ soared to 360.9 billion yen
(dlrs 2.6 billion) from 34.9 billion yen (dlrs 250 million) during
the same period last year, the ministry said.
	   Imports dropped by 14.3 percent to 1.9 trillion yen (dlrs 13.6
billion) amid dwindling demand for raw materials like oil and wood.
The ministry said such sharp declines are unlikely to continue.
	   Exports remained a robust 2.3 trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion), up
0.3 percent, as strong overseas sales of cars and photographic film
offset a drop in demand for computer chips and electronics.
	   Measured on a monthly basis, Japan's surplus has risen for the
last 13 months, as a weakening yen made the country's exports
cheaper in key markets like the United States and a moribund
domestic economy eroded imports.
	   In the most recent monthly figure, Japan posted a 1.2 trillion
yen surplus in April.

In Jordan, the feared Mideast water shortage is already reality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic JORDAN WATER &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ In the arid Middle East, there is always
talk of a future water shortage. In Jordan, it's already happening.
	   Streams are drying up, and water levels across the desert Arab
kingdom are falling. A rationing system means citizens get water
from public supplies just two days a week.
	   For the government, the water shortage means constantly seeking
loans and grants to find ways to stretch the water there is. For
the public, the shortage is the source of daily conversation,
arguments and schemes to get more.
	   That Jordanians are used to the water shortage can be seen in
Ghalia Haddad's recollection of the water dribbling off in the
middle of her shower one day.
	   ``I dried my hair with a towel, put on my jeans, stopped at a
nearby supermarket and bought bottled water to continue my bath,''
said the 35-year-old architect.
	   The reason for the severity of the shortage is simple: Jordan
lacks the rivers of nearby Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt _ and it
doesn't have the money oil-rich Gulf countries use to pay for
desalination of sea water.
	   Not that other Middle Eastern states are not without water
problems. For example, Lebanon's broken down system means it can't
deliver water regularly even though it has plenty.
	   But Jordan is the only country rationing year round because of
shortages, meaning each household gets just 85 liters (22 gallons)
a day.
	   It's not much since the average Jordanian household is nine
people, and the water must be used for showers, toilet-flushing,
cooking, house-cleaning and drinking. It compares to the 250 liters
(65 gallons) available per household in Saudi Arabia and 300 liters
(78 gallons) in Israel.
	   With rain being Jordan's only assured renewable water source,
the government began pumping water from a handful of underground
aquifers across the country in 1989.
	   Now Jordan is using one billion cubic meters (35 billion cubic
feet) of water yearly, even though its renewable water resources
amount to only 650 million cubic meters (23 billion cubic feet).
	   Water scarcity is most evident during the long summer when it is
common to see neighbors arguing over accusations of water thefts
from rooftop tanks on houses.
	   During heat waves, there also are fights with private suppliers
who triple the usual price for 5,000 liters (1,300 gallons) of
water to 20 Jordanian dinars, or about dlrs 30 _ in a country where
the per capita annual income is 720 Jordanian dinars (dlrs 1,100).
	   ``It is sometimes impossible to persuade these devils to fill up
the (rooftop) bins even if you lure them with a tip,'' said Fadi
Badaro, a car wash clerk. ``It is a nightmare.''
	   Water looting is not confined to homes. Herdsmen are known to
have used submachine guns to pierce water pipes to quench the
thirst of their cattle. And some Jordanians hook up their homes to
the state's network without obtaining a permit.
	   ``It is difficult to pinpoint the source of the loss,'' said
Munther Haddadin, the water and irrigation minister, showing charts
that say 50 percent of pumped water is stolen or leaks from eroded
pipelines dating to the 1940s.
	   Elias Salameh, a water expert at the University of Jordan,
points to ``soft management'' as a contributing factor to water
scarcity.
	   Licenses for wells have been carelessly handed out to farmers.
For example, the number of wells near the shrinking oasis of Azraq,
where Lawrence of Arabia once lived in southeastern Jordan, have
risen from 50 in the 1970s to 800.
	   Farmers are resisting suggestions to change to crops that
require less water and can be planted in winter.
	   Consumption is soaring, and water is never cut off in wealthy
districts housing government officials and much is wasted on
swimming pools and irrigating public parks.
	   Lewis Lucke, director of Jordan programs for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said the problem can be eased ``not by
using less water, but by using water more efficiently.''
	   Germany, Japan and the United States have spent dlrs 500 million
on Jordanian water projects since 1990, but Haddadin, the water
minister, said it was barely enough to ``keep our nose above the
water.''
	   The 1994 peace treaty with Israel was touted as one solution to
the problem because it promised Jordan additional water, but that
will come from future projects.
	   One such proposal calls for construction of a dlrs 5 billion
canal linking the Red Sea with the Dead Sea, where desalination
plants would be linked with pipelines to Amman and Israel. But
Israel prefers a cheaper project linking its Mediterranean shore
with the Dead Sea.
	   Salameh, the water expert at the University of Jordan, is a
pessimist. He thinks the water shortage is incurable.
	   ``We will always be vulnerable and a series of drought years
will expose our water crisis,'' he said.

In new step for `Workers Paradise,' China tries social security

	   TAIYUAN, China (AP) _ Communist welfare helped drive Shanxi
Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory into bankruptcy.
Capitalist-style social security helped dig it out.
	   Located in China's rusting heartland of heavy industry, Shanxi
Textile had the typical ailments of state industries: bad
management, glutted markets and swarms of workers _ 10,000 strong
in this case, all guaranteed lifetime jobs and benefits.
	   ``Our burdens were too heavy. From birth to death we were
responsible for their nursery school, primary school, middle
school, then on to work and retirement. It was too much,'' said
Wang Yuhao, one of the factory's senior managers.
	   So when Shanxi Textile went bankrupt, the Taiyuan city
government tapped new social welfare funds to provide for old and
unwanted employees, making the factory more attractive to
investors.
	   China is dismantling the employer-based socialist welfare state
that was once the hallmark of the communists' ``workers paradise''
but left state industries uncompetitive. In its place, a new
government-administered social welfare system is being constructed,
more Western in style and decidedly bare bones.
	   Old-age pensions and formerly free health care are being
retooled and once unneeded unemployment insurance being invented.
It's the social spending side of what has been dubbed China's ``New
Deal'' _ a public works program to invigorate a slowing economy and
find jobs for millions of laid-off workers as decrepit state
industries cope with free-market reforms.
	   ``If we want labor mobility, we must have a social security
system,'' said Gu Shengzu, vice mayor of Wuhan, another ailing,
aging industrial city in central China.
	   A new social security system is crucial to preventing unrest as
the ruling Communist Party purges the economy of the last traces of
central planning and, in the process, breaks its promise of
lifetime job security for urban workers.
	   Questions persist whether the government can build a social
safety net fast enough to handle the swelling unemployed or even
come up with the money to build it. But China's new pragmatic
premier, Zhu Rongji, has partly staked his reformist mandate on the
program's success.
	   A new Ministry of Labor and Social Security has been set up as
part of Zhu's sweeping government restructuring. Provinces have
been ordered to unify by year's end the patchwork of unemployment,
pension and health funds now run, often badly, by local
governments.
	   The need for a social safety net is desperately evident in
Taiyuan, the grimy capital of China's coal country in Shanxi
province 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Beijing.
	   Local officials and state business executives freely admit many
factories have not paid their workers in a year. At mammoth Taiyuan
Iron and Steel, with 60,000 active and retired workers on its
payrolls, most production lines operate only when the rare order
comes in.
	   Although idled workers are legion, outright unemployment is
sparse because many state factories still remain responsible for
providing stipends and subsidized housing for laid-off employees.
	   ``Because there's no social security system in China,
unemployment has become this extraordinarily big deal,'' said Zhang
Jidong, general manager of Taiyuan Copper Industry Corp., a
state-run smelter burdened with more than 4,000 workers.
	   Zhang laid off 500 last year, mainly by leasing them the
restaurants, shops and other sideline businesses his company was
running to provide employees with subsidized daily comforts. He
kept several chicken and duck farms to pay pensions for 600
retirees. If allowed, he would fire 2,000 more workers.
	   Taiyuan is trying to meet the demands of reform. An unemployment
insurance program, started in 1994, now covers more than 3,700
enterprises. Firms pay 1 percent of their payrolls and an
additional 0.5 percent is taken from each worker's wages.
	   If laid off, workers can draw 75 percent of their pay _ with a
monthly minimum of 175 yuan (dlrs 21) _ for two years. Instead of
lifetime job security, unemployed residents of Taiyuan are now
guaranteed 120 yuan (dlrs 15) a month in welfare payments
indefinitely if they cannot find work.
	   When Shanxi Textile was allowed to declare bankruptcy in late
1996 _ then also a rare move for a state company _ the city used
its unemployment fund to provide 5.3 million yuan (dlrs 640,000) to
encourage some workers to take early retirement and to pay for
unemployment benefits and job training for others.
	   About 4,000 younger able-bodied workers were invited to stay on
with the factory, which was reorganized with the help of two new
investors as Xinkai Textile Printing and Dyeing Co. Ltd.
	   ``Now, the new company just deals with production,'' said Wang,
the former manager at the old mill who now is a director at the
revived factory.
	   For social security to succeed nationwide, the government must
force the booming private sector, not just unhealthy state firms,
to take part. In Taiyuan, payroll taxes for unemployment, health
insurance and pensions account for nearly a third of employer
expenses, said the city labor bureau's director, Zhao Qingsheng.
	   Beijing and provincial capitals may find it hard to wrest
control of funds from local governments. Although social welfare
funds are supposed to be invested solely in low-risk treasury
bonds, local governments have diverted money to build airports,
roads and drinking water systems and, in Taiyuan, buy cars.
	   With money in short supply, weak businesses and a relatively
poor working class, China plans to keep its social security system
no-frills.
	   ``We can't make the payments too high like in some developed
countries or nobody would want to work. That's no good,'' Zhao
said.

Dollar tops 140 yen in Tokyo, stocks down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, bond and currency prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar broke through the 140-yen level for
the first time in seven years and showed no signs of slowing in
morning trading in Tokyo on Monday. Japanese stock prices slipped.
	   The dollar bought 140.69 yen at midday, up 1.27 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo and its highest point since June 20, 1991. In New
York, the dollar settled at 139.75 yen on Friday.
	   The dollar crossed the 140-yen line for the first time in thin
weekend trading Sunday in New York.
	   The dollar's strength sprang from fresh evidence of a robust
U.S. economy after the Labor Department reported on Friday the
nation's unemployment rate held to a 28-year-low of 4.3 percent in
May.
	   Also supporting the U.S. currency was the diminishing likelihood
the Group of Seven industrialized nations will make a strong
statement criticizing the current dollar level, traders said.
	   Officials from the G-7 _ the United States, Japan, Germany,
Italy, Canada, Britain and France _ are scheduled to meet in Paris
on Tuesday.
	   Persistent pessimism over Japan's economy also continued to
weigh on sentiment among many investors, who have sold yen to shift
money into more robust markets in the United States and Europe.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
edged down 26.03 points, or 0.17 percent, to 15,297.40 at the close
of the morning session. On Friday, the average lost 103.04 points,
or 0.67 percent.
	   The benchmark average started lower on small-lot selling as the
yen's weakening discouraged some investors about the outlook for
Japan's economy.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 3.43 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,198.51. The
TOPIX closed down 5.56 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond was unchanged at 1.165 percent. Its price fell
slightly to 112.30 yen from 112.31 yen on Friday.

China's jobless city dwellers head for the countryside

<TEXT>
	   EIGHT MOUTHS VILLAGE, China (AP) _ In the heyday of China's
embrace of radical communism, millions of young urban Chinese were
sent to the countryside _ a sentence to years of drudgery, hunger
and loneliness.
	   Most eventually escaped back to the cities. But in a telling
sign of China's progress toward capitalism, some who escaped are
trickling back to the farms, this time in search of economic
opportunity.
	   Yu Yuzhu joined China's burgeoning ranks of jobless city workers
three years ago. Now the 40-year-old former school teacher views
that setback as a turning point.
	   ``Losing my job could have been a bad thing but, in fact, it was
my chance,'' Yu says as she feeds corn, barley and beans to pairs
of plump white pigeons at the Eight Mouths Pigeon Farm near
Beijing.
	   A testament to her land's past use as a communal pig farm,
fading white characters painted on the walls of Yu's farm proclaim:
``Only socialism can save China.''
	   These days, however, Beijing's government is encouraging
residents to follow the example set by Yu and other entrepreneurs
in putting unfarmed land in the countryside to profitable use.
	   Some transplants are growing fruit trees or medicinal herbs or
raising horses, pigs or ducks on marginal land rented from
villages, officials say. The city also has rented out farm plots
and greenhouses in Shunyi county, north of the city, to grow
lucrative vegetable crops.
	   Many now turning to farming are among those who were forced to
live and labor with peasants during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, when at then leader Mao Tse-tung's urging, the nation's
politics swung toward a utopian vision of communism.
	   According to the state-run Beijing Youth Daily, the kind of
intensive, high-tech farming promoted in Shunyi can earn up to
240,000 yuan (dlrs 29,000) an acre (600,000 yuan or dlrs 72,640 a
hectare) _ a far cry from the miserable rations of sweet potatoes
and corn buns the ``rusticated youth'' lived on while toiling in
impoverished villages during the Cultural Revolution.
	   It is a signal of the desperation spreading through China's
cities that urban residents are looking for work in the
countryside. But despite the official campaign, it is an unlikely
option for most people, given the scarcity of usable farmland and
the tens of millions of hungry farmers migrating to the cities in
search of a living wage.
	   In China, only truly barren land is left unfarmed. And most
urbanites are loath to dirty their hands anyway.
	   ``Unfortunately, most Beijingers are too proud to work in the
countryside,'' says Duan Jianling, a city official. ``People should
be more open-minded.''
	   Yu was among the last students sent to the countryside, in
1977-78. Like many of her generation, she wanted to stay in school,
but politics intervened and she went to live in the mountains south
of Beijing when she was 20.
	   ``We were there to be taught. It was a completely passive
experience,'' Yu says. ``Now we are our own masters and I am the
one taking the initiative.''
	   After losing her job as a teacher, Yu helped a friend start a
nursery school. When that venture flopped, she turned to raising
pigeons for food.
	   Yu started her business in the courtyard of her mother-in-law's
village home, with her brother-in-law's help. They soon expanded
and moved to the former pig farm.
	   Raising pigeons can be a tricky business because the birds are
vulnerable to illness. While the birds don't mind northern China's
bitter winter cold, Yu's eight employees stay busy protecting them
from heatstroke during the sultry summer months.
	   Timing is crucial. Pigeons should be eaten when they are between
25 and 28 days old or they get to be too tough, Yu says.
	   Yu says she sells about 2,000 pigeons a month, but her success
worries her.
	   A popular dish in some parts of southern China, roasted pigeon
is relatively expensive and is not commonly eaten by northern
Chinese except as a health-boosting delicacy.
	   ``If we want to continue to breed so many pigeons, we have to
persuade northern Chinese to eat more,'' Yu says. ``You have to
always keep thinking of the next step ahead.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Yin Guoqiang hasn't had a job in more than 10
years and, with factories firing workers all around, doesn't expect
one soon.
	   But he's not worried _ his feathered friends support him.
	   Yin, a former machine repairman, raises birds for a living. He's
one of a growing number of Beijing residents for whom parakeets,
parrots and other birds have become a vital source of income in
troubled times.
	   Keeping pet birds is an ancient Chinese tradition that for many
remains just a hobby. But for others, bird raising is big business,
so big that speculative fever has sent bird prices yo-yoing.
	   Capitalism's intrusion into the tranquil world of bird raising
owes much to unemployment. As overmanned state factories lay off
workers, good jobs are hard to find. The unemployed are improvising
to make ends meet.
	   Many go into business for themselves. Sidewalks and alleys are
filled with people peddling snacks, knickknacks and the like.
	   Others, like 40-year-old Yin, go to the Jade Dragonfly Bridge
market to wheel and deal in pet birds. The market is setting up new
stalls to accommodate the swelling ranks of bird raisers.
	   Small and easily transportable, birds are an ideal cottage
industry for China's capital, where space is limited and families
share small apartments. Some birds fetch as much as 20,000 yuan
(dlrs 2,440) a pair _ what the average Beijinger earns in about
three years.
	   Of Beijing's estimated 300,000 bird raisers, about two-thirds
are laid-off workers, and ``most have made bird rearing their one
and only economic support,'' the official Beijing Evening News
reported recently.
	   Yin, who deals from a flatbed tricycle, says even if he could
find a job, he probably wouldn't take it.
	   ``At least doing this, I'm the boss. I watch over the birds,''
he says. ``If I had a job, others would watch over me. They would
be the boss.''
	   Yin reaped a windfall last year when prices were pushed to a
peak by speculators. But when state-run news media warned a few
months ago that the market was overheating, prices plunged, Yin
says.
	   Today, Yin still earns enough from birds to live, but others
``lost a packet.''
	   ``They really wept,'' he adds. ``One day, they bought birds for
900 yuan (dlrs 108) a pair. A few days later, they were worth 100
yuan (dlrs 12).''

Aussie dollar slides towards record low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details in last graf on the Australian dollar's record
low &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian dollar continued its
plunge toward 12-year record lows Monday despite attempts by the
Reserve Bank of Australia to halt its slide.
	   ``The Australian dollar will remain under pressure until
something fundamental changes in Asia,'' Commonwealth Bank senior
manager foreign exchange Kurt Magnus said.
	   By late morning the local currency hit a near 12-year low of
59.77 U.S. cents, a level not seen since 1986.
	   The Australian dollar fell as low as 60 U.S. cents during
offshore trading on Friday night. It closed in Sydney at 60.51 U.S.
cents.
	   Dealers said the central bank intervened in the market as
recently as Monday morning to attempt to prop up the ailing
currency by buying Aussie dollars.
	   ``We've got it on good authority that the RBA's been in to
smooth and test the currency and take some heat out of the
market,'' Macquarie Bank foreign exchange associate director Brent
Aggar said.
	   The RBA has already spent about U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion (3 billion
Australian dollars) in a largely futile attempt to prop up the
currency.
	   The Australian dollar's record low of 57.10 US cents was struck
in July 1986 after then-Treasurer Paul Keating's infamous comments
that the Australian economy was nearly that of a ``banana
republic.''

 &UR; Newspaper editor loyal to Cambodian leader Hun Sen shot

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The publisher-editor of the
country's most widely-read newspaper _ which supports Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen _ was shot by an unidentified gunman Monday, his
wife said.
	   At least two of six bullets fired struck Thong Uy Pang, 55,
while he was sitting on his motorcycle about 8:05 a.m. outside a
pagoda, Yim Phanny said from the capital's Calmette Hospital. Her
husband was being treated and his condition was unclear.
	   There was no immediate known motive for the shooting. Thong Uy
Phang's hard-hitting Koh Santepheap (Island of Peace) backs Hun
Sen, who has often been accused of orchestrating attacks on
journalists supporting his opponents.
	   Hun Sen is engaged in an election campaign seeking to restore
international legitimacy and aid lost since his bloody coup last
year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The opposition has complained of being denied access to the
broadcast media, controlled entirely by Hun Sen.

Galaxy 5, Revolution 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, Califlornia (AP) _ Ezra Hendrickson scored twice as
the Los Angeles Galaxy defeated the New England Revolution 5-1
Sunday in Major League Soccer play.
	   Welton, Greg Vanney and Mauricio Cienfuegos also scored for the
Galaxy (12-2) and Carlos Hermosillo had two assists in his MLS
debut.
	   Johnny Torres scored in the opening minute for New England
(4-8), which lost its fifth straight. The Revolution played the
last 63 minutes shorthanded after defender Manny Motajo was ejected
for a second yellow card.
	   Welton tied the score in the 38th minute with a league-leading
12 goals. Revolution goalkeeper Ian Feuer managed to get his right
hand on Vanney's powerful 30-yard shot, but Welton beat midfielder
Ted Chronopoulos and Feuer to the rebound, tapping a shot inside
the 6-yard (5.5-meter) line into the open goal.
	   Welton assisted on Cienfuegos' goals for a league-leading point
total of 33.
	   Hermosillo set up the tiebreaking goal in the 59th minute,
heading Welton's pass back to Cienfuegos, who shot from just inside
the penalty area.
	   Hendrickson scored in the 65th and 72nd minutes. Hermosillo, who
was assigned to the Galaxy Saturday, also assisted on Vanney's
68th-minute goal.
	   Los Angeles out-shot New England 25-8 and led 8-3 in shots on
goals. Feuer made three saves, while Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman made two.
	   Motajo, who played with the Galaxy during its inaugural 1996
season and was playing his first match for New England, tripped
Wellington Sanchez and Cienfuegos in the same sequence. He had also
received a yellow card in the 20th minute for a tackle from behind.
Under MLS rules, Motajo will be suspended for the Revolution's next
match, Sunday against Chicago.
 &UR; Burn 5, United 4, SO
	   In Washington, Ted Eck atoned for an own goal by scoring the
shootout clincher Sunday and the Dallas Burn beat D.C. United 5-4,
their first loss at home this season.
	   The upset came just three days after Dallas (8-5) took the worst
defeat in MLS history, 8-1 to the Los Angeles Galaxy.
	   United (12-4) came into the game with an 8-0 mark at RFK
Stadium, but the Burn outscored D.C. 3-1 in the shootout.
	   Dallas had taken a 4-3 lead late in regulation when Mickey
Trotman tapped in a rebound of a shot by Brian Haynes. Moments
later, United knotted the score when a pass by A.J. Wood deflected
off the head of Burn defenseman Tom Soehn and past his own
goalkeeper Mark Dodd, forcing the shootout.
	   Richard Farrer and Temoc Suarez, who each scored their first
goal of the season in the first half, joined Eck in scoring in the
shootout for the Burn.
	   Brian Kamler scored the only United goal in the shootout. Dodd,
who had seven saves in the game, had saves against Jaime Moreno and
Tony Sanneh in the shootout.
	   Dallas' other goal was on a penalty kick by Damian in the second
half.
	   Roy Lassiter scored twice for United and Marco Etheverry added a
goal.
	   Lassiter's second goal, his eighth in nine games with United,
tied the game 3-3 in the 70th minute.
	   The eight goals scored in regulation were an MLS record for RFK
Stadium. The four goals were a season-high by Dallas.
	   Dallas played without midfielder Leonel Alvarez, who was
suspended after being ejected during the loss to Los Angeles. D.C.
United was without defenders Eddie Pope and Jeff Agoos, who are
playing in the World Cup.
	   Every MLS team except Dallas will be missing players the next
several weeks because of the World Cup the next several weeks. In
all, 21 MLS players are in France for the tournament, including 16
on the U.S. team. Columbus will miss five players, a league high.
 &UR; MetroStars 2, Fusion 1
	   In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Miles Joseph's goal in the 88th
minute off an assist from Eduardo Hurtado gave the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars a 2-1 victory Sunday, sending the Miami Fusion to
their fifth consecutive loss.
	   The game was played in 97-degree heat before 9,073 fans at
Lockhart Stadium. The MetroStars improved to 7-6 and kept their
hold on third place in the MLS East with 19 points. The Fusion, who
outshot the MetroStars 28-11, dropped to 5-9 with 11 points.
	   Joseph, who came on as a second-half sub, took a perfectly
played through ball from Hurtado and beat Miami goalkeeper Scott
Budnick with a left-footed shot to the far post. The Fusion have
given up a league-high nine goals in the final 10 minutes this
season.
	   New York-New Jersey led 1-0 at halftime on Giovanni Savarese's
goal in the 36th minute. Savarese pounced on a loose ball and shot
into an open net after Budnick mishandled a pass intended for
MetroStars midfielder Diego Sonora. The goal was Savarese's fifth
this season.
	   Miami's Diego Serna equalized in the 63rd minute when he took a
short pass from Dan Stebbins and beat goalie Tony Meola from close
range. The goal marked the first time season the Fusion have tied a
game after allowing the opening goal.
	   Meola was outstanding down the stretch as Miami pressured a
worn-out MetroStars defense. He punched a header by Roger Thomas
over the bar in the 80th minute and stopped David Vaudeuil from
eight yards just five minutes later.
	   After Joseph's goal, Meola made clutch saves on Miami's Pablo
Mastroeni and Cle Kooiman to preserve the win.

Three Japanese banks to close operations in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three large Japanese banks will shut down their
branches in Paris to cut costs and consolidate operations elsewhere
in Europe, bank officials and media said Monday.
	   Sanwa Bank Ltd., Japan's third-largest private lender, will
close its Paris office within the year and move the operations to
London, said spokesman Haruhiko Kimura.
	   With the creation of a single European currency, the bank will
be able to streamline management by concentrating its European
lending business in a single office, Kimura said.
	   ``We see London as more of an international financial center,''
Kimura said.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
Ltd. will also close their branches in the French capital within
three years, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported Monday.
	   A smaller bank, Yasuda Trust &AMP; Banking Co., also plans to shut
down all European branchs except its Luxembourg office, the paper
said.
	   Burdened by 76 trillion yen (dlrs 550 billion) in bad loans from
the collapse of Japan's property market in the early 1990s,
Japanese banks have been forced to cut back at home and abroad.

Prince Charles calls for public debate on genetically engineered
</HEADLINE>
food &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles, a longtime environmental
campaigner and organic farmer, called Monday for a public debate on
the merits of allowing genetically engineered food to be grown in
Britain, saying such alteration ``takes mankind into realms that
belong to God, and to God alone.''
	   Writing in The Daily Telegraph two days after U.S. biotechnology
giant Monsanto Co. launched a multimillion dollar advertising
campaign to convince Europeans of the safety of genetically
engineered crops, the prince said genetic modification, designed to
make crops pest-resistant or stay fresh longer, raised ``crucial
ethical and practical considerations.''
	   ``Apart from certain highly beneficial and specific medical
applications, do we have the right to experiment with, and
commercialize, the building blocks of life?'' he asked.
	   ``Obviously, we all have to make up our own minds about these
important issues,'' he said. ``I personally have no wish to eat
anything produced by genetic manipulation, nor do I knowingly offer
this sort of produce to my family or guests.''
	   The prince said choice backed by comprehensive labeling was
needed.
	   The question of genetically modified foods is controversial in
Europe. They enter the country in staples from U.S. and South
American farmers, who are moving steadily to modified soybeans and
corn and have no mechanisms to separate them from nonmodified
varieties for export.
	   The technique is not allowed to be used on farms in Britain, but
some companies are now seeking government approval to grow a
handful of genetically modified crops.
	   Part of Europe's cautious attitude has to do with European
attentiveness to food and its sources. There is also a perception
that European governments and scientists failed to protect people
from mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
	   The EU banned all British beef exports on March 27, 1996, in
response to a possible link between BSE and the deadly human brain
ailment Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
	   ``The lesson of BSE and other entirely man-made disasters in the
cause of 'cheap food' is surely that it is the unforeseen
consequences which present the greatest cause for concern,'' the
prince wrote. ``We simply do not know the long-term consequences
for human health and the wider environment of releasing plants bred
in this way.''

Philippines eyes electricity from ocean currents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government has
received an offer from Italy to help it harness the sea as an
inexpensive source of electrical power.
	   This was disclosed over the weekend by trade secretary Cesar
Bautista, who said the offer came from the University of Naples.
	   The offer has received an endorsement from the European Union,
which has promised the Philippines a dlrs 500,000 grant to finance
a feasibility study for the proposed project, he said.
	   The proposal calls for the construction and operation of power
generators that will run on turbines driven by sea currents. The
concept is ideal for the Philippines, an archipelago composed of
thousands of islands _ and plenty of water.
	   ``The idea here is to use the water velocity to generate
electricity,'' said Bautista, adding that the turbines are
practically ``maintenance-free'' and thus inexpensive to operate.
	   Bautista, however, didn't disclose the cost of putting up such a
facility.
	   He said such plants would be ideal for providing electricity to
villages located near water with a strong enough current to run the
turbines. The University of Naples has identified eight such sites,
he said.
	   Bautista said similar projects are currently operating in the
Mediterranean, the Atlantic, South America and China, but this
would be the first in Southeast Asia.

Bank chairman warns of Singapore recession unless government acts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The chairman of one of Singapore's biggest
banks warned of a recession if the government does not take action
now to stimulate the economy, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Wee Cho Yaw, chairman of United Overseas Bank, told The Straits
Times that the current economic situation in the small island
republic was the worst he had seen in his 40-year banking career.
	   The Singapore government has stood staunchly by earlier
predictions that the economy would grow at least 2.5 percent this
year.
	   But the forecast was made before the economic turmoil in
neighboring Indonesia worsened and other regional economies began
to exhibit signs of a slowdown into zero growth or outright
recession.
	   At least two private investment houses have already predicted
that the Singapore economy will fall into recession this year,
though a recent newspaper survey of 15 analysts and economists
showed an average forecast of 1.5 percent growth.
	   Finance Minister Richard Hu defended the government forecasts in
Parliament last week, though he conceded that the authorities stood
ready to implement a stimulus package soon if new figures indicate
a likely recession.
	   In his interview with The Straits Times, bank chairman Wee said
Asia's financial crisis far exceeds the last major economic
challenge Singapore faced, a recession in 1985.
	   He said the government forecast was unlikely to be achieved and
urged immediate action.
	   ``If there is no growth, or a mere 1 percent growth, then the
government will have to inject more funds into the system,'' Wee
was quoted as saying.
	   These could include tax cuts and more spending on
infrastructure, he said.

Maddux leads Braves to 9-0 victory over Orioles; Cubs beat White
</HEADLINE>
Sox &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Greg Maddux accomplished a rarity, and he made
it look incredibly easy.
	   The Baltimore Orioles had gone a major-league best 128 games
without being blanked before Sunday, when Maddux pitched a
four-hitter to lead the Atlanta Braves to a 9-0 victory.
	   Andres Galarraga homered twice and Andruw Jones also connected
as the Braves won the series 2-1 to avenge the three-game
interleague sweep the Orioles registered in Atlanta last season.
	   Maddux (9-2) struck out four and walked one in becoming the NL's
first nine-game winner.
	   Orioles starter Doug Drabek (5-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Yankees 4, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In New York, David Cone, who missed his last start when he was
bitten on the hand by his mother's dog, pitched a two-hitter and
struck out a season-high 14 as the Yankees handed Florida its 11th
straight loss.
	   Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams all hit solo
homers off rookie Ryan Dempster (0-2) as the Yankees have won seven
in a row and 43 of 52.
	   Cone (8-1) allowed only a third-inning single to Gregg Zaun and
an RBI double to Todd Dunwoody in the eighth. He walked two, hit a
batter and is 8-0 with a 3.30 ERA in his last nine starts.
	   Cone missed his last start when he was nipped on the inside of
his right index finger by his mother's Jack Russell terrier.
 &UR; Padres 17, Rangers 8 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, Steve Finley matched his career-high with
five RBIs and San Diego scored 11 runs over the final two innings
against the Rangers' bullpen.
	   Finley went 4-for-5 with three doubles for the Padres, who
scored six runs in the eighth and five more in the ninth to blow it
open. Greg Vaughn homered and drove in four runs for San Diego.
	   With the score tied 6-6 in the eighth, Texas reliever Danny
Patterson (1-2) walked in two runs after loading the bases.
	   Dan Miceli (5-2) pitched 1 2-3 innings of hitless relief for the
Padres, who had lost four of their previous five.
 &UR; Cubs 13, White Sox 7 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa and Jose Hernandez each hit three-run
homers and had five RBIs as the Cubs won their ninth straight.
	   It was the third consecutive three-game series sweep for the
Cubs, who are on their longest win streak of the decade.
	   Sosa has homered in his last four games. His fifth-inning shot
was his 19th of the season and 10th in nine games.
	   Jeremi Gonzalez (5-5) gave up four runs and six hits, walking
five and striking out four in 6 1-3 innings.
	   Mike Sirotka (6-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Indians 6, Reds 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Dave Burba got revenge on the Reds by hitting a
two-run homer _ the first by a Cleveland pitcher in 26 years.
	   Burba (8-4) made a triumphant return to the stadium where he was
supposed to be the opening day starter, only to get traded to the
Indians on the eve of the opener.
	   He put the Indians ahead to stay by hitting his third career
homer in the fifth inning off Scott Klingenbeck (0-1).
	   Burba won his fifth consecutive start by allowing eight hits,
including Dmitri Young's RBI single, over 6 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Twins 3, Pirates 2 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Matt Lawton's go-ahead pinch-hit single in the
seventh inning ended the seven-game winning streaks of both Jason
Schmidt and the Pirates.
	   The Pirates, trying to extend their longest winning streak since
an 11-game run in September 1996, led 2-1 until Brent Gates'
run-scoring single in the sixth and Lawton's RBI hit off Schmidt
(8-2).
	   Dan Serafini (2-0) won in his first relief appearance of the
season and Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 11th save.
 &UR; Blue Jays 3, Phillies 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Chris Carpenter got his first win since joining the
starting rotation and Carlos Delgado barreled over Philadelphia
catcher Mike Lieberthal to score the Blue Jays' go-ahead run.
	   Carpenter (2-2) gave up one run and eight hits in 7 2-3 innings
in his third start since being promoted from the bullpen.
	   Randy Myers loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth before
getting Doug Glanville to fly to center for his 15th save.
	   Curt Schilling (5-7) lost his fourth straight decision.
 &UR; Devil Rays 4, Expos 3, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Mike Kelly scored from first when
Montreal threw the ball all over Tropicana Field in the bottom of
the 11th inning.
	   After drawing a one-out walk from Steve Kline (1-3), Kelly broke
for second when Dave Martinez hit a slow hopper to third baseman
Shane Andrews. Andrews' throw got Martinez at first, but Kelly
never stopped on the play and headed toward third base.
	   With third uncovered, catcher Chris Widger hustled down the line
to take first baseman Ryan McGuire's return throw. Kelly was safe
at third when the ball got away from Widger, and he broke for home.
	   Left fielder Robert Perez finally tracked down the ball but his
throw to Kline, covering the plate, was late.
	   Albie Lopez (2-1) struck out four in two perfect innings as the
Devil Rays ended a five-game losing streak.
 &UR; Tigers 4, Brewers 1 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Justin Thompson pitched a career-best three-hitter
and Bobby Higginson and Tony Clark homered to lead Detroit.
	   Thompson (4-6) didn't allow the Brewers a hit until the fifth
when they scored an unearned run. Thompson struck out six and
walked three in his second complete game this season.
	   Thompson gave up an RBI single to Darrin Jackson in the fifth
and singles to Mike Matheny in the seventh and Jeff Cirillo in the
eighth.
	   Steve Woodard (3-4) took the loss.
 &UR; Astros 7, Royals 1 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Shane Reynolds pitched an eight-hitter and Jeff
Bagwell had three extra-base hits for the Astros.
	   Reynolds (7-3) won his fourth consecutive start by pitching his
third complete game. He struck out nine and did not walk a batter.
	   Bagwell doubled twice and homered off Jim Pittsley (0-1), and
Derek Bell added a double and a homer.

Suharto turns 77, lonely and upset over corruption allegations:
</HEADLINE>
newspaper

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's former president had his
77th birthday Monday, reportedly lonely and upset over allegations
that he and his family amassed billions of dollars illegally.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted a Suharto aide as saying few of his old
friends and associates have visited him at his home in central
Jakarta since he quit office last month.
	   Military personnel guard the house but not longer salute him,
said the aide who has worked for Suharto since the 1970s.
	   Only a pet parrot, long ago trained to say ``Good Morning Bapak
(Mister) President,'' still calls him by his former title, the Post
said.
	   On the rare occasions that he leaves his house, his car must
stop at red lights, whereas before his presidential limousine sped
through the streets of Jakarta under police escort.
	   Forced to quit after mobs went on a rampage and angry protesters
demanded he be tried for corruption, Suharto has said nothing
publicly since his May 21 resignation.
	   Critics say he and his family amassed between dlrs 20 to 40
billion in assets during his 32 years in power.
	   Many want the state to seize the money and use it to help
Indonesia overcome its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment have soared, making life a miserable
for many of the nation's 202 million people.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has said that an inquiry will be held
into corruption under Suharto's rule. However, he has called on
Indonesians not to seek unlawful retribution.
	   Habibie, a longtime friend and formerly the loyal deputy of
Suharto, has rolled back many of his old boss's draconian ways. He
has released some political prisoners, promised elections in 1999,
ended a ban on free labor unions and dropped restrictions on media
freedom.
	   He has also said that he hasn't talked to the aging former
autocrat since he was sworn in as the new head of state.
	   The Post said Suharto spends most of his time at home reading
newspapers, which daily run accusations of corruption and nepotism
during his time in office. He also watches television and spends
time with his grandchildren.
	   Presidential security guards still stand watch over his home.
But their numbers are gradually being reduced.
	   ``As he is no longer president, they do not give him a military
salute,'' the Post quoted an unidentified aide as saying.
	   Few people still come to see Suharto because ties to the former
president are now seen as a liability in post-Suharto Indonesia,
the aide was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The publisher-editor of the
country's most widely-read newspaper _ which supports Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen _ was shot by an unidentified gunman Monday.
	   At least two of six bullets fired struck Thong Uy Pang, 55, in
the shoulder while he was standing outside a pagoda about 8:05
a.m., his wife and police said. His bodyguards returned fire. One
was hit and so was the gunman, who still managed to flee, witnesses
said.
	   Thong Uy Phang was undergoing surgery at the capital's Calmette
Hospital. Yet Razaque, a deputy municipal police commissioner, said
the shooting was being investigated. There was no immediate known
motive.
	   Thong Uy Phang's hard-hitting Koh Santepheap (Island of Peace)
backs Hun Sen, who has often been accused of orchestrating attacks
on journalists supporting his opponents.
	   Hun Sen is engaged in an election campaign seeking to restore
international legitimacy and aid lost since his bloody coup last
year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The opposition has complained of being denied access to the
broadcast media, controlled entirely by Hun Sen, and of violence
and intimidation of opposition supporters.

Bulls 96, Jazz 54
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The blowout was so thorough and lopsided it made
history.
	   The Utah Jazz broke the record for fewest points in a game since
the inception of the shot clock as they were humbled 96-54 Sunday
by the Chicago Bulls in Game 3 of the NBA Finals.
	   ``It's an awesome score to look at. It's overwhelming in that
respect,'' Bulls coach Phil Jackson said.
	   It was a wretched, sickly effort that shattered plenty of
records. No one had ever lost by this many points (42) in the
Finals, no one had ever made so few field goals (21) and no one had
ever scored so few points in a second half (23).
	   But the one number that stood out was the 54 points. Over
thousands and thousands of games, no NBA team had ever scored so
few.
	   ``Damn, that's all I can say. Wow,'' said Greg Foster of the
Jazz. ``We played scared and overanxious.''
	   ``It had to happen sometime to someone. It's too bad it happened
to us,'' Greg Ostertag said.
	   Utah's 54 points broke the NBA record of 55 set earlier this
season by the Indiana Pacers and was 17 fewer than the Finals
record of 71 by Syracuse in 1955 and Houston in 1981.
	   The Jazz scored only 14 points in the first and third quarters,
17 in the second and nine in the fourth. It was so bad that the
Bulls were actually doubled over laughing as the fourth quarter
wound down.
	   ``Everybody had a good time out there,'' Michael Jordan said.
``We came out and played hard. We put the effort and intensity in
and as a result we could relax a little in the fourth quarter.''
	   The victory gave Chicago a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 series,
with Game 4 set for Wednesday night.
	   That will give the Jazz two full off days to ponder their plight
and try to figure out how they could become so hideous so quickly.
	   And this time, they can't blame Karl Malone.
	   After shooting 14-for-41 over the first two games of the series,
Malone made his first six shots and finished 8-for-11 for 22
points.
	   But the rest of the team shot a combined 13-for-59, with Howard
Eisley (0-for-6), Bryon Russell, Greg Ostertag (1-for-7 each) and
Jacque Vaughn (0-for-6) among the biggest offenders.
	   ``We just didn't come ready to play,'' Malone said. ``We just
got an old fashioned butt-kicking. If this one don't wake us up,
nothing will.''
	   The Jazz also gave a new meaning to the term sloppy, finding
every way imaginable to turn the ball over. Utah, which had 13
turnovers in Game 1 and 20 in Game 2, had 26 turnovers this time _
including seven by Malone and five by John Stockton _ which led to
22 Chicago points.
	   ``I'm somewhat embarrassed for NBA basketball, for our guys to
come out and have no fight at all,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said.
``They got all the loose balls and all the rebounds.''
	   The Bulls got bigger-than-usual contributions from Ron Harper
and Scott Burrell and 24 points out of Jordan. Toni Kukoc added 16
points, Scottie Pippen and Burrell had 10 each and every player on
the team scored at least two.
	   It was so one-sided that Jordan amused himself during a
fourth-quarter timeout by clowning with courtside reporters and
watching the scoreboard video screen as fans did a limbo dance.
	   Malone sat out the entire fourth, just like Jordan, and watched
Chicago go ahead by as many as 42 as the Bulls topped the old
record margin of 35 by the Washington Bullets against Seattle in
1978.
	   Chicago also surpassed its own team record of a 33-point margin
of victory, set in Game 1 of the 1992 Finals against Portland.
	   The Bulls broke this one open with a pair of first-half runs, a
12-0 spurt bridging the first and second quarters and a 12-2 run to
close the first half that gave Chicago a 49-31 halftime lead.
	   So complete was Utah's breakdown that the Jazz let the Bulls
make two steals in the final six seconds of the second quarter.
	   Kukoc hit a corner jumper to make it 47-31, and Burrell swiped
the inbounds pass. He missed a jumper and the Jazz rebounded, but
Harper quickly stole the ball again and Burrell went to the free
throw line for two more points after Stockton committed a
loose-ball foul with 0.3 seconds left.
	   The lead reached 23 early in the third, 28 late in the third and
was at least 30 for most of the fourth.
	   With 2:21 left, Jud Buechler's second 3-pointer of the night
gave the Bulls a 40-point lead.
	   Malone hit Utah's first five shots and scored his team's first
10 points en route to shooting 6-for-6 for the quarter. But his
teammates combined to shoot 1-for-16 _ including 0-for-4s for
Russell, Ostertag and Jeff Hornacek _ and the Bulls closed the
quarter with a 8-0 run to lead 17-14 going into the second quarter.
	   Pippen scored the next two baskets to extend the run to 12-0,
and the Bulls would go ahead by a dozen points twice in the quarter
_ the second time at 41-29 on a fastbreak layup by Kukoc following
Malone's first miss _ an airball baby hook.
	   Utah's frustration started boiling over, from Malone vehemently
arguing on offensive foul that negated his seventh straight basket
to Sloan going ballistic as the referees called 14 of the first 20
fouls on his team.
	   By the end, all the Jazz could do was sit quietly on the bench
and wallow in their misery as Chicago won its seventh straight home
game in the Finals and dropped Utah to 4-3 on the road in this
year's playoffs.
	   ``If we're not ready to play (Wednesday) after what went on out
there, we shouldn't be in this business,'' Malone said.
