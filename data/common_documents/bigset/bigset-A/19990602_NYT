CITIES SEEK END TO SPEEDING, TRAFFIC IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Not too long ago, residents who complained
about drivers speeding through their neighborhoods probably would
have seen a stop sign pop up or police stake out the street for a
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't happen so much anymore. It is not because city
officials stopped caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop signs get ignored,'' said Bonnie Johnson, planner for
Liberty. ``If drivers do slow down, they just speed up quickly
between the next stop sign and end up going faster.''
</P>
<P>
   And police enforcement only temporarily solves the problem.
After the police leave, speeds increase.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kansas City area, officials are looking into
other ways to make neighborhood traffic calmer. So you can expect
to see more speed humps, speed tables, chicanes, slow points and
even roundabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wallwork, president of Alternate Street Design in Orange
Park, Fla., said the increased interest in such devices stems from
a change of attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to build skinny streets and rely on a grid network
when it came to planning,'' Wallwork said. ``No one went too fast
and no one street carried a lot of traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the 1950s, the main focus in street design was how to
get people from Point A to Point B the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, streets became wider and straighter. Cities removed
obstructions. Trips became quicker and travel became easier.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to increases in traffic volumes and speeds, and
ultimately an increase in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not too happy with that,'' Wallwork said. ``They
have been crying out for such things as stop signs, traffic signals
and speed humps. But none of them are truly effective slowing
traffic down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now people are willing to forgo high-speed travel to improve the
quality of neighborhood life.
</P>
<P>
   Wallwork said traffic calming began in the early 1970s in
Australia and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is finding a balance between those who want to
speed and people who don't want them to speed in the
neighborhood,'' he said. ``That is often a big challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence, Mo., recently adopted new design standards in new
development.
</P>
<P>
   But because of budgetary constraints, Independence is limited on
what it can do for its older areas. If traffic speed is a problem,
the city first will try signs, including stop signs at
intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a cost-to-benefit ratio, it sure looks a lot better,''said
Rob Richardson, senior planner for the Independence.
</P>
<P>
   In older areas that have few curbs, gutters and storm water
drainage, Richardson said, the costs increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically have to redo the street, including acquiring
more right of way, which is not practical for a lot of cities,''
Richardson said. ``When it comes right down to it, a lot of
neighborhoods would probably have to be asked to participate in the
cost. A lot of times they determine it is not justified if they
have to put their own money into it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Jere Meredith, division engineer of Streets and
Traffic, said the city has a reactive program that is triggered
after neighborhood complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally we wait until a neighborhood group comes forward and
says it has a problem,'' he said. ``At that time we explain to them
what the possibilities are, including the benefits and drawbacks of
each device, and let them decide if we should pursue the measure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it is up to the neighborhood to convince its residents
that something should be done. The city, however, does not consider
stop signs an effective measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been pressured into putting in stop signs for speed
control before,'' he said. ``When we do that, we do
before-and-after studies and invariably the speeds go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all traffic calming projects receive the public's
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Olathe, Kan., officials installed chicanes _ bulges of
the curb into the street that force drivers to slow _ but removed
them two weeks later after 45 persons complained.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Linan, traffic engineer for Olathe, said the city failed
to convince residents that stop signs don't really control speeds
and volume.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those problems, Olathe has adopted guidelines for
using speed humps. Neighborhoods now are required to appoint a
representative to request the city to take action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the city will do speed studies, traffic counts
and accident reviews. If a problem is found, residents must submit
a petition showing at least 80 percent approval for speed humps.
The only exception is in extreme conditions. In that case, the city
will install speed humps without approval of the residents.
</P>
<P>
   Linan said that some people might blame poor design for traffic
problems, but he thinks not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over last 30 years, the goal of the traffic engineer was how
to get from here to there faster and how to make it easier to get
from here to there,'' Linan said. ``The least impedance you had,
the better it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently they did a good job because now, decades later, we
are retrofitting them. Now the priority is to make sure people get
there safely.''

FUEL FORUM BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Today, the ``Fuel Summit'' begins.
</P>
<P>
   The summit could result in slightly higher prices at the pump.
And it may lead to a healthful reduction in the Kansas City, Mo.,
area's summertime smog.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, it could return the area to compliance with
federal clean-air regulations so that highway expansion projects
can resume.
</P>
<P>
   The summit begins at 10 a.m. today at the Jack Reardon Civic
Center in Kansas City, Kan., and ends Thursday. Regulators, local
officials and oil industry representatives will discuss whether
reformulated gasoline, a new kind of less-polluting fuel, should be
brought to area pumps. The fuel is sold in the St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   The forum is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan and Kansas Gov. Bill Graves have
hesitated to ask for federal permission to bring the new fuel here.
Proponents of the fuel hope the summit will lay to rest any
questions the governors still have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we will see all the issues aired, and it will put the
governors in a position to take action,'' said Eileen Hiney of the
Mid-America Regional Council.
</P>
<P>
   Recently federal regulators ruled that area highway projects to
expand a road's capacity had to be shelved until both governors
officially requested reformulated gas.
</P>
<P>
   The governors have said they would wait until the fuel summit to
decide whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
   There are several variations of reformulated gas, but the most
popular blend has included MTBE, methyl tertiary-butyl ether.
</P>
<P>
   In California the governor has called for a ban on the use of
MTBE fuel because the chemical is prone to pollute groundwater
supplies and lakes used for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of reformulated gas in Kansas City has been brewing
for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the regional council's Air Quality Forum proposed
bringing reformulated gas to Kansas City. In February 1998 the
Missouri Air Conservation Commission approved the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In much of those discussions, representatives of the oil
industry objected to bringing the new fuel here. The fuel costs
more to manufacture, and industry representatives also questioned
whether it was legal to bring it here.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues still remain, said Ken Peterson, director of the
Kansas Petroleum Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are other actions that Kansas City should
look at before taking this rather severe step,'' Peterson said
Tuesday. ``This is more expensive fuel. It'll cost more at the
pump.''

PACERS EVEN SERIES WITH 88-86 VICTORY OVER KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It was him again. After the New York Knicks had
put themselves in divine position to steal the soul of Indiana and
command of the series, Reggie Miller hit two free throws with two
seconds left to give the Pacers Game 2 of the Eastern Conference
finals on Tuesday night at Market Square Arena, 88-86.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, limping as badly as he had been since Game 5 of
the Knicks first-round series in Miami, had a golden look at a
game-tying, 14-foot jumper at the buzzer, but missed. In a frantic
finish, the Pacers evened this four-of-seven-game series after a
heart-stopping ending and sent it to New York for games Saturday
and next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 seconds left and the score tied, Allan Houston lost the
ball for New York and gave Miller his chance; it was the Knicks'
20th turnover. Miller held the ball in front of Chris Childs. With
the clock winding down, he darted to his left to the baseline,
leaped and drew contact for a foul.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who finished with 16 points, coolly made both free
throws to finally stop the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But this game showed that there is something in the Knicks that
won't allow them to stop coming no matter how dire the situation.
Down by 14 points in the third period, they rode the energy of
Childs, Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, along with
Larry Johnson and Chris Dudley. This alternating unit just kept
circling the Pacers like vultures, ready to swoop down on their
every mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Each Miller missed jumper, each errant free throw by any number
of Pacers, and each turnover put air under the Knicks' hopes. With
an aching Ewing on the bench and in foul trouble, the Knicks went
on a 17-4 tear to end the third period and begin the fourth. They
took a 73-71 lead two minutes into the fourth period on a putback
by Dudley. But Dudley fouled out with 6 minutes 26 seconds left in
the game and the Knicks ahead, 78-74, and Ewing trudged back onto
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Over a minute later, Johnson, who had 22 points, fouled out. It
looked as if attrition was going to get the best of the Knicks as
the Pacers went on a 9-0 run to take 84-80 lead after a 3-point
play from Derrick McKey with 3:04 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But on his wobbly legs, Ewing delivered a jumper and Camby
soared in off a shot that was blocked by Antonio Davis and hit the
putback with 1:22 remaining to tie the game. Ewing's next shot
almost tied it again at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing finished with 10 points, making 2 of 7 from the field.
Mark Jackson led the Pacers with 17 points, and added 8 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this game, Ewing was limping, sarcastically goading
on the crowd as it booed his moves and cheered his foul trouble.
Ewing's counterpart, Rik Smits, was hobbling through yet another
game when he had foul difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   With the marquee big men down and out for much of the game, the
Knicks were leaning on Camby to find some rebounds, Sprewell to
turn a couple of fast-break points and Johnson to deliver some
offense as they weathered an early onslaught by the Jackson-led
Pacers to turn a 14-point third-quarter deficit into a 73-71 lead
with 10:50 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout was stunning. A tense and bizarre first half
unfolded as a result of a flurry of fouls committed by Childs and
Charlie Ward, who were trying in vain to stop a determined Jackson
on his way to punishing the Knicks in the post. Their foul woes
left Coach Jeff Van Gundy to opt to put a team on the floor without
a point guard for an eight-minute stretch, from the first quarter
to the early minutes of the second. The Knicks also went without a
point guard in the final three minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the mismatches worked to the Knicks' favor, with
Sprewell bringing the ball up. Other times, it failed miserably as
the Pacers took a 53-38 lead with 2:21 left in the half. At that
moment, Ewing picked up his third foul. Exiting with a limp in the
middle of a cascade of boos, Ewing flapped his arms to the crowd,
as if to say, ``Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on, all right. The Pacers were playing intense
basketball, taking their cue from Jackson, who was finding his
teammates inside the 3-point arc. The Pacers took just three shots
from 3-point range in the half in an effort to eliminated the
fast-break points and cool the transition-happy Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Knicks scored just 6 points off the break, Sprewell
got his shots, though, hitting 5 of 10 in the first half. He and
Johnson, who had 17 first-half points by obliterating Chris Mullin
inside, were seizing the chance when they had a mismatch. With both
teams shooting just over 50 percent, neither team was exactly
stopping the other in a first half pierced by whistles.
</P>
<P>
   As the aggressors, the Pacers got the calls and went to the
free-throw line 27 times in the first half, compared to the Knicks'
16 attempts. The good news for the Knicks was that the Pacers hit
just 19 of their free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the Pacers got careless by turning the ball over twice
in the last 1:37 of the first half did the Knicks scramble to make
up ground and pull within 57-46 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers then turned very un-Pacer like and began to unravel
in the third quarter. With the Knicks turning occasionally to
double-team Jackson in the post, Miller and Mullin missed open
3-point chances. The Knicks were able to capitalize and pull within
61-53 with 7:30 left in the third on a jumper from Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was unflustered, though. He continued to post-up Ward,
and then Childs and put the Pacers back up, 68-57, with 4:09 left
in the third. The Knicks clinged to the game by getting to the foul
line and making their free throws while the Pacers were missing
badly on their end. That helped the Knicks to pull within 70-64
with a minute left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   After being bludgeoned by Jackson, Childs then lost Jackson's
replacement, Travis Best, and delivered a 3-pointer with 28 seconds
left in the third. After another botched offensive possession by
the Pacers, Sprewell found his way to the free-throw line and hit
both free throws with 2.7 seconds left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   What had the makings of a blowout, ended with the Knicks on a
12-3 run that allowed them to cut the Pacers' lead to 71-68
entering the fourth quarter. After losing their poise in the first
quarter, the Knicks had calmed down and worked themselves right
back into the game courtesy of some poor free-throw shooting by
Indiana, which made just 2 of 8 in the third.

FAMILY SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER DEATH OF PILOT AT KCI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BOCZKIEWICZ  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The widow and children of a pilot killed in the 1995
crash of a cargo jet at Kansas City International Airport recently
settled their lawsuit against McDonnell Douglas Corp. and UAL Corp.
for $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Mark N. Ulmer, first officer of the Air Transport
International jet, sued in federal court in Denver, where the
settlement was disclosed in documents filed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ulmer, 38, and the two other crew members were killed Feb. 16,
1995, in a fiery nighttime crash along a KCI runway. The plane had
unloaded freight and was being flown to Massachusetts for
servicing.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed after the crew aborted the first take-off. The
crew was trying to take off with one of the plane's four engines
not working, something officials said was not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas built the DC-8-63, and UAL Corp. trained the
crew at its United Airlines Flight Training Center in Denver in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Ulmer and her three sons claimed in their 1997 lawsuit
that the companies were responsible for the crash through
negligence by providing unsafe instructions and training for
three-engine take-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies denied responsibility. According to court
filings, they blamed the crash on errors and negligence by the crew
and by Little Rock-based Air Transport International. McDonnell
Douglas also blamed the Federal Aviation Administration for
allegedly failing to adequately monitor the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulmer family will receive $122,607 of the $300,000,
according to court filings. The remainder will cover attorney fees
and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the plane's captain, Walter Miga, and its flight
engineer, Kerry Hardy, earlier this year settled their lawsuit
against UAL and McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for those families said the terms of their
settlements were confidential.

SPORTS COMMENTARY: WITH THE PACERS IDLING, BIRD CALLS ON RESERVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They were down and nearly out, struggling for
points and defense and anything to get them back in this dogfight
of a game. The building was electric, the Knicks bench became
flammable and nothing Larry Bird tried seemed to rectify the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers were within minutes of falling into an 0-2
hole, the kind of crevice that good teams never recover from.
Latrell Sprewell was taking flight in transition, Marcus Camby's
elongated arms were reaching over two and three players for the
basketball _ and securing it. Chris Dudley put back a missed shot
with less than 11 minutes, giving the Knicks their first lead of
the game and hushing the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing his starters had lost momentum, Bird fought fire with
fire and summoned his reserves. In came Jalen Rose, leading a 9-0
run in a span of 2 minutes 21 seconds. In came Antonio Davis,
rebounding the basketball with desire.
</P>
<P>
   And when they had done their duty, Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson
and Dale Davis came back to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 may have been the best theater this season, an heirloom
won by the resilient Pacers, 88-86, and lost by the
just-as-resilient Knicks. It did not end until Patrick Ewing missed
a fallaway 18-footer at the buzzer _ on a three-quarters-court pass
from quarterback Charlie Ward, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Knick assassin who finished only 3 of 11 from the
field and could not get an open shot if his career depended upon
it, drew the cheapest of fouls from Chris Childs with 2 seconds
left and made the deciding two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   There may been 15 fouls not called on Tuesday night, but some of
the ones that were whistled were unnecessary and momentum
deflating. Every time Mark Jackson began to back another player
into the post, the slightest bit of contact would result in a foul.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is at Madison Square Garden Saturday, which is nearly too
long a wait for these two rivals
</P>
<P>
   So contentious was the battle in the middle, so crucial each
possession, you half-expected a riot to break out after it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson backed Chris Childs and Ward into the post like a beer
truck with a broken parking brake. Sprewell grabbed Miller's
jersey, refusing to let the Pacer guard break free for a
3-pointers. Ewing was taunting the crowd more than they were
taunting him.
</P>
<P>
   Did you catch the elbows Antonio Davis and Kurt Thomas were
generously doling out on each screen they set? No one gave ground
in the most physical game of the National Basketball Association
season, a flat-out scrap that had people rising out of their seat
with either venom, euphoria or both.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the stands was almost as heated and maniacal
as it was on the court. Two overzealous Knick fans were escorted
out of the building after offending everyone they sat next to.
High-fived on the way out by Herb Williams and the Knick bench, the
scene typified the lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   Two young children sat a few rows in back of the Madison Square
Garden president Dave Checketts, holding a sign up with an arrow
pointing toward Checketts: ``Phil Jackson's Next Boss,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a lot of second-guessing going on Wednesday,
especially when it comes to Jeff Van Gundy not going to his bench
earlier in the second half or the Knicks having any timeouts at the
end of the game. Camby, though, had an open wound on his leg that
had to treated, costing the Knicks a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, Childs and Camby were instrumental in bringing the
Knicks back, but their abysmal first half were responsible for
putting their team in a double-digit halftime hole.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson kept the Knicks in this game, scoring 22 points
over three quarters and hitting 9 of his first 12 shots. He did not
finish strong, but he was the thread in their comeback and his
defense was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Where this series goes from here, no one can say. The Pacers are
the best road team in the post-season, winning every game they have
played away from home. They are poised, they will be rested and
there is no reason to think they cannot steal one of two games at
the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have to feel good about their resolve, even if did
fall 2 points short in a game they had every chance to win. As Bird
said before Game 2, ``It's going to be a long series, that's what
I'm telling all my players.''
</P>
<P>
   A war took place here on Tuesday night, one of the best
post-season games in recent memory. And as good as it was, you
still get the sense that the battle has only begun. &QL;

STARS' `THUG' HELD OWN AGAINST FORSBERG
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA AND WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Richard Matvichuk has been called ``thug'' in the
Denver media. He has been labeled a cheapshot artist who has
inspired Avalanche center Peter Forsberg to a new level in the
playoffs because of his dirty play.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, however, the Stars defenseman was simply called
``good.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk and defensive mate Derian Hatcher won their battle
against Forsberg _ or at least tied it _ and that's all the Stars
can ask. Forsberg has been the catalyst for the Avalanche and he
had another outstanding game Tuesday night. However, not so
outstanding that it dragged his teammates to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a great player, one of the greatest in the world,''
Matvichuk said. ``So any time you get a chance to challenge
yourself against one of the greatest in the world, you take it
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk, the Stars' leader in hits per game (three) for the
past two seasons, didn't have one Tuesday night. He blocked three
shots and took three shots. Mostly, though, he held Forsberg to one
assist with solid positional play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what our job is and we knew we did a horrible job (in
Game 5),'' Matvichuk said. ``Tonight, we went back and worked hard
and did our job.''
</P>
<P>
   And that job included the Stars' defenseman scoring his third
career playoff goal in his 50th postseason game. So, did he take
any satisfaction in outscoring Forsberg?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even see it go in,'' Matvichuk said. ``I was heading
back to play defense, that's what my job is all about.'' EVENLY
MATCHED
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with the altitude and everything to do with
the hockey. Sighs of relief are rarely breathed in this Western
Conference finals series.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars scored two goals in a 14-second span to take a
4-1 lead, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I let out my sigh of relief,'' he said. ``I took
my hands out of my pockets then and relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   While just two of the first six games have been decided by a
single goal, the teams have split the first six games by playing
evenly matched hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two wonderful hockey teams that are giving
everything they've got in order to get to the dance,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Every game goes down to the last 10 minutes and every game
is up for grabs. It doesn't matter what happens
</P>
<P>
   the first 50 minutes. Both teams are confident they can play
their best right now.'' SIDES DON'T MATTER
</P>
<P>
   The left-to-right move of winger Jamie Langenbrunner has paid
big benefits for the Stars during their playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of the season playing on the left side and scored
only a dozen goals. Moved back to the right side for the playoffs,
Langenbrunner, a natural right-handed shot, scored twice in the
Stars' 4-1 Game 6 victory Tuesday night and has eight playoff
goals, only one behind team-leader Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving him back to the right side has been huge,'' coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``He's just been much more comfortable there and
you can see it in the way he's been playing.'' STATIC LINEUP
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive game, the Stars used the same lineup.
Since Grant Marshall returned from a sore groin and Shawn Chambers
returned from a knee injury, the Stars have been virtually
injury-free.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hrkac continues to nurse sore ribs, but is close to being
cleared to return.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the healthy scratches for the Stars were Derek
Plante, Brad Lukowich, Aaron Gavey, Jon Sim, Marty Turco, Doug
Lidster, Brent Severyn and Alan Letang. HART FAN
</P>
<P>
   On the back of Brett Hull's skates are written the initials,
``O.H.'' It's Hull's tribute to Owen Hart, the wrestler who died
last week after falliing from a support wire as he was being
lowered into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Hull is a huge fan of pro wrestling and has appeared as a
celebrity in a match.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said the league has honored NHL player Steve Chiasson and
Columbine High School with stickers on the players' helmets, and he
has been remembering Doug Wickenheiser, an old friend and St. Louis
Blues player who died of cancer. So he thought honoring Hart was
natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got stickers all over our helmets and I've been wearing
the Wick sticker all year,'' Hull said. ``(Hart) was a good
Canadian and it was such a tragic loss. I just wanted to remember
him.'' FIRST GOAL
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche has scored first in the past four games, but has
won only two of those four games.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Stars are 5-3 when scoring first in the playoffs
and 6-2 when giving up the first goal. TRIPLE THREAT
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have not lost three consecutive games since April 1-4,
1998. That's a span of 121 games _ including the playoffs the past
two seasons. nn

KING IS TALKING TO KINGS

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave King might not become the Los Angeles Kings'
next coach, but at least he has the right name.
</P>
<P>
   King, an assistant coach with the Montreal Canadiens, Tuesday
became the third candidate to interview with general manager Dave
Taylor for the Kings' vacant coaching job. On King's resume are
stints as coach of the Calgary Flames and the Canadian national
team.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor _ who also signed three players Tuesday _ previously
interviewed former Buffalo coach Ted Nolan and Long Beach Ice Dogs
coach and general manager John Van Boxmeer. Taylor is expected to
interview Detroit assistant Dave Lewis and possibly another
candidate this week. He is expected to conduct second interviews in
mid-June, with a decision likely before the June 26 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor signed junior defenseman Richard Seeley, Finnish right
wing Marko Tuomainen and free-agent left wing David Hymovitz, who
scored 46 goals this season for Indianapolis in the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   Of immediate interest is Tuomainen, whose one-year contract is a
one-way deal, meaning he gets paid the same amount whether in the
NHL or in the minors _ a sign the Kings expect Tuomainen to
contribute this season. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound Tuomainen, 27, was
drafted by Edmonton in the ninth round in 1992 and spent the past
two seasons in the Finnish league, collecting 50 points in 94
games.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 185-pound Hymovitz, 25, signed a two-way,
two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Seeley, a sixth-round choice in 1997, signed a two-way,
three-year deal. The Kings had to sign him by Tuesday's deadline or
he would have gone back into the draft.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WAR IS ON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ At one point near the end of the first half on
Tuesday night, Patrick Ewing drew his third foul and went to the
bench to the accompaniment of some 16,000 fans in Market Square
Arena chanting an obscenity at him. Ewing raised his great wingspan
as if to encourage them, and wiggled his lengthy fingers as if to
say, sticks and stones can hurt your bones but _ well, you ain't
hurtin' us.
</P>
<P>
   A shrink in the stands might have wondered if Patrick was losing
it, especially since his Knicks had fallen behind to the Pacers at
this juncture in this second game of the Eastern Conference finals
by 15 points. In fact, Ewing, who has in his basketball dotage
become the emotional linchpin for this team, was just expressing
the determination, the tenacity, the implausible impetuosity of
this team.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the fourth quarter was little more than 30 seconds
old they had tied the game at 71 and shortly after took the lead,
and even went ahead by 6 at 78-72. The Pacers fought back, however,
to go ahead again. And it was close until the finish when Reggie
Miller hit two free throws with two seconds remaining to give
Indiana a 88-86 victory in Game 2 to forge a tie in their Eastern
Conference final.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Knicks had vanquished the favored and home-team Pacers
in the first game of the four-of-seven-game series, Mark Jackson,
the Pacer point guard, was asked before the second game if his team
felt a sense of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same desperation as Game 1,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly all games in the playoffs are significant. But staring
the Pacers in their collective, determined faces was the distinct
and rather ugly possibility that if they lost again on Tuesday
night they would go into Madison Square Garden to resume the
series, down 2 games to 0, and play the next two games before that
wild and crazy Gotham crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Of course an athlete must feel loose and confident if he is to
perform at his apex. And Larry Bird, the Pacers' head coach, and a
former player of some note, understands this fully. He acknowledged
that the Pacers would have to get back quicker on defense to stop
the Knick fast break, that Rik Smits, his 7-foot-4-inch center had
to be more aggressive on offense and perhaps a little less
aggressive on defense _ no silly fouls!
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, too, that his estimable star sub, Jalen Rose,
couldn't take his Knick counterpart, Latrell Sprewell, as a
personal insult, but had to remain in the flow of the team game,
and he acknowledged that it is important for Jackson to not only
post-up Chris Childs, but had to make those jump hooks from close
range that he missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers indeed made adjustments, but so did the Knicks _
including having Larry Johnson crash to the hoop for 17 points in
the first half, and Childs hitting two big long shots as the Knicks
caught up and passed the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that and more, Bird also laid the underpinnings for a
potential loss in Game 2. ``We're a good road team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. And the success included no road losses Milwaukee and
Philadelphia, since the Pacers swept the Hawks and 76ers in the
first two rounds of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who played for the Knicks for five seasons, starting in
1987, is hardly a stranger to the Garden. Nor are Chris Mullin or
Sam Perkins, both of whom, like Jackson, are from New York City.
And when Jackson was asked about a New York tabloids headline that
called this series The ``Knicks versus Hicks,'' he said he found it
curious. ``We have three guys from New York City,'' he said, ``I
don't know where the Knick guys are from, but I'd bet none of them
have ever been to downtown Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing is from Jamaica (not Queens) and Boston; Allan
Houston is from Louisville, Larry Johnson's from Tyler, Texas.
Sprewell is from Milwaukee, Childs from Bakersfield, Calif.,
Charlie Ward from Tallahassee. Only Marcus Camby and Chris Dudley
are even neighbors, from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   And to Reggie Miller, the Great Knick Villain, the Garden is
like a second home. Tensions with the Knicks are generally a happy
sop to him _ though his 3-point shot with his team down by a point
with 12 seconds to to in Game 1 ended by the ball hitting the front
rim. But he hit the winning free throws on Tuesday night, and now
Knick fans will remember how he burned them for 39 points in Game 5
of the 1994 conference finals, his 8 points in 8.9 seconds to
co-opt Game 1 of the 1995 second-round series and his 3-pointer in
last year's second-round series, which forced overtime, won by the
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought Knicks-Pacers would be a war,'' Rose said.
``And now we have one.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or, to paraphrase Jackson, same ol', same ol' desperation. &QL;

HELLING KEEPS IT CLOSE IN RANGERS' WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Early in Tuesday night's game, Texas Rangers
starting pitcher Rick Helling felt similar to his Opening Day start
when he allowed seven runs, five earned, in only three innings of
work of an 11-5 loss.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he never lost his focus.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not get the win, Helling kept Texas within
striking range with seven strong innings of work, allowing one run
on three hits and three walks, in the Rangers 3-1 come-from-behind
victory against the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let that one get to me and I pitched poorly,'' Helling said
of his Opening Day performance. ``Tonight, I battled through it and
I did a good job of keeping the team in it. I didn't have my best
stuff, but those are the nights you have to find a way to get
through it and battle. Tonight, I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first five innings of the game, Helling fell behind
in the count to most of the batters he faced. He started off 12 of
the first 18 batters he faced with balls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he seldom found himself in any real trouble. He allowed one
hit and two walks in the first four innings with only one runner
advancing as far as second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to throw mostly zeros up on the board and keep the
team in it and give us a chance to score some runs and win the ball
game,'' Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   The only time he allowed two base runners on base in one inning
came in the fifth when he walked catcher Chad Kreuter, who later
came home on a two-out, full-count double by second baseman Steve
Scarsone.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed one base runner in his final two innings of work,
leaving the game after the seventh with the Rangers trailing 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``You can't
ask for anything more out of your starter. I just wish he would
have been able to get the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling lowered his earned-run average to 4.99, the first time
last year's 20-game winner has had it below 5.00. He is the only
member of the Rangers' starting rotation allowing fewer than five
runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the second time in 12 starts Helling (5-5) has not
figured in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rick has pitched a whole lot better than his basic
numbers indicate,'' Texas manager Johnny Oates said. ``What was
this? His 12th start? I believe he could have won nine of those
very easily.'' nn

PIRATES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The $80 million payroll sets up a potentially
awesome starting rotation and all-stars in the field. As the Los
Angeles Dodgers are finding out, it doesn't do very much to help a
bench or bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The $22 million-earning, poverty-stricken Pittsburgh Pirates
delivered one piece of enlightening news in beating the Dodgers for
the second straight day _ this time 4-2 Tuesday at Three Rivers
Stadium. The message is that hustle and execution still win games.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is 27-24. The Dodgers are 26-25 and are 4-4 on this
nine-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   A beleaguered Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who's spent a
season battling injuries to his beloved bench and bullpen,
delivered news that impacts the Dodgers beyond this three-game
series. Already in need of outfield help to give center fielder
Devon White some time off, Johnson said it's likely outfielder Todd
Hollandsworth will return to the disabled list because of a torn
oblique muscle on his right side.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson used backup outfielder Trenidad Hubbard to spell White
once but not since Hollandsworth was injured Thursday in
Cincinnati. Also, the Dodgers are carrying 12 pitchers, and with
Jose Vizcaino on the disabled list, Tripp Cromer is their lone
backup middle infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that's contributed to a stretch in which the
Dodgers have gone 4 for 47 with runners in scoring position while
losing three of the past five. The Dodgers were 1 for 10 in this
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're tired,'' Johnson said. ``We had pitches to hit. I
don't know. I wish I had answers. This guy (Pittsburgh's Jason
Schmidt) got racked up pretty good (in the past). We had pitches to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   What's worse is the Dodgers have no apparent solutions, or even
stopgaps, at the minor-league level. Triple-A Albuquerque's Kevin
Gibbs is out with torn cartilage in his throwing shoulder. Hiram
Bocachica was in big-league camp in the spring as an outfielder but
has since been sent back to the infield at Double-A San Antonio.
The Dodgers already lost outfielder Jacob Brumfield on the waiver
wire to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it's unlikely the Dodgers would make a move before
heading home after tonight's series finale with the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the choices at Albuquerque are former big-leaguers Wes
Chamberlain (.272, 8 HR, 40 RBI) and Warren Newson (.236, 1, 8) and
outfielders Brent Cookson (.324, 14, 39) and Kevin Grijak (.333, 3,
20).
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of these injuries look like three to five days and
wind up being three weeks,'' Johnson said. ``I don't know what our
options are. Vizcaino can possibly be ready, but I need an
outfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-gasp hope for the Dodgers is that a second cortisone
shot Hollandsworth received prior to the game does enough to allow
him to play. If not, Hollandsworth, who began the season on the
disabled list with a hamstring injury, will return there Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of (the shots) definitely helped, but what can you do if
you tore something,'' Hollandsworth said. ``You're just kind of
stuck. I feel better, but as far as being able to (swing), it's
something that has to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers sleepwalked to their second straight loss, the
vibrant Pirates played small ball to near-perfection. Ed Sprague
homered in the first off right-hander Ismael Valdes (5-3), but the
Pirates' next three runs scored via the sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley homered for the second straight
game. The solo shot came in the second inning. The Dodgers just
haven't hit with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Eric Young singled in the eighth and moved to second
on a wild pitch, the Dodgers couldn't even move him over a base.
Gary Sheffield, Raul Mondesi and Hundley each struck out. In fact,
the Dodgers' first four hitters _ White, Young, Sheffield and
Mondesi _ went 1 for 15.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard's pinch-hit single in the ninth to score Adrian Beltre
was the Dodgers' only hit with a runner in scoring position and cut
the lead to 4-2. But White grounded out to first to end the game,
giving Schmidt (5-3) his first win since May 1, and Mike Williams
notched his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say people are dragging, but Davey, historically,
he gives a guy a day off here, a day there,'' said first baseman
Eric Karros, who had two of the Dodgers' seven hits. ``We don't
have the ability to move guys in and out of the lineup.... We're
struggling right now, but it's going to turn around. As bad as it
is right now, it's going to be as unbelievably good at some point
in the season.''

FOR STARS, BORING CAN BE GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DENVER _ For what it's worth, and that may be plenty, the Stars
backed off the muscle here Tuesday night. While not exactly turning
a cheek, they did turn a page. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This, of course, had been a bruising Western Conference finals
of one crunching blow after another. Unlike Stone Cold Austin and
his ilk, none of it was fake either. The last guy left standing got
to score the game-winning goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Game 6 statistical sheet will show the Stars with 16
``hits.'' You will see more than that on a ``Jerry Springer
Show.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had been over 35 hits in three of the previous five
games, two of them losses. The low for the series had been 23,
which was a Game 3 shutout victory for Dallas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We got carried away with the physical stuff, and that
benefited \RColorado\S,'' admitted Guy Carbonneau, who has been
around the NHL long enough to know the difference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So staying alive for the Stars last night meant going back to
plain ol' basics, which brought many changes, including combat
restrictions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And while these ``basics'' have been described in Denver circles
as boring to watch, the yawns aren't necessarily restricted to the
Mountain time zone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Stars' locker room, players are sometimes heard
plotting an occasional escape from Ken Hitchcock's button-downed
defensive system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But last night, when survival was all about now-or-never on road
ice, the Stars willingly returned to those foundation roots of
``positional hockey.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The racehorse _ meaning the Colorado Avalanche _ never left the
barn. Whatever that 12-goal thing was Sunday afternoon, this time
it was the Stars that dictated ice space and tempo. And this time
the frustration slowly but surely overwhelmed the Avalanche. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 was up for grabs in the third period. The Stars did the
grabbing, and wouldn't let go, piling up three goals in the final
13 minutes en route to a 4-1 victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, we got our organizational feet back under us,'' said
Hitchcock. ``The emphasis was on positional play. What happened was
not unexpected. We always perform well in adverse situations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With one of those adverse situations successfully overcome, now
there's Game 7 on Friday night at Reunion Arena. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is that good or bad? The Stars have more road victories in this
series. Could they possibly lose three out of four games to one
team at Reunion? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many questions still to come, but first, there had to be the
Game 6 answer. Or many answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among those was Eddie Belfour returning from the Game 5 dead. He
was brilliant again in goal. And when the offense had to get going
after an early 1-0 deficit, Jamie Lagenbrunner led the way with his
third-period outburst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why then, did Hitchcock's first praise in his postgame comments
center on the ``\RBrian\S Skrudland line, with \RGrant\S Marshall
and \RBlake\S Sloan?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because those grinders established an energy tempo, not to
mention a game-plan tempo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play good, they can't beat us,'' sniffed Avalanche
defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh afterward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ozo, however, sounded more bored than defiant. Which is the way
the Stars want to keep the Avalanche for Game 7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone say it's boring?'' asked Hitchcock, knowing the
Denver media has, more than once in this series. ``This is the way
we have to play to win. It's a system that suits our personnel. Our
players are proud of that. It takes discipline, but we play well
this way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opposed, of course, to the Game 5 monster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As a series is in progress, sometimes both teams get caught up
in a certain style of play,'' Hitchcock said. ``And sometimes, like
in Game 5, the schedule takes its toll, creating fatigue. That
happened Sunday at home.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In regrouping the troops for last night's most important game
ever for a Dallas hockey team, Hitchcock said he never attempted to
calm nerves. ``Actually, you'd better be nervous at this time of
year,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there was also no detailed game plan to stop a Colorado team
that had hung up seven goals two days earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we spent 15 seconds talking about Colorado at
our team meeting today,'' added Hitchcock. ``The only discussion
was about us. About who we are and what we are all about as a team.
And what it takes for us to be the kind of team we know we are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other words, boring was beautiful last night. And more
boredom is needed for Friday night. &QL;

BASEBALL JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Major league baseball has always abhorred spontaneous
bursts of creative intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the owners are so comfortable with Bud Selig as
commissioner; that's why the umpires' union, instead of the rules,
is allowed to run the game on the field; that's why baseball's
marketing slogan has been (brace yourself) ``What A Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Put all the good ideas that have improved baseball for fans and
players into a book, and it reads faster than ``The Peruvian Guide
to World Dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   So when umpire Frank Pulli Sunday relied on instant replay to
correct an erroneous call on a home run by his crew in the
Florida-St. Louis game, he found himself predictably upbraided
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use of video replay is not an acceptable practice,'' National
League president Len Coleman said. He was backed by his American
League counterpart, Gene Budig, who said, ``Major league baseball
games are determined between the lines, and electronic assistance
is not permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether Pulli was sentenced to watch the WB network,
or similar hideous punishment that fits the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But it's plain that baseball has a larger priority on doing
things the standard way instead of pursuing fairness. Which once
again proves the point that there is little difference between
baseball and most of the rest of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   No, there was no expectation that, based on one episode,
baseball should suddenly adopt instant replay in the middle of a
season. But the summary dismissal of instant replay by most of
baseball showed its standard lack of enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pulli had backed away from his act so fast he was near a
reverse whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things went through my mind,'' he said. ``I hope I
don't have to go to the replay again. I don't want it to become
like football.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohmigawd, no. Let's not be like the NFL, a sport that at least
is attempting to get things right this fall by re-introducing a
limited use of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   Given the hundreds of episodes of umpire judgment that are a
part of every major league game, baseball traditionalists assume
that replays would render the already languid game inert.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that logic, Ben &AMP; Jerry's should be labeled a hazardous
substance, because eating it too fast will create fatal ice cream
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in how the item is used.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL this season will confine replay's use to out-of-bounds,
goal-line and possession calls, limiting the number of challenges
as well. It's a better, faster system than the unwieldy method used
from 1986 to 1991 that alienated even replay advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Replay is a partial answer to a chronic, once-insoluble problem
in football and many sports: Too many things happen too quickly or
too distantly for the eye to see and the mind to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that TV often can provide the home audience with better
information than any available to officials only serves to
aggravate a skeptical fan base already primed to believe the worst
about the source of judgment calls.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest results of the NFL's original experiment with
replay was to confirm that officials were right most of the time.
When they weren't, calls were reversed and the sport's credibility
increased. Changes to the method this time around figure to reduce
the delays and inconclusiveness that compromised the NFL's first
try.
</P>
<P>
   Replay's use in baseball should be even more limited than
football: No balls and strikes, no plays at a base, no continuation
plays (in which a reversed call would have an undetermined effect
on subsequent play).
</P>
<P>
   Replay's primary use would be for what Pulli encountered Sunday:
Potential dead-ball situations that determine a home run or a fair
ball at points far from the nearest umpire.
</P>
<P>
   If stadium fences were uniformly distinct, there would be far
fewer ground rules. But fences, including the Kingdome's right
field, often are not clear, festooned as they are with scoreboards,
railings and other gewgaws.
</P>
<P>
   No Kingdome season has passed without several arguments about
whether a long ball hit a fence, a rail or a fan before bounding
back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   A fat umpire lumbering into the outfield can only guess about a
small, fast-moving object 150 feet away. But of course, if that
shortcoming were eliminated, we would also forego the privilege of
witnessing spittle exchanges between the cherubic arbiter and Lou
Piniella, which is hell on hygiene but always a highlight.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine what kind of threat will be posed to
baseball's integrity in which well-placed, unmanned cameras provide
key information about fair or foul, home run or double.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm sure a demon will be discovered and seized upon by
umpires, players and owners and beaten senseless, in order to
restrain baseball's entry into the 20th century, just in time for
the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Why spend a few thousand bucks on the game's credibility when
many millions can be given to old, broken-down pitchers?

ROSE STEALS THE SHOW BY BEING HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ After two years, Jalen Rose was finally the
player Larry Bird wanted. Or so the Pacers' coach thought. Gone
were the games when Rose would attempt to steal the spotlight with
dazzling one-on-one moves, with flashy cross-over dribbles in the
paint. Or so Bird thought.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who had slowly turned himself into a structured team
player under Bird, reverted to his old ways in Game 1 of the
Knicks-Pacers playoff series, lured there by the showy Latrell
Sprewell. Rose tried to mirror Sprewell's performance, and it got
him benched for the final nine minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just his way of telling me he loves me,'' a smiling
Rose said, referring to the benching. ``Everyone wants to be in
there during crunch time. You don't make it to this level by
settling for anything less.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was in the right frame of mind before Game 2 on Tuesday
night. Having taken criticism for his selfish play, he said he had
learned his lesson. For 14 minutes in the first half, Rose played
within himself, scoring 5 points on 2-for-6 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the spotlight fell on Rose, but not because he
forced it upon himself. He was front-and-center late in the fourth
quarter because he made several crucial shots down the stretch to
bring the Pacers back in a game they won, 88-86.
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks leading by 78-72 with a little more than seven
minutes to play, Rose nailed a 10-foot jump shot to pull the Pacers
within 4 points, 78-74. The capacity crowd at Market Square Arena
jumped to its feet. On the next Pacer possession, Rose was fouled
by Chris Dudley as the two chased a loose ball. Rose went to foul
line and sank both shots to pull the Pacers to 78-76.
</P>
<P>
   Then after Reggie Miller, who had been coasting through a quiet
game, sank a 15-footer to bring the Pacers even with the Knicks at
78-78, Rose hit his biggest shot thus far in the series with 5
minutes 13 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pacers in serious jeopardy of traveling to Madison
Square Garden down by 0-2, Rose popped out at the far right corner
and fearlessly nailed a 3-point shot that gave the Pacers a 81-78
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rose finished the game with 13 points on 4-of-10 shooting,
including 2 of 3 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game Bird said: ``We'll see. I think Jalen will have
a good game. He usually backs up a performance like he had the
other day. Just as long as he understands what the problems were.
And the problems were that he was breaking a lot of plays where he
was trying to go one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a better player when he comes off a pick and gets the
ball and penetrates and makes plays. Jalen is a fine basketball
player, and we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Rose proved his coach right. &QL;

STARS DEFEAT AVALANCHE, FORCE GAME 7
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Guy Carbonneau didn't even have to be prodded. He
conjured up vivid memories of last year's Game 6 Western Conference
finals loss to the Detroit Red Wings at first mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think in that game we weren't ready. We didn't know as
a team just how much it would take,'' Carbonneau said as he
remembered the loss that ended the 1997-98 season for the Dallas
Stars. ``This year, we know what it's like to suffer, we've grown
from it, we've learned from it. And I think that's what has carried
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night that experience carried the Stars to the biggest
victory in their six years in Texas, and possibly the biggest in
the 31-year franchise history. Backed to the wall in Game 6 vs. the
Colorado Avalanche, the Stars came up with a gutty 4-1 victory that
forces Game 7 on Friday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Although the franchise went to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1981
and 1991 as the Minnesota North Stars, the team lost as huge
underdogs on both occasions. If the Stars win Game 7, they will
play the Stanley Cup Finals as the favorites against the Buffalo
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we can't think about that, and we weren't even thinking
about Game 7. All we can think is that we don't want this to end,''
Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``We came in here with the
thought that we were going to do anything and everything possible
to keep our season going, and that's exactly what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround from a 7-5 loss in Game 5 was both startling and
expected, if that's possible. It was startling in that in 48 hours
the Stars completely changed their game plan. It was expected in
that the Stars' players said they knew exactly what they were
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the same game plan we played in this series before we
just had a meltdown,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said.
``What we did was we got back to the sound defensive game that we
used for most of this series. But we didn't back off on being
aggressive. We just did what we knew we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   After yielding 17 giveaways in Game 5, the Stars' trimmed their
giveaways to seven Tuesday night. After taking themselves out of
position with 36 hits in Game 5, the Stars limited themselves to 16
Tuesday night. After hanging goalie Ed Belfour out in the wind in
Game 5, the Stars battled to prevent second shots Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to whack us over the head with a board to
get the point through, but we're not stupid,'' Ludwig said. ``We've
done a great job of learning from our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with everything they fixed, the Stars trailed 1-0 at
the end of the first period after an exceptional play by Avalanche
center Peter Forsberg. The gritty Swede who carried the Avalanche
in the past two games fought off the checks of Jere Lehtinen,
Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk _ the Stars' best defensive
players _ to get the puck to Adam Foote at the point. Foote's
long-distance shot was deflected in by Avalanche winger Claude
Lemieux, and Colorado had the lead in the game with 34.9 seconds
remaining in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in five periods that the Stars had allowed
a goal in the final minute, and the Stars appeared shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig disagreed with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it changed momentum at all,'' Ludwig said. ``We
thought we did exactly what we wanted in the first period, and we
were going to stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A minute and 55 seconds into the second period, the Stars gained
the game-tying goal on a Lehtinen's sixth goal of the playoffs.
Lehtinen lifted a rebound over Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy to
break a six-game scoring drought.
</P>
<P>
   The score stayed that way until the Stars finally got the
game-winner. Jamie Langenbrunner, who has been a Stars' savior of
sorts, beat Aaron Miller off a check in the corner and slammed in a
rebound at the 6:49 mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second rebound goal, and a symbol of the
determination the Stars were using to get to Roy. The Stars
finished with 40 shots, while being defensively responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when they were down a goal, they were mentally
tougher,'' Avalanche defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Avalanche center Joe Sakic: ``They deserved this win,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't back off even after leading 2-1. They stretched
it to 3-1 on another Langenbrunner goal and made it 4-1 on a
Matvichuk goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they seized the momentum they lost in Game 5. In the
end, they buried any memories of the Game 6 loss to the Red Wings
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Stars have another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've worked for, everything we've suffered
through, everything that's made us closer, that's what we used
tonight,'' Carbonneau said. ``And hopefully, this was our
second-best game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The best, Carbonneau said, needs to come Friday night. nn

BELFOUR'S PERFORMANCE QUIETS RUMORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ed Belfour was one game away from possibly his last
game in a Dallas Stars uniform _ or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Lose in Game 6 Tuesday night and the rumors about Belfour's
future in Texas would have taken on the combined force of
discussions currently surrounding Cowboys players Michael Irvin and
Deion Sanders. It was that important.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have to choose between Belfour and Roman Turek this
summer _ they have to make a choice not unlike when the San
Francisco 49ers had to choose between Joe Montana and Steve Young.
With the expansion Atlanta Thrashers ready to take one of the two
goalies in the expansion draft, the Stars have a tricky decision.
</P>
<P>
   And if Belfour would have gone out in Game 6 with a loss after
allowing six goals in Game 5, the jury would have been out on
Belfour and the push to keep Turek would have grown wings.
</P>
<P>
   But Belfour made that point moot Tuesday night _ at least for a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he thinks about that stuff at all,'' Stars
defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``I just think Eddie has been
tremendous and he continues to be great. He was there when we
needed him tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   So was there an easy explanation for Belfour's meltdown in Game
5 on Sunday afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a night game, and Eddie's always ready for night
games,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but Game 7 is a night game, not that Belfour is
concerned. nn

LANGENBRUNNER GIVES STARS A LITTLE EXTRA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DENVER _ Ken Hitchcock closed his eyes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, silly, not for the whole game, but for those few seconds
late in the third period, when Jamie Langenbrunner was racing down
the ice with the puck all alone, just him and Colorado goalie
Patrick Roy and a full house at McNichols Sports Arena holding its
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner had already given the Stars a 2-1 lead _ it would
prove to be his fourth game-winner in the playoffs _ but everybody
knows a one-goal lead isn't enough against these guys. With just
under four minutes to play, this was his chance to put Roy and the
Avalanche in their Rocky Mountain graves for good.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't watch,'' Hitchcock admitted.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Langenbrunner never got a shot off _ Roy, coming out
of his crease, poked the puck away as Langenbrunner tried one deke
too many _ but the Stars and their sometimes star-crossed
left-to-right winger would not be denied.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five seconds later Langenbrunner one-timed a pass from
Dave Reid into the net, helping the Stars to a pulsating 4-1
victory that ties this best-of-seven series at three games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a series deserved a Game 7, this one does, and now it's
on for Friday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got two great hockey teams, two wonderful hockey teams,
who are giving everything they've got to get to the dance,''
Hitchcock said. ``It never seems to matter what happens in the
first 50 minutes. It always boils down to the last 10 minutes of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think you could hold your breath for 10 minutes, did you?
</P>
<P>
   Get ready to try it for 60 minutes Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars rediscovered their game last night after Sunday's 7-5
debacle at Reunion Arena. Their second and third periods, in
particular, were brilliant, maybe their best of the season, and
came from desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel they had a good sense of urgency,'' Avalanche
coach Bob Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Eddie Belfour was back to his old self, stopping 26 shots
as the Stars played excellent positional hockey and still outshot
the Avalanche 40-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a night game,'' Hitchcock shrugged, referring to
Belfour's penchant for taking afternoon naps, even during games.
``No problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most importantly for the Stars, their so-called
second line of Joe Nieuwendyk, Dave Reid and Langenbrunner, who has
found a spark since being moved back to right wing from the left
side, continued its premier playoff performance.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner's two goals were his seventh and eighth of the
playoffs, one behind Nieuwendyk's team-leading nine. Throw in
Reid's pair, and the line leads the team with 19 goals and 37
points, outperforming the more highly touted No. 1 threesome of
Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen, who scored his first
goal of this series to tie the score at 1 early in the second
period last night.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's the Modano line which has to spend its time
bumping heads and matching rushes with the Avs' No. 1 line of Peter
Forsberg, Valeri Kamensky and Claude Lemieux. But Nieuwendyk and
company have dominated the Avs' second line of Joe Sakic, Theo
Fleury and Chris Drury, nine goals to four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nieuwendyk has just been a good player all playoffs, but
Langenbrunner's really picked it up in the last two series,''
Hitchcock said. ``We were a little down when \RBenoit\s Hogue went
out, because he played so well, but Reid's really filled in
admirably.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RReid\S is being very effective. He's had the benefit of not
playing very many minutes so he has a lot of energy, and it's just
a good line, good chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner's game-winner with 13:11 to play was another case
of his being in the right place at the right time. Nieuwendyk fired
a point-blank shot that Roy blocked, but it handcuffed him and he
couldn't control the rebound. Langenbrunner poked it past him and
into the net before Roy could recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a first great save,'' said Roy, never missing a chance
to pat himself on the back, ``and I think it hit Ozo's \RSandish
Ozoliinsh\S stick and bounced back under me. And then I think
Langenbrunner's stick was under me and I could not put my pad on
the ice and he just pushed it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Langenbrunner played a super game. I think they made
their breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche was putting incredible pressure on the Stars and
the seconds ticked away, however, and it was Langenbrunner's second
goal which gave them some breathing room and demonstrated the
resiliency and determination of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, using his strength to keep control of the puck, fed
Langenbrunner in front of the net for a 3-1 Stars' lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the foiled breakaway that lingered on Langenbrunner's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream about scoring goals in the Stanley Cup playoffs when
you're a kid in your basement,'' said Langenbrunner, who scored
once in 17 playoff games last year. ``It would have been nice to
put us up 3-1 with that breakaway ,but he just poked it away from
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I got another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, do the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Don't close your eyes. You don't want to miss
anything on this ride.

RANGERS RALLY FOR EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ Don't mistake Kansas City's Matt Whisenant for
the Rangers' Jeff Zimmerman. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whisenant appears to compare favorably to Zimmerman
statistically, but go beyond their earned-run averages and
opponents' batting averages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between the two relievers end there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman will not beat himself through lack of control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whisenant did in the Rangers' 3-1 victory Tuesday night at The
Ballpark in Arlington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Royals' left-handed reliever ignited the Rangers'
eighth-inning rally with a seven-pitch walk to first baseman Lee
Stevens, and the American League's hottest team capitalized on it
for their eighth consecutive victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore delivered the game-winning hit with
his two-run single off right-hander Terry Mathews, and Zimmerman
(5-0) earned the victory with a scoreless inning of perfect
relief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what one little walk can do,'' said manager
Johnny Oates, whose Rangers won their fourth consecutive game in
their final at-bat. ``It seems so innocent at first, but it led to
their run and started our three-run inning in the eighth.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stevens drew the walk, and Whisenant responded by hitting the
next two batters _ shortstop Jon Shave and pinch hitter/center
fielder Roberto Kelly _ with first-pitch deliveries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surprising? No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whisenant (1-1) entered this appearance with a 1.69 ERA and
opponents hitting only .118 against him, but the left-hander had
issued 10 walks and hit three batters in 16 innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing worse than letting down your team,''
Whisenant said. ``I felt good. I just took a little too long to
find the strike zone out there. You can't do that in situations
like that. Anytime you walk someone in a one-run game, that's
asking for trouble.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Royals manager Tony Muser summoned right-hander Mathews from the
bullpen after Whisenant failed to retire any of the three batters
he faced, and McLemore greeted him with the game-winning hit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McLemore swung at a 2-2 fastball that appeared up in the strike
zone and lined it into center field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too close to take,'' McLemore said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer, who twice failed to deliver a clutch
hit with a runner in scoring position in the first and sixth
innings off Kansas City starter Jay Witasick, followed with a
run-scoring single for the final run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland followed Zimmerman's one-inning,
two-strikeout appearance and pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for his
league-leading 17th save, although a save opportunity appeared to
be out of the question for most of the evening despite another
strong performance from right-hander Rick Helling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling entered the fifth inning with a one-hit shutout intact,
but Witasick proved to be worthy to the task by pitching six
scoreless innings. The Royals produced only three base runners
during the game's first four innings, and the Rangers' defense
retired two of those. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling induced a one-out, second-inning ground ball from Kansas
City's Larry Sutton that McLemore and shortstop Jon Shave converted
into a 4-6-3 double play, and right fielder Juan Gonzalez retired
shortstop Rey Sanchez with an accurate throw to second base after
the latter attempted to stretch a third-inning single into a
double. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling, though, issued a one-out, fifth-inning walk to catcher
Chad Kreuter, who later scored the game's first run. Second baseman
Steve Scarsone, the Royals' No. 8 hitter, worked the count full
before delivering a two-out double. Kreuter scored easily from
first base by getting a running start on the two-out, 3-2 pitch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that run would stand until Whisenant unraveled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't give up,'' McLemore said. &QL;

LEHTINEN'S GOAL BRINGS STARS BACK FROM RINK OF DISASTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Colorado Avalanche followed the script perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   A high-spirited, high-energy first period was winding down with
a scoreless tie when Claude Lemieux deflected a shot past Ed
Belfour with just 35 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche already had a 3-2 series lead on the Dallas Stars
going into Tuesday night's game. Now surely they had them out, with
the lead, the momentum and the backing of a raucous, sellout crowd
at McNichols Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Surely money-goalie Patrick Roy would pitch a shutout, and the
Stars' season would be over.
</P>
<P>
   But then Jere Lehtinen sent the script to rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars forward lifted a shot over Roy less than two minutes
into the second period and washed away the bad taste of the late
first-period goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big for us,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``That
was a great goal. From then on we picked it up and got better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars went on to a 4-1 victory, tying the series and forcing
a deciding seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to get that first goal just to tie it up,''
veteran forward Guy Carbonneau said. ``We came back in the room and
talked about it. We knew we could come back. It was a matter of
keep playing disciplined and look for the opening.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was Lehtinen's sixth of the playoffs, but the first of
this series. While the other marquee players on both sides had
their moments of brilliance, Lehtinen was silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was pressing a little,'' he said. ``I have had chances
almost every game. I just had to keep playing hard, and hope it was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   It came because Lehtinen has a nose for the puck, and knows what
to do when he gets it.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had the puck in the Colorado end, and the line of Mike
Modano, Brett Hull and Lehtinen worked hard to keep it there.
Modano dug it off the boards, and passed it to defenseman Sergei
Zubov at the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov unleashed a slap shot that was stopped in front by Hull,
who was going for the deflection. Then, the puck landed on
Lehtinen's stick.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen had just enough time to mentally review the scouting
report. He knew that Roy's butterfly style makes it hard to beat
him low because he drops down so quickly, so he didn't want to just
slide it across the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got it, I said I have to shoot upstairs,'' Lehtinen
said. ``We have seen that work, when you shoot up.''
</P>
<P>
   He went top shelf, hitting the narrow gap between Roy's left
shoulder and the cross bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little bit of time to look,'' he said. ``I was glad it
went into the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal provided redemption for the first line, which was on
the ice when the Avalanche scored late in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our line made some mistakes on their first goal, and we wanted
to get that back,'' Modano said. ``It was a great play by everybody
to keep the puck in the zone, and then by Zubie to get it on net.
It gave us new life and got us back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen's goal was the only one by the trio, but it wasn't
their only scoring chance. The first line combined for 13 of the
Stars' 40 shots, with Hull getting five and Modano and Lehtinen
four each. nn

CLINTON MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY RENEWING CHINA'S TRADE TIES WITH U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes in 9th and 10th grafs)  (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the seventh time since he took office,
President Clinton will ask Congress on Thursday to renew China's
trading privileges with the United States. It has always been a
dicey proposition, though one that Clinton _ with aggressive
lobbying help from companies with interests in China _ has always
won.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the battle over what is now called ``normal trade
relations'' with China promises to be more confused, more emotional
and far trickier than at any time since the military crackdown in
Tiananmen Square, exactly 10 years ago. Just a few months ago
Clinton and the Chinese had hoped to be asking Congress for far
more _ for permanent trade privileges, as part of a deal that would
usher China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say that on Thursday the president will hold
open the possibility that the bigger and more permanent deal will
be struck soon _ presumably after the furor dies down here over
accusations of Chinese spying and in Beijing over the mistaken
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. But some of Clinton's
advisers say privately they fear the chances of getting a trade
deal signed with the Chinese and through an angry Congress are
increasingly remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are watching,'' one of his advisers said last week,
``is a seven-year initiative with China crumble in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the White House called that initiative the development of a
``strategic partnership'' with China, a phrase that has now been
stricken from all official references to that country. So has the
term ``commercial diplomacy,'' once used to describe how increased
economic engagement with China would strengthen ties in other
arenas. Now the White House, and the business community, are
arguing the opposite, why national security issues should be
divorced from trade.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's seeming ambivalence about how to tackle this
vote _ which usually becomes a congressional referendum on the
state of Chinese-U.S. relations _ is mirrored by the ambivalence of
the Republicans. Roughly half the hopefuls for the Republican
presidential nomination _ including Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and
Gary Bauer _ argue that the spy case underscores why the United
States should suspend negotiations with China over WTO admission.
</P>
<P>
   The other half, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain, have carefully separated the issues, with McCain, the
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, arguing that ``we should
make judgments on the basis of our trade interests. The scandal is
not that they spied on us, but that we let them.''
</P>
<P>
   For many business executives, this year's debate over how to
respond to the spying accusations has echoes of the debate that
played out in the first two years of the Clinton administration,
over tying China's human rights record to its trade privileges.
Clinton himself started out that way and reversed course,
separating human rights issues from arguments over the annual
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Intel Corp., Andrew Grove, said he saw the
relationship in terms of parallel universes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the political and geopolitical universe, where
nations have problems and collaborations,'' he said. ``There is the
trade universe and then there is a universe of technology issues.
And what we have to deal with _ whether we want to tie those three
together, so that if it hits a brick wall they all stop making
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove's concern, one that he and other technology executives
plan to voice in Washington next week, is that Congress will link
the trade vote to new restrictions on technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely possible that higher-end Pentium III's will not
be salable in China,'' said Grove, referring to Intel's
top-of-the-line microprocessors. ``Imagine that: A personal
computer you will be able to buy for $1,200 at CompUSA by the end
of the year could not be shipped to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove and other technology executives argue that such
restrictions would not deny technology to China; they would only
force China to make its own. ``And then you have to ask: Are we
better off in any of those universes _ the political one, or the
trade one, or the technological one _ if we force them to build up
their technological base on their own?''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, though, such subtleties have not yet been debated.
After Tiananmen, Congress imposed a series of trade and technology
restrictions, many of which have since been lifted. There may be
the same reaction this time.
</P>
<P>
   But some on Capitol Hill say they believe that when passions
cool, there will once again be momentum for a trade deal that opens
China's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who is pushing
for permanent trade privileges, ``people will come to realize that
all the concessions in this trade agreement are on China's side.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ It was time for a Reggie Miller moment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or perhaps we should say it was about time for a Miller moment.
</P>
<P>
   With two seconds left in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals
at Market Square Arena on Tuesday night, Miller strode to the foul
line and buried two free throws to give the Indiana Pacers a
dramatic 88-86 victory over the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In true theatrical fashion, though, the victory wasn't wrapped
up until Patrick Ewing's last-second jumper clanged off the rim,
giving the Pacers a split in the first two games of the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   And New Yorkers thought the best shows were found on Broadway.
It was Miller _ again _ playing the villain to New Yorkers in this
act, which was performed before 16,586 at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who made a living by killing the Knicks, had yet another
opportunity Tuesday. He wasn't at his best in this game, scoring 16
points on 3-of-11 shooting, but he was there when the Pacers needed
him at the end.
</P>
<P>
   That's all the Pacers could have wanted. And it's all the Knicks
feared.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who had not scored a field goal since popping in a
3-pointer with 8:03 to play in the first quarter, pump-faked Allan
Houston to draw the two-shot foul, and he wasn't about to miss
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to get the ball on the last play,'' Miller
said. ``They really don't count stats on how many (shots) you make
or miss. It's who wins the ballgames. As long as you make the last
one, that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   And New Yorkers are familiar enough with Miller's history
against the Knicks to know he was going to drain those last two
foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Miller is the same guy who scored 25 points in the
fourth quarter to personally win Game 5 of the 1994 conference
finals, the same guy who scored eight points in a span of 8.9
seconds of the fourth quarter to beat the Knicks in Game 1 of the
1995 conference semifinals. And it was Miller who rifled in the
game-tying 3-point shot with 5.9 seconds left to force overtime in
Game 4 of last season's conference semifinals, a game the Pacers
won 118-107.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks fans can now add Tuesday's game to the list.
</P>
<P>
   But they're probably busy blaming the referees to give Miller
too much credit for pulling out the win for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials Dick Bavetta, Hue Hollins and Joe Forte established
early how this game was going to be played, and neither team was
happy about the tempo. The teams were whistled for 68 fouls _ 40 on
the Knicks _ and they combined to shoot 84 free throws, turning the
game into a marathon-like procession to the respective foul lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your best players are sitting over there with you (at the
end of the game), it's not a great feeling,'' said New York coach
Jeff Van Gundy, referring to Larry Johnson, who fouled out with
4:58 to play after scoring a game-high 22 points. ``I guess there
was a statement to be made about whatever I don't really know what
the statement was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana coach Larry Bird wanted to hear none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't be disgruntled over any calls that were made
out there,'' Bird said. ``I thought the officiating was going
haywire out there for a while, so they should be very happy with
calls they got.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's foul shots capped a frantic final minute that saw both
teams take short-lived leads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite trailing by 17 points in the first half, the Knicks
rallied to take a 78-72 lead on Houston's baseline hook shot with
8:24 left in the game. But the Pacers weren't about to fold,
outscoring the Knicks 12-2 over the next five minutes _ a run that
was capped by a three-point play by Dale Davis (15 points and 12
rebounds) that gave Indiana an 84-80 lead with just over three
minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks scored the next six points, four by Ewing, to retake
the lead at 86-84 with 45.5 seconds to play, but Antonio Davis
scored underneath to tie the game with 31.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks brought the ball downcourt, attempting to get one
good look at the basket, but Houston committed a crucial turnover
with 20.4 seconds remaining that gave the Pacers time to work the
ball to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove to the basket, but I probably should have pulled up
for a shot,'' said Houston, who finished with 15 points on 3-of-12
shooting. ``I didn't get a shot up, and in that situation you have
to get a shot up.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Miller's foul shots, the Knicks got one last look at
the basket, throwing the ball nearly the length of the court to
Ewing, who missed a wide-open jumper from the left of the
free-throw line at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a desperation play,'' said Ewing with a shrug. ``I got
a good look and a good shot. I thought it was going to drop, but it
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like some good drama to enliven an already entertaining
show. But as riveting as the show has been so far, the series now
goes on hiatus, resuming Saturday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   And about the only problem the Knicks face as they head back to
New York is dwelling on what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, the only eighth seed to ever make it this far in the
playoffs, could have been going back to New York with a sweep of
the first two games in the Eastern Conference finals but instead go
home with a split.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of disappointed,'' said Ewing, who was limited to 10
points in 25 minutes. ``This is a game that we could've won,
should've won. We had our opportunities, but for whatever reason _
and I'm not even going to dwell on it _ we didn't. Now we have to
come back, regroup and get ready for Saturday.'' &QL;

said, ``told me he would build me two rooms with new tin for the
roof.'' Ms. Toscano never got her new house. Last week, the lawyer
and two women on Long Island were arrested and charged with running
a baby-smuggling ring. Some of the adoptive parents have complained
that the women lured them into illegal agreements by preying on
their desperation to have children. But, worlds away, in this
isolated patch of the U.S.-Mexico border, the view of these
adoption agreements gets even more complicated and tragic. By

YANKEES CRUSH INDIANS, 11-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a year has passed since Roger Clemens was
charged with a loss, but he is not kidding himself. Clemens
embraces the responsibility inherent in being the ace of a staff,
and his legs are not as strong as he wants them to be, he is not
pitching as well as he expects, or as long.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a time this season, presumably, when Clemens takes
off and carries the Yankees, but for now, he continues to win with
a lot of support from his teammates, who bludgeoned the Cleveland
Indians on Tuesday night in an imperfectly played 11-5 victory
before 32,759 at Yankee Stadium. Since last June, Clemens has won
20 consecutive decisions, an American League record that is four
short of the major league mark set by Carl Hubbell of the New York
Giants in 1936-37.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens grinded through a slow start and tired in the seventh
inning, and as he waited on the mound for Manager Joe Torre to
relieve him, Clemens turned and thanked the teammates around him
for playing well, again. Appropriately, Derek Jeter was among
those; he had two hits and drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the sun right now, and the rest of us, we're playing
here on Earth,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter has reached base in all 50 Yankee games this season, which
may explain why Cleveland's Steve Reed drilled Jeter in the left
thigh with a fastball in the eighth inning, apparently retaliating
for the two Indian batters hit by pitches earlier in the game.
Jeter cursed Reed on the way to first base, and after the umpires
made sure both teams remained on their respective benches, Paul
O'Neill hammered a two-run home run _ his first homer since April
27 _ and Jeter trotted deliberately and smirked his way around the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Yankees suspected that Manny Ramirez had used a
corked bat to hit a monstrous home run in Monday's game, but as
expected, the controversy didn't spiral beyond the Yankees' quiet
accusations and the adamant denials by Cleveland Manager Mike
Hargrove. Ramirez went 0 for 5 with two strikeouts, both in at-bats
against Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to pitch against the Mets on Sunday, Clemens said he
has not resumed his usual workouts. He likes long-distance running,
to build his legs, and while with Boston and Toronto, he developed
regular routes in the neighborhoods around the stadium. He hasn't
done this in the Bronx yet, chiefly because he strained his left
hamstring in April and is still rehabilitating.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clemens is lacking his best stuff, his best
command. Early in Tuesday night's game, Clemens did not establish a
consistent breaking ball, or his split-fingered pitch, and his
fastball was not overpowering. He had trouble finishing off
batters. Without having to contend with Clemens's full variety or
his explosive high fastball, the Indians fought off a lot of his
best stuff: In Clemens' first two turns through the Cleveland
lineup, the Indians swung and missed only five times, and fouled
off 17 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But he just kept grinding and grinding, catcher Jorge Posada
said, never giving in, constantly searching for a pitch that would
get him past a crucial hitter and allow him to escape a jam. ``You
see it in his eyes,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Clemens is pulled through those situations by his
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he pitches once every five days, and he's going to do
everything he can on that day he pitches,'' Torre said. ``He just
wants to prove he's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens surrendered a first-inning run, but then the Yankees
came back with two, and a pattern developed: Cleveland tied the
score, 2-2, the Yankees scored the go-ahead run in the third, and
in the next half-inning, the Indians tied it, 3-3. Finally, Jeter
punched a two-run single off Dave Burba (5-2) in the fourth to give
the Yankees breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens finally fought through his mound malaise, his fastball
getting better from inning to inning, his split-fingered fastball
emerging in the fourth inning. Ramirez led off the sixth inning;
with two strikes, Clemens drew back and fired, and Ramirez swung
through. That fastball, teammates agreed later, was the best
Clemens threw all night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens tired in the next inning, telling the pitching coach,
Mel Stottlemyre, that he had some stuff left _ in Clemens code,
that means he was just about finished _ and one out later, Torre
pulled him.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander walked off to cheers and waved his glove, but
later, it was apparent in his face and his tone that Clemens wants
more. He is sure he can pitch better. He is sure he will pitch
better.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ Hitting home runs in each of his first two starts
wasn't enough to make Sean Bergman an honorary Killer B, but he
might have earned his stinger Tuesday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one thing the Killer B's needed as badly as a timely
hit or two, it was a shutout pitching performance to take some of
the heat off their frigid bats.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman delivered in timely fashion, blanking the Milwaukee
Brewers 3-0 in a rain-shortened game at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said of
Bergman's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman's second career shutout was his first since he logged
one for Detroit on Aug. 2, 1995, against Boston. Tuesday's effort
was two innings shy of a traditional blanking because the game was
halted by rain with one out in the top of the eighth inning. But it
still counts.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker was planning to bring Scott Elarton
in from the bullpen in the bottom of the eighth inning, but Mother
Nature was on Bergman's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't want to come out of the game,'' Dierker said
of Bergman. ``He came to me a couple of times trying to get me to
let him stay in. But with the conditions the way they were (cold as
well as wet), I just didn't want to push it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman's strongest showing of the year helped the Astros snap a
season-high four-game losing streak, and it took the focus off
their struggling offense, at least for a day.
</P>
<P>
   The offense wasn't much more impressive than it has been during
a much-publicized funk, but it was just enough to get past the
Brewers, who are mired in last place in the National League
Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros accounted for just five hits, and three of them came
in the decisive three-run seventh inning. They had gone 68 innings
without collecting more than two hits or scoring more than two runs
in the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Johnson's sacrifice fly was the only run the Astros needed,
but Tim Bogar added a little insurance with a two-out, two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, the Astros had the bases loaded with one out and
Carl Everett due to hit when home-plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck
waved the players off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The rain delay lasted 1 hour and 12 minutes, and fewer than 100
of the 15,266 fans who attended the game were still around when it
officially was called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a game gets rained out, I've always believed we
should come back and play it the next day,'' Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio said. ``But that's the way the rules are, and I'm glad
we benefited this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewers starter Scott Karl, who had allowed 14 runs in his last
8 innings, found the perfect tonic for his pitching woes. The
Astros have been more soothing to opposing pitchers than a hot
toddy on a cold night.
</P>
<P>
   The first nine Astros went down in order, with only Biggio, Tony
Eusebio and Johnson managing to hit a ball out of the infield.
Derek Bell ended any premature thoughts of a no-hitter with a
one-out double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl was really sharp,'' Dierker said. ``He was throwing more
hard stuff than we had seen him throw. I felt like we were lucky to
get to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl retired 18 of the first 20 batters he faced, but he ran
into trouble when Bagwell led off the seventh with a single to
left. Everett singled, and Eusebio drew a walk to load the bases
with one out. Bagwell scored on Johnson's sacrifice fly to right.
Bogar, back in the lineup after missing six games because of a
hamstring injury, hit a blast to left field that looked as if it
might be a homer when it left the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was a home run,'' Bogar said. ``I don't hit
enough of them to know when they're gone. I was just glad that I
felt good and that I was seeing the ball well after being out for
six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you really have to give Bergy all of the credit. Our
offense has been struggling, and he went out there and threw up
zeros for seven innings. That's the kind of thing that can really
pick you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who also pitched a complete game at Florida on April
30, retired 10 of the last 13 batters he faced and stranded five
runners in scoring position. He allowed six hits and two walks.
Bergman had gone six starts without issuing more than one walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of guys on base in the first couple of innings,
but the defense made some great plays behind me, and we were able
to have a big inning with the bats,'' Bergman said. ``I wasn't
thinking about being the guy to stop the losing streak or anything
like that. I was just trying to stay focused on the job at hand.
This was a big win for us, and hopefully this will get us rolling
again.''

SOX GO LONG WAY AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-TIGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody wants to get into the act. If it's not the veterans
who are spurring the Red Sox to new heights, it's the new kids on
the block who are getting it done.
</P>
<P>
   No better example can be found than Tuesday night's 5-4 victory
over the Detroit Tigers at Fenway Park. What started out as a
triumphant return by pitcher Bret Saberhagen wound up as a
celebration featuring rookies Trot Nixon and Brian Daubach, who
tied and won the game with homers in the seventh and eighth
innings. The winning pitcher was John Wasdin, who would you believe
has a 5-0 record. Who's writing these scripts?
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Red Sox have a five-game winning streak,
matching their season's best so far. They aren't supposed to be a
power-hitting team, but they belted four homers Tuesday night,
getting contributions up and down the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it has been every night,'' said Daubach, whose
leadoff homer in the eighth was his second game-winner of the
season and second blast in as many days. ``I don't know how I came
through. I guess I'm just lucky in the clutch.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck? This team has had a ton of it lately. Take the ninth
inning, when the Tigers put a man on first base with two outs and
had fleet outfielder Karim Garcia pinch run for Bill Haselman. When
the next batter, Brad Ausmus, hit a double into the gap, Garcia
took off like a deer. But he rounded second like Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, stumbling across the bag. By the time he got up, he
could get only as far as third.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe then struck out Damion Easley to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is doing well right now and I want it to continue,''
said manager Jimy Williams. ``Saberhagen pitched good. All our
pitchers, overall. Our relievers have been asked to do a lot of
things lately. Fortunately, it worked for us tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Nixon and Daubach, you have to say they're more than
just two kids on the team. They go out and compete. They're not
playing like they are rookies. But maybe it's because they're
getting some help from those veteran guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen used up his pitch limit at 77 and had to be relieved
after five innings, but he left with a 3-2 lead, built in part on
homers by Troy O'Leary (No. 10) and Jason Varitek. Jim Corsi held
the fort until he gave up a two-out single to Luis Polonia in the
seventh. Wasdin came in and Ausmus socked his first pitch into the
screen for a two-run homer and a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the bottom of the seventh, Nixon hit a fastball
into the Red Sox bullpen, his first home run at Fenway Park.
Daubach couldn't wait for his turn and teed off against reliever
Doug Brocail in the eighth. Not bad for a couple of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them whack one, it doesn't surprise me,'' said
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   While the frantic finish pleased most of the 26,457 in
attendance, it was the return of Saberhagen that seemed to delight
the Red Sox most. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan pointed out that the
righty threw 13 first-strike pitches (he faced 21 batters). His
velocity was in the low 90s, and through three innings he had
thrown just 38 pitches. But he needed 27 in the fourth inning, and
there was no way the Sox were going to let him go over 80 pitches
after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot of things right,'' said Kerrigan. ``I'd like to
see him go throw six innings, but 77 was enough. Next time we'll go
for 90.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams, ``He did a nice job. After all the rehab, he came
back and was ready to throw. He got 15 outs and came out when we
were ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, predictably, had mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy the way I threw,'' he said. ``I'm disappointed that
I only went five innings. I've always gotten the ball to the
bullpen later in the game. I understood the pitch count tonight. I
just hope I can do a little bit better next time. I was able to
throw all my pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year it's a matter of me staying healthy and being able
to do what I think I can do. I want to pitch a couple of complete
games before it's over. That's my goal right now.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He came to Fenway Park. But he didn't hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox righthander Mark Portugal cleaned out much of his
clubhouse stall after pitching three innings in Monday's win over
Detroit and left the park in a bit of a huff.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he was back to meet with Red Sox brass and talked with
some teammates in the clubhouse before the game, but he was not in
the dugout when it started.
</P>
<P>
   He got together with manager Jimy Williams and then general
manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have a resolution to his status with the
team,'' Duquette told reporters during the game. ``He's still on
the roster. He's considering a couple of different options and he's
got a couple of personal issues he needs to get resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette declined to detail the options or the issues or how the
team might resolve his situation. But he did point out that
Portugal _ who suffered an incomplete dislocation of his left
shoulder while fielding a ball early in Monday's game _ was
healthy. And, Sox officials emphasized, he did not have a problem
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not hurt, so we're not considering the disabled list as
an option,'' Duquette said. ``He's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he did not expect Portugal to be available to the
media in the next couple of days, nor did he expect him around the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met (Tuesday) and we're going to meet again later in the
week,'' Duquette said. ``He's not in uniform (Tuesday night), but
he's on the roster. We've discussed a number of different things,
but we haven't done anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he hoped to have Portugal's situation resolved by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Portugal had brought up the subject of retirement,
Duquette responded, ``Not directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Pat Rapp would take Portugal's place in the
rotation for Sunday's game against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take care of things in-house,'' Williams said. ``It's a
personal matter and we'll deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, 36, had run into a few rough outings of late. He won
his first two games of the year but had just one victory in his
last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   That stretch started with maybe his best performance of the
year, a three-hit, no-walk job at Detroit that he lost, 1-0. He had
two straight no-decisions, then a win, another no-decision, and two
losses before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was against Detroit again Monday that he suffered his
toughest game of the year, leaving after three innings and having
given up six runs on six hits. He hurt his left shoulder in the
second inning but convinced Williams he could continue to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Duquette became aware of Portugal's personal
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had some things on his mind other than pitching,''
Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal is 3-3 with a 5.33 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   While Rapp, who pitched three strong innings in relief Monday,
gets the start Sunday, Saberhagen's return couldn't have come at a
much better time with Portugal out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess so,'' said Saberhagen. ``A few days ago, everyone was
asking who, where, what, and why, and with Mark going down and
having some problems, Pat steps back into his spot almost like he
didn't miss a whole lot because of the way he pitched (Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen saw Portugal both Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's got some things to go over,'' Saberhagen said. ``I know
his knee's been bothering him. His shoulder (Monday) was bothering
him. He needs to kind of sit down and think exactly how he's going
to approach the rest of this. All we can do is offer him support.
We'd like to have him pitching for us.''

<P>
   DENVER _ They were saying all the right things, but no one knew
quite what to expect. Two days earlier, he had been so awful that
his coach wouldn't even comment on his play, and there was little
in Eddie Belfour's history to suggest this was the ideal spot to
bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened between a wretched Sunday afternoon at Reunion
Arena and a remarkable Tuesday night in the Rockies?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a night game,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said with a
smile. ``Eddie is always ready for a night game.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he was ready for this one. With game, season and
perhaps even career on the line, Belfour stopped 26 of 27 Colorado
shots as the Stars stunned the Avalanche 4-1 to extend the NHL
Western Conference finals to a Game 7 Friday night in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie came up big,'' said Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner,
whose two third-period goals broke open a tight game. ``He had a
rough outing, as did the team, in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out and played a great game just when we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Dallas dodged elimination after flirting with
disaster in an ugly 7-5 loss just two days earlier. Now, at the end
of a series in which the home team has won just two of six games,
neither the Stars nor the Avalanche will be taking anything for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only an advantage if you make it one,'' Dallas' Brett
Hull said of heading back to Texas. ``So far, it hasn't meant
much.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be an issue for another night. There will be at least
one more for the Stars because a fellow who looked so awful in
giving up six goals his last time out _ dredging up memories of
big-game meltdowns past _ was able to rebound from one of the worst
big-game performances of his career.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a goal to Claude Lemieux to account for the
game's first score with just 34.9 seconds left in the opening
period, Belfour stared down Colorado's three-time Stanley Cup
winner Patrick Roy the rest of the way. In doing so, he gave Dallas
time to establish control of the style and pace, subtly turning the
game the Stars' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some big saves for us when we needed him,'' Stars
winger Mike Keane said. ``Eddie's a very emotional goaltender, but
he knows we need him to stop pucks for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't make the saves, who knows where we'd be?''
</P>
<P>
   Playing golf today, most likely. The challenge of delaying those
tee times would not be without its anxious moments, though, made
all the more so by Belfour's awful experience in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected him to come back, just like the rest of us,''
center Mike Modano said. ``We needed a big game, and Eddie gave us
one.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jere Lehtinen's roofer beat Roy 1:55 into the second
period, the teams stayed tied into the third. As Dallas clung to
postseason life, the Avalanche tried to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 1-1 after two periods, and whoever got that next goal
was a big difference,'' Colorado's Joe Sakic said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Langenbrunner got it, picking up a rebound of a Joe
Nieuwendyk shot and poking it past an off-balance Roy at 6:49. The
Stars nursed the one-goal edge for the next 10 minutes before
cashing in twice in 14 seconds _ the first on a power-play goal by
Langenbrunner, the second on a shot off a faceoff by Richard
Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, a series of strange plot twists was going the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest: We played a very solid first period, but the
second and third (Dallas) played extremely well,'' said Roy, who
has been beaten nine times in the last two games. ``Give them
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, in particular, seemed due for some. His rocky moments
were a big part of Dallas' demise in last year's conference finals,
and he was the focus of much of the attention heading into this
make-or-break Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Would Eddie ``The Eagle'' lay another egg? The McNichols crowd
did its best to goad him with the standard derisive chants, but
Belfour was not to be had.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to stay as calm as you can,'' he said. ``But there
were a few butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   To win it, Belfour did his best to tap into happier thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since you are little kids, you're always playing for the
Stanley Cup and pretend it's Game 7,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he did in those games, Belfour allowed a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we always won,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the real thing, it hasn't been quite so simple, as Belfour
has yet to see his name etched on the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Dallas moved a step closer. The fellow at the
center of the storm did all but assure it.

HILL LIFTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Yes, the Texas Rangers have won eight in a row
and are threatening to run away with the American League West. Yes,
the Anaheim Angels are in last place, 6{ games out, their biggest
deficit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels have something positive to focus on: June.
</P>
<P>
   With Angels starter Ken Hill coming within one strike of
throwing the club's first complete-game shutout of the season, the
Angels began June much like they finished June of last season. By
winning _ this time 5-1 over the Minnesota Twins before 17,003 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Last June the Angels went 22-6, their best month in club
history. Ever the optimist, Angels manager Terry Collins pointed
out that their record of 25-27 is not much different than last
year's mark at this point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through 52 games last year we were 26-26, just a couple games
off the pace,'' he said. ``Are we happy? No, of course not. But you
look at the whole situation and you have to be optimistic. The most
important thing is to keep the confidence up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill did his part, coming so close to throwing the first shutout
by an Angels pitcher since Chuck Finley blanked the Devil Rays on
April 17, 1998. But the Twins' Corey Koskie homered with two out in
the ninth on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hill threw a season-high 123 pitches at that point, so Collins
replaced him with Mark Petkovsek, who needed only one pitch to get
the final out and end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's only other trouble came in the fifth inning, when he
walked the first two batters. But he got Todd Walker to hit into a
4-6-3 double play, then got Denny Hocking on a comebacker,
stranding the only Twins baserunner to reach third.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Angels' offense came from Randy Velarde and Troy
Glaus. Velarde went 2 for 4, including his fifth home run of the
season; Glaus went 2 for 3, including his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was an especially good sign for Glaus, who was benched May 27
after his average had dipped to .226. In the five games since,
Glaus is 5 for 12 with two homers.
</P>
<P>
   This night, however, belonged to Hill (2-4), who won for the
first time in six starts. He gave up five hits, struck out six and
walked three.

EDMONDS PAYS A RARE VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There was a rare Jim Edmonds sighting Tuesday
afternoon in the Anaheim Angels clubhouse. Edmonds had shoulder
surgery April 22, and Tuesday's was the first time he made an
appearance in the clubhouse before a game with other players
around.
</P>
<P>
   While Edmonds said he was here to see some friends, an Angels
official confirmed Edmonds picked up his paycheck. He's making
$3.55 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   Some Angels players have voiced their displeasure with Edmonds'
decision to have surgery after the season started instead of during
the offseason. But while those same players have said the situation
was blown out of proportion, many find it strange that Edmonds is
not doing his rehabilitation work with team trainers at the team
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' therapy is performed by Dr. David Bradley at Newport
Physical Therapy in Newport Beach. Asked about Edmonds' condition,
Bradley said: ``I was told (by the Angels) not to say anything.
Everything has to go through the head trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds spent most of his time in the clubhouse speaking with
Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Contract talks: Angels manager Terry Collins is negotiating a
contract extension. Collins initially signed a two-year deal before
the 1997 season and the club picked up the option for 1999. He is
believed to be making about $400,000 per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' Collins said. ``Managers' jobs are hard to
get, and I've got a good one. I've got good people to work with,
good coaches, good players _ it's a great place.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said getting a deal taken care off, possibly a two-year
extension, makes his job easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps,'' he said. ``When I was in Houston, it was
constantly an issue all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he didn't believe a report that players have gone
to general manager Bill Bavasi to complain about him. But he admits
he will always have detractors in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never going to be a manager in the game that can
please 25 guys. It's impossible,'' he said. ``You make decisions,
and any decision you make, somebody's not going to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Skipping Sparks: The Angels will skip pitcher Steve Sparks' spot
in the starting rotation because his spot falls on Thursday's
off-day and Collins doesn't want any of his other starters to get
off their regular routine.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks is coming off one of his best performances of the season
_ 81/3 innings, three runs, five hits in a victory over Kansas City
on Saturday. Sparks took a shutout into the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Said Collins: ``One guy was going to have to be the guy and
Sparks was the guy. (But) I know Steve won his last start and
deserves to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene in right: Todd Greene was penciled into Tuesday's game as
the starting catcher, but his bruised right shoulder _ a result of
his homeplate collision Monday with Twins catcher Terry Steinbach _
wouldn't allow him to catch. However, he was in the starting lineup
in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Greene had surgery on his right shoulder in October of 1997 and
has made a slow recovery. He's caught only 10 games this season,
but said he didn't have a choice but to try to run over Steinbach
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't slide in that situation, he has the whole plate
blocked, Greene said. ``I'd slide right into his shinguard. ...
Hopefully I'll have the ability to go in with my left side (in the
future).
</P>
<P>
   Ahead: The Angels and Twins play the final game of their
three-game series tonight starting at 7:35. Chuck Finley (3-5, 5.15
ERA) will start for Anaheim against Minnesota's Brad Radke (4-4,
3.82).

HOMESTORE.COM APPLIES FOR IPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- HomeStore.com Inc., a collection of three real
estate Web sites, registered Tuesday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to hold a $100 million initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had revenues of $5.5 million for the quarter
ended March 31 and $19.1 million for all of 1998, said it hopes to
raise money with the IPO to make its sites the premier real estate
destinations on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the SEC, HomeStore's three
sites are already the most heavily trafficked collection of real
estate Web sites on the Internet. David Rosenblatt, the group's
vice president of marketing, said that data compiled by Media
Metrix, an Internet traffic monitor, found the company's sites are
receiving about 1.8 million unique visitors each month.
</P>
<P>
   The HomeStore sites include Realtor.com, the official Internet
site of the National Association of Realtors; HomeBuilder.com, the
home site of the National Association of Home Builders; and
CommercialSource.com, a site targeting commercial real estate
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced plans last month to buy SpringStreet.com,
a San Jose-based site that provides renters with apartment
listings.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore's various sites generate revenue from advertising and
by renting out Web space to other Realtors. The company said,
however, that it has consistently lost money and expects to operate
at a loss for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore's planned IPO will be underwritten by Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette; Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co.; and BancBoston Robertson Stephens acting as co-managers.

AVONDALE TO SIGN LITTON BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In a marriage of two major military shipbuilders,
Avondale Industries Inc. has agreed to a $529 million buyout by
Litton Industries Inc. but will give a rival bidder two days to up
its offer, the companies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's new offer bests its original $500 million bid announced
May 6 and tops an earlier $470 million offer from Newport News
Shipbuilding Inc. that Avondale had already accepted. That deal
also won Pentagon approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, terms allowed New Orleans-based Avondale to consider
more lucrative bids and Litton subsequently made an unsolicited
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale has informed Newport News of its intent to terminate
the merger agreement and said it intends to sign Litton's offer
following the expiration of a 48-hour deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Newport News officials declined comment on the development, said
company spokeswoman Jerri Dickseski.
</P>
<P>
   The Litton-Avondale merger would leave Litton as the
third-largest Naval contractor, behind No. 1 General Dynamics and
No. 2 Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Litton is also trying to purchase Newport
News for $1.9 billion, a combination opposed by the Pentagon.
However, the government indicated Friday that it does not object to
the Litton-Avondale merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely pleased that Avondale's board has recognized
the superior value of our all-cash proposal. We look forward to
executing this agreement, which will create a world-class
shipbuilder,'' Michael D. Brown, Litton's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's offer works out to $39.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Keith Patriquin at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. in Boston said
the deal enhances Litton's economies of scale when it comes to
shipbuilding and should impact earnings positively in the near
term.
</P>
<P>
   It improves the company's political clout, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purchase will benefit Litton from a strategic standpoint
by giving them a stronger voice of power with the Defense
Department, Congress and within the shipbuilding industry,''
Patriquin said.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs would probably be kept to a minimum and Litton has
indicated that Avondale's senior management would be retained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still expect there will be opportunity to grow and there
are some advantages to combining our strengths and add value to the
customer and increase value to the shareholders,'' said Avondale
spokesman Ed Winter. ``The (new) company should be able to compete
better in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Litton's Ingalls Shipbuilding unit based in Pascagoula, Miss.,
designs and manufactures surface combat ships for the U.S. Navy and
allied nations. Although both Litton and Avondale build amphibious
and commercial vessels, there will be little overlap in the merger,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that a preliminary
assessment by the Navy of a Litton-Newport News merger found that a
reduction in competition among shipbuilders did not outweigh cost
savings to the government.
</P>
<P>
   That deal would leave the government with just two providers of
combat ships, Litton and General Dynamics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Newport News, which builds aircraft carriers and nuclear
submarines, has a distinctly different product line from Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   Patriquin said that Litton's cost savings estimates may have
been on the conservative side so as not to upset politicians whose
districts may have been hit with job cuts because of the
three-company merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that strategy may have been an error because the
government seems to say they want more cost savings and that can be
changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Newport News rose 56.25 cents to close at $28.0625.
Litton shares rose 18.75 cents to $65.375. Avondale rose $1.65625
to $38.15625.

HILL LIFTS ANGELS OVER TWINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Yes, the Texas Rangers have won eight in a row
and are threatening to run away with the American League West. Yes,
the Anaheim Angels are in last place, 6{ games out, their biggest
deficit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels have something to positive to focus on: June.
</P>
<P>
   With starter Ken Hill coming within one strike of throwing the
club's first complete-game shutout of the season, the Angels
defeated the Minnesota Twins 5-1 on Tuesday before 17,003 at Edison
Field, and the Angels began June much as they finished June of last
season: by winning.
</P>
<P>
   Last June the Angels went 22-6, their best month in club
history. Ever the optimist, Angels manager Terry Collins pointed
out their record of 25-27 is not much different than last year's
mark at this point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through 52 games last year we were 26-26, just a couple games
off the pace,'' he said. ``Are we happy? No, of course not. But you
look at the whole situation and you have to be optimistic. The most
important thing is to keep the confidence up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill did his part, coming close to throwing the first shutout by
an Angels pitcher since Chuck Finley blanked the Devil Rays on
April 17, 1998. But with two outs, the Twins' Corey Koskie homered
in the ninth on a 3-2 pitch to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had made a season-high 123 pitches at that point, so
Collins replaced him with Mark Petkovsek, who needed only one pitch
to get the final out and end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's only other trouble came in the fifth inning when he
walked the first two batters. But he got Todd Walker to hit into a
4-6-3 double play, then got Denny Hocking on a comebacker,
stranding the only Twins baserunner to reach third until Koskie's
homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got out of sync a little bit,'' Hill said of the walks in
the fifth. ``I started to think about my mechanics, and that's the
last thing I need to do. But I gathered myself and made a pitch to
Todd Walker and got out of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Angels' offense came from Randy Velarde and Troy
Glaus. Velarde went 2 for 4, including his fifth homer of the
season; Glaus went 2 for 3, including his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was an especially good sign for Glaus, who was benched May 27
after his average had dipped to .226. In the four games since,
Glaus is 5 for 12 with two homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not trying to muscle the ball, and he's putting a good
swing on it,'' Collins said. ``He's shortened his swing a little
and he's seeing the ball good. He's taking balls down and away that
he wasn't 10 days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This night, however, belonged to Hill (2-4), who won for the
first time in six starts, his previous win coming April 29. He gave
up five hits, struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great. I felt as good in the ninth as I did in the
first,'' Hill said, adding that losing the shutout was not a
disappointment. ``The biggest thing is getting a win, no matter how
you get it. We needed a win. I needed a win. It's been rough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all pitchers, he lives with command,'' Collins said.
``When he throws good, he spots his fastball. Tonight he was doing
that. He was also throwing other pitches. He threw splits when he
was behind in the count, and when you do that, it keeps people off
your fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 1-0 lead in the third inning after Glaus
doubled, went to third on a grounder to second by Matt Walbeck and
scored on Andy Sheets' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels knocked Twins starter Mike Lincoln (1-8) out of the
game in the fourth after Garret Anderson (double) and Todd Greene
(single) each drove in a run with basehits, giving the Angels a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus and Velarde homered in the seventh and eighth innings,
respectively, to give the Angels and Hill a 5-0 lead entering the
ninth.

ORIOLES SOLVE GARCIA IN RUNAWAY WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It wasn't the inning from Hell, but the Mariners still
felt flames lapping at the feet of their yearling pitchers for
nearly a half-hour Tuesday night at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   When all the ashes were pushed aside, as well as rookie starter
Freddy Garcia and first-year reliever Jordan Zimmerman, the
Baltimore Orioles had sent six runs across in the sixth inning to
break a 4-4 tie and punish the M's with an eventual 14-11 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The home club made things interesting in the ninth inning with
five runs _ including home runs by Russ Davis and Dan Wilson _ all
off former teammate Mike Timlin. Davis, in fact, had two homers for
the evening, his 13th and 14th. But the damage had long been done.
</P>
<P>
   This 28-hit, 11-pitcher epic was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, the Mariners were bruised for a 14-batter,
eight-run fourth inning by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, suffering
through 44 minutes of despair en route to a 15-7 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve Orioles marched to the plate this time. Half faced
Zimmerman, and none of them went away unhappy. Five got hits, the
other got hit.
</P>
<P>
   Making just his seventh big-league appearance, Zimmerman was
called on to rescue Garcia from a two-on, one-out situation with
the game deadlocked at 4. Zimmerman didn't come up for air. Most of
the 21,597 fans went out for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have my stuff tonight,'' said Zimmerman, who had
given up just two harmless hits in his previous outings. ``It
seemed like everything I threw up there, they hit. It's just one
bad game. I'm sure there are going to be plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   As this one quickly got away from the Mariners, the crowd turned
their loud invective on manager Lou Piniella, obviously displeased
with Garcia's departure time.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the move, Piniella said Garcia was struggling and
Zimmerman had been virtually unhittable. Five of the upcoming
Baltimore hitters were lefties; it was a natural move. Plus, Garcia
had exceeded a 100-pitch limit, one strictly enforced with the
Mariners using a four-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan just didn't get it done tonight, but he'll be all
right,'' the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia wasn't at his best, but he wasn't exactly throwing
batting practice either. Through four innings, the righthander had
a 4-1 lead and a clear shot at picking up his seventh victory in
eight decisions. Ken Griffey Jr. helped put him out front, doubling
in a run in the first and singling home two in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia (6-2) couldn't stay out of trouble, giving up three
runs in the fifth. His big mistake was plunking Brady Anderson with
an 0-2 pitch with one out and the bases clear. Delino Deshields and
B.J. Surhoff followed with run-scoring doubles and Harold Baines
knotted the game with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Garcia gave up a leadoff single to Cal Ripken Jr.
He had a chance to avoid major damage when the next hitter, Mike
Bordick, skipped a grounder up the middle. M's shortstop Alex
Rodriguez dove and gloved the ball, but couldn't make the flip to
second for the force and a possible double play.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia came back to strike out the next batter, Charles Johnson.
But his evening was over. The Venezuelan was yanked in favor of
Zimmerman, having exceeded the all-important pitch count. A couple
more might have prevented considerable discomfort. When the inning
ended, Baltimore was up 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, the Mariner rookie pitchers emerged from this mess
wearing brave faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't at all frustrated,'' Zimmerman said. ``A couple guys
hit good pitches. A couple guys hit bad pitches, which really
surprised me. You make mistakes up here, they're going to jump on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia, ``I have no excuses. I felt pretty good tonight. I
felt strong. It happens.''

MISS BROWN'S `BABIES' BOUND FOR COLLEGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By THAAI WALKER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  OAKLAND, Calif. _ Some call her Miss Brown. To others, she's
Mama.
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Oral Lee Brown stood before a class of 23
first-graders at Brookfield Elementary in Oakland, looked into
their small brown faces and told them: I am not here to take the
place of your parents. I am here to try to help you be the best
person you can be.
</P>
<P>
   This month, 19 of those youngsters will receive their high
school diplomas. Miss Brown will be at each ceremony _ nine
graduations in all. And in the fall she will send them all to
college.
</P>
<P>
   It is the promise she made all those years ago _ to shepherd
them through elementary, middle and high schools, to help them get
into college and to pay their way once there.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the Oakland Realtor has put $10,000 into a trust
fund. The money has come out of her own pocket; set aside from
commissions made selling working-class homes in East Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The money will help pay for tuition and housing at schools such
as San Francisco State University, Georgia Tech, Clark University
and Merritt College.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise Miss Brown made to ``the babies'' as she calls
them, was about more than just money and schooling. She promised to
be hard on them when they deserved it; to put her arms around them
when they needed a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like a second mother,'' Teisha Beverly, 17, says of Miss
Brown, who has been on her case lately because her grades have
slipped. Teisha, who wants to be a nurse, plans to attend Oakland's
Merritt College in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to her with any problems you have _ things you
can't tell your parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Now high school seniors, the youths are scattered throughout
schools in Oakland and other parts of the East Bay _ one lives as
far away as St. Louis. But Miss Brown has kept her eye on all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brown is not the first one to go into a community where
poverty is abundant and hope is scarce, and promise to give a group
of children a shot at a future they might not otherwise have.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known of such benefactors is Eugene Lang, who
18 years ago promised 61 Harlem sixth-graders that if they stayed
in school, he would pay their college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Lang and other philanthropists who have followed
suit, Miss Brown, 54, is not rich. She lives in the same struggling
community her children do. Reared in rural Mississippi, she, too,
grew up in a place where dreams were hard to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Miss Brown grew up, she had a hard life, just like
ours,'' says Michael Tatmon, a Castlemont High School student who
plans to attend Louisiana's Southern University in the fall and who
knows without a doubt that he will be famous someday.
</P>
<P>
   It would not feel the same, Michael says, if Miss Brown had come
from a world different than his.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a child, Miss Brown would sit on the long front
porch of the small wooden house she shared with 12 brothers and
sisters, her parents and a grandmother. She would look into the sky
and watch crop-dusting planes flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, she would say aloud to a sister, I'm going to fly high
in the sky just like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did lots of dreaming,'' she says from inside her small
windowless office in the East Oakland realty company she has run
for the past 20 years, a smile touching her face.
</P>
<P>
   Reality had a way of doing things to dreams if you were black
and living in Mississippi in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Reality was a young black boy named Emmitt Till; lynched for the
transgression of whistling at a white woman. Reality was knowing
from an early age that you stepped off the sidewalk into the road
if a white person was headed your way.
</P>
<P>
   She got two pairs of shoes a year _ one for church, the other
for school. In the summer she went barefoot. Her dresses were made
out of 50-pound flour sacks.
</P>
<P>
   She was 18 when she came to Oakland on a Greyhound bus to live
with an older brother. Over the next few years she went to college,
raised three daughters (one died in 1977), got married, then
divorced and worked a variety of jobs: a hairdresser, a dispatcher
and a file clerk. She opened the realty company in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``God had gotten me out of Mississippi,'' she remembers thinking
in 1987. ``I figured I'd work another four or five years and then
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   But one afternoon, while heading to a corner store for a snack,
she was stopped on the street by a little girl who asked her for a
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brown took the child with her to the store. She thought the
girl, who looked about 9, would simply buy some potato chips, but
the child picked up a loaf of bread, some cheese and bologna.
</P>
<P>
   As they left the store, Miss Brown asked her: Where is your
mother? Don't you go to school?
</P>
<P>
   ``At home'' and ``sometimes'' were the answers. They went
separate ways at the corner. Miss Brown never saw her again.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to work bothered, and the troubled feeling would
not leave her. Three weeks later she phoned the principal at
Brookfield Elementary, a school where most students are black and
poor and college is often not even a dream, much less an
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   She told Principal Yolanda Peeks: I want to adopt a class. I
want the kids no one expects to go anywhere in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I wanted to be able to go to the school every week
to see about my babies,'' Miss Brown recalls, ``that I wanted to
tutor them, talk to them and that when 1999 rolled around _ which
seemed like a long time to me _ the kids would go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 years, there have been nights, at the end of long
demanding days divided between running her business and tending to
the children, that she has gone home bone weary, climbed into bed
and cried. It was all much harder than she had ever envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as the days whittle down to when the children will don
caps and gowns, she is both elated and sad _ sad that four of the
original 23 children will not graduate because of their grades.
</P>
<P>
   It sits heavy on her mind and heart. She has gone over it again
and again in her head, ``What could I have done differently?''
``Did I do enough?'' Once she even asked the four: ``Where did I go
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   They told her she had done everything right.
</P>
<P>
   She has bought some of them shoes when they had none. She has
fed them when their was no food in their homes. Every year there
are Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   She has taken them on outings to show them the world that exists
beyond East Oakland. Once she took them to a farm in Manteca so she
could teach them how to milk a cow.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she took them on a tour of colleges. They went to
out-of-state schools such as Morehouse, Spelman and Georgia Tech.
Most of the youngsters had never been on an airplane before.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brown got the biggest thrill watching the looks on their
faces as the plane rose high into the sky.

   MORTGAGE DOOR OPENS WIDE FOR MANY BUYERSBy RAMON G. MCLEOD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Getting a home loan used to be a pretty big deal, something you
sweated out as you prayed that the banker would overlook that old
late payment on your gas card.
<P>
   But now we live in an easy-credit world, a time when
unsolicited, preapproved, $75,000 equity lines come in the mail and
the 20 percent down payment for a house is ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   The shift started in the early '90s with a confluence of events
_ the newly elected Clinton administration's desire to curb
redlining, industry innovation that allowed for more home loans and
new technology for determining whether borrowers are likely to pay
their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Without those changes, it would be hard to comprehend the kind
of price increases and bidding wars that have characterized the Bay
Area housing boom. Even with the robust economy, very few people
could pony up the $60,000-plus it would take for a down payment on
a $300,000 home under the traditional mortgage lending system. But
now, much smaller down payments _ often less than 5 percent _ are
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   And while the credit revolution of the '90s has made home loans
easier to get for everyone, it has dramatically boosted home
ownership rates for minorities, who are now the fastest-growing
group of homeowners in the nation. Data are sketchy for single
women, but mortgage brokers say that this group, too, has greatly
benefited from new credit practices and rules.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1998, home ownership for white households increased
by 3.4 percent. But it increased by 8.6 percent for African
Americans and by 13.5 percent for Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were programs for us in 1993 that just weren't there
before,'' said Reg Moore, an African American meter reader who
bought a home in Antioch that year with his wife, DiShon, and their
four children.
</P>
<P>
   The home, an attractive, modern, 2,000-square-foot home with
five bedrooms on a quiet street, was priced at $163,000 in 1993,
which would have been out of reach for the Moores if they had been
required to put down 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to put relatively little down on the house,
though it was a lot of money to us ($12,000),'' he said, ``and we
got an adjustable loan that really made it possible to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest downside connected to changes in lending
practices has been a troubling rise in personal bankruptcy rates,
usually blamed on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, mortgage default rates have stayed low and
steady, meaning that the ``nontraditional'' homebuyers are good
about paying their mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people get themselves overencumbered, it happens after they
buy their house,'' said Ginny Ferguson, co-owner of Heritage Valley
Mortgage in Pleasanton. ``Credit cards are far too available to
people, and some people mistake all the offers they get as some
kind of validation that they can run up their bills. That's where
the trouble usually comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Today in the Bay Area, more than 52 percent of homebuyers are
buying their first home, according to 1998 data from the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America. This is a major shift from the
1980s, when the overwhelming majority of buyers were existing
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more remarkable is that this is happening in the
costliest housing market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind that if things had not
changed, there would be very few first-timers buying houses in the
Bay Area,'' said Hannah Goody, owner of Goody Mortgage and
Investments in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people come in with a minimum down payment because it is
too hard to save up $40,000 or $50,000,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what helped first-time buyers like Elena Pushnova.
</P>
<P>
   A single Russian immigrant, she has a limited credit history and
minimal personal savings. She has a good job as a molecular
biologist, earning about $56,000 annually, but a decade ago, a
person with her background would have been sneered out of most
banks.
</P>
<P>
   However, with a little help from her friends, a good credit
record and a willingness to live frugally, she was able to buy a
1,100-square-foot A-frame home last year in Oakland's Montclair
district. The home cost $209,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, I had to start from scratch. I needed
clothes, furniture, everything. I came here with a suitcase and
$50,'' she said. ``By '96 I was starting to save, but it looked
like many years before I would have enough to put a down payment on
a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I started hearing that I could do it without a lot of
down payment. So I borrowed $8,000 from friends and I was able to
get a mortgage that had a special program for new buyers. ... I got
$2,500 cash back in closing costs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, people like Pushnova and the
Moores would probably have been excluded from the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   However, three things happened in the 1990s that dramatically
altered the home-buying landscape:
</P>
<P>
   --Political pressure. Reports of denying credit _ called
``redlining'' _ to people living in minority neighborhoods led the
newly elected Clinton administration to pressure the industry for
easier credit.
</P>
<P>
   --Industry innovation. The so-called ``secondary market'' has
grown, providing the industry with a steady flow of cash to lend
from the sale of mortgages to the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
(Freddie Mac), two federally chartered, but private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   --Credit scoring. Technology was developed that accurately
predicts whether a person will pay bills on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting history, one that most people outside the
industry don't know. But it was one of those rare times when you've
got a real win-win situation,'' said Brian Carey, a spokesman for
the mortgage bankers association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1993, after a major refinancing wave, there was excess
capacity in the market. There was more money to lend than there
were customers. At the same time, there was a big push on by the
Clinton administration to reach out to nontraditional and minority
home buyers. There was real acknowledgment that there are these
markets that were underserved and that helped push along new
programs with no down payments and low down payments,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of that ``secondary market'' for mortgages has
made a substantial difference in the availability of money for home
loans, said Michael Carney, executive director of the Northern
California Real Estate Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system that was typical through the early 1980s, home
loans were made by savings and loan associations, which, with their
limited reserves, eventually would find themselves without any
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically it worked this way: I give you money and you give me
the note and trust deed. But eventually I have no more money to
lend and my primary asset becomes the IOUs, the notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This created liquidity problems for the S&AMP;Ls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, President Richard Nixon signed a law that authorized
Fannie Mae, a quasi-federal agency, to purchase conventional loans
from lenders. That same year, Congress also created Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Both these entities are private, stockholder-owned corporations,
with very similar purposes: They buy mortgages from lenders,
package the mortgages into securities and then sell the securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some time, but this brought a great deal of liquidity
to the market,'' Carney said. ``Instead of just holding the loan
paper as an asset, the S&AMP;L sells them to Fannie Mae, which gives
them cash so that they can in turn loan out more money.''
</P>
<P>
   The last piece of the equation that has revolutionized lending
has been credit scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit scoring is a method of projecting who is likely to pay
or not pay,'' said Sally Taylor Shoff, director of credit bureau
products for Fair, Isaac of San Rafael, the national leader in
developing the software used by banks and credit bureaus to
generate credit scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has really done is to allow credit granters to be
precise in the kind and amount of credit they are willing to issue
to an individual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically speaking, what this means is that even people with
poor scores won't be turned down as much as they will get
alternative credit offers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even a bad credit risk can get a loan, although
it will have a higher interest rate than that given a person with a
good history.
</P>
<P>
   The way it basically works is that an individual's credit
history is matched with a computer model that is based on patterns
of repayment of people with similar histories to the credit
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A score won't tell you that this particular person won't
pay,'' she said. ``It will tell you that this person is part of a
group, 90 percent of whom will pay their loan. It is up to the
lender to then decide whether they want to assume this risk and to
price their loan accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, because scoring can accurately predict default risk,
individuals are allowed to carry a much higher amount of debt than
once was thought safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit scoring really revolutionized the whole industry,''
said Karen Christie, an analyst with Bank Rate Monitor, a lending
industry watchdog group. ``There really were points at which people
would be cut off from credit because of some pretty unscientific
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the not-so-distant past, a lender would be
reluctant to give a mortgage to people who would be spending more
than 36 percent of their gross income on mortgage, credit cards and
all other debt repayment. Lenders today routinely go beyond that
old standard.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it possible for someone like Pushnova, whose
obligations total about 40 percent of her gross income, to get her
mortgage, Christie said.
</P>
<P>
   Pushnova said the $1,900 she has to pay each month for her
insurance, taxes and mortgage do require her to be smarter about
her money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I've had to tighten my belt, but I'm not starving. I
go out with friends to restaurants and to the jazz clubs,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have my house.''

FEDERAL PROGRAM OFFERS $16 BILLION FOR S.F. BAY AREA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By REBECCA SMITH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Fannie Mae will pump $16 billion into Bay Area
home lending during the next five years and will make it easier for
immigrants and public-transit commuters to buy houses under a major
initiative announced in San Francisco Tuesday.
<P>
   This is the largest commitment to a single region in the housing
corporation's 61-year history. The $16 billion will be spread among
nine counties, with at least $2 billion earmarked for San
Francisco, where the median price for a home is well over $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, the nickname of the Federal National Mortgage
Association, will not lend the money directly to homebuyers.
Instead, it promises to buy $16 billion worth of loans from
mortgage lenders, thus encouraging financial institutions to make
home loans.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae announced the initiative at San Francisco's City Hall
Tuesday. It said the program should help 100,000 Bay Area residents
buy homes during the next five years. In addition to the overall
$16 billion loan commitment, Fannie Mae introduced two new loan
programs:
</P>
<P>
   -- The New Immigrants Initiative will let those who have applied
for permanent resident status (``green cards'') pool money for a
down payment and share the monthly mortgage expense.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an extended family wanting to buy a $200,000 home
could qualify for a 97 percent loan, as long as all adult members _
who may be parents, children, aunts and uncles _ have been living
together at least 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   All they would have to do is come up with a $6,000 down payment
(3 percent of the loan amount) and combine their incomes to come up
with the minimum $55,400 income required to qualify for a $194,000
loan.
</P>
<P>
   The ``boarders'' who, technically are not borrowers, would be
allowed to contribute up to 30 percent of the qualifying household
income, or $16,600, in this example.
</P>
<P>
   The program breaks many traditional rules of lending by allowing
people without citizenship or green cards to take out a mortgage.
In addition, the pooling eliminates the usual requirement that
borrowers come up with a down payment without using funds from
friends or family.
</P>
<P>
   Although the program is directed at immigrants, it is also open
to American families living under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   -- A Location Efficient Mortgage program lets people who ride
public transit to work qualify for a loan with less income than
people who drive. The rationale is that public-transit riders spend
less on car upkeep and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This program is being tested in the Bay Area, Seattle and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae says it will buy at least $25 million worth of these
commuter loans, and will work with lenders, local transit officials
and the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit
environmental organization, to develop software that will determine
income requirements.
</P>
<P>
   A third program focuses on existing homeowners in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae said it will provide assistance for seismic upgrades,
such as installation of foundation bolts or cripple walls. The
Disaster Prevention Loan Program will provide financing for loans
of up to $20,000 with repayment terms of up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are no income limitations for the earthquake program. The
interest rate has not yet been set, though Fannie Mae pledged to
make it ``a competitive interest rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenders said the programs seem well suited to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't for everyone, but for certain segments of the
community, they will make the difference between qualifying for a
home loan and not qualifying,'' said Dottie Sheppick, a mortgage
lender with Countrywide Home Loans in Calabasas (Los Angeles
County), one of the largest lenders to minorities in America.
</P>
<P>
   Following criticism a decade ago that its lending criteria were
too rigid, Fannie Mae has been trying to come up with more flexible
loan programs.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it received a healthy dose of inspiration from
California public officials, including San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown and U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, who were both at Tuesday's
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish Fannie Mae came up with this in the 1980s when I
was mayor,'' joked Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he began pushing Fannie Mae to ``get realistic''
about the housing crisis when he became chairman of the housing
committee for the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coup to get this kind of a commitment for Bay Area
affordable housing,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae executives said they realize that traditional
underwriting standards do not work in places with extremely high
housing costs. Though most lenders want to cap mortgage costs at no
more than 28 percent of household income, many renters pay
substantially more and could devote more of their income to a
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to see that we're doing everything we
can to broaden the scope of what we do in the Bay Area,'' said Ted
Chandler, vice president of housing and community development for
Fannie Mae's western region in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   The programs will be promoted by lenders for residents
throughout the nine-county Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fannie Mae purchased $300 million worth of San
Francisco mortgage loans. Nationally, it purchased $400 billion
worth of purchase loans and refinance loans, providing capital to
lenders that they can recycle into new loans.

GIVING VENT TO DUST MITE FRIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
I used to be concerned. Now I'm scared.
<P>
   An ad that runs regularly in this paper for a home
air-duct-cleaning outfit used to feature a drawing of a dust mite,
about the size of a dime, with the caption ``Not life-size.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the ad has a new drawing, much more graphic and scary, and
the mite has grown to the size of a silver dollar, and there's no
more ``Not life-size'' disclaimer.
</P>
<P>
   If one of these megamites were to crawl out of a vent, small
children could ride it. Puff the Magic Dust Mite.
</P>
<P>
   The duct-cleaning operation, screams the ad, ``helps eliminate
DUST MITES BREEDING in your vents!''
</P>
<P>
   So that's what all that noise is.
</P>
<P>
   The mite in the drawing looks like a plucked, headless, mutated
turkey. It would give George Lucas the creeps.
</P>
<P>
   Clean my ducts, hell. I'm going to spray my ducts with
automatic-weapons fire, then weld closed the vent openings.
</P>
<P>
   CASA JOE: Marilyn Monroe slept there. So did the Yankee Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into celebrity ghosts, the late Joe DiMaggio's house
at 2150 Beach St. in the Marina is a steal at $1.4 mil.
</P>
<P>
   Joe bought the place for his parents for $14,600 after he signed
with the Yankees in '37 for $15,000. Who knows how he squandered
the other $400?
</P>
<P>
   So far, no prospective buyer, says broker Joan Smith. The price
might be a little above the going rate, but consider that Joe's '91
Mercedes, Blue-Booked at $18,000, just sold for $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy the house, you'll have to BYO Joltin' Joe
memorabilia. The only trace of the Clipper is the rusty nails Joe
pounded into the knotty pine walls of the rec room (converted
garage) to hang pictures and plaques on.
</P>
<P>
   One day, plumbers working in that trophy room broke a pipe.
DiMaggio heard the commotion, ran downstairs, grabbed one of his
old No. 5 New York jerseys and began mopping up the floor with it.
</P>
<P>
   Mama mia! That's like Da Vinci using the Mona Lisa to bash out a
brushfire.
</P>
<P>
   STILL GRAPPLING with the Y2K problem, the Rite Aid pharmacy in
Oakland's Rockridge district filled Allen Matthews' prescription
and gave the expiration date as May of 2200.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized printout also listed Matthews' birth date as
1897.
</P>
<P>
   So the medicine will be fresh for two more centuries, while
Matthews, who doesn't look a day over 40, is due to expire at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   WARM MEMORIES of Candlestick Park: That's today's oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   I take a back seat to no one in my disdain for the blah and
blustery ball barn. But as Bruce Adams points out, the 'Stick had
(and has) one thing that the new ballpark won't have _ seats.
</P>
<P>
   Available and affordable seats for average fans, that is. I miss
the old meat locker already, and it's not even gone.
</P>
<P>
   FORGET LOTTO: The Super Lotto jackpot is up around $30 mil, but
don't waste your money.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Sanfilippo has it in the bag. He won a $33 mil jackpot
seven years ago and immediately predicted he'd win another $30
mil-plus seven years hence.
</P>
<P>
   That would be now. Dennis' lucky numbers are 7 and 11. It's been
seven years, so Tuesday he bought seven quick-pick tix at exactly
11 a.m., maybe at a 7-Eleven mart.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, a former roofer who lives in San Andreas, parlayed his
Lotto fortune into a bigger fortune in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Sanfilippo is throwing a party Saturday, a
fund-raising concert for the local Women's Crisis Center, $10 for
noon-to-midnight top-name bands at the Metropolitan Theatre in San
Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like a good guy, but it's going to be hard to root for
Dennis when the ping-pong balls start poppin'.
</P>
<P>
   YOU BITCH ABOUT the spare-change panhandlers because they might
blow your money on drugs or booze.
</P>
<P>
   But in Contra Costa County, a civil grand jury found that, among
other shortcomings of the homeless program there, ``homeless
officials were unable to provide a mission statement or written
report on how money and time were spent.''
</P>
<P>
   So would you rather donate to the homeless or to the clueless?
</P>
<P>
   And Brother, can you spare a budget spreadsheet?
</P>
<P>
   BUS, HO! The first of Muni's new NextBus computerized bulletin
boards spring to life Wednesday, around noon in a few locations.
The readouts tell you when your bus is expected to arrive, so you
can adjust your anger and frustration levels up or down, as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   No, the board will not give Vegas odds on whether your bus will
be too full to stop for you.
</P>
<P>
   BOB BUGG is an entomologist at UC Davis, duly noted here
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bugg's current writing projects: ``Nitrogen dynamics in a
non-tillage cover-cropped organic almond orchard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds fascinating, but I'm waiting for Bob's megachiller,
``Revenge of the Lust-Crazed Dust Mite.''

 &HT;    Border Patrol backlog draws fire
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Last summer, the U.S. Border Patrol Academy
here was buzzing with activity as 700 chanting, sweating, studying
men and women honed their skills and prepared to deploy to Texas
and other southwestern border states.
</P>
<P>
   Now the academy, located on a former naval base, is quiet. The
head count has dropped to less than 150, all but two of the last
eight incoming classes have been canceled, and the remaining
classes have been pared down _ all because of a sudden shortage of
recruits that has put a crimp in the Border Patrol's expansion
plans and brought the wrath of Congress on the agency's tiny
recruiting staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deader than a doornail right now,'' said John Attanasio,
the training operations supervisor at the academy, which opened in
1996 to accommodate a hiring push that came with Congress' latest
effort to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling at the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's booming economy, combined with a steady stream of
agents leaving the Border Patrol, have left recruiters scrambling
to meet Congress' demand to hire 1,000 agents a year, said Sid
Waldstreicher, a manager in the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's human resources office. Border Patrol officials expect to
hire fewer than half that number by the end of the budget year on
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline essentially started running dry,'' Waldstreicher
said from his Washington, D.C., office _ from which five staff
members wander the nation recruiting new employees for both the
Border Patrol and its parent agency, the INS. ``What had been a
steady stream became a drip.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS first noticed the slowdown in November, Waldstreicher
said. A tight labor market, he said, has put the Border Patrol in
competition with the military, police departments, other federal
agencies and the private sector for recruits. And the Border Patrol
is looking for a certain type of person _ someone able to work long
hours in difficult terrain under a blazing sun.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Border Patrol has made it tougher to get
in, Waldstreicher said. The entrance exam has been expanded, and
the background checks are more stringent. Then there's the academy
_ 18 weeks of eight-hour days filled with intensive classes in
Spanish and immigration law and demanding physical training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical part of this is actually more strenuous than
Marine Corps boot camp,'' said Troy Lempke, a 26-year-old recruit
from Illinois who served in the Marines for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Waldstreicher said, the INS has surpassed Congress'
annual goals by hiring more than 6,100 Border Patrol agents since
1995 _ more than doubling the size of the patrol in the process.
There are about 8,000 agents this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 percent of agents leave the Border Patrol each year, not
counting the roughly 10 percent of trainees this year who have
resigned or failed out of the two academies in Charleston and
Glynco, Ga. Border Patrol officials say some agents defect to other
federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration or
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which pay more. Salaries for
Border Patrol agents start in the mid-$20,000 to mid-$30,000 range,
depending on experience and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We train them, and then they hire them,'' Waldstreicher said.
``When we say we have to hire 1,000, we really have to hire
2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his office has stepped up recruiting, tripling the
number of college job fairs that recruiters visit and doubling the
number of military installations where recruiting drives are held.
Recruiters also plan to double their print and radio advertisements
by this fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas is one of the Border Patrol's top states for
recruits, Waldstreicher said the University of Texas isn't one of
the targeted institutions _ the agency pulled out this year after a
couple of years of disappointing results. Texas A&AMP;M University
continues to be fertile ground for recruiting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the extra effort, the Border Patrol is falling behind.
Waldstreicher said the agency has attracted 200 fewer applicants
this year than during the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional pressure makes it even more difficult,''
Waldstreicher said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure has come from a group of senators and
representatives, including Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Reps. Lamar Smith of San Antonio and Silvestre Reyes of El Paso,
who have accused the INS of dragging its feet on recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 law passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton
ordered the INS to hire 1,000 Border Patrol agents a year for five
years. When Border Patrol Chief Gus de la Vina told Congress in
April that the agency expects to add only 200 to 400 agents because
of recruiting problems and attrition, the lawmakers were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, that just shows a lack of commitment and lack of
seriousness on the part of INS to do what Congress has told them to
do,'' said Reyes, a Democrat and former Border Patrol chief in El
Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also has lashed out at the Clinton administration,
which did not request money for the 1,000 new agents in this year's
budget because it said the Border Patrol has grown too fast and has
too many inexperienced agents in the field. In a letter signed by
dozens of members of Congress, Smith and Reyes scolded Clinton for
not being serious about border security.
</P>
<P>
   While overseeing the Border Patrol's efforts in the area, Reyes
launched Operation Hold the Line in El Paso in 1993 and watched the
idea spread to Border Patrol sectors in California, Arizona and the
Rio Grande Valley. The operation seeks to deter illegal immigration
by stacking agents and technology on the border around the clock
instead of trying to catch immigrants after they cross.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said he and his colleagues are trying to help the Border
Patrol retain agents by supporting a pay raise this year.
Legislation filed by Hutchison and Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., would
increase the pay of many agents by $8,000 a year.

 &HT;    The destruction _ and restoration _ of a river
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Halfway across Central Florida's grassy
midsection in the late 1960s, a college student heading for Boca
Raton came upon a curious divide.
</P>
<P>
   Looking north from his French-made 1959 Simca, Richard Coleman
saw a curving waterway, its natural color a shade of dark cola.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, the water sliced south in a straight gash. It was
cloudy with clay and silt, ``like coffee with milk in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know it then, but Coleman was witnessing one of
Florida's most notorious environmental fiascoes, still in progress.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was dredging the Kissimmee River
into a straight line, destroying the snakelike curves that
sheltered game fish, wading birds, ducks and alligators amid
overhanging oaks and a 3-mile-wide marshy flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how much destruction was taking place,'' said
Coleman, of Winter Haven, now a 55-year-old Sierra Club leader and
boat captain.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next three decades, he would find out. Fishing would
collapse in the former river that the corps labeled Canal 38.
Oxygen levels in the water would plunge. Wading bird populations
would plummet 90 percent. And when downpours struck, the canal
would dump huge surges of water into Lake Okeechobee downstream.
</P>
<P>
   The drained land created by the canal also aided an influx of
ranches, dairies, citrus farms and homesteads into the Kissimmee
valley, worsening the lake's pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, meanwhile, would join a cadre of activists demanding
that the corps undo what it had created.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're getting their wish. Crews hired by the corps are set
to begin filling 22 miles of the canal, a project meant to restore
the curves and marshy floodplain along a little less than half of
the old river. More than 40 square miles of former flood plain will
flood again.
</P>
<P>
   But even after acknowledging its mistake, the corps says it
can't restore the entire river. That would risk creating floods
around lakes to the north _ some less than 10 miles from Walt
Disney World _ and around the town of Okeechobee to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the $495 million project is a milestone in the broad
restoration of the Everglades-Lake Okeechobee region, for which the
Kissimmee serves as the headwaters.
</P>
<P>
   For environmentalists, the Kissimmee fight also served as a
trial run for the Everglades struggle _ with the same early
skepticism from decision-makers, squabbles over money, and
hostility from property owners who objected to losing their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said we were crazy,'' said West Palm Beach
environmentalist Johnny Jones, another leader in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Kissimmee is an ancient Calusa or Ais Indian
word for ``long water.'' But today's Kissimmee is a lot shorter
than it used to be: just 56 miles long, compared to the old river's
103-mile-long meander.
</P>
<P>
   The straightened river greets boaters like a broad highway,
lined by mounds of dredged soil instead of billboards. But modest
restoration attempts have revived a few traces of the old river
along scattered detours, called oxbows. Navigating them is like
leaving Florida's Turnpike for a rutted cow trail.
</P>
<P>
   The waterway turns narrow and twisting, curving in one direction
and then another, splitting off into forks, some of them dead ends.
Oaks, maples and Carolina willows line the banks, with expanses of
prairie visible between the trees. Sand bars are reappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to look a lot like the Kissimmee used to be,''
Coleman said. It's the river seen in photos from the 19th century,
when steamboats plied the water.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration project under way will go much further. While
crews fill in the canal, South Florida water managers plan to raise
the elevations of the lakes upstream to increase the flow
southward.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent flooding nearby landowners, the South Florida Water
Management District has spent $89 million to buy 81,187 acres
bordering the lakes and the river. The district is also paying half
the costs for the whole restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   Many landowners didn't want to leave. Others insisted that the
corps had done enough damage and should just let the river alone.
And much of the land was caught in a legal tug of war, as state
officials insisted it was former river bottom that the state
already legally owned.
</P>
<P>
   The Kissimmee restoration by itself won't solve Lake
Okeechobee's pollution problems, said Kent Loftin, the water
district's chief engineer. That will probably have to wait for a
separate $7.8 billion Everglades restoration plan from the corps.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kissimmee project should help slow the river down.
</P>
<P>
   In the rainy summer and fall, the old river used to overflow and
spread across the surrounding plain. Instead of shooting
downstream, it would lazily flow, spread and seep, filtering
through the marsh.
</P>
<P>
   When dry times returned, the receding waters would leave
isolated ponds, allowing gators and wading birds to feast on the
trapped fish.
</P>
<P>
   Okeechobee rancher Frank ``Sonny'' Williamson said he remembers
hearing ``millions of frogs'' on the river in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roar of those frogs at night when you shut off an airboat
was amazing,'' said Williamson, also a former South Florida water
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But to ranchers and other landowners, the flooding was also the
problem. A 1947 flood inundated 600,000 acres. The state demanded
action.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the corps moved in to straighten what it called a
``crooked river.'' The new channel was 30 feet deep, more than
triple the depth of old river, draining not only the riverbed but
43,000 acres of surrounding marsh.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Loftin said, it would have been cheaper just
to buy out the ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the corps finished in 1971, opponents were already
demanding that the river be restored.
</P>
<P>
   The state changed its mind first, passing a law in 1976 aimed at
devising solutions to the river's problems. In 1983, then-Gov. Bob
Graham made the Kissimmee's restoration a prime goal of his Save
Our Everglades plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the corps at first refused to issue a permit for the work,
and then contended that filling the canal wouldn't create enough
economic benefit to qualify for federal money. The corps later came
around after some changes in federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists had one ally: Much of the land surrounding
the river is still undeveloped and without roads..
</P>
<P>
   ``If development moved in, we would have lost all of it,''
Coleman said.

 &HT;    Take hurricane season kickoff as act of faith
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's that time of year again when we in
the media duly report that another hurricane season has begun.
</P>
<P>
   The opening day of hurricane season is a very artificial news
story. There's never a real hurricane in the works. It's pretty
much like any other day in late May. Except it's June.
</P>
<P>
   It's not at all like the opening of baseball season, which
involves a real event along with all the trappings of a fresh
start, including the pomp and circumstance of a presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   The president never shows up at the National Hurricane Center to
toss out the first ceremonial weather balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature plays dumb too, refraining from showing her hand
early by putting a weather disturbance off the West Coast of Africa
at the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was pretty much like every other opening day of the new
hurricane season. Uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   We did manage to get a little rain here, but it was certainly
not the kind that would send people scurrying to Home Depot for
chain saws. No, you've just got to accept the beginning of
hurricane season on faith. You've got to believe it's there, even
though you can't see it or feel it.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's like tourist season. Nobody can say for sure when
tourist season begins. It's just that one day you're driving to
work on I-95, and you realize that every other car on the road is
caked with salt and outfitted with a rack of clothes strung across
the back seat. Then you know it's tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between the hurricane and tourist seasons,
though, is that you can count on the tourists showing up every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Unreliable storms easy to ignore
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes are far less reliable. They're so unreliable that
many people around here have just blown them off.
</P>
<P>
   I know because I'm one of those people. Here's my typical
preparation for hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   1. Read Palm Beach Post hurricane guide, paying close attention
to checklist of recommended supplies.
</P>
<P>
   2. Realize I only have tuna.
</P>
<P>
   3. Think about buying everything else.
</P>
<P>
   4. Think about something else.
</P>
<P>
   I realize this is horribly irresponsible of me. I should already
be stockpiling water, batteries, cash, insect repellent, duct tape,
and SPAM.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, my hurricane plan for the past 15 years could
be summarized in a single word: Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   It got me thinking what it would take for people like me to take
hurricane season more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Need tougher sounding names
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the storms need to be renamed. This year we have
storms with such ferocious names as Cindy, Bret and Tammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, my name is Bret. I'll be your hurricane this evening.
Can I start you off with an appetizer of feeder bands?''
</P>
<P>
   How about giving them names that inspire fear? How about
Hurricane Diablo, Hurricane Sayonara, or Hurricane Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   How about Hurricane Doom, Hurricane Halitosis of Hell, or
Hurricane Slobodan?
</P>
<P>
   And we should come up with some activity to kick off the
hurricane season, something to give this phantom season more of a
presence in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   I have a parade in mind, one like the Mardi Gras, except that
people on the floats would throw batteries, instead of trinkets,
into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And we'll invite the president to ride on a float, and we'll
serenade him with Golf-Ball-Sized Hail to the Chief.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he might not show, choosing to distance himself from
the 12th storm of the year _ Hurricane Lewinsky.

 &HT;    Gender will color Dole campaign
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I remember her wearing a yellow suit at
the 1996 Republican National Convention. With microphone in hand,
Elizabeth Dole moved through the audience toward the stage as she
told America why husband Bob, the party's nominee, would make a
great president.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe ``Liddy'' wore bright blue that night. Still, whether
filtered through yellow or blue, the memory lingers of Ms. Dole, a
poised, articulate woman speaking convincingly about her man and
her party. Her performance so impressed many on the convention
floor and others _ like me _ in the television audience that we
came to believe she would make the better presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the former Red Cross director has decided to go after
the Y2K Republican nomination, I'm a tad ticked at myself for
trying to remember what she was wearing. Annoyance turns to anger
when I find myself wondering if she will be so bold as to wear red
to accept the nomination, should she win her party's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Why annoyance? Because I'm obviously caught up in the ``woman
thing.'' Why anger? Because while I, a would-be liberated woman,
have extricated myself from the tangle of traditional gender
judgments on a conscious level, my subconscious remains actively
engaged. I become aware of this affliction whenever I catch myself
focusing on trivial details while assessing a female politician,
applying standards I would never apply to a male. I find little
comfort in discovering I'm not alone in this practice.
</P>
<P>
   Though women today can aspire to the highest office, events of
the past few months convince me that if Ms. Dole runs, she will
have to do so while carrying gender baggage. Some will be light,
such as the interest in what color she wears. Some will be heavier,
such as the speculation that her positions on abortion, gun control
and other issues are designed to prove a feminist independence.
</P>
<P>
   Inconveniently bulky baggage also will include the remarks of
her spouse, the would-be first ``First Gent'' who seems to be
bristling at the prospect. Mr. Dole's remarks that he is thinking
about donating to another Republican candidate's campaign because
he doubts his wife can raise enough money for a credible campaign
are, at best, insensitive. At worst, he has betrayed their
marriage, a private relationship that in public requires mutual
support of each other's goals.
</P>
<P>
   When contrasted with his wife's earnest appeals on his behalf
three years ago, Mr. Dole's gaffe suggests that the former senator
experienced a sexist moment, the kind of gender bias too frequently
buried deep inside men _ and women _ who thought themselves free of
the affliction.
</P>
<P>
   In her marriage and professional life, Ms. Dole faces the same
unsettling reality that has confronted others who dare to knock at
the door of an exclusive club. Those who want to share power
probably won't get in. If the club has to accept her, she will face
attempts to undermine her status.
</P>
<P>
   They will come from writers who, consciously or subconsciously,
try to reduce her to a stereotypical woman. Tongue in cheek, they
will portray her as a hysteric who may roar to be entrusted with
power but obsessed with matters only a woman would consider
important. Calvin Trillin's essay in the May 24 issue of Time,
satirizing the first 100 days of an Elizabeth Dole presidency, is
an example. Once the ``candidate-as-shrew'' image sets in,
everything Ms. Dole does likely will be viewed through a prism of
ridicule. So, perhaps she will rethink her goal and go for the
vice-presidential slot. Democrat Geraldine Ferraro already bloodied
her head loosening the hinges on that door.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Ms. Dole remains at the door to the
presidency, hammering away, she will have the consolation of
knowing that she jolted the lock sufficiently for some future
female candidate to break in. Somebody's got to do it.

 &HT;    Hooters is hot news in Round Rock
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the beginning of the end of this Williamson County
city's rock-solid conservative, family-oriented image.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters is planning to open a restaurant in Round Rock on
Wednesday, June 16. Mothers, lock up your husbands. Fathers, lock
up your sons. Fathers, lock up your daughters so they won't get
jobs at Hooters running around half-nekkid.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters, the restaurant chain that features statuesque young
waitresses dressed in teeny, shiny orange short-shorts and snug,
revealing tank-top T-shirts, is coming to Round Rock. This is not
necessarily bad. Hooters and the Grand Canyon have one thing in
common _ great scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters in Round Rock. My gawd. What's next? A head shop with
casino gambling? The town is becoming downright licentious.
</P>
<P>
   You know what's causing this? Free-wheeling, hippie-dippy Austin
is starting to rub off on stodgy ol' Williamson County. The place
is turning into Sodom, and soon Hutto will be Gomorrah. Next thing
you know, Leslie and his thong will be moving up from Austin to
Round Rock to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm all for a Hooters opening in Round Rock. For one
thing, the location is perfect. It's on the southbound feeder road
of Interstate 35, just north of FM 1325, near Garden Ridge pottery.
</P>
<P>
   Ever notice when you go to Hooters that the customers are almost
exclusively guys? It's only fair that Round Rock guys are getting a
Hooters at this spot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being dragged for hours through Garden Ridge pottery
to look at all that Martha Stewart trash _ the dried flowers,
kitchen linens and candle accessories _ the old man can stay behind
at Hooters and look at Melanie, Bambi and Dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters really is marching forward on this.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday I went by the place, which is still under
construction. Hooters is hiring waitresses and kitchen workers at
the location out of a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 people have applied for work, said Meagan Lee, the
assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten them from Round Rock, San Marcos, Austin,
Georgetown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the place has already hired about half of its staff of
70 Hooters girls.
</P>
<P>
   The Polaroid snapshots of those who have been hired to wear the
Hooters colors are displayed in the trailer. Let's put it this way.
The ones I looked at all had nice teeth.
</P>
<P>
   What they ought to do is call this Round Rock Hooters Cyber
Hooters. I say this because it'll be right across I-35 from the
enormous Dell Computer campus, which employs about 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has the campus, and thanks to Hooters it's about to get the
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just know that at lunch great numbers of that prolific
high-tech species Floppius discerooni will make the trip across the
road to check out the, uh, chicken wings at Hooters?
</P>
<P>
   If the Round Rock Hooters has any snap, Friday nights will be
Geek Night, with wings half off.

 &HT;    Sunny days in the Yukon (even at 3 a.m.!)
 &HT;    (EDS: This is Installment 15 in a series of columns by Ron
Wiggins, ``Midlife journey to Mount McKinley.'' If you are
interested in previous columns, please call CoxNet at
404-526-5456.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are strange things done under the midnight sun by the
men who moil for gold . . .'' _ from ``The Cremation of Sam McGee''
by Robert Service.
</P>
<P>
   DAWSON CITY, YUKON TERRITORY _ They weren't kidding about this
midnight sun business. An hour before midnight, the sun hangs just
above the mountain, flooding my camper, and if I'm to get any
sleep, I may have to climb the mountain with a bat and beat the sun
beneath the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 a.m. the sun subsides just low enough to provide some
darkness and with it, blessed sleep. And the next morning, when the
sun blazes out of a cloudless horizon, warming my face, I bound out
of bed and see by my watch that it is 3:17 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   There are no roosters in the Yukon. They are all in therapy.
</P>
<P>
   After more ``rest'' I drive into this legendary gold rush town
of 2,500 to find out what kind of people thrive in 50-below zero
winters punctuated by 10 weeks of ceiling-staring insomnia. The
town itself consists of old houses and stores set in a tight grid
on the banks of the mighty Yukon River.
</P>
<P>
   The roads are graveled and oiled to hold down dust, and if this
is meant to be quaint or faithful to its boomtown past, the effect
is more shabby than nostalgic. But if there is madness here, it
begins with neglected buildings that lean dangerously toward their
upright neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the permafrost,'' explains Guy Chan, 35, owner of Dawson
Donuts. ``Five or six feet down the ground is permanently frozen.
When the ground above thaws, the buildings tilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Frame houses and businesses are elevated on blocks so that they
do not melt the ground before spring and sink into a bog of their
own making. When spring comes, the ground under the house thaws
unevenly and tilting results.
</P>
<P>
   You know an adjustment is needed when a meatball falls off the
table and rolls to the wall. Then you get out the shims and the
sledgehammer and true up the house the way you stick a matchbook
under a table leg.
</P>
<P>
   The graveled roads, according to Chan, are another concession to
permafrost sag. No use repaving every spring when there are
mountains of gold mine tailings for the gravel. Where else are
roads impregnated with gold and the hope of finding an overlooked
nugget on the streets?
</P>
<P>
   There is gold still being taken out of the river, but it wasn't
the lure of gold that brought the native of Vancouver within a
three-day mush of the Arctic Circle. It was an assistant chef's
job. He stayed as he grew to love the town. And ``the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim,'' he smiled. ``She works at the refinery. She's the one
who pours the gold into bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan came to know Kim from the hotel where both worked. ``One
day she's all dolled up and looking really hot, and I ask her where
she's going and she says to break up with her boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, and they started dating and bought the doughnut shop
and the Victorian house next door and to this day, Chan still
doesn't get it. ``Why get all dolled up to break up with somebody?
It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has something to do with the Northern Lights or the
warped diurnal cycle or Dawson City's undisputed bipolarism: The
town is by the pole and it's still deciding whether it's a tourist
town or a gold town.
</P>
<P>
   Bona fide miners and bonanza seekers comb the stream beds for
gold even as hundreds of thousands of vacationers throng the town
to drink at Diamond Tooth Gerties, attend the Robert Service
Theater and even try their hand at gold-panning. All Chan asks is
that the nostalgia revelers stop by for a doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was new here,'' Chan said, ``I assumed that the gold
was played out and that these miners were dreaming. I said that a
couple of times in bars, and suddenly it got real quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there people getting rich in the creeks? Chan shrugs. ``Some
of these guys work their claims when it thaws, and in October, a
lot of them go to South America and Mexico. Somebody's finding
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Most newcomers to Dawson City, Chan says, are like himself,
young and entrepreneurial. ``We know a half dozen people our age
who had babies last year.'' He and Kim intend to rear a family.
``Cuba will be opening up soon. Maybe we'll go there when we
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chan says, in Dawson City not much goes on that
doesn't get repeated at Dawson Donuts. Winters are cold, he
concedes, but not as brutal as Toronto winters with the wind
blowing off the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   And to prove his point, he told me about a prospector named
Cory, who lives year around in a 12-by-12-foot tent heated by a
wood stove. ``When it's too cold to prospect, he works in town as a
machinist.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can survive a Klondike winter in a tent, I say flatly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the old pictures of Dawson City in winter,'' Chan
replies. ``Nothing but tents.''
</P>
<P>
   As I board the ferry to cross the Yukon River and connect with
the Top of the World Highway to Alaska, I am sorry I didn't get to
meet the man who winters the Klondike in a tent, but I am sorrier
that I didn't get to meet Kim and ask her if this is a normal thing
for women to get all dolled up to break up with somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't she let her hair go for a few days, throw on her
rattiest bathrobe and smudge a little soot under her eyes? This
continues to trouble me as I drive north and the days become longer
and the nights shorter.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT: Alaska's bounty: salmon-studded rivers, virgin forests,
the pristine droppings of a bull moose.

 &HT;    Teen finds fortune in the stars
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Folks, we've been outsmarted by a
12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, he's 16 and he'll be 17 soon. He's taking
driver's ed and he's looking for a girlfriend, if anyone's
interested.
</P>
<P>
   But Kalman Gabriel used to be 12. And when he was, he started
this little project that has since landed him an agent, a book and
a 1998 Youth News Writers award.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman liked to collect autographs, mostly from sports figures.
But it got to be too expensive. So, the handsome kid with the
little sister and the mom and dad who are both accountants started
a project.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote to people, famous people, and asked them a simple
question:
</P>
<P>
   Dear So and So,
</P>
<P>
   I am a 12-year-old boy from Oyster Bay, New York. If you could
give me advice for life, what would it be?
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Kalman Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   And for the next three years, young Kalman kept his mailman on
Long Island very, very busy.
</P>
<P>
   His first response, and, thus, still his favorite today, was
from actor Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   July 18, 1994
</P>
<P>
   Dear Kalman
</P>
<P>
   1). Show thanks and pray to God every day.
</P>
<P>
   2). Live a vegetarian lifestyle. (No beef, no pork, no poultry.)
</P>
<P>
   3). Work hard in school.
</P>
<P>
   4). Honor your mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   With all best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Alec.
</P>
<P>
   His weirdest letter? The one from Sydney Biddle Barrows, the
Mayflower Madam. She told him to practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was kind of a weird thing to tell a
12-year-old,'' Kalman says.
</P>
<P>
   Regis Philbin: Obey the commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Cash: Look to the light.
</P>
<P>
   Art Garfunkel: Always try to show up.
</P>
<P>
   George Carlin: Question everything you are told by governments,
corporations and religions. Question and resist!
</P>
<P>
   As time went on and the project grew, Kalman switched from
handwritten notes to letters printed on the computer. He turned 13,
then 14, then 15. His cursive signature got a little more fancy.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Kalman ran out of names. There are only so many
people like Michael Jordan and Mother Teresa. That's when Kalman,
with the help of his dad, started writing to people he'd never
heard of before in his life. Nobel laureates. Scientists. College
presidents. Politicians. He's heard from more than 300 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kemp: Never give in!
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan: Don't go along with the crowd. Be your own man.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Polanski: Read a lot. Good books inspire.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner: LEAD, FOLLOW OR GET OUT OF THE WAY!
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it probably cost a lot because of all the stamps
and everything,'' he says. That's when he found himself an agent
and got himself a deal for a book (Dear Kalman, William Morrow and
Co., Inc., $14).
</P>
<P>
   Some people wrote several pages. Some people wrote a few words.
A lot of people told Kalman to do well in school, love his parents
and be nice to other people.
</P>
<P>
   And some people were too stuck on themselves to write back.
People such as Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Gabriel, wrote Eisner's assistant, Thomas J. Deegan.
</P>
<P>
   As you may expect, Michael's Disney duties fully occupy his
schedule. He simply has no free time to pursue the dozens of
requests he receives every week, especially those requiring his
personal attention such as expressions of opinion, ``words of
wisdom,'' or personal advice.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like a certain gazillionaire could use some advice. Advice
like, Hey Michael: Lighten up. Make time for kids like Kalman.

   MIDLIFE-JOURNEY _ DAWSON CITY, Yukon Territory _ They weren't
kidding about this midnight sun business. An hour before midnight,
the sun hangs just above the mountain, flooding my camper, and if
I'm to get any sleep, I may have to climb the mountain with a bat
and beat the sun beneath the horizon. By 1:30 a.m. the sun subsides
just low enough to provide some darkness and with it, blessed
sleep. And the next morning, when the sun blazes out of a cloudless
horizon, warming my face, I bound out of bed and see by my watch
that it is 3:17 a.m. There are no roosters in the Yukon. They are
all in therapy. (EDS: This is Installment 15 in a series of columns
by Ron Wiggins, ``Midlife journey to Mount McKinley.'' If you are

   DIET-COLUMN _ In February 1997, my 5-foot-4 wife had ballooned
to 185 pounds. If there was a diet she didn't try, it was only
because it wasn't printed in English. Packaged stuff from a
strip-mall weight-loss place. Weight Watchers. Starvation.
Everything in between. Nothing worked long-term. In February 1998,
Margaret, who hates to cook, settled on a low-fat diet and our
kitchen became a fat-free zone. She also ran 3 or 4 miles a day and
played for an indoor soccer team. She began to see results. And
then the fighting began. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

an iceberg lettuce salad than trendy micro-greens any day. In her
latest book, ``Learning to Cook with Marion Cunningham'', she

   WINE-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ What's the hardest thing you've
ever had to do? Wayne Flynn can answer that question. ``The hardest
thing I've ever had to do was to price the first bottle of wine
that I produced,'' said the proprietor of Flynn Winery in Oregon.
The bottle was a 1984 pinot noir. ``I decided to be as close to
under $10 as I could be.'' The wine came out at $9.95. That was
nearly 15 years ago. You know what has happened to wine prices in
the past decade and a half. They've risen faster than a Champagne
cork exits a warm, shaken bottle. Kapow. Through the roof. Flynn
produces two pinot noirs now. So what do you suppose they cost? Um,
$8.99 and $12.99. (The $12.99 wine is the one that used to cost
$9.95, by the way.) And the wines are delicious. (Fisher, Dayton

teen movie glut: a teen video glut. Several less-than-stellar
depictions of American teen life _ like ``Varsity Blues'' _ are
headed for the video stores in the coming weeks. So here are a
dozen alternatives for your kid, mostly older and better movies

<P>
   Q: An article about Helen Suzman described her as a member of
Parliament in South Africa who for 36 years was the only one who
voted against apartheid and other repressive laws. How did she
manage to get re-elected over and over again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Suzman served as the liberal representative from Houghton, a
silk-stocking district in northern Johannesburg, from her first
election in 1953 until her retirement in 1989. For 13 of those
years, the South African-born daughter of Jewish immigrants from
Lithuania was the only opposition member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   She credited her ability to hold onto her seat for so long to
the people she represented, whom she called ``exceptional,
intelligent, traveled.'' Many of them were Jewish like herself,
with an ingrained aversion to racism.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers during her turbulent decades in South
African politics, however, said it was more than that, crediting
her uncompromising integrity and singleness of purpose. In 1989,
when she announced that she wouldn't run again, even her political
opponents joined the line of parliamentarians who paid tribute to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Short-wave radio reports indicated that at least 21 Americans
have been killed in the fighting in Yugoslavia. Can you confirm? Of
that number, how many were military, and how many civilian?
</P>
<P>
   A: As of May 28, no U.S. or NATO forces have died in combat,
said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Steve Campbell. Two U.S. pilots
were killed May 5 in an Apache helicopter training accident in
Albania, but they aren't considered combat casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said NATO has reported the ``possibility'' that
American civilians have been killed in its bombing campaign, but he
added that there has been no confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend told me she had heard about a lawsuit in the Claus
Von Bulow case that would force him to pay damages to the family of
his wife, Sunny. He had been accused of trying to kill her with
insulin some years back. Can you shed any light on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It isn't something that happened recently. In 1985, after a
previous conviction on the attempted murder charge was overturned,
Von Bulow was acquitted of trying to kill Martha ``Sunny'' von
Bulow.
</P>
<P>
   Her adult children by a previous marriage then filed a $56
million civil lawsuit against him that was settled out of court in
1987 after Von Bulow agreed, among other things, to renounce his
claims to his wife's fortune and to divorce the heiress, who was
left comatose. Defense attorneys argued that the woman brought on
the comas herself by drug and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Armstrong, who represented the stepchildren,
said later: ``The purpose for the Von Bulow suit was to get Claus
out of the lives of the family. When he agreed to do that, there
was no longer any purpose in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Ted Turner's military background?
</P>
<P>
   A: The CNN founder served six months of active duty in the Coast
Guard, according to Current Biography.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many of us who are size-conscious find inspiration in Richard
Simmons. Can you give us some background information about him?
Where can fans write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The physical fitness specialist and TV personality was born
in New Orleans in 1948 as Milton Teagle Simmons. In his
introduction to the best-selling ``Richard Simmons'
Never-Say-Diet,'' he wrote that when he was a child he thought his
parents favored his older brother, Lenny. So he turned to food for
comfort and, in his own words, became addicted.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 or 11 he renamed himself Richard. By the time he was 15,
his love of food was evident as his weight approached 200 pounds.
He attended Southern Louisiana University and Florida State
University before heading to Italy, where he peaked at 268 pounds.
When someone left a note on his Fiat saying ``Fat people die
young,'' Simmons says he was was jolted into determination,
shedding 112 pounds in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 he returned to the United States, eventually opening a
restaurant and adjacent exercise studio in Beverly Hills, Calif. TV
producers attracted by his antics made him a staple on talk shows
and he eventually got his own program. Books, audiotapes,
videotapes and shopping center appearances furthered his celebrity
status.
</P>
<P>
   Write him in care of Anatomy Asylum, 9306 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Beverly Hills, CA 90210.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible for Americans to adopt orphans from Kosovo? If
so, what is the procedure?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the State Department says it shares humanitarian
concerns for the children of Kosovo, and applauds people's desire
to help them, it also says adoption isn't feasible. In a formal
statement on the issue, this is what the department says: ``In
general, adopts are private legal civil matters governed by the
laws of the nation where the child lives. The process involves
complex foreign and U.S. legal requirements. The laws in the former
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) give priority to their own citizens
and make adoptions by foreigners very difficult. In a crisis
situation . . . it can be extremely difficult to determine if
children whose parents are missing are truly orphans. . . . Even
when children have been truly orphaned or abandoned by their
parents, they are often taken in by other relatives. Staying with
relatives in extended family units is generally a better solution
than uprooting the child completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: TV game show host Bob Barker was presented with a lifetime
achievement award at the recent Daytime Emmy Awards. Can you tell
us about his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Robert William Barker was born Dec. 12, 1923, in Darrington,
Wash. He served in the Navy in 1943-45, and in 1947 graduated summa
cum laude from Drury College in Springfield, Mo., with a major in
economics. While at Drury, Barker worked for radio station KTTS in
Springfield. After a stint with a radio station in Palm Beach,
Fla., he moved to Los Angeles, where he hosted ``The Bob Barker
Show'' for radio station KWIK in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest: ``Truth or Consequences,'' ``The Family
Game,'' ``The Price Is Right,'' various beauty pageants, hosting
the Pillsbury Bake-Off and ``The Bob Barker Fun and Games Show,''
among many others. Before his recent recognition for lifetime
achievement, Barker had received at least a dozen Daytime Emmys,
starting in 1981-82. His wife, Dorothy Jo, whom he married in 1945,
died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about the Kosovo conflict have mentioned the
War Powers Act. What is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The War Powers Act is a law passed by Congress in 1973 as a
result of actions taken by Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard
Nixon during the Vietnam War. It was designed to balance military
powers of the president, as commander in chief, and Congress, which
has the power to declare war.
</P>
<P>
   According to Section 4 (a) (1) of the resolution, the president
must inform Congress within 48 hours if U.S. forces are sent into a
hostile area without a declaration of war. In addition, those
forces may remain no longer than 90 days unless Congress approves
the president's action or declares war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what initially was considered a successful attempt to
involve Congress more meaningfully in war-making, the resolution
has been the subject of much criticism and debate. Some critics
argue that it attempts improperly to tie the president's hands,
while others view it as an invitation for the president to conduct
war freely within a specified period of time. Even if taken at face
value, the resolution contains loopholes. It states, for example,
that ``Nothing in this joint resolution . . . is intended to alter
the constitutional authority of the president.'' Also, there's no
mechanism to force the president to comply with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Evander Holyfield have a fan club? If so, what is the
address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the heavyweight boxing champion has a fan club. For
information, write: Holyfield Management, 794 Evander Holyfield
Highway, Fairburn, GA 30213.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend and I are debating the value of those popular green
and orange sports drinks. Are they really better than water?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unlike water, sports drinks provide sodium, which is lost in
perspiration, as well as carbohydrates. These ingredients also are
said to speed fluid absorption from the stomach into the
bloodstream, making dehydration less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some people think the drinks are no better than water
for most active people, who don't exercise long enough or hard
enough to reap the benefits of rapid hydration that the drinks
provide. People who consume water before, during and after exercise
don't come close to approaching dehydration, these experts contend.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: Every quart of a sports drink contains 250
calories, so if you're exercising to lose weight, you need to burn
off well over 250 calories to create a caloric deficit.

   Q: Years ago, I read that Jacqueline Kennedy put something into
President Kennedy's casket before he was buried. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arlington National Cemetery reports that the president's
widow, and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, placed
several items in the casket. They included three letters, a pair of
gold cuff links, a piece of scrimshaw engraved with the
presidential seal, a silver rosary, and a PT-109 tie clasp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about White Oak Plantation in Florida,
where the Clintons spent their recent short vacation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The plantation, a 7,500-acre spread on the St. Mary's River
dividing Florida and Georgia, and about 20 miles north of
Jacksonville, isn't your average resort. For starters, it isn't
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   White Oak was established in 1938 as a family residence by
Charles Gilman. His son, Howard Gilman, who died last year at age
73, developed the plantation as a corporate meeting place. The son
was chairman and CEO of Gilman Paper Co. in St. Mary's, Ga., the
largest privately held paper and building products company in the
United States. The plantation, accessible by an unmarked dirt road,
has a swimming pool, nine-hole golf course, political research
center and a studio for dancers and other artists. Guests have
included Al Gore, Colin Powell, Mikhail Baryshnikov, John F.
Kennedy Jr., Julia Roberts and Jessica Lange. The Clintons are
guests of the Howard Gilman Foundation, which lets groups and
individuals use its facilities for free.

   The grounds are home to about 400 animals, such as giraffes,
cheetahs, black rhinos and white rhinos, and Big Guy, an endangered
Florida panther injured by a car. They're under the care of more
than 40 zoologists at the White Oak Conservation Center,
established in 1982 by Howard Gilman to breed and preserve
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   White Oak has 14 houses, including log cabins, lodges and modern
stucco dwellings. The Clintons stayed at Roseland, a two-story,
five-bedroom cedar-paneled house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the articles I've read about the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington, I've never seen whether new names can be
added. Is it possible? If so, who can I contact to see about adding
someone's name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The names on the Wall _ numbering more than 58,200 _ were
obtained initially by the Defense Department, which compiled a list
of combat zone casualties according to an executive order handed
down by President Johnson on April 24, 1965. The Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund says it continues to receive numerous requests each
year from people who want to have names placed on the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   While the fund finances the addition of names to the Wall, it
says the decision on determining which names are inscribed is made
by the Defense Department. Only those people who died of a combat
injury suffered in Vietnam can be added. For more information on
the parameters involved in the consideration of adding a name,
contact the relevant service branch: Army, 703-325-5304; Air Force,
1-800-531-5501; Marine Corps, 703-696-1177; and Navy, 703-687-3979.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement addressing the question of adding names, the fund
adds that the memorial ``stands to honor all who served in Vietnam,
not just those whose individual names it bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a lawsuit involving Gerber
baby food? I received an e-mail saying that children born between
1986 and 1997 would be issued a $500 savings bond if the parent
writes to a settlement office in Minneapolis .
</P>
<P>
   A: This story, which makes the rounds from time to time, is
``completely inaccurate and false,'' says Gerber Products Co. This
misinformation appears to have started circulating after a 1996
settlement involving infant formula and pricing issues, but Gerber
wasn't connected with that litigation. In any case, Gerber says,
the deadline for filing claims in that settlement expired Jan. 31,
1997. The company also says a Minneapolis post office box linked to
Gerber for the processing of claims has been closed by Minneapolis
postal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that consumers are being misled by this
information,'' Gerber says in a statement posted on its Web site.
``Consumers are cautioned not to send birth records or other
information in conenction with this rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do I write to Vice President Al Gore, and how should I
address him?
</P>
<P>
   A: A spokeswoman in Gore's press office said most people who
write him use the title The Honorable Al Gore, Vice President of
the United States, followed by this address: The White House, 1600
Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, DC 20500.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, call up the White House Web site _
www.whitehouse.gov _ and click on The President &AMP; Vice President
and follow the steps. You'll be able to leave a message with a
maximum of 10,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After seeing a TV series about Gen. Douglas MacArthur, I'm
reminded of his widow, Jean. Is she still living? What about their
son, Arthur?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jean Faircloth MacArthur, who turned 100 last Dec. 28, lives
quietly at her home in New York's Waldorf-Astoria, where she has
been a resident since 1951. She has shunned the limelight for
years, never appearing on talk shows and rarely turning up in
celebrity columns, said Col. Bill Davis of the MacArthur Library
Archives and Memorial in Norfolk, Va. Davis said she's in good
health, but other than that he chose not to describe her
activities, saying only that she is ``very much'' a private person.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jean MacArthur's few public forays came in 1990 when,
accompanied by her friend Barbara Bush, she cut a ribbon to open a
research center at the Norfolk facility named for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur MacArthur lives in New York, Davis said, but he declined
to provide any details. It has been reported variously that the son
was either a music arranger, a Wall Street businessman or ballet
dancer, but there never has been any confirmation. Since his
father's death in 1964, he has chosen to stay out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas MacArthur is entombed at the Norfolk museum, which is
part of the library and archives. When his widow dies, she will be
entombed with him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the lightning tracking system used by some
television weather reporters. Can you explain how it works?
</P>
<P>
   A: Meteorologist Glenn Burns of WSB in Atlanta likens the
technology to what happens when you're listening to AM radio and
hear a static discharge from a distant thunderstorm. A network of
sensors detects the presence of positive and negative lightning
strokes, Burns said, and enables TV stations to show their location
on display maps ``in real time'' almost instantly as they occur.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper has reported frequently about the new quarters
honoring the 50 states. What about the District of Columbia?
</P>
<P>
   A: The authorizing law calls for quarters to honor only the 50
states, according to the Treasury Department, so the District of
Columbia is out of the question, at least for now. But there's a
provision in the law regarding the possibility of additional
honorees. A bill introduced in Congress by Del. Eleanor Holmes
Norton (D-D.C.) seeks to extend the program to include the District
of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Los Angeles police and the FBI are
closing in on two fugitives from the 1970s, Kathleen Soliah, former
associate of Patty Hearst and her Symbionese Liberation Army
colleagues, and James Kilgore, suspected member of the New World
Liberation Front, which was blamed for various bombings in
California in the mid-1970s. Is there no statute of limitations
involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no statute of limitations because the charges involve
a capital offense, said FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   The Symbionese Liberation Army was a group of ex-convicts and
radical college students that claimed responsibility for the
assassination of Marcus Foster, superintendent of schools in
Oakland, Calif. The SLA kidnapped Hearst from her Berkeley
apartment in 1974 and demanded, among other things, that her
father, Randolph Hearst, then president and editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, feed the poor for her release. Patty Heast
joined the radical group during the next 18 months, and she was
videotaped holding a gun during an April 1974 bank robbery in San
Francisco. Hearst eventually told authorities, and wrote in her
book, ``Every Secret Thing,'' that Kilgore and Soliah had
participated in another SLA bank robbery a year later in
Carmichael, Calif., in which a woman customer was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard on the radio that Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, bought the original sheet music to ``Candle in the Wind.''
What will he do with it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Spencer paid about $40,500 at an auction in London last week
for the original manuscript for the tribute song, which became the
biggest-selling single of all time after Elton John _ now Sir Elton
John _ performed it at Westminster Abbey during Diana's funeral in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer plans to display the manuscript, which was signed by
John and Beatles producer Sir George Martin, at a museum devoted to
Diana's life which Spencer has created at Althorp, the family's
ancestral home. ``It will be on display this year, and we are very
happy to have it,'' said Shelley-Anne Claircourt, Spencer's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the auction, which was held at Sotheby's in London,
will be donated to music-related charities, according to the
auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is this mysterious pin money given to Hillary Rodham
Clinton, which I'm told she has reported on her income tax return?
</P>
<P>
   A: No mystery. You're referring to the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin
Money Fund, which isn't new to Clinton. It was established in
Freeman's 1912 will for whoever, at a given time, is the spouse of
the president. The income tax return of the Clintons included
$12,000 from the pin money fund. As she has done in past years, the
first lady said she will contribute this income to charitable
entities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A told us about Hillary Rodham Clinton's pin money. I've
always been curious: Where does that expression come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: It goes way back, as the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins explains. Metal pins, invented perhaps as early as the 14th
century and later manufactured in England by a monopoly under
grants from the crown, were so costly and scarce at first that
there was a law forbidding their sale except on the first two days
of January each year. About that time of year, husbands customarily
gave their wives money to buy all the pins they would need for the
months ahead _ hence, pin money. When pins became less expensive,
the expression still was used for this annual stipend. It came to
mean a personal allowance given to a wife, generally, by her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   End take 2 of 2.

 &HT;    A taste of wine: Producer a breath of fresh air in outrageous
pricing world
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Quick, what's the hardest thing you've ever had
to do? Ever?
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Flynn can answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing I've ever had to do was to price the first
bottle of wine that I produced,'' said the proprietor of Flynn
Winery in Oregon. The bottle was a 1984 pinot noir. ``I decided to
be as close to under $10 as I could be.'' The wine came out at
$9.95.
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly 15 years ago. You know what has happened to wine
prices in the past decade and a half. They've risen faster than a
Champagne cork exits a warm, shaken bottle. Kapow. Through the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn produces two pinot noirs now. So what do you suppose they
cost?
</P>
<P>
   Um, $8.99 and $12.99. (The $12.99 wine is the one that used to
cost $9.95, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   And the wines are delicious. They could easily fetch more, if
Flynn was so inclined. He's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate raising prices,'' he said, shrugging. ``I don't mind
being known as a producer of less expensive wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my. Can we speed up that human cloning technology, please?
</P>
<P>
   Flynn is a breath of fresh air in a wine price world run amok.
And his down-to-earth sensibilities extend beyond pricing. He's one
of the few winemakers who will casually admit to using oak chips _
a quick shortcut to obtaining the flavors and aromas of oak-barrel
aging _ in his wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been honest so far, and it's served me well. No sense in
changing now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some other winemakers, especially in Flynn's price category,
would have you believe each of their bottles picks up that toasty,
vanilla-like note from the hand-crafted new-oak barrels they've
lined up in the cellar. It just doesn't seem as romantic to picture
a cellar worker tossing chunks of wood into a steel tank filled
with wine. But it's a touch of technology that Flynn doesn't mind
acknowledging using for his under-$10 ``Clos d'Or'' pinot noir and
chardonnay. Besides, those new French oak barrels are nastily
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn uses 15 pounds of toasted oak chips per 1,000 gallons, in
case you're wondering. ``Not to give oak flavors, but to soften the
wines a bit and bring out the fruit . . . I want to drink my wines,
not chew them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn produces a solid lineup of wines. They're worth seeking
out for their value, and heck, for the refreshing integrity of the
guy who's making them.
</P>
<P>
   The wines:
</P>
<P>
   _ Flynn Cellar Select 1997 Oregon Pinot Noir ``Clos d'Or,''
$8.99: Fruity, delicate, just a bit smoky. Pinot doesn't get any
better than this for the price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flynn 1996 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir, Willamette Valley,
$12.99: This wine has been aged 12 months in oak barrels and has a
bit more richness and a vanilla note that the less expensive pinot
doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flynn 1997 Pinot Noir Blanc, $7.99: This salmon-pink wine
makes a delicious alternative to white zinfandel. Great
concentration of fruit flavors balanced by just the right amount of
acidity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flynn Cellar Select 1997 Chardonnay ``Clos d'Or,'' $8.99:
Fruity, straightforward, great summertime white.

 &HT;    How I lost 60 pounds and finally won a fight with my wife
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Fighting over food _ low fat vs. low
carb _ got real ugly at my house.
</P>
<P>
   And it all started with a photo.
</P>
<P>
   In almost 30 years together, Margaret has rarely seen me as
stunned as the day that photo arrived in the mail from my pal Greg
in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   It was taken two months earlier, at an NBA Trailblazers game.
Greg had gotten my son, Nick, and I courtside seats _ and that
high-profile placement came with a price.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, there I was _ 5-feet, 7-inches, 246 pounds _ on
the arena's aptly named JumboTron scoreboard. A big gut, no neck,
poured into the seat.
</P>
<P>
   From a skybox, Greg snapped the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret leaned over to take a look. ``Wha'd you expect? You're
a fat pig.''
</P>
<P>
   To say Margaret, the oldest of 11 kids, was raised with wolves
is not a gross exaggeration. She favors a quick-strike, bludgeon
offense.
</P>
<P>
   This time she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret didn't grow up fat and wasn't going to settle for XL in
middle age.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, my 5-foot-4 wife had ballooned to 185 pounds.
If there was a diet she didn't try, it was only because it wasn't
printed in English. Packaged stuff from a strip-mall weight-loss
place. Weight Watchers. Starvation. Everything in between.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked long-term.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Margaret, who hates to cook, settled on a
low-fat diet and our kitchen became a fat-free zone. She also ran 3
or 4 miles a day and played for an indoor soccer team. She began to
see results.
</P>
<P>
   And then the fighting began.
</P>
<P>
   We live in Tampa, but I'm in West Palm Beach four days a week.
When I came home on weekends, the food wars started.
</P>
<P>
   I'd buy orange juice, and she'd go into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing but sugar!'' she'd yell. (She was right. There's
more sugar in OJ than Coke.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd bring home a couple of doughnuts and you'd think it was
crack cocaine. We couldn't eat in restaurants. She searched any bag
I brought home as though she worked for U.S. Customs and I was
arriving from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't about my health. Margaret doesn't worry about when I
drop dead but where I drop dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she often says, ``the paper's life insurance pays
double if you die working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   No, food fights were about our 12-year-old son. Nick doesn't
have a weight problem. Yet, says Margaret. ``If you think for one
minute that I'm going to let him eat like you ... ''
</P>
<P>
   You've got no shot when Margaret begins any argument with ``If
you think for one minute.'' You can actually feel the little army
men in your brain dropping their weapons and beating a fast
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   A prisoner of war, I joined her fat-free march when my Portland
photo arrived in March '98. With low fat, I was miserable. Always
hungry. I lost and gained. I finally gave up after five months.
</P>
<P>
   Motorized Margaret stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then low carb called to me.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to an audiobook of The Zone diet. I read more. I
understood the first two chapters of Protein Power. I couldn't stay
at 30 grams of carbs a day, so I invented my own diet, 50 to 75
grams of carbs daily, balanced with fat and protein.
</P>
<P>
   I quit eating bagels, fried food, pasta and all the obvious
sugar snacks. I ran/walked 2 miles, five days a week. I drank eight
glasses of water daily.
</P>
<P>
   In West Palm Beach, I don't cook, I eat at Howley's. I found low
carb to be restaurant friendly. I'd have a large Greek or Julienne
salad. Tuna sandwich. Chicken breasts. I had bacon, eggs, butter,
olives, cheese, nuts. At night I might have an apple or half of a
cantaloupe with Cool Whip.
</P>
<P>
   I bought low-carb. She bought low-fat.
</P>
<P>
   As I lost weight, it drove Margaret crazy. She couldn't get
enough low-fat microwave dinners, pasta, rice, bagels, cereal. The
fight was on. I'd ambush her worthless low-fat diet at night when
she'd be waiting for her usual bag of microwave popcorn or bowl of
low-fat ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Nick would wander into the kitchen. ``Can I have some ice
cream?''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret would say yes, it was low-fat.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say no, the fat was replaced by sugar that makes you
hungrier.
</P>
<P>
   She spent more than a year on low fat, lost 55 pounds and
stalled 10 pounds short of her goal.
</P>
<P>
   I spent six months on low carb and lost 60 pounds _ to within 10
pounds of what I weighed in high school 30 years ago. And I felt
better.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a truce arrived two weeks ago. Just in time. Margaret
was locked into low fat and taking some goofy appetite suppressant
pills she got from another soccer mom.
</P>
<P>
   I gave her Suzanne Somers' new diet book and told her to read
Dr. Diana Schwarzbein's foreward that explained low carb as clearly
as I'd seen it. Then I got her the clearly explained The
Schwarzbein Principle to read.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret read the nine low-fat side effects _ from cravings to
insomnia _ and admitted, ``I had them all.''
</P>
<P>
   She did low carb for a week and pronounced it a winner. Gone
were her cravings. She had more energy. ``I feel like a speed
freak!'' (For those of us from the late '60s, this is a good
feeling.)
</P>
<P>
   Nick wandered into the kitchen the other Saturday morning. He
smelled something foreign, something good. Margaret was microwaving
bacon to go with his scrambled eggs, a piece of peanut butter toast
and milk.
</P>
<P>
   His low-carb mother and father smiled as he devoured his
breakfast. He didn't ask for orange juice. Smart boy.

 &HT;    Boon or bane? A new comic courts controversy in its portrayal of
black life
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cartoonist Aaron McGruder has discovered that there
are some things that some people don't want to joke about, here at
the far end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Racial prejudice is one of them. Also plastic ``Star Wars''
light sabers.
</P>
<P>
   As far as race is concerned, McGruder knew that his strip ``The
Boondocks,'' featuring cub black nationalist Huey P. Freeman and
his gangsta-wannabe little brother, Riley, would ruffle some
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a small miracle that this strip ever saw the light of
day,'' says McGruder, 24, speaking from his ``office,'' which also
happens to be in his bedroom at his parents' house in suburban
Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   That's because McGruder makes punch lines out of, well, touchy
subjects. He pokes fun at white people who get nervous seeing a
black face in the neighborhood. And he pokes fun at black people
who consider straight hair to be ``good hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey and Riley are two Chicago boys who have just moved to the
suburbs _ i.e., ``The Boondocks'' _ and become strangers in a
strange hood. In one leafy, bucolic panel, Riley complains to Huey,
``We've been walking for 10 minutes and haven't passed one subway
stop, ball court, Chinese carryout place or rib shack!'' Replies
Huey, ``Riley, we are pilgrims in an unholy land.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Riley must practice his ``thug mug'' because, though he
wants to be bad, he's ``cursed with cuteness.'' And Huey's attempts
to raise his grandfather's Afrocentric consciousness generally
prompt an offer to whoop his behind.
</P>
<P>
   Marketed as a strip to appeal to the ``hip-hop generation,''
McGruder's dramatic, anime-influenced artwork and his puckish
sensibility have gone over big nationally. Universal Press
Syndicate reports that since its debut April 19 the strip has been
picked up by 180 newspapers, including the daily Constitution and
the weekend Journal-Constitution. It's one of the biggest launches
of any syndicated comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly equals the launches of `Calvin and Hobbes' and
`For Better or for Worse,''' said Lee Salem, Universal's editorial
director.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those strips, ``The Boondocks'' has also raised some
tempers. Newspapers around the country have received scores of
complaints, along with a smattering of positive notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to give the author of `Boondocks' space to
spew race hatred, I think you should offer David Dukes equal room
to express his views on the subject,'' Dunwoody resident Walter
Mitchell wrote to the AJC.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted by telephone, Mitchell, 70, says that the strip has
``toned down a little bit'' since the episode that annoyed him. In
that sequence Riley is called ``cute'' by an elderly woman and
rails that he won't become her ``house negro.'' (The lady, hard of
hearing, misses the little tyke's tirade.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got enough trouble without stirring things up like
that,'' says Mitchell, who is the former publisher of Southern
Accents magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Salem expected some white readers to be put off by the strip,
but some African-Americans have also failed to find it amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society already makes us look stupid anyway; why can't we have
a comic strip that is positive?'' says Travia Jones, 29, a resident
of Duluth. Jones was perplexed by a strip that showed a biracial
character, Jazmine, denying that she has an Afro, while her black
father ponders whether lye will straighten out his daughter's hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job to make black people look good,'' says the
self-possessed McGruder. If processed hair is silly, he says, then
he should make fun of it. ``In 1999 I still have people coming up
to me, black people, saying 'Oh you've got good hair.' The hair
thing has never gone away.''
</P>
<P>
   McGruder owes his ``good hair'' to his part-Indian heritage.
Otherwise, his background is not unlike Huey's. McGruder was born
in Chicago, but was moved shortly thereafter to suburbs in
Illinois, Kentucky and Maryland. ``Virtually all my life I've been
the only black face in class,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That could also describe his presence on the comics page. By
some estimates there are only a half-dozen syndicated black comic
strips. McGruder failed repeatedly to break into that small circle
until he attended a panel discussion at a 1997 meeting of the
National Association of Black Journalists, and passed his panels to
Harriet Choice of Universal Press.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the small world of black strips, opinion on McGruder's
work is divided. Barbara Brandon-Croft, who draws the weekly
feature ``Where I'm Coming From,'' which appears Mondays in the
AJC, says: ``I applaud Aaron. We haven't been able to talk about
things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon-Croft, 40, adds that the stodgy world of the funny
papers needs shaking up. ``You can't please everybody, and if you
did please everybody, you'd be 'Family Circus.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Ray Billingsley, author of ``Curtis,'' which runs in the
daily Journal and the weekend Journal-Constitution, suggests that
McGruder should be ``careful.'' The role of the comics is to
entertain, he maintains, not to provide political or social
commentary. ``We want the situation to get better,'' says
Billingsley, 41, ``we don't want to dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGruder's answer is characteristically blunt. ``That's a
crock,'' he says. ``Doonesbury'' and ``Bloom County'' regularly
skewered sacred cows, says McGruder, which is what he intends to do
as well. He ascribes some of the uneasiness surrounding ``The
Boondocks'' to an American double-standard. Compare his strip to
``Calvin and Hobbes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love Calvin, but he was a cynical, obnoxious little
kid. And not only that but extremely violent,'' says McGruder.
Indeed, Calvin fantasized about destroying his elementary school
with air-to-ground missiles. ``But when somebody like Riley looks
at somebody sideways, he's a menace.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: This week's sequence has Riley disappointed
with a plastic lightsaber because it won't actually chop any of his
enemies in half. He demonstrates the toy's ineffectiveness by
whacking two fellow characters.
</P>
<P>
   In this post-Columbine era some editors were skittish about
running the strip. ``We winced when we saw that one episode,'' says
Diane Bacha of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee paper will run the strip and continue carrying
``Boondocks,'' but at least one paper, the Aiken (S.C.) Standard,
has canceled it due to reader complaints.
</P>
<P>
   It's a plastic toy, for Pete's sake, says McGruder. ``I don't
see the connection between a kid going into a school armed to the
teeth, and a plastic lightsaber, which is obviously designed to
whack other kids with.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip will run in Thursday's Constitution, whose editors are
high on ``The Boondocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that it has more edge than other things on the
comics page, but it particularly speaks to younger readers,'' says
Susan Soper, assistant managing editor/features.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the paper is moving the strip. Next week, ``The
Boondocks'' will shift from the comics page to the second page of
the Living section, where the newspaper also runs the similarly
topical ``Doonesbury.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McGruder's career is on fast-forward. The cartoonist
was featured in the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune; the
Today Show plans a feature; he's chatted with filmmaker Reginald
Hudlin about TV and movie projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into this unafraid because I had such low
expectations,'' he says. ``The irony is that at end of the day the
same reason why the strip sold to 160 papers will be the same
reason the strip may get canceled out of some of those papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking a lot of people out of their comfort zones,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't care. You shouldn't have been there to begin
with.''

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kalman Gabriel started
this little project that has since landed him an agent, a book and
a 1998 Youth News Writers award. He liked to collect autographs,
but it got to be too expensive. So, he wrote to people, famous
people, and asked them a simple question: ``Dear So and So, I am a
12-year-old boy from Oyster Bay, New York. If you could give me
advice for life, what would it be?'' And for the next three years,
young Kalman kept his mailman on Long Island very, very busy.

beginning of the end of this Williamson County city's rock-solid
conservative, family-oriented image. Hooters is planning to open a
restaurant in Round Rock on Wednesday, June 16. Mothers, lock up
your husbands. Fathers, lock up your sons. Fathers, lock up your
daughters so they won't get jobs at Hooters running around
half-nekkid. (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   MIDLIFE-JOURNEY _ DAWSON CITY, Yukon Territory _ They weren't
kidding about this midnight sun business. An hour before midnight,
the sun hangs just above the mountain, flooding my camper, and if
I'm to get any sleep, I may have to climb the mountain with a bat
and beat the sun beneath the horizon. By 1:30 a.m. the sun subsides
just low enough to provide some darkness and with it, blessed
sleep. And the next morning, when the sun blazes out of a cloudless
horizon, warming my face, I bound out of bed and see by my watch
that it is 3:17 a.m. There are no roosters in the Yukon. They are
all in therapy. (EDS: This is Installment 15 in a series of columns

   DIET-COLUMN _ In February 1997, my 5-foot-4 wife had ballooned
to 185 pounds. If there was a diet she didn't try, it was only
because it wasn't printed in English. Packaged stuff from a
strip-mall weight-loss place. Weight Watchers. Starvation.
Everything in between. Nothing worked long-term. In February 1998,
Margaret, who hates to cook, settled on a low-fat diet and our
kitchen became a fat-free zone. She also ran 3 or 4 miles a day and
played for an indoor soccer team. She began to see results. And

thing I've ever had to do was to price the first bottle of wine
that I produced,'' said the proprietor of Flynn Winery in Oregon.
The bottle was a 1984 pinot noir. ``I decided to be as close to
under $10 as I could be.'' The wine came out at $9.95. That was
nearly 15 years ago. You know what has happened to wine prices in
the past decade and a half. They've risen faster than a Champagne
cork exits a warm, shaken bottle. Kapow. Through the roof. Flynn
produces two pinot noirs now. So what do you suppose they cost? Um,
$8.99 and $12.99. (The $12.99 wine is the one that used to cost
$9.95, by the way.) And the wines are delicious. (Fisher, Dayton

BUSH BEGINS _ BUT IN HIS OWN FASHION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now it begins.
</P>
<P>
   With the Texas Legislature officially adjourned, Gov. George W.
Bush can turn his attention to the business of running for
president. Although his candidacy is not yet official, the
possibility that Bush might decide against making the race is
virtually inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   He has come too far to turn back. The bandwagon has gained too
much momentum to suddenly slam on the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can call his upcoming campaign trips ``exploratory'' until
the cows come home, but everybody knows what he's doing: He's
launching his campaign for the Republican Party's 2000 presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he'll just say it and be done with it: ``I am a
candidate for president.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Bush is sticking to his plan, which is to
explore the viability of his presidential ambitions before making
them official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to test the waters,'' Bush said Tuesday during an
Austin news conference that generated nationwide news coverage.
``I'm going to start traveling the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody wanted to know what he meant by the phrase ``test the
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you fully committed to a run for the presidency?'' Bush
was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fully committed to start traveling the country,'' Bush
replied.
</P>
<P>
   This was a typical Bush-media exchange. Reporters try to bait
him into saying something he doesn't want to say, into going
farther than he wants to go in committing himself to future actions
or positions on likely campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for example, a reporter wanted Bush to take a position
on a local issue in Iowa _ one of the early and crucial states in
the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you wait until I get up there so I can make news up
there?'' Bush said, adding that he will ``have a strong statement
on that subject when I get up to Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's detractors often accuse him of being short-tempered, but
he never seems to lose his composure with reporters, no matter how
much they try to annoy him. He even has a little fun with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I don't want to do is preempt your
colleagues in Iowa,'' Bush told the reporter who sought his views
on that issue in the Hawkeye State.
</P>
<P>
   As he wrapped up the news conference, Bush managed to squeeze a
laugh out of his tormentors:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you're gonna get tired of me, but I will never get
tired of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bush's insistence on refusing to commit himself
before he's ready has been identified by his critics in the media
and elsewhere as a chink in his armor when in fact it is one of his
greatest strengths. By taking his time and making sure of the
direction he wants to go, Bush almost always avoids the unfortunate
process of backpedaling and ``clarifying'' that defines the public
pronouncements of so many politicians.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring nearly eight years of Bill Clinton's habitual
mind-changing, chronic about-facing and pathological
promise-breaking, the American people will be more than ready in
2000 for a presidential candidate who thinks things through before
staking out a position.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when candidates and officeholders react in knee-jerk
fashion to the slightest shift in the political winds _ when
politicians trip over themselves and each other trying to sprint to
the front of any parade that passes by _ voters will surely be
intrigued by a candidate who carefully considers the ramifications
of important issues before lining up on one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   If it's waffling to spend some time contemplating an issue and
then taking a position you are comfortable with, well, we could use
more wafflers in public office.
</P>
<P>
   Such cautious consideration is not waffling, of course. Waffling
is what Clinton does: Impulsively jumping into the fray in the hope
of gaining some short-term political advantage and then
flip-flopping later on.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of time for Bush to articulate his positions on
the important issues of the 2000 campaign. And when he does, there
will be no doubt where he stands.

 &HT;    PANEL SAYS MEDICARE SHOULD FOCUS ON ERRORS, END-OF-LIFE CARE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare should give a higher priority to reducing
medical errors and improving health care delivery to patients
nearing the end of life, a congressional advisory commission has
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations were part of a 164-page report delivered to
Congress late Tuesday by the 19-member non-partisan Medicare
Payment Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although studies have shown that elderly patients may be twice
as likely to suffer from medical errors than younger patients, the
commission noted that Medicare does not have policies designed to
reduce errors such as incorrect medication. Instead, the program
relies on outside quality-improvement organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended that Medicare establish policies that
would encourage the reporting of mistakes or ``near misses,'' such
as in the airline industry. Congress would have to ensure that
those reports remain confidential, the panel said. The panel also
recommended that Medicare encourage the use of autopsies to develop
information about errors in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Wilensky, chairman of the commission and a former head of
the Health Care Financing Administration which oversees Medicare,
said at a breakfast Wednesday with reporters that the use of such
reports would be aimed at identifying systems or patterns of
practice responsible for causing repeated errors, rather than
focusing on a specific mistake made by an individual doctor or
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also urged Medicare to give a higher priority to
making it easier for patients to receive high-quality care at the
end of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been too little thought to how to care for
chronically ill individuals, and even less about how to provide
care when people have reached a terminal point in their life,''
Wilensky said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare was designed to pay for acute care such as an illness
or surgical procedure, she said. Payment rules often do not mesh
well with long-term, debilitating illnesses such as chronic heart
disease which may result in death after a period of many months or
years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Medicare pays for hospice care _ generally designed to
provide support to patients whose death is expected within a brief
period _ it does not have a system to pay for longer-term care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need alternative payment models that provide supportive
care to people who are in a terminal phase,'' Wilensky said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that doctors, in many cases, do not know what
services Medicare will cover. For example, many doctors are unaware
that visits in which patients give directions what care they want
at the end of life, when they may be unconscious, are covered by
Medicare, Wilensky noted.

NETWORKS LEAVE MINORITY CHARACTERS OUT OF PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the 13th annual American Comedy Awards earlier
this year, D.L. Hughley, the African-American star of ABC's ``The
Hughleys,'' was a presenter along with co-star John Henton. As part
of their banter, Hinton asked Hughley: ``Don't we have any snappy
repartee?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Hughley replied.
</P>
<P>
   Hinton: ``Then why are we here?''
</P>
<P>
   Hughley deadpanned, ``If Fox (Network) wants to keep its FCC
license, it has to show at least two well-dressed black men not
being chased by cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. A number of black actors and comedians have grumbled that
Fox, which built its network on such African-American-centric
comedies as ``In Living Color'' and ``Martin,'' has abandoned
minorities in favor of aliens and ``reality'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're starting out, the networks  &UR; looove &LR;  black people.
Then, after they get successful, they switch over,'' said Tim Reid,
popular TV actor and creator of the second-season Showtime series
``Linc's,'' with a slightly sad laugh.
</P>
<P>
   If Fox is showing fewer faces of color, it certainly isn't
alone. When the networks announced their fall 1999 season lineups
in May, there wasn't a single show _ out of more than two dozen new
shows on the major networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox) _ that featured
a leading character who is a minority. This, after repeated public
hand-wringing and pledges on the part of network executives to ``do
better'' at representing America.
</P>
<P>
   Those promises continue. Asked by the Daily News about the
``whiteness'' of the fall lineup, ABC Entertainment president Jamie
Tarses replied last week that the network ``is aware that our new
programming doesn't represent the diversity we want to,'' and is
hoping to cast a few minorities into the new shows before the
season begins. Meanwhile, ABC moved ``The Hughleys'' from Tuesday
to Friday night _ a less desirable, lower-rated television viewing
night.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Masur, president of the Screen Actors Guild, says the
issue of equitable representation is something unions and viewers
have to keep reminding the networks of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (network executives) are unconcerned, but their
main concern is ratings. That's their business. ... It's our job to
remind them there are markets they're not addressing.'' SAG has put
out a number of studies documenting not only the
underrepresentation of racial minorities but also of women and
seniors in film and television.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it so difficult to get and sustain shows starring
minorities on mainstream television? Part of the problem,
certainly, is that the behind-screen people making these shows
don't represent America either. The extremely competitive and
relationship-driven business that develops and distributes TV shows
is still dominated by white men.
</P>
<P>
   Reid jokes, ``There's probably more blacks in the Aryan Nation
than there are in network boardrooms.'' Reid, who previously
starred on such shows as ``Frank's Place'' and ``WKRP in
Cincinnati,'' says he thinks it's ``a little immoral in this day
and age'' to have such a lack of diversity on television. But he
recognizes that when he pitches new shows that feature multiracial
casts, he must present it as a pure business decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks want to foster the belief that they're broad,
while the reality is, they and everyone else are now going into the
niche marketing business,'' Reid said. ``That means it's bad
business not to serve the whole community. They may be making a lot
of money right now, but it's not going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is echoed by Latinos, who are helping
Spanish-language radio and television stations overtake
English-language ones in major Latino markets. While black lead
characters are rare on the major networks, Latino leads are
virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Spanish language broadcaster) Univision has the fastest
growth of any network in the country,'' notes Ana Maria Fernandez
Haar, president and chief executive of Miami-based marketing firm
IAC Group and past president of the Association of Hispanic
Advertising Agencies. She says while it's disappointing that
Latinos are nearly invisible on the major networks, it has been a
boon to outlets such as Univision, which is attracting millions of
dollars in advertising money from companies eager to reach the
young and growing Latino family.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez Haar and Reid both attribute much of the erosion of
network viewership to minorities turning elsewhere for their
entertainment. ``I would say to network executives, `Would you like
to be a competitor in the years to come, or would you like to
disappear?'' said Fernandez Haar, who points out that Spanish is
the predominant language in our hemisphere and that whites are
expected to be a minority in the U.S. by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the ``suits'' who are white. The situation extends
to the writers who shape characters: According to Writers Guild of
America statistics, minority writers represented just 7 percent of
those employed in television work and 5 percent of those employed
in feature films in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When minority writers do get work, it's often ``limited to
specific sectors and genres,'' according to a study released by the
WGA late last year. That is, black writers are hired for black
shows. There are fewer of these shows, and they're more likely to
be on the lower-rated networks such as UPN rather than the four
major networks. While the WGA, like other Hollywood unions, has
diversity committees, seminars and the like, the percentage of
minority writers has remained fairly flat over the past six to
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent belief on the part of the major networks is that
advertisers want young, white and therefore ``upscale'' audiences.
This has resulted in the fall season being overloaded with ``dramas
of teen angst,'' as Les Moonves told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves is president of CBS, the only network that is bucking
that trend by programming to an older audience. But the face of the
network still remains overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves boasts, for the record, that CBS is the only network to
feature an Asian as the star of a TV series (although Sammo Hung's
role on ``Martial Law'' is somewhat stereotypical, and the show
airs on Saturday evening). Other than pointing out ``Martial Law,''
along with CBS' commitment to a new, multiracial midseason series
from ``Hill Street Blues'' creator Steven Bochco, Moonves
tap-danced around the question of race as much as Tarses and other
network bigwigs did.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers and show creators seeking better representation of
minorities on TV say the networks seem to have lost sight of the
forest for the trees. While white kids with lots of disposable
income are certainly attractive to advertisers, black, Latino and
Asian families with tens of billions of dollars of spending power
are extremely desirable, too. But for the most part, the networks
currently seem content to pick up minorities along with the rest of
the broad-as-possible audience they get with top sports and drama
programming while leaving shows built around minority characters to
the upstarts like UPN.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't wash with those who complain about
underrepresentation. ``If the networks claim advertisers want (just
young white people), why are marketers going the opposite way with
their ads?'' asks Fernandez Haar. She asserts that marketers,
because they must be in direct contact with their consumers and
respond quickly, are doing a better job of speaking to minorities
and showing them in their ads.
</P>
<P>
   Next season's lineup, top-heavy with whites and teens, may just
be another symptom of the networks struggling to keep their heads
above water in the rapidly shifting currents of the TV business.
Meanwhile, because of the lack of diversity in the system itself,
the networks may not even realize they're overlooking a major
problem.
</P>
<P>
   While viewers often grumble and occasionally will write to
networks to complain if they feel their race, age group or sex is
being unfairly ignored on TV programming, Masur says positive
encouragement is the most effective way to try to initiate change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraging anyone who feels underrepresented to, when
they see themselves in a positive way, write four letters _ one to
the producer, one to the network, one to a major sponsor and one to
the advertising agency. If 500 people say, `I'm not watching,'''
Masur says, ``that's not going to change your ratings. Big deal.
But 50 people on the plus side can really mean something.''

ADVERTISER-SPONSORED PROGRAMS ON THE WAY BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As much as the networks are scrambling to please
advertisers today, television in its early days was completely
advertiser-driven. The movie studios wanted nothing to do with TV
in its infancy _ they saw it as a threat to their business. So,
shows were underwritten by advertisers, who in exchange got to name
the show after themselves (Texaco Star Theater, Pepsi-Cola
Playhouse, Lux Video Theatre) and _ hopefully _ create a hit show
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Once the studios wised up, the business model changed. Studios
laid out the initial investment required to produce shows, then
sought to make their money back by selling the show and its
advertising time to broadcasters. This basic model has remained in
place to this day, though a few large companies such as Hallmark
have continued to make direct investments in programming.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a number of market forces are converging that may presage a
return to the old, advertiser-sponsored television show model. As
the TV audience continues to fragment _ with viewers being drawn
away by the new networks and myriad cable outlets _ the few shows
that do manage to attract a huge audience, such as ``ER,'' have
become insanely expensive to produce. And, even as the networks say
they're catering to what advertisers want, advertisers are
indicating that they're often frustrated with the offerings _ and
are looking for more control over the product.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Brand X, a newly formed Beverly Hills-based company that
is devoted to developing advertiser-sponsored, ``branded''
programming. The firm is seeking to update the old formula for
making TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Brand X partner Heidi Sinclair thinks the change could have only
a positive effect on on-screen diversity. ``Most companies ... are
trying to talk to the breadth of their consumers. What they're
doing already in their marketing better reflects our society today
(than does a lot of television),'' said Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brand X's first show isn't expected to hit the air until
early next year, Sinclair can't get too specific about their
projects. But she says companies are definitely looking to promote
diversity in their programming.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair says that currently, the networks seem to be targeting
a very narrow demographic (``upscale'' _ read, mostly white _
younger adults) at the expense of diversity. ``The networks say,
here are our demos. Advertisers just have to react against that.
We're looking at a more collaborative process, which I think will
end up being more representative of the larger consumer community
than the target demographic communities the networks are
promoting.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Time to pay respects to the lowly onion
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever contemplated onions? Probably not. They hang
humbly in their little mesh sacks in probably every kitchen on
earth, and nobody ever pays them much attention or ever considers
where we would be without them. Yet the lack of an onion at a
crucial time can send you out to hunt one up more quickly than just
about anything, so necessary are they to our palates. The pale,
unassuming onion: always in the background, perpetually playing a
supporting role, allowing flashier foods to shine and dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   Onions weren't always taken so much for granted. When the world
was younger and people had a lot less to distract them, folks
flat-out marveled at the onion, which was one of the first
vegetables that humans cultivated for food after it emerged from
the primordial ooze. With its translucent layers and spheres within
spheres, the onion took on religious significance. The Egyptians
believed them nothing less than a symbol of eternity and took their
sacred oaths on onions.
</P>
<P>
   The Byzantine domes that are part of the architecture of
religious structures the world over? Onions.
</P>
<P>
   Their value became more secular during the Middle Ages, when you
could pay off your debts with a sack of onions. During the Civil
War, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant informed the War Department, ``I will
not move my army without onions.'' Three trainloads were delivered
to the front the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization has long since stopped marveling at onions, but
once a year we do get a chance to give them a bit of well-deserved
attention. This is onion season, when growers in places such as
Washington state, Idaho, Oregon, Hawaii, South Texas and, of
course, South Georgia begin tooting their horns about their crop
and everyone becomes a little more aware of the humble bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Now's a good time to renew our appreciation for the onion, and
about 10 minutes on the Internet allows you to pay proper homage.

<P>
   &QR;  With all the emphasis on the ancient religious significance of
onions, we forgot to mention that they were once considered a
powerful aphrodisiac. Roman writer Martial advised, ``If your wife
is old and you're . . . exhausted, eat onions in plenty.'' To see

 &HT;    Marion Cunningham shares recipes from her new book `Learning to
Cook with Marion Cunningham'
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of Marion Cunningham's recipes are stylish and
contemporary, others homey and old fashioned. But all have her
imprint: simple, fresh ingredients combine in ways that make sense.
Even experienced cooks can learn some lessons from this book.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   The Best Oatmeal Cookies
</P>
<P>
   Makes 48 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: 10 minutes per batch
</P>
<P>
   What makes this oatmeal cookie the ``best,'' writes Cunningham,
is that it has ``all the virtues of a true oatmeal cookie without
the usual `klutzy' coarseness.''
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups quick-cooking (1-minute) oats
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Place one oven rack in center of oven. Preheat oven to 350
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place softened butter in a large bowl. Add sugar. Using back of
a spoon, vigorously mash and scrape butter against sides and bottom
of bowl, gradually mixing into sugar until it becomes smooth and
pale yellow. (Can also be done with electric mixer.)
</P>
<P>
   Add flour, oats, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and vanilla extract
to bowl. Using hands (or a sturdy spoon or electric mixer), blend
dry ingredients into the butter by pressing and squeezing dough
between fingers until it becomes a solid mass with no loose flour
or oats in bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Grease 2 cookie sheets with butter or nonstick cooking spray.
Using a small spoon, scoop up 1 rounded teaspoon of dough and
gently roll it between palms of your hands to form a small ball.
Place dough ball on a corner of greased cookie sheet, about 1 inch
from sides. Form another ball of dough and put on cookie sheet
about 2 inches from first one. Continue until 2 sheets are filled,
with 12 evenly spaced balls of dough on each. Using palm of your
hand, press lightly on each to flatten into a 1/4-inch-thick round.
</P>
<P>
   Put one cookie sheet in oven at a time and bake 10 minutes, or
until edges are golden brown. If not ready after 10 minutes, bake
another 2 minutes and check again.
</P>
<P>
   Place second sheet in oven and repeat baking instructions. Place
cookie sheets on heatproof counter or stovetop and let cool about
10 minutes. Remove cookies with spatula to a flat surface.
</P>
<P>
   Grease cookie sheets again and continue to make cookies until
all dough is used.

   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Smothered Chicken With Mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those dishes that everyone seems to like,''
writes Cunningham. ``The flavors are captured in the simple sauce
that brings together the delicate chicken flavor and the earthy
mushrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   4 chicken breast halves (with ribs and skin)
</P>
<P>
   2 medium yellow onions
</P>
<P>
   Salt and black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups chicken broth, canned or homemade, divided
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch parsley
</P>
<P>
   4 slices bread
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse chicken pieces under cold running water and pat dry with
paper towels. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and chop onions. Set aside. Salt and pepper chicken to
taste. Put oil in large skillet and place over medium-high heat.
Hold your hand about an inch above the bottom of the pan; if it
feels hot, it's ready. Place chicken, skin side down, in hot oil.
Cook 1 to 2 minutes; spear a piece with a fork to check underside
for brownness. If not brown, cook another minute or 2. If brown,
turn over and cook on other side for another 2 minutes. When all
the pieces are browned, put them into a 2-quart casserole with lid.
Cover and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put onions in same skillet and saute until just brown, about 2
to 3 minutes. Put 1/2 cup chicken broth and flour in a jar with a
lid. Tighten the lid and shake jar vigorously for 1 minute, until
well-mixed and without flour lumps. Pour into skillet with heat
still at medium-high, continuing to stir for about 1 minute as the
sauce thickens. Slowly add remaining broth and constantly stir
around sides and bottom of skillet about 1 minute. Remove from
stove when smooth and thick-soup consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Pour sauce over chicken. Cover casserole, place in oven and bake
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As chicken cooks, wipe mushrooms clean with paper towel and cut
into quarters.
</P>
<P>
   When chicken has cooked 20 minutes, add mushrooms, cover, and
cook another 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As chicken cooks, finely chop enough parsley to make 1/2 cup.
Just before chicken is done, toast bread and butter generously.
</P>
<P>
   Remove casserole from oven and add salt and pepper to taste, if
desired. Place a slice of toast on each plate and top with chicken,
mushrooms and sauce. Sprinkle each generously with parsley. Serve
hot.

   SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Parsley Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Here, Cunningham raises the stature of the most mundane of herbs
by transforming it into a palate-cleansing salad. ``Don't think of
this as a typical salad,'' she notes. ``It should be served in
portions of 1/2 to 3/4 cup per serving. Try it with steak, or James
Beard's Roasted Spareribs (see recipe) or add it to spaghetti.The
salad will keep refrigerated for about a week.''
</P>
<P>
   For the dressing:
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the salad:
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 bunches curly-leaf parsley (4 cups, chopped)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   To make dressing: Remove the papery skin from the garlic cloves.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using a food processor or blender, put the oil and
the peeled garlic cloves into the bowl of the processor and blend
until the garlic is smoothly incorporated into the oil. Add the
vinegar, salt and pepper and blend.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not using a food processor, crush garlic cloves by
setting them on a cutting board and smashing them under the
broadest flat surface of a large knife _ the part nearest the
handle. Sprinkle the salt over the smashed garlic and use the same
knife to chop the cloves finely. The garlic juices melt the salt
and help spread the garlic flavor through the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Using the flat side of your knife, scrape up the garlic-and-salt
mash and put it into a small jar with a lid. Add olive oil, vinegar
and pepper. Screw on lid and shake well.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare parsley: Rinse under cold water and shake off excess
water. Pat dry with paper towels or spin dry in salad spinner.
Remove stems and discard. Separate clusters of leaves to make
fluffy pile of green.
</P>
<P>
   Put parsley in a bowl, pour dressing over it and sprinkle on
Parmesan cheese. Using hands or large spoon, mix well so dressing
and cheese coat parsley evenly.

<P>
   Preparation time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Cunningham isn't averse to odd ideas if they work. Crushing the
pasta, she writes, transforms it ``into a wonderful new texture,
and with the tomatoes and eggplant it becomes a complete meal in
one dish.''
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 cup small elbow macaroni
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh spinach (2 cups chopped)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 small eggplant
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 large cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 medium tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon pepper, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups canned stewed tomatoes, undrained
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 2 teaspoons oil into an 8-by-8-by-2-inch baking dish and
smear around bottom and sides, using fingers or paper towel. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Put macaroni in plastic bag and seal. Using rolling pin or
glass, crush macaroni, rolling it back and forth until each piece
is crushed into small pieces but not a powder. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Wash spinach and chop into large pieces. Press firmly into
measuring cup, and measure about 2 cups. Set aside in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Wash parsley and pat dry. Remove and discard stems. Finely chop
leaves. Place in bowl with spinach and toss. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Slice about 1/4 inch off stem end of eggplant and discard.
Leaving skin on eggplant, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch rounds. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place remaining olive oil and water into small lidded jar.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and finely chop garlic and add to jar. Cover and shake a
few seconds until well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Cut fresh tomatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices and
place in single layer in bottom of prepared baking dish. Add 1/2
teaspoon each salt and pepper. Spread half of spinach-parsley
mixture over tomatoes. Sprinkle crushed macaroni evenly over
spinach and parsley. Add remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper,
then another layer of spinach and parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Spread stewed tomatoes and liquid over spinach and parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Place eggplant slices over stewed tomatoes. Shake water-oil
mixture again until well-blended. Drizzle over top. Cover dish
snugly with foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 1 hour. To test for doneness, bite into a piece of
macaroni. If not tender, cook another 10 minutes and test again.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and let stand a few minutes, or until bubbling
subsides. Serve warm.

<P>
   Beard used to teach this recipe in his classes. Cunningham
writes that you can really taste the pork; after all, ``Who needs
all that BBQ sauce?''
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds meaty pork spareribs
</P>
<P>
   Generous salt (up to 2 tablespoons) and freshly ground black
pepper (up to 1 tablespoon) to taste
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the ribs with salt and pepper on both sides. Set a roasting
or broiler rack in a roasting pan. Arrange ribs on the rack, meaty
side facing up. Put the pan on the center rack of the oven and bake
for 30 minutes. Using a pair of tongs, turn the ribs over and cook
for another 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the second 30 minutes are up, the ribs should be nicely
browned and fairly crisp on the outside. If not, roast for another
10 minutes and check again.
</P>
<P>
   When you are serving the ribs, cut the rack into separate racks
of 3 or 4 ribs per person and place on a platter or plates. Serve
hot.

   Roasting the tomatoes beforehand intensifies the flavor.
Cunningham says, ``This recipe is just the thing when you can't
find perfect fresh tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   12 Roma or plum tomatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch parsley, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   4 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt (for cooking the pasta)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound (12 ounces) dried spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh basil ( 1/2 cup chopped)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise, and place them _ cut side
up _ in a large, shallow baking dish. Salt and pepper them lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and finely chop garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Wash the parsley and pat dry; remove and discard the stems.
Finely chop the leaves (you want about 1/2 cup).
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the garlic, half the parsley and 2 tablespoons of
the olive oil in a small bowl. Using a spoon or your fingers, pat
the garlic mixture on the tomatoes and drizzle on 2 more
tablespoons of the olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 45 minutes, uncovered. The tomatoes should be mushy; if
not, bake for another 10 minutes and test again.
</P>
<P>
   After the tomatoes have baked for 30 minutes, fill a 6-quart pot
about 2/3 full of water, stir in the 1 tablespoon salt and set over
high heat, covered. When the water reaches a full boil, add the
spaghetti and stir. After about 10 minutes, start testing pieces of
pasta every minute or so.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the water and the spaghetti into a colander set in the
sink. Let the pasta drain.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a small pot over medium heat. Chop the basil
leaves into small pieces. In a large serving bowl, mix together the
remaining parsley and olive oil, melted butter and basil. Add the
drained spaghetti and the baked tomatoes. Using two forks, lift
small batches of spaghetti until it is all coated with the
oil-butter mixture and the tomatoes are well-distributed. Serve
immediately.

 &HT;    Ex-James Beard aide and prime advocate of home cooking aims to
bring families back to the table
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marion Cunningham is excited about lunch at Watershed
in Decatur (Ga.). She's already a fan of executive chef Scott
Peacock and has heard something about the reputed fame of owner
Emily Saliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't she one of the Spice Girls? No? An Indigo Girl?'' She
lets out a hearty laugh. ``Well, at my age you don't know all these
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's age is 77, and her field of expertise is American
home cooking, so it's easy to see why she's more comfortable
talking gingersnaps than Ginger Spice. Tall, charismatic and full
of energy despite a 4 a.m. wake-up call, this striking woman in hip
jewelry makes senior citizenship seem like nothing more than a few
wrinkles. And even her wrinkles are elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch (potato gnocchi, which she loves) Cunningham speaks
about her years as personal assistant to father of American food
writing James Beard, her late-in-life career as a cookbook author
and cooking teacher, and her campaign to save the family meal from
extinction. Her persona is at once old-fashioned and California
contemporary. Even as she talks fondly of beef stew perfuming her
Bay area home, you suspect it's not a house filled with lace
doilies and crocheted samplers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Cunningham stops herself in mid-
</P>
<P>
   sentence, folds her large hands on the table and laughs. ``My
God, I'm talking a lot about myself. What would my mother say?''
</P>
<P>
   But those expressive hands keep talking. You can imagine all the
pie dough and pot roasts that have passed through them. You can see
them, too, in her latest cookbook, ``Learning to Cook With Marion
Cunningham'' (Knopf, $29.95). The book is a mixture of homey
recipes spelled out in plain terms for beginners and a source of
gentle, nudging encouragement to get in the kitchen and cook.
Throughout, it features intimate portraits of Cunningham's hands
performing everyday kitchen tasks _ cutting a drumstick off a roast
chicken, stuffing garlic into slits in a leg of lamb _ that most
cookbooks don't illustrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually very clumsy,'' Cunningham admits, ``and I'm
left-handed so it looks awkward. But I'm able to do every job I
need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's longtime editor, Judith Jones, convinced her to
lend her hands to the project. ``They're long and gnarled and just
beautiful,'' said Jones by telephone. ``I wanted them almost as a
comfort for the readers, who could be in the kitchen with a
grandmother rather than witnessing the high jinks that a chef can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The book grew out of a yearlong series of classes that
Cunningham held at her house with six adults who had never before
cooked. For this lifelong veteran of home-prepared meals, the
students' perspective was an eye-opener. They hated going to
supermarkets because they were overwhelmed by the rice selection.
They were mystified when asked to ``dot with butter.'' They were
intimidated by busy-looking cookbooks. They thought that if a
recipe called for green onions, you had to cut off the white part.
It took Cunningham little time to realize she was up against ``a
combination of fear and inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   Her goal was not to transform these can't-boil-water wimps into
gourmet Pygmalions but to make them comfortable preparing meals at
home. ``Whether it's wonderful or just OK food doesn't matter. It's
the action in the kitchen and sitting down together _ that's what's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham used the students' suggestions to determine the tone,
look and content of ``Learning to Cook.'' More than anything, she
worked on the language and wording of recipes, using vivid images
and steering clear of jargon. For stuffed cherry tomato appetizers,
she crumbles crisp bacon ``into small bits, about the size of Rice
Krispies''; or, in a recipe for basic risotto, she ingenuously
comments, ``when the rice is tender and ... has a creamy
consistency, almost like thick oatmeal, it is done.''
</P>
<P>
   No dish was too basic for these beginners or, Cunningham
suspects, millions of other Americans. So in addition to offering
contemporary dishes such as fish baked in parchment and pasta with
chile and cilantro, she hashes out detailed recipes for scrambled
eggs, baked potatoes and hamburgers. Does anyone really need a
recipe for hamburgers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she says vehemently. ``There's an art to making a good
hamburger. If you've never made one, you want to pat and fiddle
around with that ground meat too much. Some of the most simple
things are harder than the harder things.''
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Cunningham's students had developed ``enough
confidence to invite people over,'' she notes. ``It was interesting
to see what evolved. One of them is quite the food snob now!''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham knows firsthand that a mere cooking class can have a
profound impact. In 1972, when she was a 50-year-old California
housewife and mother of grown children, she ventured north to
Oregon to take a class with James Beard, her favorite cookbook
writer. (``He sort of talked to you through the pages.''). Beard
asked if she would become his assistant and for the next 11 years,
until Beard's death at age 83, she was his right hand at cooking
classes throughout the world. It was a change for a woman whose
only previous job had been in a service station during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Beard also hooked Cunningham up with Jones, who was looking for
a home cook to test and revise the 1,800 recipes in the ``Fannie
Farmer Cookbook,'' the classic text written by a Boston housewife
in 1896. ``I wanted someone who could take these old recipes and
change them, but still respect what Fannie did,'' said Jones.
Published in 1979, the book established Cunningham as a kind of
culinary missing link _ a gray-haired cookie baker who also travels
in the high-profile American food world. She's the mom with the
golden palate.
</P>
<P>
   She has cultivated this unique role in the intervening years.
Now settled in the Bay area, she is both a cooking teacher who
works with children and a regular dining companion of the San
Francisco Chronicle restaurant critic.
</P>
<P>
   Having shared an excellent meal with her at Watershed and a
mediocre one elsewhere, I can tell you the only thing Cunningham
doesn't mince is words. She is vocal about her likes and dislikes,
and praises upscale restaurant food as long is it honest and not
overly stylized, because ``pretty is as pretty tastes.'' But, when
she encounters a nouvelle carrot soup screaming with ginger, she
puts down her spoon after one bite and says, ``I think soup should
be soothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, she remains true to her love of simple American food
_ the meatloaf, head-lettuce salad and baking powder biscuits that
the other Marion Cunningham served to Richie and the gang on
``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of us grew up on this food, Cunningham is really the
only major food personality speaking out for it. To her, it is
vital for a simple reason: The less Americans consider traditional
home cooking, the less they cook at home.
</P>
<P>
   In the preface to ``Learning to Cook,'' she addresses the
disappearing dinner hour. ``There are all kinds of reasons given _
lack of time, other demands at the family dinner hour, anxiety
about wasting ingredients not eaten up, the ease of eating in a
restaurant, the lure of takeout foods. But the main reason nobody's
in the kitchen, I began to suspect, was that people today are
uneasy about cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it roast beef hash therapy. Or chicken soup for the
stomach. Cunningham thinks that concise recipes for old-time
favorites might bring families back to the kitchen and back to the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds so preachy,'' she says over dessert, a chocolate
layer cake that gets high marks. ``Yet there's this mission I have
about trying to get people to share food together.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't we looking at a future of supermarket sushi and
chicken wraps?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stick to the idea that people might return to
more home cooking.'' She says it in a measured tone _ part realism,
part hope.

 &HT;    Big response is the icing on the cake
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A request from Dorothy Rogers of Decatur (Ga.) almost
a year ago for a poppy seed cake and its ``special icing'' fell
through the cracks here at the Recipe Swap. When it turned up
again, we called Rogers, who said that in the meantime she had
found a recipe but would welcome others.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of publishing her belated request two weeks ago, we

CHAMPAGNE PRICES UP AS Y2K COUNTS DOWN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rumors that worldwide revelry this New Year's will
create a champagne shortage are greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   So says Don Atkinson, a wine salesman for the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give the Frenchman your money, he's going to give you
something,'' said Atkinson, a senior wine consultant at Manhattan's
Astor Wine &AMP; Spirits.
</P>
<P>
   True champagne comes exclusively from the Champagne region, a
province northeast of Paris encompassing only 85,000 acres. A rush
of New Year's parties to celebrate the year 2000, some fear, could
mean bubble trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson has seen prices rise a few dollars a bottle, but he
believes the increase is more hype than shortage. Still, Atkinson
said he already has a few bottles of choice libations stashed away,
to guard against future price increases if not shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told all my regular customers to buy now, especially if
you're going to buy a lot of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The importers have already put retailers like Atkinson on a
ration of the finest champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts are predicting that shortages, if any develop at
all, will only affect the best champagnes, like Dom Perignon. Top
shelf champagnes start at about $100 and, depending on the vintage
and blend, can cost hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tell a lot of our customers is what will really be
depleted is prestige cuvees,'' said Michele Lawton, marketing
manager for Remy Amerique, which supplies Heidsick champagnes to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already seen our sales up 30 percent,'' Lawton said. ``We
plan on selling 80 percent of our volume by September.'' Forty-five
percent is normal every year, except this millenium year.
</P>
<P>
   Any bubbly not produced in the Champagne region is only
sparkling wine. Mass-produced brands like Korbel are in little
danger of running out of supply.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation that demand for champagne would surge for the
coming New Year comes as no surprise to the French vintners.
</P>
<P>
   The New York office of the Champagne Wines Information Bureau,
which represents champagne suppliers, says 300 million bottles are
on their way to America. Six years ago, only 11 million bottles
were exported to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our champagne sales were normal up until last November,'' said
Michael Aaron, chairman of Sherry-Lehman of Manhattan. ``That's
when everybody seems to have been bitten by the millennium bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices at Sherry-Lehman, which boasts the highest volume of any
single store in the country, have crept up as importers have made
it more difficult to buy top-quality champagne, Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   The liquor store executive attributed some of the increase in
Champagne sales to the publicity around rumored shortages. He said
volume this February was 55 percent higher than last February.
Sales were up 15 percent this March.
</P>
<P>
   At Flute, a tony champagne bar in midtown Manhattan, owner Herve
Rousseau is not worried about running out of the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Flute offers some 14 different champagnes by the glass, and more
than 100 bottles. Prices range from $30 for a bottle of California
sparkling wine to $1,200 for a magnum of 1973 Krug.
</P>
<P>
   Located just a few blocks from Times Square, Rousseau is
planning to throw a $500 fixed-price New Year's party, complete
with caviar and some of his better bubbly. Running out of the good
stuff is not a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they really have millions and millions of bottles,''
he said. ``So it should be OK.

FROM THE THINKER TO THE NOODLE: MUSEUM SHOPS COMMODIFY ART 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tucked into a discrete corner near the entrance to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art there were once delicate postcards
and etchings for sale in a tiny shop. But that was in 1871. Nearly
125 years later, things are very different.
</P>
<P>
   Today that little shop has expanded to 18,760 square feet on two
and a half floors, with gold and mirrored walls. Discrete little
postcards are also a thing of the past. Today the store sells
thousands of different products _ everything from ties and scarves
to board games, stuffed animals and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the museum shop frenzy has spread across the
nation. Today, there are 1,855 museum shops registered with the
Museum Shop Association, a Denver-based trade group. The
``art-inspired'' merchandise for sale at these shops include
everything from pens with plastic eyeballs on top of them to
baseballs emblazoned with Cezanne's signature and pasta noodles
shaped like Rodin's ``Thinker.'' Prices range anywhere from 50
cents for a pencil with the museum's logo, to thousands of dollars
for limited edition prints.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that selling ``all-American'' merchandise such as
art-inspired baseballs democratizes the highbrow art world and
attracts the public to museums. But art purists believe that
turning works of art into menial objects like magnets and T-shirts
is demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's a manifestation of a deeper problem in our
society, which is that people aren't yet at the point of accepting
the experience of art as being the wonder of looking at something
and not taking it with you,'' said Nicholas Fox Weber, a
Connecticut art historian. ``I am not impressed with the idea of
taking a Picasso painting and putting it on an ashtray or a Jackson
Pollack and putting it on some underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to retailers at museum shops, the merchandise for
sale only re-enforces the public's cultural education and allows
customers to bring a little art into their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very, very few people who can afford to have a Monet
in their house, but there are many, many people who can have a
print or a book or something representative of the artist,'' said
Judy Oldfield, the director of operations at the Museum Company
Store, a private retail operation that buys wholesale products from
250 museums across the nation. ``There are plenty of art movements
that have historically sought to democratize art and I personally
think that this is great.''
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers, the museum stores offer a chance to buy a token
related to a current exhibition or a favorite artist. The question
of taste is an important one for many shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big fan of having a Picasso on a watch or a Klimt
impression on a scarf because I think that's just tacky,'' said a
German tourist, Eva Steiner, while browsing in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art Store in New York. ``But the fact is that not
everybody can buy a real Picasso, so I think that it's okay to have
a poster in your house.''
</P>
<P>
   For museums, the thriving retail industry has brought in
much-needed revenue to support programs and institutional costs.
According to the Washington-based American Association of Museums,
museums derive about 8 percent of their total operating income from
gift shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to raise taxes to support cultural
institutions and they are extremely critical of raising the price
of admissions, so how are we supposed to maintain them?'' said John
Curran, the vice president of merchandising at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. ``Letting them help themselves is one way they can
do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The store at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which sells
merchandise produced exclusively by the museum's in-house
reproduction studios, generates about $80 million a year. Nearly 10
percent of that is revenue that goes toward the operating budget of
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about survival,'' Curran said. ``It's about
helping to support institutions that people really love and feel
that it is important to maintain for educational purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   But would Rodin be rolling in his grave if he knew that his
famous ``Thinker'' statue had been reduced to a noodle? Would
Cezanne be mortified if he knew that his signature was being
slapped around by a baseball bat? According to merchandisers and
art retailers, it doesn't matter. The fact is that times have
changed and these products reflect an evolution of our culture.
Michelangelo might not be happy that his beloved ``David'' statue
is now a naked refrigerator magnet ready to be dressed in drag, but
good or bad, they say, that is the reality of culture today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are living in times when people's tastes and the
way they dress, the music they listen to, the shows they watch are
obviously not the same as in Michelangelo's time,'' Curran said.
``Even artwork produced today reflects that. So, therefore does the
merchandise that sells.''

 WHEN IT COMES TO TEENAGE SEX, IS IT BABY THINK IT OVER?
 For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By RAMONA JENKIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marguerita Rodriguez sat in the health clinic at St.
Columba School in Newark, N.J., filling out forms to help get
medical benefits for her 2-year-old daughter, Shailene, who was
fussing in her stroller.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 18, became a high school drop-out three years ago
after she got pregnant with Shailene despite her participation in
an eighth grade health class at St. Columba that used an
infant-like doll called Baby Think It Over.
</P>
<P>
   The doll is intended to help teen-agers think twice about what
it is like to be a parent _ sleepless nights, never-ending feeding
schedules, lack of freedom _ before they engage in sexual activity
and find themselves on the fast track to responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   For a full week Rodriguez had to insert a special key into the
control box to quiet the doll, programmed to cry throughout the day
and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' Rodriguez said. ``I had to take it everywhere
with me _ on the bus, to hang out with the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the week I was saying, 'I'm never having a
baby,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, 24, did not go through the program, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later she became one of approximately 500,000
teen-agers who become pregnant each year in the United States,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   St. Columba's program is voluntary and requires parental
permission, said Betty Rosenbaum, a nurse who helps run the
program. Few boys choose to participate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no pregnancies in eighth grade girls that she
knows of since the program started three years ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will only work if it's done with a very structured
program if it is accompanied by a larger program,'' Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-agers live for the moment,'' said Mary Jurmain, president
of Baby Think It Over.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to get teen-agers to stop and think what caring for
a baby really involves, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the company has been selling the dolls, now priced
at $295, to licensed professionals _ teachers, nurses, social
workers and doctors _ at schools, health centers and other
organizations that provide comprehensive health education for
teen-agers, Jurmain said.
</P>
<P>
   One of their printed advertisements states ``successful programs
are reporting reductions in pregnancy of over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But four years, 40,000 dolls, a million doll-educated teen-agers
and over $11 million in sales later it is unclear what role the
doll really plays in the prevention of pregnancy in teen-agers like
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   CDC data show there has been a 5 percent decrease in births to
teen-age mothers aged 15 to 19 between 1991 and 1995, said Michelle
O'Connell, a consultant for the Department of Health and Human
Services' Office of Population Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   OPA provides grants for 57 programs around the country to
develop pregnancy prevention strategies, she said. About 10 percent
use Baby Think It Over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnancy rates and sexual activity have gone down,''
O'Connell said. ``That says that everything we're doing is
working.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that probably ``it's all AIDS and the fear are what's
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baby Think It Over program is an attractive idea,'' said
Dennis McBride, a program evaluator for OPA.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult and expensive to set up studies that look at
long-term outcomes, like pregnancy rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A study would have to randomize teen-agers getting different
interventions and follow them up over several years, McBride said.
That would mean some students would get the doll and others would
not.
</P>
<P>
   There is reluctance to withhold an intervention if there is any
possibility that it may have even a small impact on reducing
pregnancy rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doll is nothing more than a tool,'' said Brenda Lee Green
of Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania. Almost 3,000 public school
teen-aged boys and girls have gone through their comprehensive
health curriculum around the doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local pregnancy rates are in line with the national
rates,'' she said. She attributed the local decline in rates to
easier access to contraception and better education.
</P>
<P>
   But in a handful of teen-agers there were unexpected reactions
to the doll, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of the kids it did the complete opposite,'' she said.
``It confirmed to them that they wanted a baby. They enjoyed it.
They liked the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our educators did some pretty serious processing around
that,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Think It Over does not have any plans to do studies to
answer the question about preventing pregnancy outcomes, Jurmain
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to do it we'd have to hire an outside study to avoid
conflict of interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have $40,000 to spend are we going to spend it on a
study?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a business,'' Jurmain said. ``We have to look at the
most efficient way for us to spend our money.''

FOR BILLBOARD PAINTERS THE ROADSHOW NEARS THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By GEORGINA GUSTIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They scale sheer vertical walls in every extreme of
temperature. They hang above speeding traffic and crowded
intersections at spectacular heights. They put themselves face to
face with tough cowboys and dangerous women daily.
</P>
<P>
   They are billboard painters _ the people who climb hundreds of
feet in the air with a few cans of paint and a brush to render
images that have become as much a part of this country's roadscape
as truck stops and budget motels. And they are a vanishing species.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the images on billboards, like the famous
Marlboro Man, have seeped into American lore, the people
responsible for creating them have remained anonymous. And now,
with changes in the billboard industry, these invisible artisans
may disappear altogether.
</P>
<P>
   To the average driver, the target of billboard ads, the
existence of these huge pictures is almost a mystery. Yet the
process of creating them requires agility and craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   To create a billboard, a painter stands on a platform that is
rigged on a pulley system enabling him to maneuver across the
billboard's surface. He carries a ruler so that he can measure a
grid onto the billboard and paint an image to scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billboards are quite noticeable, they're right in front of
you,'' said Jason Perline, a longtime billboard professional. ``It
amazes me that people still don't know about them. People think
they're there by divine right.''
</P>
<P>
   Perline knows better. The former owner of Van Wagner Outdoor
Advertising, he presided over some hugely successful billboard
campaigns, including the infamous Brooke Shields ad which featured
the then-adolescent model lying seductively above Times Square
wearing nothing but a half-open blouse and her Calvins.
</P>
<P>
   Perline respects the process of creating billboards. ``I was
once on a scaffold,'' he said. ``I said I'll never do it again. It
was scary as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the many personal characteristics required of a billboard
painter, a fear of heights is not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a can-do attitude, the ability to think on your
feet,'' said Scott Charmichael, 43, of Scott Signs in New Jersey.
``You have to be intelligent because you're always being faced with
a new set of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``You don't want somebody who's always tripping
over their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   When potential painters come into his office seeking employment,
Charmichael instructs them to climb a ladder that he keeps in his
studio to test their confidence and comfort level up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want some kid who's got something to prove,''
Charmichael said. ``Guys come in here and say, `I'm not afraid to
die. I'm not afraid of anything.' Well, it's not worth dying for.
It's only advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the painters, including Charmichael, a billboard is far
more than an appeal to drive-by consumers or a health risk. It's an
artistic challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Many billboard painters have formal art training.
</P>
<P>
   But Charmichael, who holds a bachelor's degree in fine arts from
Indiana University, said, ``I learned more about how to paint in
billboards than I did in art school. I spent my days up to my
elbows in paint.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, artistic skills and techniques are rarely employed.
The industry, once reliant on the abilities of artists who painted
billboards by hand, has come to rely on computer-generated images
that are printed on vinyl, called flex face, that is delivered to a
billboard site and stretched across the billboard's frame.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated billboards are quickly phasing out
hand-painted images that cost more and are labor intensive, often
taking several weeks to complete. New technology has enabled
advertisers to erect campaigns within a few hours and take them
down just as quickly, often moving one image to a different
location for maximum play.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has also enabled billboard companies to control
changing digital displays, like lottery jackpot numbers, via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these advances, some advertisers insist on hand-painted
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no comparison to the artistry of hand painting,'' said
Jared Townsend of the Outdoor Media Group in Murietta, Calif. ``The
color, the depth, the contrast, the transition in color, are just
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   One advertiser that has insisted on hand painting is the Philip
Morris Corporation, owner of Marlboro cigarettes. But as of April
this year, the company has had to seek other venues for the
enduring lonesome cowboy; because of a settlement reached between
the states and the tobacco corporations, cigarette billboards will
no longer be permissible in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically coming down to the end,'' Townsend said. ``The
Marlboro man is riding off into the sunset.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hole, a 16-year veteran of the billboard painting industry
and a former art teacher, has painted over 300 Marlboro men.
``That's a lot of cowboys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A short while ago, as if to defy fate, Hole had put the
finishing touches on a 60-foot-tall Marlboro Man _ the last he
expects he will ever paint. ``I did the hat yesterday,'' said Hole,
somewhat wistfully. ``All I have left is the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Hole said he will most likely return to teaching, but he is
sentimental about the career he is leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just a job,'' he said. ``Thousands of people
see these things, and we're not going to be doing them anymore. You
feel a little nostalgic. It's sad to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hole's final rendition of the Marlboro Man _ it will be
dismantled and shipped in pieces to Venezuela where men of his ilk
are still legal.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ His debt to society was paid. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   So wondered Charles Griffin upon his release from Coxsackie
state prison in upstate New York in the winter of 1996. He had $107
in his pocket and little to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 7, his mother died of a heart attack in his arms.
His abusive drug-addicted father blamed him, and Griffin became a
ward of the state for a decade. He struggled through high school
and joined the Army, which he loved. But, unable to keep up with
the discipline, he was kicked out and felt lost, he said in a
recent telephone interview from the Orleans Correctional Facility
in Albion, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after his release from Coxsackie, Griffin
grabbed a woman's pocketbook, down the street from where Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani was having lunch. He wanted to get out of the
filthy, drug-infested Brooklyn shelter where he had found a bed, he
said. He wanted to buy new clothes for a job interview, and things
for his estranged daughter. He landed back in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pride got in my way,'' said Griffin, who is 32 now and
serving his 16th year in his fourth robbery conviction. He now
regrets he wasn't more patient, and vows next time he will be. He
awaits his 2002 release and perhaps his final chance to go clean.
Another conviction would almost certainly win him a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat offenders like Griffin make up a significant portion of
the prison population across the country, although recidivism rates
vary between states. Of the 26,104 convicts released by New York
state prisons in 1994, 44 percent returned to prison within three
years, according to the state's Commission of Correction. Groups
like the Manhattan-based Fortune Society are working with
ex-offenders to increase their likelihood of going clean.
</P>
<P>
   As the city's largest nonprofit organization to assist
ex-offenders, the Fortune Society helps clients get their GED, look
for a job, fight drug abuse, and live with HIV. More than that, it
is a source of moral support for people who often lack job
experience, education and familial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a family to people,'' said Edmond Taylor, 40,
who works with clients in career development. Incarceration
isolates people, he explained, citing his own 12 years in state
prison. Like a majority of the society's 100 or so employees,
Taylor is an ex-offender who can relate to the frustrations
awaiting his clients upon their release.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, 'If he can do it _ I can do it,' and that gives them
hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public foots 90 percent of the Fortune Society's $5.6
million budget. While state financing has grown for HIV and drug
treatment programs, the group constantly struggles to secure money
from the legislature, said Beth Finnerty, the society's financial
director.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics question whether taxpayers should dish out more
money to help people who got themselves in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a balance,'' said Kevin Mica, spokesman for
the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, a conservative nonpartisan
advocacy group that supports victims' rights over criminals'
rights. ``Prisoners have so many perks and bonuses these days,'' he
said. Prisoners ought to serve their full sentences and not be
eligible for services, such as a free college education, when
plenty of innocent people do without, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gov. George Pataki recently eliminated all college
classes in prison, but other prison-based programs remain. Some
rehabilitation programs may be worthwhile, but these should not be
financed predominantly by public money, Mica said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. Rehabilitation works, without a doubt, said
Francis T. Cullen, professor of Criminal Justice at the University
of Cincinnati. Broad analyses of existing studies show that early
intervention, drug treatment, and other rehabilitation programs
prevent crime and reduce recidivism, he said. Get-tough approaches
such as boot camps and longer sentences do not. ``It's close to
indisputable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitation is cost effective, he said. Not only does it
reduce crime, it reduces the high costs of incarceration. ``It's an
absurd wasting of funds,'' Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
   New York state and city spend $28,000 a year to incarcerate each
of its more than 100,000 inmates. Nationwide, Americans spend close
to $31 billion a year on corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Although rehabilitation programs are effective, they are
imperfect, concedes Cullen. The work is often underpaid and
undervalued, and convicted criminals do not always want to take
advantage of these opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Griffin visited the Fortune Society between prison
terms, but he was among the 35 percent who regularly drop out.
Griffin said he might go there again, but thinks if he can just
land a job, he should be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he is cutting vegetables in the prison kitchen for 38
cents an hour. Through eight-hour workdays, he hopes to amass close
to $2,000 by his release three years from now. He described the
prison environment as awash with negativity _ gangs, fights, ``lost
souls.'' Trying to avoid the bad and prepare for the best, he took
a 90-day ``personal enhancement'' seminar where prisoners role play
and discuss alternatives to drug use and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I can offer the world something,'' he said. ``I'm
a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin wants to capitalize on his behind-bars food-preparation
experience to find work and vows to persevere this time. He hopes
to repair his relationships with his father, who has gotten off
drugs, and his daughter who is now 12. But the biggest test is yet
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk is cheap,'' he said. ``I still gotta go home and prove
all this.''

NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS PLAN KOSOVO TRAINING MISSION 
</HEADLINE>

 By DIANE HANDAL  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While Albanians were streaming out of Kosovo, a
unique group of police officers in New York wanted nothing more
than to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Secure in their adopted country and working in a career they
would have eschewed in their native land, these police officers are
repelled by the images of heavy-handed police who attack their
former countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   They hope one day to help replace Kosovo's militaristic police
force with a law-enforcement system based on civil liberty for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly. I want to help people of my ethnic
background,'' said New York Officer Ylli Dauti. ``My family wants
me to go, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my moral duty to help. How can my conscience not let me
go?'' said one 27-year-old officer who asked that his name not be
divulged because of his undercover assignment in the New York
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers and 15 other New York police officers of
Albanian background were ready and trained for a special mission in
Kosovo even before the refugee crisis began in March. But Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing push and NATO's
subsequent bombing raids interrupted their plans to join a State
Department group organized to train a new police force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had recruited these police officers to oversee an
international peace agreement when it was still active earlier this
year. Officers were needed to help verify compliance with the
cease-fire and eventually to train a new local police force in
Kosovo. The State Department, which sent similar police missions to
Bosnia and Haiti, has found that American officers conversant in
the native tongue have a credibility with people in war-ravaged
countries, said a department coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed I couldn't go,'' Dauti said. ``I want
to go as soon as possible to help with the refugees in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New York undercover officer, whose parents are from
Montenegro, said he was relieved that the mission was put off,
given the war that ensued. ``I'm still anxious to go but it's a
blessing in disguise,'' he said. In fact, one New York police
officer who did go early to Kosovo had to be evacuated when the war
started.
</P>
<P>
   The New York officers are strongly motivated by the policing
standards they have found in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Yugoslavia, police ``are an extension of the
government and there you would be told to beat somebody up if they
say something against the government,'' said Victor Preni, 30, a
beat officer in the Bronx who immigrated from Kosovo at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers here fight against crime. There, it's
political thought,'' the undercover officer said. ``They are an
instrument of Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   On a 1991 visit to Yugoslavia, Dauti experienced police
repression. ``At every checkpoint from Belgrade to Kosovo,'' he
said softly, ``we were ordered out of the car, machine guns were
pointed in our faces and we were ordered to pay the police.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian-American police officers also believe their
immigrant status helps them with their police work in New York's
polyglot ethnic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was in the Albanian army,'' said Dauti, a
patrol officer in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where gangs and violence are
synonymous. ``Because my family isn't wealthy and I come from a
different culture, I am more open and understanding to a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian contingency at the New York Police Department
seemed a natural fit, said Inspector Richard Martin, executive
officer of personnel. ``The diverse community and many cultures of
New York City add to their training and set them apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the police mission to Kosovo was shelved indefinitely
pending outcome of the administration's broader effort with NATO.
``We have a moral and strategic interest in managing and solving
this crisis,'' said David Leavy, White House National Security
Council spokesman. ``All Serbian forces and para-military have to
withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   While they wait, the New York officers, like many Americans of
Albanian descent, have tried to contact family members still in the
former Yugoslavia and have closely monitored TV coverage of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I saw my cousins on TV in the refuge camp,''
Dauti said. ``I thought they were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   His great uncle had opened the door to find a Serb policeman
brandishing a knife. ``The officer took out his knife and slit his
throat. There were two 11-year-old cousins in the house who jumped
out the window and escaped to Albania,'' Dauti was told by Albanian
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Preni heard from his uncle in Kosovo who witnessed the execution
of two neighbors, brothers who were dragged from their home by
three masked gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these people,'' Preni said, weeping and clenching his
fists. ``I grew up next door to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments far overtake the financial incentive that the
New York officers would have to join the training mission to
Kosovo. Their State Department stipend would be about $85,000,
which is more than double the average police salary in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do it for the same salary I get now. The money doesn't
interest me. It's a matter of living with my conscience,'' said the
undercover officer.

THREATS TO MEDICAL PRIVACY SPARKS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By WILLIAM MURRAY  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Computerized medical records are becoming standard in
hospitals and doctor's offices nationwide, with patients mostly
assuming those files remain as private as they have been in file
cabinets. But a growing debate is raising questions about just how
secure medical records are in the age of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing shelves full of manila folders with digital databases
seems like a great way to improve efficiency, diagnosis and patient
care. Today, however, consumers, the medical community and members
of Congress are fighting over whether computerized medical records
can ever be safe, especially when no national standard regulates
their protection.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been debating several bills to strengthen legal
protections against misuse of private health information. The issue
is particularly sensitive among those who seek to protect the most
sensitive data _ dealing with AIDS, psychiatric history and drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the United States has no consistent medical privacy
policy,'' said Ronald Weich, an American Civil Liberties Union
legislative consultant. ``There is a patchwork of state laws that
protect some citizens, but a national law is needed in an era of
electronic records and national insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have protections pretty much along the lines of other
places around the country,'' said Kathy Stark, assistant director
at the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. ``For those patients
with records of greater sensitivity, such as psychiatry and drug
addiction, there is a second step that must be taken. The patient
must be informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Within each state, medical institutions are on their own when
developing their own security systems, leaving questions about
whether the precautions can really thwart hackers, insurance
company investigators or private investigators.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Michigan Medical Center, a student in
February stumbled across thousands of pages of medical records
incorrectly placed on the Internet. The breach, which released
records including patients' Social Security numbers, employment
information and diagnoses, occurred as the hospital ironed out bugs
in new scheduling software. The university said the information was
not accessed by other third parties, but the incident highlighted
potential problems as more hospitals convert to digital record
keeping.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Clinton administration first proposed then backed
away from a Unique Health Identifier _ a Social Security number for
medical recorders _ after the ACLU and other privacy rights groups
vehemently opposed it claiming that electronic files could be
easily compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals are digitizing information. The large-scale
aggregating of data is causing the problem,'' because so much data
is available from a single entry point, said Alex Fowler, a
spokesman for the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco,
an Internet privacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional bills aim to standardize federal
requirements and legal penalties for medical record protection.
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Senate Health and
Education Committee, proposed civil penalties of up to a $100,000
against companies or individuals who violate medical privacy
guidelines. Others bills follow a similar vein.
</P>
<P>
   ``This battle is between American families who want some privacy
and big business buying access to their personal medical records,''
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said as he introduced legislation in
March allowing states to enforce higher protective standards than
the federal government. He cited instances where private firms
mined databases for medical records they could sell to insurance
companies for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that no degree of security measures can thwart
every invasion, particularly in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Nagel, a psychiatrist and spokesperson for the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C., told the National
Committee on Vital and Health Statistics two years ago that 90
percent of security breaches with medical records involve insider
access.
</P>
<P>
   In a high profile case she cited, a convicted serial rapist
employed by a hospital in Massachusetts accessed the records of
nearly 1,000 girls and young women, one as young as 9.
</P>
<P>
   Even still, some medical records specialists believe electronic
storage of records actually improves security.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there was no audit trail that could be traced
within the hospital,'' said Francoise Righini, medical records
director at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
``When the files were on paper, no one could know who had seen it.
Now with computers, every time a record check is made it must be
from a computer within the system and a password.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, privacy advocates also caution that health care
consumers themselves are too willing to part unnecessarily with
private medical information to insurance companies and courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are not reluctant to give medical records to third
parties,'' said B.J. Armstrong, special counsel for the American
Medical Association in Chicago. ``People give up records that
contain things they don't want others to know.''

FORGET THE RAT RACE: THE ONLY GOOD RAT IS A DEAD RAT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ITAY HOD  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was almost midnight. James Valletti led his team
to the lower platform of Nassau-Broadway subway station, the most
infested area of New York City's 850-mile track. The three men
stepped onto the tracks, turned on warning lights and pulled out
their weapons _ plastic bags of rat poison covered with peanut
butter.
</P>
<P>
   They all knew what they had to do. Ted Dixon was in charge of
stopping the trains, Joe ``The Firm'' Nilsson posted signs and
James ``The Rat Killer'' Valletti spread the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like killing rats,'' said Valletti, a heavy set man in
his 30s. ``I always did. I like to see the numbers go down and I
like to see the carcasses on the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's New York's other rat race, the never-ending quest to rid
the city of rodents. The Big Apple's get-tough mayor has made rats
a top priority, along with sex shops, jaywalkers, and other
undesirables.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spent $8
million on, what some have called, a re-election-inspired campaign
against vermin _ the Comprehensive Rodent Control Program. And
comprehensive it was. The three-part plan targeted 69 neighborhoods
in all five boroughs. All city departments joined forces to fight
what some consider New York's most serious health problem.
</P>
<P>
   Strategies have gotten ruthless. Exterminators are not only
cleaning up infested areas, but also targeting the areas around
them, making sure the rats have nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Almost two years later, the fight is still on.
</P>
<P>
   But is it working?
</P>
<P>
   According to Alan Yager, MTA manager at the division of track,
the crusade has been a success. ``There's no way of doing a rat
census, but in the past few years, I have seen a decline in rats,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department statistics support this claim. Complaints of
rat bites have declined by almost two thirds, from the upper 800s
in the 1980s to about 200 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the tracks, Valletti, wearing a helmet and an orange
reflective vest, sprinkles his deadly poison. From a nearby garbage
crevice, rats scamper around the tracks, squeaking and squealing.
Some sniff the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not hungry tonight,'' he said. ``You have to think
like a rat in order to kill them. It's not just throwing poison.
You have to have the knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rats are no easy prey. Although they have poor eyesight, they
hear extremely well and have a great sense of smell. They average a
pound in size, but can grow as big as four pounds. Not only can
they climb walls, they can swim for miles. They can also jump out
of a fifth floor window, without getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, they are expert breeders. Sexually mature at two
months, they can have up to six litters a year, seven babies each.
In three years, one pair of Norway rats, the most common New York
City rodent, can yield 350 million. Fortunately, Norway rats only
live on average six months.
</P>
<P>
   More than just a nuisance, rats carry deadly diseases. During
the 14th century, 23 million people died from the bubonic plague _
almost half of Europe's population at the time. Last century, 12
million people died of rat-related illnesses _ rat-bite fever,
dysentery, salmonella, typhus, jaundice and more. These illnesses
are still a problem today.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA is pulling out all the stops. Twelve of its supervisors
have enrolled in higher education, a 30-hour course in the art of
the kill. This will ensure the system has exterminators on hand 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nasty,'' said Tracy Bryant, an MTA maintenance
supervisor who is enrolled in the course. ``But it's good to know
how to kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   In one recent lecture, students gathered for a training video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rats _ man's worst enemy,'' snarled the melodramatic narrator.
``It is now that the sickening force must be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a city where there are four rats for every person, it
seems unlikely the problem will ever completely go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an ongoing issue,'' said John Gadd, spokesperson for
the New York City Department of Health. ``There are numbers of
neighborhoods where the rodent situation had become unmanageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Valletti, who has killed close to 10,000 rats in the past six
years, agrees the epidemic can be controlled but not eradicated. As
he throws his peanut butter poison, Valletti tiptoes down the
soiled tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you're in their territory,'' Valletti said.
``Underground is their domain. They are not afraid of people. They
see them all the time, they are used to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Valletti recalled how some cable network crew brought their own
rats to film a documentary on vermin. They brought 15 rats with
them and left with 18. Three just went along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   After many years in the business, Yager has a story or two. He
recalls when a rat hopped onto a subway train to the amazement, and
horror, of the passengers. Everyone on board screamed and ran to
the opposite side of the car. ``They all got off on the next
stop,'' Yager said with amusement. ``Rats are not aggressive,
they'll only bite if they feel threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Williams, 33, a computer operator from Brooklyn has seen
more rats than he cares to remember. ``I'm so used to it by now,''
said Williams. ``It's kind of funny actually, you see so many of
them it makes you wonder why it's so difficult to get rid of rats
in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone takes the rat situation lightly. A concerned
citizen wrote the mayor asking permission to take action. Convinced
employees weren't doing enough, he wanted permission to throw some
poison of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His request was denied. Apparently, he could be sued for
littering.

 BY JEANINE PREZIOSO  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Capt. James Sheehan, a Marine Corps reservist, knows
how to cut off a rattlesnake's head and throw it on fire for
dinner. He has learned which berries and roots are safe to eat and
how to build a rock dam to catch fish _ and then smoke the fish and
meat in a wood-and-rock shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan, 26, has been through both land and water survival
training.
</P>
<P>
   What Naval Air Force Sgt. Paul Laws, who teaches at the Air
Force Water Survival School, serves up may not tempt the palates of
most, but then who can be choosy when crash landing in the middle
of the Atlantic?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fluid around the eye sockets and spines of fish make good
water sources,'' Laws said matter-of-factly. ``If you don't have a
de-salinity kit, you can collect fresh rainwater. The most abundant
source of water is rainwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Most humans can go a few weeks without food but only five to
seven days without water, said Laws, so water is the priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the Arctic, you can use sea ice as a source,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Land survival techniques include which plants to eat, Sheehan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taught how to get fresh water from leaves; wrap any
kind of plastic around the leaves, leave it in the sunlight and
over time water would condense around the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned how to make beef jerky,'' he said. ``The idea was
that we could smoke this stuff so that we could keep it and it
wouldn't go bad.''
</P>
<P>
   All Air Force crew members get both land and water training,
said Master Sgt. Buddy Gurnari of the Fairchild Air Force Base
Survival School in Spokane, Wash. Under a program called Survival
Evasion Resistance and Escape, or SERE, all members of the Armed
Forces receive some kind of survival training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy does it mostly with air crew members,'' he said. ``We
send the guys who fly planes with ejection seats to Pensacola for
water survival school. They go parasailing to simulate
parachuting.'' Aviators who fly cargo planes stay at Fairchild and
take a non-parachute course, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gurnari once trained cadets at Pensacola for water survival, now
he teaches land survival. Grasshoppers and a lot of plant-eating
insects taste like plants, he said. ``Grubs'' have a nutty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grubs' are larvae,'' Gurnari said. ``And I've never gotten
sick from eating an insect.''
</P>
<P>
   One cadet just broke his class record for having eaten 27 banana
slugs, he said. ``He just got back from a tropical location, lots
of slimy things there,'' Gurnari added.
</P>
<P>
   Gurnari warned against eating ``puffer fish or fish that eat
directly off the reef. You can eat shell fish only if covered by a
high tide.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Water Survival Training'' manual given to all Air Force
cadets, gives survival pointers, some of which are just plain
common sense: ``Oceans and seas cover roughly 70.8 percent of the
earth's surface. The possibility of becoming a water survivor at
some point in a flying career is better than average ... nearly 3
out of every 4 feet of space on this planet is occupied by water.''
</P>
<P>
   Once enough water has been found or stored, survivors can begin
to think about food, available from ``the largest supermarket in
the world, located under the raft,'' says the booklet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to find something that doesn't have scales,'' Laws
advised. ``No brightly colored or ornamental fish either.''
</P>
<P>
   What he recommends: Fish that look like fish you see in the
supermarket. Don't eat anything that has a boxy shape. And eat it
raw and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might shake up your system a little bit,'' he said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   If raw fish makes you sick, you can always turn to seaweed, a
good source of carbohydrates and vitamins. Only the leafy parts
should be eaten and only in small bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turtles or birds are OK, too,'' Laws said, adding that it is
best to skin the bird and eat it raw or let it sit in the sun and
dry out, to get rid if that ``oily'' flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Insects are a good source of protein, said a senior official at
Fairchild Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ants are easy as long as they're not biting ants,'' he said.
``Just stick your hand in the nest, let them crawl all over and
lick them off.''

JAR JAR'S CHARACTER UNSETTLES SOME CRITICS AND `MENACE' VIEWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jar Jar Binks, the loopy, goofy, big-eared amphibian
alien from the hit flick ``The Phantom Menace'' must:
</P>
<P>
   a) move to a galaxy far, far away
</P>
<P>
   b) keepsa on workin' as yous humbule servant
</P>
<P>
   c) get a translator and a makeover
</P>
<P>
   d) DIE! DIE! DIE!
</P>
<P>
   e) all of the above
</P>
<P>
   Anyway you splice it, George Lucas' computer-generated movie
character is stirring powerful reactions on Planet Earth, from
radio talk shows (where shock jocks are calling for a Jar-B-Q) to
Internet Web sites (www.JarJarMustDie.com) to murmurings as people
exit theaters (``I thought he was racist,'' whispered a movie
critic from a metropolitan newspaper in the Midwest.)
</P>
<P>
   Though some adults think the alien goes too far far, kids mostly
love Jar Jar, who resembles a Rastafarian Joe Camel. But scholars
say his Caribbean-like speech _ ``when is yousa tinkin wesa in
trouble'' _ and shuffling klutziness smack of stereotypes of
African Americans straight out of Stepin Fetchit, the 1930s-era
actor who played lazy or easily frightened characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jar Jar is the science fiction version of a character in black
face,'' said Daniel Bernardi, an assistant professor of media
studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who studies race
and science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching him, I was reminded of the stereotype of colored
people as bumbling sidekicks. Big bulging eyes, big lips, can't
speak clearly and shuffling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even away from the ivory tower, Jar Jar sparks passions _
provided, that is, you can understand him. Many viewers complained
his speech was hard on their ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most annoying creature Lucas has ever created,''
said Rachael White, who spent $2,000 so she and her husband, Tim,
could see a special charity screening of the movie at Seattle's
Cinerama Theater. ``If I was 7 years old, I would have thought it
was the best thing ever. But I'm 27.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mueller, an Auburn resident who is a clerk for Zanadu
Comics in downtown Seattle, became so jarred by Jar Jar he started
a Web site and club in dishonor of the bug-eyed, platypus-billed
character. It's called The International Society for the
Extermination of Jar Jar Binks.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller said the movie would have been ``vastly improved'' if
the alien was CTRL-ALT-DELETED. Others apparently agree. Mueller's
club and Web site have attracted several hundred members in recent
weeks, and he has become something of an international media
darling, drawing the interest of CNN and others.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said Jar Jar was designed to bring comic relief to his
celluloid universe, much in the way the furry-faced Wookie,
Chewbacca, served up funny grunts in the original ``Star Wars''
trilogy. Speaking in New York recently, he said ``Phantom'' was
primarily a children's movie with humorous flourishes and was not
meant to be taken too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say children are precisely the people who will enjoy
the antics of Jar Jar and other Lucas characters but will fail to
see deeper stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Jar Jar Binks, it is the dialogue that puts up the
red flag. There's a number of occasions where the character delves
off into some sort of ebonics,'' said Todd Boyd, a professor of
cinema studies at the University of Southern California School of
Cinema and Television.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's phone has been ringing off the hook about Jar Jar. But he
was more offended by the presence of two aliens in ``Phantom
Menace'' who sported Asian-sounding accents. Those aliens lured the
Jedis into a trap at the beginning of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were speaking in this dialogue straight out of a Charlie
Chan movie,'' Boyd said. ``I thought it was much more overt than
Jar Jar.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Lucas company executives fired back at the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in `Star Wars' that is racially motivated,''
said Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynne Hale. ```Star Wars' is a fantasy
movie set in a galaxy far, far away. It is populated with humans,
aliens, droids, robots and other fantastic creatures that have no
resemblance to the world we know today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale added: ``To dissect this movie as if it has a direct
reference to the world that we know today is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bernardi said Hale's way of thinking is precisely the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Lucas to suggest there isn't even a race issue is silly,''
he said. ``For aliens to reach us (the audience) emotionally, they
have to be tied to Earth in order to make it meaningful and
grounded in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernardi said Lucas' camp is engaging in ``plausible
deniability,'' or rationalizations _ Jar Jar's ``just an alien'' or
``it's just a movie'' _ while overlooking racial problems that have
been replete in the ``Star Wars'' saga.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said Billy Dee Williams' character, Lando
Calrissian, the baron administrator of Bespin's Cloud City in ``The
Empire Strikes Back,'' was a pimplike gambler with eyes for
Princess Leia. In ``Phantom Menace,'' he says, the winged junk
dealer and sand-planet alien, Watto, the slaveholder of Anakin
Skywalker, has an unmistakable Middle Eastern voice, suggestive of
an Arab or a Jew. But Jar Jar, he says, takes the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whitewashing of the future of the universe. You have
the main characters, the Jedis, trying to save the day. ... Then
there is Jar Jar _ the Stepin Fetchit loyal sidekick,'' said
Bernardi, who has written the book ``Star Trek and History:
Race-ing Toward a White Future.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some people say Bernardi has too much time on his hands.
(And his views have gotten him dozens of angry calls and e-mails.)
But he fancies himself a pop-culture guardian, pointing out
dangerous currents presented in mass media. ``People should see a
need for scholars to tear apart and challenge pop culture,'' said
Bernardi, who loved ``Phantom Menace'' but thought the racial
issues were strong drawbacks. ``It is important because it affects
the way children and adults see themselves in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Jar Jar is banished, or ends up with the popularity of a
fluegelhorn-playing Barney the dinosaur, will play out in the court
of public opinion. Juries are deliberating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, I wish people would stop attacking Jar Jar so
viciously,'' one Web entry reads. ``I wasn't thrilled by him the
first time around ... but I've grown to like Jar Jar.''
</P>
<P>
   But another site asks, ``How about replacing Jar Jar with Adam
Sandler? or Carrot Top?''

<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ Aurrora Pulido hopes the American doctors
can help her daughter walk.
</P>
<P>
   Aurrora Ornelas, 3, cries softly when her mother flips the child
onto her abdomen to show a visiting Texas doctor the girl's
deformed spine.
</P>
<P>
   A large bump protrudes from the toddler's back. Aurrora was born
with spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spine fails to close
properly during pregnancy's first month. In severe cases, the
spinal cord bulges through the back and may be covered by skin or a
thin membrane.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido asked the doctor if surgery in San Antonio would help
Aurrora, who's as small as a 10-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do it now so when she gets older she can walk. Even
then she will have crutches,'' said Pulido, 27. ``She moves on her
knees and butt. She doesn't like to be sitting down, she wants to
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ken Long of San Marcos listens to Pulido in the small
cramped kitchen of a home here.
</P>
<P>
   On this spring day he'll see about 100 patients, most of whom
have never been to a doctor. His reason for donating his time and
making the trip is simple: ``For the love of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have relatively minor problems, malnutrition or a
common cold,'' he said. ``Once or twice a year we see these extreme
problems where we can fix it or at least improve it with surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Long sits on a wooden chair facing patients across from him. To
his left lined up on the kitchen counter are small bags of
medications, vitamins, decongestants, ointments and bandages.
</P>
<P>
   After patients are assessed, most take the small plastic bags
full of pills and stuff them into their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl's mother complains that her daughter isn't eating
well, and Long tells the mother the teen is malnourished and hands
her a bag of vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind I like. I know what it is and I know how to treat
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Area Christian Medical and Dental Society
sponsors eight of these trips a year to northern Mexico border
cities. Long was one of 36 caregivers on this trip to neighborhoods
in Nuevo Laredo, a city of more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Society Director Roger Matkin said the group has made 75 trips
to Nuevo Laredo, Piedras Negras and Ciudad Acuna since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend trips are a marathon of sorts, with participants
hustling to set up makeshift clinics with crude exam rooms where
they provide basic medical and dental care.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, dentists and students donate their time and often their
own vehicles to travel to the border cities. Each person pays about
$35 for lodging, insurance and a lunch. Other meals or expenses
also come out of participants' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect opportunity for doctors and dentists to
use their profession in serving the Lord,'' Matkin said. ``They can
actually heal people in a little way. It's the kind of thing
Christians in general ought to be doing _ caring for the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, dentists and clinics are readily available throughout
Nuevo Laredo _ dentists every few blocks, medical clinics and a few
hospitals. But Matkin said the people living in the poor sections
of the city lack the means to pay for such care.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies _ including medications, vitamins and medical
instruments _ are donated by member doctors, dentists,
pharmaceutical companies and the University of Texas Health Science
Center at San Antonio, Matkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Morina Rios hasn't been to a dentist in 10 years, but on this
day the 15-year-old is sitting in a chair of this second-story
concrete apartment overlooking a patio where other patients wait.
The dentist is about to pull a tooth that's forced the crowding of
her lower teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great because some people without money can come here and
have our teeth cleaned and extracted,'' Rios said seconds before a
dentist yanked out the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   John Wallace, a fourth-year dental student at the Texas Health
Science Center, said giving up a Saturday for people with nothing
is ``all about providing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't provide everyone with the dental care we give in the
States, but coming out here is a different world and helps get your
priorities straight,'' he said. ``It's so different going home
after this; you really rethink your priorities.''

CHILDREN ARE LATEST TOOLS IN IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING SCAMS

<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Immigrant smugglers and their desperate
clients are now using rented infants to get into the country, say
Border Patrol officials who have documented the practice for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   One unusual case involved ``Baby Doe,'' a 6-month-old girl
rented three times to immigrants who then posed as a family and
avoided jail because there are no detention facilities for
children. That case shocked even veteran Border Patrol agents who
thought they had encountered every callous tactic used by
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the lucrative criminal organizations that
smuggle people across the border have amassed a horrific legacy.
They have locked their clients in car trunks, left them to die by
the scores in unventilated truck trailers and freight cars,
abandoned them without water in blistering heat, hid them amid
shipments of hazardous waste and led them into raging surf, where
they drowned.
</P>
<P>
   But using infants as living ``props'' has increased as intensive
border-control campaigns from here to California have made it
harder to slip across the U.S.-Mexico border, said U.S. Border
Patrol officials.
</P>
<P>
   To get their clients through, smugglers are now pairing up
unrelated men and women and providing them with an infant so they
appear to be a family. And because there are no facilities where
families can be detained together while awaiting immigration
hearings, these ``family units'' are routinely released by the
Border Patrol and allowed to continue their northward journey,
officials explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're resorting to this, and it's unfortunate the babies are
suffering,'' said Border Patrol agent John L. Trevino, who heads
the anti-smuggling unit in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Baby Doe,'' the infant was rented by smugglers
who provided her to three different sets of clients who swam or
waded across the Rio Grande River with the child. The infant's real
parents, undocumented Honduran citizens living in Houston, have
admitted renting their baby for $200 per trip, Trevino said. They
are now in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these smugglers have done is caught on to the fact we are
a humanitarian society,'' explained Border Patrol Assistant Chief
Harry Beall of the McAllen, Texas, sector. ``We do care for the
welfare of the people we detain, and they are using that compassion
to circumvent the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Beall said smugglers are aware that undocumented adults who are
detained by themselves on the border will languish in detention
until they get a hearing. But those who can convince agents that
they are a family are instead given a notice to appear before an
immigration judge at a later date and then are released with travel
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've caught on to this, and what they're doing is
furnishing babies for them to carry,'' Beall said of the smugglers.
``We've seen an increase in it. But as far as being able to prove
it, it's hard because these kids are of such a tender age we can't
ask (the children) questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of ``Baby Doe'' began to unravel on the late afternoon
of March 30 at the Brownsville Border Patrol station, as agent
Griselda Vidrio was helping other agents process a young ``family''
from Honduras. The man and woman _ both in their early 30s and
carrying a 6-month-old _ had earlier flagged down Border Patrol
agents along the Rio Grande in Brownsville and surrendered,
confident they would be released shortly after processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the baby, she smiled at me, and I said, `I've seen
this baby before,''' said Vidrio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I informed the agent who was processing the couple that I
recognized the baby,'' Vidrio said. ``So I started asking the lady
whose baby it was, and she said it was hers. But I don't know,
there was something strange about it that made me keep on asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Vidrio also noticed the ``mother'' seemed unpracticed at holding
a baby and had brought only two diapers, one bottle of formula and
no extra clothes. The agent also recalled seeing the red, beaded
bracelet, strung with turquoise stones, that the baby was wearing
on her right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had seen this baby before with someone else. I
remember a man coming in (with the baby for processing by Border
Patrol agents) where he said his wife had died during the Hurricane
Mitch'' disaster in Central America, Vidrio said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Vidrio, the young woman admitted the child was not
hers, but claimed the baby had been given to her by a man she met
in Mexico. Eventually she admitted the child was provided by
smugglers whom she had paid $1,000 to get her to Houston. The
smugglers had given her instructions on how to return the infant
after the ``couple'' reached Houston by bus.
</P>
<P>
   Agents began to search through the files they kept on families
who had been processed and released in Brownsville, and found the
baby in pictures taken of two other ``families'' released earlier
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl was processed as part of one ``family'' March
18, and then with another March 19, according to anti-smuggling
agent Richard A. Serra.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's pretty cold. ... This is the first time I've seen
a baby used this way,'' he said, adding that doctors who examined
the infant found she was suffering from a slight cold and the
beginning of an ear infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of shocks you, even though you get kind of callous ...
,'' Serra said.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents handed the infant over to state child
welfare workers in Brownsville, and went after the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration agents placed a southwest Houston apartment under
surveillance after identifying it from the telephone number the
smugglers gave the couple to call when they arrived in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Posing as the clients, the agents called the apartment from the
bus station and told a woman who answered that they had arrived
with the baby. The woman said someone would meet them at the
station.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Agents arrested Sandra Patricia Orellana, 29, as she left the
apartment. Investigators say she is the one who answered the phone.
They later arrested Jose Antonio Guerrero Funez, 34, of Honduras,
at the bus station after he met with the agents, Serra said.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero was indicted April 28 on charges of encouraging or
inducing immigrants to enter or remain in the United States, a
felony punishable by 10 years in prison and a maximum $250,000
fine, said assistant U.S. attorney Doug Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against Orellana have been dismissed, Davis said.
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Houston say
deportation proceedings are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The man and woman who posed as a family with the baby are being
held as material witnesses. Serra said they identified Guerrero in
a photo lineup as the smuggler who gave them ``Baby Doe'' and
instructed them to pose as a married couple.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two Hondurans claiming to be the infant's parents
went to the Houston Police Department and reported their child
missing after the infant and the smuggling couple failed to show up
as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The parents are being detained after admitting they rented their
child for use in the smuggling operation, according to federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While this case is the only time immigration agents say they
have been able to document the use of infants by a smuggling
organization, it is not the first time young children have been
caught up in this desperate trade.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, a young couple from the state of Veracruz in Mexico
walked up to the information booth at the INS office at the Gateway
Bridge in Brownsville to report their daughter missing.
</P>
<P>
   The distraught couple told Delia Gantt, an INS information
officer, that they had hired smugglers the month before to take
their 15-month-old daughter across the Rio Grande while they
attempted the crossing on their own. The couple had been arrested
on the Texas side of the river and returned to Mexico, but had not
been able to make contact with the smugglers who had their baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell they were two young kids looking for their lost
baby. You could tell by the look on their faces,'' said Gantt, who
said the mother was 17 and the father 24.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police had located the toddler in a motel room with
dozens of other undocumented immigrants, INS spokesman Art Moreno
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only luck that kept the toddler from being sold on the
black market or pressed into service by smugglers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the smuggler would have done with that child
... because smugglers have absolutely no moral ethics, nor do they
have any regard for human life,'' he said. ``I'm sorry to sound so
hard, but I've seen what they can do. I've seen the death they've
caused.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8, state child welfare officials flew the child to
Brownsville and turned her over to her parents at the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when they told me how old the little girl was
and that this had happened to her,'' Gantt recalled. ``Since she
was so little, we figured once she was lost, they would never be
able to find her. That's why we took action right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Esmeralda Ordonez, 24, a Houston woman from Honduras,
pleaded for help from federal officials after smugglers refused to
release her two children until she paid an additional $3,500 _ on
top of $7,000 she and her fiance had already paid _ to smuggle the
children from Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Her 2-year-old son, Juan Angel, and 6-year-old daughter,
Vanelisa Maradiaga, had been passed off as the children of other
adults in a group that was smuggled across the Rio Grande. The girl
was found after a raid on a downtown Brownsville hotel. The boy was
dropped off days later outside an apartment complex at 2 a.m. with
his mother's Houston phone number pinned to his shirt, said the
Border Patrol agents who found them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``Baby Doe'' case is far from being over. INS investigators
must prepare a criminal case against the alleged smugglers while
preparing to deport the infant's parents to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Child Protective Services is trying to verify that the
couple claiming to be the baby's parents are, in fact, her parents.
They will have to produce birth records and submit to DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Once that's done, the agency has to decide what is best for the
child. &UR;  &LR; Lois Shull, director of community development for CPS in
Edinburg, said the agency has the authority to terminate the
parental rights of parents of an abused or neglected child,
regardless of immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still do have the child in foster care and, at this point,
we are not looking at terminating parental rights. It's too early
in the process to consider that,'' she said. Shull also confirmed
that ``Baby Doe'' has relatives in Texas who are here legally.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Border Patrol officials expect smugglers to
continue to come up with new techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can think of a way to smuggle drugs, parrots or people,
it's probably already in use somewhere because these are very
innovative people who are always looking for ways to beat the
system,'' Beall said.

DOUGHNUT LOVERS' DELIVERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Some people might wonder why more than 100 doughnut
nuts showed up at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday for the grand opening of a
Krispy Kreme shop at the Arizona Mills mall.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wonder are the ones who have never tasted a Krispy
Kreme doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep? You can do without sleep. You can't do without Krispy
Kreme doughnuts. Cold, they're little glazed and doughy wheels of
heaven. Hot, you may as well just lay down and die after you eat
one because your life is never going to get any better.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, they're Southern.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever lived in the South _ make that the Great American
South, so that we can establish the point of view here _ you're
familiar with Krispy Kreme shops. They're as ubiquitous below the
Mason-Dixon line as Circle K stores in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   (Full disclosure: Not everyone who lives down South likes Krispy
Kreme. Two friends once debated the point _ the debate took place,
naturally, over pulled pork at a barbecue joint. One was a Dunkin'
Donuts man. Krispy Kremes are (begin ital) soooo (end ital) tasty,
the other guy said. ``Yeah,'' the first replied, ``if you like your
food dripping in hot fat.'' It should be noted that he was a
transplanted Yankee.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sign of greatness &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The spreading west of Krispy Kreme is a hopeful sign to those of
us of the Southern persuasion. For far too long we have been
derided as extras in ``Deliverance,'' ignorant sons of the soil who
marry their cousins and have bad teeth.
</P>
<P>
   What teeth we have.
</P>
<P>
   Enough. The South is no longer just bad grammar and gimme caps,
car races and corn squeezin's. There are plenty of great things
about the South, things as important as Krispy Kreme doughnuts _
things that, with any luck at all, will find their way west soon.
</P>
<P>
   Slaw on hot dogs, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   With so many transplanted Midwesterners here, the Chicago hot
dog is the dog of choice in the Valley of the Sun. And it is a
beautiful thing, especially when loaded down with sport peppers.
</P>
<P>
   But don't sell short the slaw dog until you've tried one. The
mayonnaisey flavor mixes with chili perfectly. Add onions, mustard
and ketchup, and you've got the makings of the best stomachache
you've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about porches? (begin ital) Front (end ital) porches?
</P>
<P>
   True, it's so hot here from May to October that our only outside
activity is slathering on copious amounts of sunscreen for mad
dashes between the car and the office. Spend more than 10 minutes
napping in a porch hammock and you'd be drenched in sweat, your
skin the consistency of beef jerky.
</P>
<P>
   So what? It's worth it. A front porch is so relaxing, so
tranquil. And so perfect a place for storing old car seats and
washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, the neighbors'll get used to it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Acquired tastes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of acquired tastes, don't forget buttermilk. Your
classic Southerner drinks it like water. Like gloppy yellowish
water as thick as pancake batter, but that's part of its charm.
</P>
<P>
   It also goes well with vegetables that have been cooked with ham
hocks until they are as limp as soggy tissue, another Southern
staple. Probably has something to do with that bad teeth-thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other worthy candidates for migration _ Moon
Pies, pork rinds, peanuts in Co-colas.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing we could import from our Southern friends is
a big dose of hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Phoenix is a friendly place, especially for a big
city. People don't scream at each other in delis. Strangers nod on
the street and, occasionally, even say hello.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, they don't just say hello. They say, ``Hey, how
you? You look like you're hungry _ would you like to come on home
and get something to eat? You're skin and bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, if you're not used to this kind of treatment, it's a
little creepy at first. But don't worry. It'll grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   Like kudzu. &QL;

   AMERICAN AIRLINES CRASH
</P>
<P>
   CRASH _ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ An American Airlines flight with 145
people aboard skidded off a rain-slickened runway during a storm,
broke apart and burst into flames. A source familiar with the
investigation said nine people were known to have been killed. At
least 80 people were injured and taken to hospitals. The deaths
were the first on a major U.S. airline in nearly 1 1/2 years.
Flight 1420, a Super MD-80, crashed just before midnight Tuesday.
It had 139 passengers and six crew members and was due to arrive at
9:41 p.m. The flight from Dallas was delayed for more than two
hours and arrived just as the storm was hitting Little Rock with
lightning, hail and winds gusting to nearly 90 mph.

for Kosovo. (Deans, Cox News Service) Developing.
</P>
<P>
   w/KOSOVO-TEAM _ WASHINGTON _ Like most effective managers,
President Clinton tends to think of problems in one of three ways:
those that can be ignored, those that can be solved and those that
must be managed. Guess which box Kosovo fits into. Here, after all,
is a foreign policy crisis with at least four key dimensions _
military, humanitarian, diplomatic and political _ each of which is
affected daily, sometimes hourly, by developments in the other.
Clinton relies on a flexible, multi-tiered team with diplomats,
generals and lawyers at its core to manage U.S. policy, objectives
and long-term strategy in Kosovo. (Deans, Cox News Service)

   KOSOVO-FORTDIX _ FORT DIX, N.J. _ Overseeing the arrival of
Kosovar refugees at Ft. Dix in New Jersey is a military mission
that requires more of a soft heart than a steady trigger finger.
Gen. Mitchell Zais, dispatched from Atlanta's Fort MacPherson on
May 1 to oversee Operation Provide Refuge, has a lot of heart for a
Vietnam veteran and the son of a four-star general. He has cried
many times looking into the faces of the families arriving here,
getting processed and then leaving to settle into apartments and
jobs across the country. With a PhD in psychology, a distaste for
mornings and cryptic military acronyms, General Zais is not very,
well, General-like. We spend a day following him as he goes about
his business tending to the needs of 3,700 refugees housed at Ft
Dix. (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

Patrol Academy here was buzzing with activity as 700 chanting,
sweating, studying men and women honed their skills and prepared to
deploy to Texas and other Southwestern border states. Now the
academy, located on a former naval base, is quiet. The head count
has dropped to less than 150, all but two of the last eight
incoming classes have been canceled, and the remaining classes have
been pared down _ all because of a sudden shortage of recruits that
has put a crimp in the Border Patrol's expansion plans and brought
the wrath of Congress on the agency's tiny recruiting staff.

Decatur High in the past month, Love became frustrated at the

</P>
<P>
   DEADLY-PRESCRIPTIONS (Washington) _ A special report: Miguel
Sanchez was just 1 day old when he was killed by a prescription
drug. In death, he joined a population that is causing increasing
anxiety among health care experts and federal regulators: the tens
of thousands of Americans who lose their lives each year not to
illness, but to medication intended to treat it. Food and Drug
Administration officials, as well as independent drug safety
experts, say a flood of new and ever more complicated medications
are overwhelming the nation's health care system, making it
increasingly difficult for pharmacists, doctors and hospitals to
protect patients from being killed or harmed by adverse reactions
or mistakes. By Cheryl Gay Stolberg.

TESTIMONY IN CASE OF MISSING ATHEIST READS LIKE THRILLER

   AUSTIN, Texas _ If it had been created by a Hollywood screen
writer, the creepy story might have ended up as drive-in fare, the
perfect double bill with ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   It has all the B-movie elements, but the document that became
public here last week was not created as a work of pulp fiction.
Rather, it was the result of the federal government's investigation
into the disappearance in September 1995 of famed atheist Madalyn
Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-page affidavit of an Internal Revenue Service agent was
unsealed last week, leaving little room for optimism that O'Hair
and her two adult children will return.
</P>
<P>
   The document implicates O'Hair's former office manager, David R.
Waters, 52, of Austin; an ex-convict from the Detroit area named
Gary Karr, 50; and a heavy-drinking man from Florida named Danny
Fry, who was killed shortly after the O'Hairs vanished from San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waters, Karr and Fry planned and executed the scheme to
abduct, kidnap and murder Madalyn Murray O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray
and Robin Murray O'Hair for the purpose of stealing at least
$600,000,'' the affidavit states.
</P>
<P>
   Later it adds, ``Waters and Karr turned on Fry and killed him.
They then dumped the beheaded and handless body of Fry in Dallas
County, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as an IRS money-laundering case two years ago has
become a multi-agency investigation of four homicides involving
</P>
<P>
   And according to the affidavit, revenge as well as greed led to
the abduction and apparent murder of O'Hair, John Garth Murray and
Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waters was open about his dislike of the O'Hairs and made
comments about harming Madalyn. Waters began obsessing about his
ability to take Madalyn's money without her knowledge,'' says a
confidential source quoted in the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair gained prominence in the 1960s for her successful court
battles to eliminate organized prayer in public schools. She went
on to lead a national atheist organization.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Hair's surviving son Bill Murray, the violent,
ugly end that his mother apparently met was consistent with the
life she led.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her fate came as no surprise to me or anyone who actually
understood how bizarre and dysfunctional this family actually
was,'' said Murray, who renounced atheism for fundamentalist
Christianity nearly 20 years ago and lives in Fredericksburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``She led a very brutal life _ a life of constant aggression and
attempts to control,'' he said. ``It was the kind of life that
makes these kinds of enemies. She offended people to the point of
them wanting to kill her. My only surprise is that more people
didn't die with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fry is dead and Waters and Karr are behind bars on
federal weapons charges, no one has been charged with any crime
relating to the disappearance of the O'Hair family.
</P>
<P>
   The federal affidavit, however, advances a case made first in
newspaper stories over the past year that the three men were
responsible for the disappearance of America's most famous atheist
and her children.
</P>
<P>
   And the affidavit goes far beyond anything before made public to
fill in the many spaces in the story of the O'Hairs' last days.
</P>
<P>
   Using records from public storage facilities in Austin, van
rental companies, and hotel registers, federal investigators
produced an affidavit that tracks the movements of the O'Hair
family and the alleged abductors.
</P>
<P>
   Records there show Karr and Waters rented a room at the Warren
Inn in northwest San Antonio in late 1995, and a maintenance man
recalls seeing a woman who met Madalyn's description there at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit also makes good use of confidential sources to
report Waters' movements and thoughts before, during and after the
fateful month of September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It shows a man who once worked for O'Hair who was consumed by
thoughts of revenge to the point of ``snipping off her toes.''
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit also offers clues to the two big unanswered
questions: What became of the $500,000 in gold coins that vanished
with the O'Hairs, and what became of the O'Hairs?
</P>
<P>
   According to one federal informant, Waters put the suitcase full
of coins in a storage unit in Austin but later claimed they
disappeared after a break-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waters said Fry stole the coins. Later Waters stated that
Fry's son stole the gold and still later, Waters stated that the
coin dealer stole the coins,'' the informant told federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   The other missing piece of the puzzle is what became of the
O'Hairs' bodies, assuming, as the government says, they were
murdered, possibly dismembered and stuffed into blue plastic
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   So far the FBI as been unable to find any remains, complicating
the case against Waters and Karr.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit offers only scant clues as to where the bodies
could be.
</P>
<P>
   According to another confidential source, Karr talked about the
O'Hair murders but claimed they were killed because of a card game.
According to this person, Karr said Waters killed the four people
and ``buried them in a field in Texas near a subdivision.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, apparently acting on a tip from Karr, twice
searched a ranch in Real County, northwest of San Antonio, but they
came away empty-handed.

   JOHNSON CITY, Texas _ Driving across the Texas Hill Country, you
can sense the forces that shaped Lyndon Baines Johnson. Life
started and ended here for him, among the rock-strewn ranches and
sturdy German-heritage towns.
</P>
<P>
   LBJ's career thrived on Capitol Hill, but the 36th president of
the United States often returned to his ranch near Johnson City and
Stonewall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something different about this country from any other
part of the nation,'' he once said. ``The climate is generally
pleasant; the sun is generally bright; the air seems to be always
clean; and the water is pure. The moons are a little fuller here;
the stars are a little brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   LBJ has been gone for 26 years, but this native son left large,
lasting imprints for those who want to follow in his footsteps over
some of Texas' prettiest ranch land.
</P>
<P>
   Take the first step at the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical
Park in Johnson City, located about 48 miles west of Austin. For
the record, the city was named not for LBJ, but for a cousin and
town builder, James Polk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 130,000 annual visitors start at the LBJ Boyhood
Home, one block north of the park's visitors center. Built in 1901,
this was Johnson's home until his marriage to Claudia Alta Taylor
(now known all over the world as Lady Bird) at age 26. The restored
house includes furnishings of the 1920s. Free daily tours are given
every 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors center features free exhibits and films about the
Johnsons' lives. If time permits, take a 10-minute stroll on a
nature trail to the Johnson Settlement, where programs focus on
Texas frontier life. Several historical structures include the
dog-trot cabin purchased by LBJ's grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson,
for his bride in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider the National Park Service's 75-minute bus tour of
Johnson's ranch along the crystal-clear Pedernales River.
</P>
<P>
   The journey begins with a quick look at the one-room Junction
School, where the former president learned to read at age 4. The
next stop is his reconstructed birthplace, and visitors can tour
the house he rebuilt as a guest cottage in 1964. Johnson delighted
in telling visitors that the only original piece of furniture in
the place was the beat-up-looking rawhide-bottom chair in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Across the road is the oak-flanked Johnson Family Cemetery where
LBJ was buried Jan. 25, 1973. Johnson died after suffering a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The bus also visits his paternal grandparents' farmhouse, where
Johnson used to pick apples. It then makes a quick stop at the
century-old rock LBJ Ranch House, where Lady Bird still resides.
Also referred to as the Texas White House, it remains under Secret
Service protection. The final stop is the Show Barn, where visitors
can get a taste of life on a working ranch and see LBJ's
prize-winning Hereford cattle.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the former president's early years, trace
his rise to political power at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library on the
University of Texas campus in Austin. Operated by the National
Archives and Records Service of the General Services
Administration, this facility serves both as a center for scholarly
research and a historical museum.
</P>
<P>
   Three floors house LBJ-related exhibits, showcasing his tenure
as president. Other highlights include the First Lady's Gallery and
the 1968 Lincoln Continental presidential limousine. A must-see is
the animatronic display of LBJ, which spouts recordings of humorous
observations by the late president on politics, education and life
in general.
</P>
<P>
   The LBJ Library, 2313 Red River St., is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m.
daily, except Christmas Day. Admission is free. For information,
call 512-916-5137.
</P>
<P>
   Cost for the LBJ Ranch bus tour is $3 for ages 7 and older. For
information, call the LBJ National Historical Park at 830-868-7128.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We have two overhead lights in the ceiling of our basement
stairway. Each has a bare bulb in the socket and while carry a
large box up the stairs I accidentally broke both these bulbs,
leaving only a few shards of glass and the base of the bulb still
in the socket. As a result I can't really get a grip on the bulb to
unscrew what is left. Is there anything you can suggest to solve
this problem, or must I have an electrician come in to replace the
sockets?
</P>
<P>
   A: One trick that usually works in such cases is to cut off the
end of a large raw potato. Shut off the power to the fixtures and
while wearing a heavy work glove push the cut end of the potato
into the shattered remains of the bulb. This will give you a grip
that will make it possible to turn the bulb's base out of its
socket safely. Incidentally, you can use a bar of soap instead of a
potato, but you can usually get a firmer grip on a potato.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About one year ago I attached a deflated balloon to my wall
with tape. I took the balloon off recently but found that ink from
the balloon had stained the paint on the wall. I tried painting
over this a couple of times, but the ink still shows through. How
can I get this ink off the wall?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since you have painted over it several times, removing the
ink stain would require removing all the paint on that area by
using a chemical paint remover. This will also remove the ink
stain. However, this may not be necessary. You can cover the stain
with a stain-killing sealer such as Kilz, B-I-N or similar product,
then paint over this in the usual manner. These sealers will keep
the stain from ``bleeding through'' any paint that is applied over
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of my basement windows is below ground level and there is
a well on the outside to keep the soil away. In a heavy rain water
accumulates in the bottom of this well and tends to seep under the
window and into the basement. Can I solve this problem by digging
out the bottom of the window well and filling it with gravel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It definitely would help, but you should dig down at least
10-12 inches before filling with gravel. However, if the soil
drainage below this depth is not good this may not completely solve
the problem. You may have to dig a deep ditch leading away from the
well and then lay underground drain tile (perforated plastic pipe)
to carry the water at least 10 feet away from the bottom of the
window well, preferably ending in a dry well (sump) that will
absorb or hold the water until is can seep into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concrete basement floor of my new house is only 4 feet
below ground level and the walls consist of concrete blocks set on
the same footing as this slab. I have a problem with water leaking
into the basement. Do you think the water could be seeping in under
the footings?
</P>
<P>
   A: Without knowing where the water is actually coming in _
through the floor or through the walls _ it is impossible to
diagnose the source of your leak. The basement should not leak if
it was properly built and if the ground around the outside has been
properly graded so it slopes away from the house on all sides.

COMFORT: A TOWN APPROPRIATELY NAMED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By DAI HUYNH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMFORT, Texas _ Everett Pauls' mind had drifted into the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking pretty comfortable there,'' a passer-by
commented.
</P>
<P>
   The words took a second to sink in. ``Well, sure, what do you
expect? I'm in Comfort,'' Pauls replied.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort, Texas, that is _ a town that seems frozen in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This road hasn't changed,'' Pauls murmured, almost to himself.
``This building hasn't changed, and the building next to it hasn't
changed. It looks pretty much the same. Yes, it does.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know. The 82-year-old Dickinson resident spent many
summers here with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time was when I was 2. We would come up here to swim
in the Guadalupe River when things got too hot in Galveston. They
didn't have air conditioning in those days,'' said Pauls, as he sat
in a rocking chair on the porch of the Comfort Common Bed and
Breakfast and Antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Change doesn't come easily in Comfort. But folks here like it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort is no bustling Fredericksburg, situated 30 minutes to
the north. There is still a quiet, quirky charm about this small
provincial town, settled in 1845 by radical German ``free
thinkers'' fleeing from political and religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors often wonder how the town got its name. Nobody knows
for sure, but the unofficial version is that the early settlers
wanted to call it ``Gemutlichkeit,'' which connotes tranquility,
serenity, peace and happiness. It wasn't the easiest word to
pronounce, or to remember, for that matter, so folks opted instead
for the American equivalent: Comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Today, people come to leisurely browse through the antiques
shops and art galleries on High Street.
</P>
<P>
   Another lure is the 100 turn-of-the-century buildings within
walking distance of the town center. Listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, Comfort has one of Texas' most
complete 19th-century business districts. For those interested in
retracing area history, the Comfort Historical Museum at 838 High
St. houses considerable memorabilia from early German settlers. But
it's only open by appointment or when owner Roy Perkins Jr. is in
the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, stroll over to the ``Treue der Union'' monument, a
Civil War memorial to townspeople who were killed by Confederate
soldiers for being Union sympathizers in the Battle of the Nueces
and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Another landmark, the Ingenhuett Store, has been continuously
operated by the same family for more than 130 years. It's where
old-timers congregate to catch up on the news.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, write to the Chamber of Commerce at P.O.
Box 77, Comfort, Texas 78013, or call 830-995-3131.

HAUNTING FACES OF DIPLOMACY'S VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since I heard it on National Public Radio, I've
been unable to get the concept out of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on the debacle in Kosovo and Serbia, an international
correspondent said that diplomats on all sides of the conflict were
working behind the scenes ``to find a resolution that will allow
both Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Clinton to save face.''
</P>
<P>
   Save face. SAVE FACE?
</P>
<P>
   I have so many faces before me, I can't keep the faces of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and President Clinton in
focus, let alone grasp the value of saving them.
</P>
<P>
   What I can see are countless photographs and video segments of
ethnic Albanian Kosovars, weeping, keening or just staring into
space with a hopelessness and a desolation that belong in the
lowest ring of Hell.
</P>
<P>
   I see refugee children, filthy and sick from too many days and
nights on the run or trapped in inhumanely overcrowded camps.
</P>
<P>
   I see their mothers, physically and emotionally exhausted beyond
anything Milosevic and Clinton have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs aren't necessary for me to see thousands of young
Kosovar women who were wrenched from their families ``because
they're pretty'' and imprisoned by Yugoslavian soldiers to be raped
and humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Although Milosevic obviously does not care about them and
Clinton considers them but ``collateral damage,'' I see new-born
Serbian babies and women in delivery in a maternity ward at a
Belgrade hospital that was accidentally bombed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   I see terrified mental patients in another facility that was hit
and dozens of people with kidney disease who can no longer receive
dialysis because so many Belgrade power stations have been
destroyed and electricity is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   I see 27 dead journalists, including a 60-year-old veteran
program director named Tomislav Mitrovic, at NATO-obliterated Radio
Television Serbia in Belgrade. I see a 52-year-old Kosovo-born
Chicago man named Muhamet Bajrahtar, shot dead near his second home
in Glogovce by the Serbian police; his pocket held U.S. immigration
permits for his wife and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   I can't count the number of terrified ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo I see marching over bridges and open roads for use as
``human shields.'' Nor can I estimate how many Serbian children I
see, now living without power, water and sufficient supplies of
fresh food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more than any face, I see that of a young mother described
by my friend Bernie Ward, a reporter at KGO radio in San Francisco
who spent several weeks in refugee camps on the Kosovo-Macedonia
border.
</P>
<P>
   One of thousands of fleeing ethnic Albanians, the woman was with
her new-born and toddler in the squalor of a camp nicknamed ``The
Valley of Death'' by refugees. The Macedonians, eager to get the
sea of humanity out of their country, began herding people onto
buses for transfer.
</P>
<P>
   As the young mother prepared to board a bus, an old woman in
front of her stumbled and fell. The younger woman reached down to
help, instinctively letting go of her toddler's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few seconds elapsed, but the little boy moved away from
the bus. The terrified mother screamed for him and tried to run to
him, but the Macedonian police shoved her up the stairs. The door
was slammed shut and the bus pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Save FACE, Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Clinton? How, in God's name,
can either of you stand to look at your own in a mirror?
</P>

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Years ago, I read that Jacqueline Kennedy put something into
President Kennedy's casket before he was buried. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arlington National Cemetery reports that the president's
widow, and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, placed
several items in the casket. They included three letters, a pair of
gold cuff links, a piece of scrimshaw engraved with the
presidential seal, a silver rosary, and a PT-109 tie clasp.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about White Oak Plantation in Florida,
where the Clintons spent their recent short vacation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The plantation, a 7,500-acre spread on the St. Mary's River
dividing Florida and Georgia, and about 20 miles north of
Jacksonville, isn't your average resort. For starters, it isn't
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   White Oak was established in 1938 as a family residence by
Charles Gilman. His son, Howard Gilman, who died last year at age
73, developed the plantation as a corporate meeting place. The son
was chairman and CEO of Gilman Paper Co. in St. Mary's, Ga., the
largest privately held paper and building products company in the
United States. The plantation, accessible by an unmarked dirt road,
has a swimming pool, nine-hole golf course, political research
center and a studio for dancers and other artists. Guests have
included Al Gore, Colin Powell, Mikhail Baryshnikov, John F.
Kennedy Jr., Julia Roberts and Jessica Lange. The Clintons are
guests of the Howard Gilman Foundation, which lets groups and
individuals use its facilities for free.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds are home to about 400 animals, such as giraffes,
cheetahs, black rhinos and white rhinos, and Big Guy, an endangered
Florida panther injured by a car. They're under the care of more
than 40 zoologists at the White Oak Conservation Center,
established in 1982 by Howard Gilman to breed and preserve
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   White Oak has 14 houses, including log cabins, lodges and modern
stucco dwellings. The Clintons stayed at Roseland, a two-story,
five-bedroom cedar-paneled house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the articles I've read about the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington, I've never seen whether new names can be
added. Is it possible? If so, who can I contact to see about adding
someone's name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The names on the Wall _ numbering more than 58,200 _ were
obtained initially by the Defense Department, which compiled a list
of combat zone casualties according to an executive order handed
down by President Johnson on April 24, 1965. The Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund says it continues to receive numerous requests each
year from people who want to have names placed on the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   While the fund finances the addition of names to the Wall, it
says the decision on determining which names are inscribed is made
by the Defense Department. Only those people who died of a combat
injury suffered in Vietnam can be added. For more information on
the parameters involved in the consideration of adding a name,
contact the relevant service branch: Army, 703-325-5304; Air Force,
1-800-531-5501; Marine Corps, 703-696-1177; and Navy, 703-687-3979.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement addressing the question of adding names, the fund
adds that the memorial ``stands to honor all who served in Vietnam,
not just those whose individual names it bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a lawsuit involving Gerber
baby food? I received an e-mail saying that children born between
1986 and 1997 would be issued a $500 savings bond if the parent
writes to a settlement office in Minneapolis .
</P>
<P>
   A: This story, which makes the rounds from time to time, is
``completely inaccurate and false,'' says Gerber Products Co. This
misinformation appears to have started circulating after a 1996
settlement involving infant formula and pricing issues, but Gerber
wasn't connected with that litigation. In any case, Gerber says,
the deadline for filing claims in that settlement expired Jan. 31,
1997. The company also says a Minneapolis post office box linked to
Gerber for the processing of claims has been closed by Minneapolis
postal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that consumers are being misled by this
information,'' Gerber says in a statement posted on its Web site.
``Consumers are cautioned not to send birth records or other
information in conenction with this rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do I write to Vice President Al Gore, and how should I
address him?
</P>
<P>
   A: A spokeswoman in Gore's press office said most people who
write him use the title The Honorable Al Gore, Vice President of
the United States, followed by this address: The White House, 1600
Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, DC 20500.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, call up the White House Web site _
www.whitehouse.gov _ and click on The President &AMP; Vice President
and follow the steps. You'll be able to leave a message with a
maximum of 10,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After seeing a TV series about Gen. Douglas MacArthur, I'm
reminded of his widow, Jean. Is she still living? What about their
son, Arthur?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jean Faircloth MacArthur, who turned 100 last Dec. 28, lives
quietly at her home in New York's Waldorf-Astoria, where she has
been a resident since 1951. She has shunned the limelight for
years, never appearing on talk shows and rarely turning up in
celebrity columns, said Col. Bill Davis of the MacArthur Library
Archives and Memorial in Norfolk, Va. Davis said she's in good
health, but other than that he chose not to describe her
activities, saying only that she is ``very much'' a private person.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jean MacArthur's few public forays came in 1990 when,
accompanied by her friend Barbara Bush, she cut a ribbon to open a
research center at the Norfolk facility named for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur MacArthur lives in New York, Davis said, but he declined
to provide any details. It has been reported variously that the son
was either a music arranger, a Wall Street businessman or ballet
dancer, but there never has been any confirmation. Since his
father's death in 1964, he has chosen to stay out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas MacArthur is entombed at the Norfolk museum, which is
part of the library and archives. When his widow dies, she will be
entombed with him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the lightning tracking system used by some
television weather reporters. Can you explain how it works?
</P>
<P>
   A: Meteorologist Glenn Burns of WSB in Atlanta likens the
technology to what happens when you're listening to AM radio and
hear a static discharge from a distant thunderstorm. A network of
sensors detects the presence of positive and negative lightning
strokes, Burns said, and enables TV stations to show their location
on display maps ``in real time'' almost instantly as they occur.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper has reported frequently about the new quarters
honoring the 50 states. What about the District of Columbia?
</P>
<P>
   A: The authorizing law calls for quarters to honor only the 50
states, according to the Treasury Department, so the District of
Columbia is out of the question, at least for now. But there's a
provision in the law regarding the possibility of additional
honorees. A bill introduced in Congress by Del. Eleanor Holmes
Norton (D-D.C.) seeks to extend the program to include the District
of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Los Angeles police and the FBI are
closing in on two fugitives from the 1970s, Kathleen Soliah, former
associate of Patty Hearst and her Symbionese Liberation Army
colleagues, and James Kilgore, suspected member of the New World
Liberation Front, which was blamed for various bombings in
California in the mid-1970s. Is there no statute of limitations
involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no statute of limitations because the charges involve
a capital offense, said FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   The Symbionese Liberation Army was a group of ex-convicts and
radical college students that claimed responsibility for the
assassination of Marcus Foster, superintendent of schools in
Oakland, Calif. The SLA kidnapped Hearst from her Berkeley
apartment in 1974 and demanded, among other things, that her
father, Randolph Hearst, then president and editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, feed the poor for her release. Patty Heast
joined the radical group during the next 18 months, and she was
videotaped holding a gun during an April 1974 bank robbery in San
Francisco. Hearst eventually told authorities, and wrote in her
book, ``Every Secret Thing,'' that Kilgore and Soliah had
participated in another SLA bank robbery a year later in
Carmichael, Calif., in which a woman customer was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard on the radio that Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, bought the original sheet music to ``Candle in the Wind.''
What will he do with it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Spencer paid about $40,500 at an auction in London last week
for the original manuscript for the tribute song, which became the
biggest-selling single of all time after Elton John _ now Sir Elton
John _ performed it at Westminster Abbey during Diana's funeral in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer plans to display the manuscript, which was signed by
John and Beatles producer Sir George Martin, at a museum devoted to
Diana's life which Spencer has created at Althorp, the family's
ancestral home. ``It will be on display this year, and we are very
happy to have it,'' said Shelley-Anne Claircourt, Spencer's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the auction, which was held at Sotheby's in London,
will be donated to music-related charities, according to the
auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is this mysterious pin money given to Hillary Rodham
Clinton, which I'm told she has reported on her income tax return?
</P>
<P>
   A: No mystery. You're referring to the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin
Money Fund, which isn't new to Clinton. It was established in
Freeman's 1912 will for whoever, at a given time, is the spouse of
the president. The income tax return of the Clintons included
$12,000 from the pin money fund. As she has done in past years, the
first lady said she will contribute this income to charitable
entities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A told us about Hillary Rodham Clinton's pin money. I've
always been curious: Where does that expression come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: It goes way back, as the Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins explains. Metal pins, invented perhaps as early as the 14th
century and later manufactured in England by a monopoly under
grants from the crown, were so costly and scarce at first that
there was a law forbidding their sale except on the first two days
of January each year. About that time of year, husbands customarily
gave their wives money to buy all the pins they would need for the
months ahead _ hence, pin money. When pins became less expensive,
the expression still was used for this annual stipend. It came to
mean a personal allowance given to a wife, generally, by her
husband.

   Q: An article about Helen Suzman described her as a member of
Parliament in South Africa who for 36 years was the only one who
voted against apartheid and other repressive laws. How did she
manage to get re-elected over and over again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Suzman served as the liberal representative from Houghton, a
silk-stocking district in northern Johannesburg, from her first
election in 1953 until her retirement in 1989. For 13 of those
years, the South African-born daughter of Jewish immigrants from
Lithuania was the only opposition member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   She credited her ability to hold onto her seat for so long to
the people she represented, whom she called ``exceptional,
intelligent, traveled.'' Many of them were Jewish like herself,
with an ingrained aversion to racism.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers during her turbulent decades in South
African politics, however, said it was more than that, crediting
her uncompromising integrity and singleness of purpose. In 1989,
when she announced that she wouldn't run again, even her political
opponents joined the line of parliamentarians who paid tribute to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Short-wave radio reports indicated that at least 21 Americans
have been killed in the fighting in Yugoslavia. Can you confirm? Of
that number, how many were military, and how many civilian?
</P>
<P>
   A: As of May 28, no U.S. or NATO forces have died in combat,
said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Steve Campbell. Two U.S. pilots
were killed May 5 in an Apache helicopter training accident in
Albania, but they aren't considered combat casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said NATO has reported the ``possibility'' that
American civilians have been killed in its bombing campaign, but he
added that there has been no confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend told me she had heard about a lawsuit in the Claus
Von Bulow case that would force him to pay damages to the family of
his wife, Sunny. He had been accused of trying to kill her with
insulin some years back. Can you shed any light on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It isn't something that happened recently. In 1985, after a
previous conviction on the attempted murder charge was overturned,
Von Bulow was acquitted of trying to kill Martha ``Sunny'' von
Bulow.
</P>
<P>
   Her adult children by a previous marriage then filed a $56
million civil lawsuit against him that was settled out of court in
1987 after Von Bulow agreed, among other things, to renounce his
claims to his wife's fortune and to divorce the heiress, who was
left comatose. Defense attorneys argued that the woman brought on
the comas herself by drug and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Armstrong, who represented the stepchildren,
said later: ``The purpose for the Von Bulow suit was to get Claus
out of the lives of the family. When he agreed to do that, there
was no longer any purpose in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Ted Turner's military background?
</P>
<P>
   A: The CNN founder served six months of active duty in the Coast
Guard, according to Current Biography.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many of us who are size-conscious find inspiration in Richard
Simmons. Can you give us some background information about him?
Where can fans write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The physical fitness specialist and TV personality was born
in New Orleans in 1948 as Milton Teagle Simmons. In his
introduction to the best-selling ``Richard Simmons'
Never-Say-Diet,'' he wrote that when he was a child he thought his
parents favored his older brother, Lenny. So he turned to food for
comfort and, in his own words, became addicted.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 or 11 he renamed himself Richard. By the time he was 15,
his love of food was evident as his weight approached 200 pounds.
He attended Southern Louisiana University and Florida State
University before heading to Italy, where he peaked at 268 pounds.
When someone left a note on his Fiat saying ``Fat people die
young,'' Simmons says he was was jolted into determination,
shedding 112 pounds in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 he returned to the United States, eventually opening a
restaurant and adjacent exercise studio in Beverly Hills, Calif. TV
producers attracted by his antics made him a staple on talk shows
and he eventually got his own program. Books, audiotapes,
videotapes and shopping center appearances furthered his celebrity
status.
</P>
<P>
   Write him in care of Anatomy Asylum, 9306 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Beverly Hills, CA 90210.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible for Americans to adopt orphans from Kosovo? If
so, what is the procedure?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the State Department says it shares humanitarian
concerns for the children of Kosovo, and applauds people's desire
to help them, it also says adoption isn't feasible. In a formal
statement on the issue, this is what the department says: ``In
general, adopts are private legal civil matters governed by the
laws of the nation where the child lives. The process involves
complex foreign and U.S. legal requirements. The laws in the former
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) give priority to their own citizens
and make adoptions by foreigners very difficult. In a crisis
situation . . . it can be extremely difficult to determine if
children whose parents are missing are truly orphans. . . . Even
when children have been truly orphaned or abandoned by their
parents, they are often taken in by other relatives. Staying with
relatives in extended family units is generally a better solution
than uprooting the child completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: TV game show host Bob Barker was presented with a lifetime
achievement award at the recent Daytime Emmy Awards. Can you tell
us about his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Robert William Barker was born Dec. 12, 1923, in Darrington,
Wash. He served in the Navy in 1943-45, and in 1947 graduated summa
cum laude from Drury College in Springfield, Mo., with a major in
economics. While at Drury, Barker worked for radio station KTTS in
Springfield. After a stint with a radio station in Palm Beach,
Fla., he moved to Los Angeles, where he hosted ``The Bob Barker
Show'' for radio station KWIK in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   You know the rest: ``Truth or Consequences,'' ``The Family
Game,'' ``The Price Is Right,'' various beauty pageants, hosting
the Pillsbury Bake-Off and ``The Bob Barker Fun and Games Show,''
among many others. Before his recent recognition for lifetime
achievement, Barker had received at least a dozen Daytime Emmys,
starting in 1981-82. His wife, Dorothy Jo, whom he married in 1945,
died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about the Kosovo conflict have mentioned the
War Powers Act. What is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: The War Powers Act is a law passed by Congress in 1973 as a
result of actions taken by Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard
Nixon during the Vietnam War. It was designed to balance military
powers of the president, as commander in chief, and Congress, which
has the power to declare war.
</P>
<P>
   According to Section 4 (a) (1) of the resolution, the president
must inform Congress within 48 hours if U.S. forces are sent into a
hostile area without a declaration of war. In addition, those
forces may remain no longer than 90 days unless Congress approves
the president's action or declares war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what initially was considered a successful attempt to
involve Congress more meaningfully in war-making, the resolution
has been the subject of much criticism and debate. Some critics
argue that it attempts improperly to tie the president's hands,
while others view it as an invitation for the president to conduct
war freely within a specified period of time. Even if taken at face
value, the resolution contains loopholes. It states, for example,
that ``Nothing in this joint resolution . . . is intended to alter
the constitutional authority of the president.'' Also, there's no
mechanism to force the president to comply with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Evander Holyfield have a fan club? If so, what is the
address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the heavyweight boxing champion has a fan club. For
information, write: Holyfield Management, 794 Evander Holyfield
Highway, Fairburn, GA 30213.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend and I are debating the value of those popular green
and orange sports drinks. Are they really better than water?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unlike water, sports drinks provide sodium, which is lost in
perspiration, as well as carbohydrates. These ingredients also are
said to speed fluid absorption from the stomach into the
bloodstream, making dehydration less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some people think the drinks are no better than water
for most active people, who don't exercise long enough or hard
enough to reap the benefits of rapid hydration that the drinks
provide. People who consume water before, during and after exercise
don't come close to approaching dehydration, these experts contend.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: Every quart of a sports drink contains 250
calories, so if you're exercising to lose weight, you need to burn
off well over 250 calories to create a caloric deficit.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taken at face value, the findings are shocking. Over 20 years,
according to the report of an investigating committee chaired by
Congressman Christopher Cox of California, Chinese spies stole
information on every warhead currently deployed in America's
ballistic-missile arsenal, including the W-88, the most
sophisticated yet devised.
</P>
<P>
   They stole missile-guidance technology, and probably got hold of
design information for an enhanced neutron bomb. Their appetite for
the stuff was ``insatiable,'' their energy ``enormous,'' and they
have not stopped yet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the report concludes, China has been able to leap
in a few years from 1950s-era weapons to the most modern
thermonuclear technology; and America is left with its security in
a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the headlines. Behind them, the Cox report is not
quite that chilling for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is unclear just how much weapons expertise China has
really acquired, or from where. Since China steals from many
different countries, and even does a little original work of its
own, not all its progress can be credited to America.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive material is in the third of the Cox report
that is still classified, but in any case no weapon derived from
the stolen American information has been deployed _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of comparative nuclear strength, China remains way
behind America, with a few dozen warheads to America's thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous effect of the stealing is the strength it
gives China within Asia, not only compared with Taiwan but also
compared with Japan and other nuclear powers, such as India.
</P>
<P>
   It is also suspected that some of these secrets were passed on
to others.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of Chinese spying _ though it is hotly denied by China,
of course _ comes as no surprise. Nor, alas, does America's chaotic
openness. Chinese agents have poured for years into this sprawling
treasure chest, and not much has got in their way.
</P>
<P>
   China's borers and grubbers did not merely download material
from slipshod government laboratories; they also worked through
joint ventures, front companies, official exchanges, downloading of
secrets from drunken American visitors, even a careful reading of
American technical journals.
</P>
<P>
   American spies tried to do the same in China, but with far fewer
agents and probably much less to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the security lapses were made public, calls came for the
resignation of the officials in charge, especially Sandy Berger at
the National Security Council and Janet Reno at the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Both had received reports of spying at the laboratories some
years ago, but took no action and apparently did not tell the
president. They appear not to have thought it serious enough, and
there was probably the usual lack of communication between
departments.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy for that is simple: more vigilance and more
information-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A top-level sacking or resignation, given the laxity displayed
by Berger and Reno, might usefully underscore this point. The
consequences should not, and almost certainly will not, stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The policy of engagement with China, even a constantly pilfering
China, is as right now as it has been since 1972 when that policy
began. Yet the Clinton administration's approach to China has been
both more expansive than that, and more erratic _ even by this
administration's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although, as the Cox report says, China has been enjoying pretty
unrestricted access to America for 20 years and in Republican and
Democratic administrations alike, it was under Clinton that the
program of official military exchanges was revived, and that
supervision of export sales of satellite technology was removed
from the State Department to the far laxer Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sales contracts to China were sought with official support, and
celebrated. And it was also under Clinton _ ably assisted by
Vice-President Al Gore _ that Chinese officials pumped money into
the Democratic Party machine in the 1996 election in the confident
hope of a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   Confusingly _ not least to the Chinese _ the administration also
has moments of toughness on China. These occur whenever Clinton
feels that softness is going down badly.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is split several ways on China, between
business-friendly ``engagers'' and those, on both the right and the
left, who want China rapped for its human-rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with his typical desire to play all sides of the court,
accommodates the so-called ``moralists'' when he can.
</P>
<P>
   That is why from time to time he encourages Taiwanese who want
to be a fully independent country, despite his general endorsement
of a ``one China'' policy; and why, after Zhu Rongji's hopeful and
warmly welcomed visit in April, Clinton suddenly turned cool on
China's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report, which has given Republicans an ideal election
rod with which to beat the president, will no doubt inspire more
grit for a while. That would be no bad thing, if it lasted.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking lesson of the Cox report is that Clinton needs
to get his China policy straight. He is dealing not with a friend,
but with a rival whose interests are different from those of the
United States and the rest of the democratic West.
</P>
<P>
   To engage with this rival _ to trade, talk, consult _ is
essential. To drop one's guard, even for a moment, could prove
fatally wrong. &QL;

<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ Peeking through the heavy morning mists,
the rolling hills seem like humpbacked dinosaurs rising from
slumber.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun washes over this land _ stitched together by green
valleys, glistening rivers, stately oak trees, limestone bluffs,
and pastoral villages and towns _ the enchantment of the Hill
Country takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, this region of Texas appears peaceful _ its
quiet beauty fashioned long ago by the elements.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Hill Country is just a large, dissected
plateau, formed when thick layers of limestone and other
sedimentary rocks were deposited at the bottom of the ocean
millions of years ago. Many more millennia passed before a large
section was lifted to about 2,000 feet along the Balcones
Escarpment, a curving fault that stretches from Austin to San
Antonio to the Del Rio area. The rock layers were then raised,
forming relatively high, flat surfaces. Erosion did the rest,
carving the uplifted areas into the hilly, rocky terrain that makes
up the eastern and southern boundaries. The relatively undissected
Edwards Plateau defines the western region, and rolling plains and
prairies dominate the northern region.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rugged terrain and thin soil make the Hill Country
difficult to farm, more wildflowers bloom here in the spring than
in any other part of the state. And Mother Nature attracts droves
of vacationers _ even those with only a weekend to spare _ who seek
a romantic getaway against a technicolor backdrop. They congregate
in Fredericksburg, New Braunfels, Austin, Bandera, Georgetown,
Boerne, Kerrville, Wimberley, Blanco, Comfort, Mason or in more
secluded parts of the 25 Hill Country counties.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its scenic beauty and cooling temperatures, the Hill
Country is defined by the hospitality of its residents, a rich
German heritage and enough recreational pursuits to satisfy almost
any interest and age group, ranging from horseback riding and
golfing in Bandera to river-tubing and kayaking on the Guadalupe
River in New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   So where to begin? For now, point your travel compass westward
toward Fredericksburg in Gillespie County.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WELCOME TO FREDERICKSBURG &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willkommen!
</P>
<P>
   This German salutation is posted all along roadways leading to
Fredericksburg. In a town driven by tourists, making people feel
welcome from start to finish is paramount. Once a secret hideaway
for Texans in the know, Fredericksburg now beckons travelers from
around the world; the Tourist Division of the Texas Department of
Economic Development estimates that visitors pump about $50 million
annually into Gillespie County.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend intruder quickly recognizes residents' pride in theirshedly Teutonic-flavored town, shaped by German culture and
history.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericksburg was settled a year after the first wave of German
immigrants erected New Braunfels, about 70 miles to the southeast,
in 1845. Led by John O. Meusebach, the 120 practical-minded,
God-fearing tradesmen, artisans, merchants, farmers and
professionals named the area near the Pedernales River after their
much-loved Prince Frederick of Prussia.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneers arrived in the spring when the landscape was
covered with acres of bluebonnets, belying the physical hardship
and danger to come. But despite attacks from Indians and breakouts
of cholera, Fredericksburg prospered. According to the U.S. Census,
there were 754 Fredericksburg residents by 1850. Today, the
population is about 8,600. But that number is on the rise as more
city-weary souls migrate to the area.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the old-timers grumble that Fredericksburg has changed,
become too crowded, too commercial. Still, this progressive town
has been able to retain its charm by keeping many of its German
customs and traditions intact.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors savor Fredericksburg's culture, history, food _ several
German restaurants included _ and shopping opportunities. But they
also come to stay in one of 300 bed-and-breakfast inns and guest
houses scattered about the area. Indeed, small family-owned
accommodations _ many of exceptional quality _ are a prime lure
throughout the Hill Country, and especially so in Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the experience,'' says Carolyn Green of Austin.
``You want a place not only to sleep in, but also to dream in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredericksburg is renowned both for traditional B&AMP;Bs and guest
houses, and although people often lump the two together, they are
distinctively different. Take, for example, the morning meal. B&AMP;Bs
provide guests with a full, family-style breakfast. Individuals
staying in guest houses make or find their own.
</P>
<P>
   Another distinction: B&AMP;Bs have an on-premises host or hostess to
answer questions. Guest houses don't, but there is always the
phone. Also, when you rent a guest house, you get the entire house
_ perhaps a 1920s cottage, a rustic log cabin or even a renovated
historical barn.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of guest houses exceeds that of B&AMP;Bs in
Fredericksburg, the occupancy rate remains higher for B&AMP;Bs, says
Donna Mittel, owner of Gastehaus Schmidt Reservation Service. ``For
people who really like the pampering, and sometimes we all do, B&AMP;Bs
are the way to go,'' Mittel suggests.
</P>
<P>
   But, she says, ``There are people who really value their
privacy. Some people feel like they have more privacy in guest
houses. There's nobody there to disturb them or for them to
disturb.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative of this kind of hospitality is the Schmidt Barn,
a charming little 1860s rock structure with an herb garden. Guests
are given a map and keys to the barn at the Gastehaus Schmidt
office downtown, and off they go, on their own, and not very likely
to bump into Loretta Schmidt, the barn owner who lives a few yards
away on the same hilltop.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1982, the Schmidt Barn was one of the first guest
houses in Fredericksburg. Schmidt got into the business simply
because the number of B&AMP;Bs fell short of the demand. At the time,
there were only a handful in town. Schmidt and a few other
homeowners were asked to help out by renting their spare rooms and
guest houses to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ladies immediately liked the idea because they liked the
company,'' Schmidt said ``But then they started liking the checks
that came along with that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of guest houses grew, Schmidt founded Gastehaus
Schmidt in 1985. The reservation service, which she later sold to
Mittel, handles bookings for more than 100 guest houses.
</P>
<P>
   Like the owners, no two guest houses are alike. Aside from the
basics, each offers different amenities. Some, such as the Schmidt
Barn, provide cookies, juice and cold cuts; others nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Decor also differs. Some guest houses are sweetly draped in
floral designs and coordinating linens; among them is Oma Rosa's
Haus. Others take a more rustic approach; located off a country
dirt road on a 30-acre ranch, Das Jager Haus' enticements include
an outdoor shower.
</P>
<P>
   Many guest houses are built for romance: The Pappa John's
Bunkhouse and the Rosemary Cottage are among several that feature a
whirlpool tub for two.
</P>
<P>
   A few, including the Orange Street Cottage, Keepsake Cottage and
Up the Creek Guest House, are new. But most guest houses are
historical structures.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny one-room Sunday houses represent a style of architecture
unique to Fredericksburg. Between the late 1890s and early 1920s,
farmers erected Sunday houses for their families to use when they
came to town on weekends to worship, shop and socialize. Until
recently, the Sunday houses were being demolished to make way for
new shops and homes. Today, people are rediscovering and remodeling
them into guest houses; examples include the Yellow Sunday House
and Rode Sunday House.

<P>
   Taken at face value, the findings are shocking. Over 20 years,
according to the report of an investigating committee chaired by
Congressman Christopher Cox of California, Chinese spies stole
information on every warhead currently deployed in America's
ballistic-missile arsenal, including the W-88, the most
sophisticated yet devised.
</P>
<P>
   They stole missile-guidance technology, and probably got hold of
design information for an enhanced neutron bomb. Their appetite for
the stuff was ``insatiable,'' their energy ``enormous,'' and they
have not stopped yet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the report concludes, China has been able to leap

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   South Korea's economic strategy over the past four decades was
to follow a few paces behind Japan. Its economic model was based on
Japan's. It moved into new industries, such as television or
microwave production, just as Japan moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, South Korea might offer its former colonial
masters a lesson or two.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have had severe financial crises, which left them
with sick banking systems and massive overcapacity after years of
artificially cheap capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the big difference is that South Korea's economy seems to be
recovering quickly from recession, while Japan's continues to
languish in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year South Korea's GDP jumped by an
annual rate of 18 percent, to 4.6 percent above its level of a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists now predict that the economy will enjoy growth
of more than 5 percent for 1999 as a whole, following a decline of
5.8 percent last year. Industrial production is back at pre-crisis
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this rebound springs from firms adjusting their
inventories, but consumer spending and exports have also perked up.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, in contrast, industrial production is stuck almost 10
percent below its level of early 1997; the country's GDP is
expected to shrink again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics argue that it is easy to bounce back sharply after a
steep fall; and even if the South Korean economy does grow by 5
percent this year, it would still leave output 14 percent below its
previous trend growth line.
</P>
<P>
   But applying the same logic to Japan, where growth has averaged
only 0.7 percent a year over the past seven years, compared with a
previous trend rate of 3-4 percent, one could argue that Japan's
output has already fallen by as much as 15-20 percent relative to
its previous trend. Yet nobody expects Japan to bounce back
strongly this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's recovery partly reflects looser fiscal and
monetary policies; but the government's greater boldness in
pursuing reforms and cleaning up the banking sector have also been
important.
</P>
<P>
   Under IMF tutelage, the government has opened up the economy to
foreign direct investment and tightened accounting rules to make
business more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant of all, South Korea was quick to tackle its
banks' ills. Many banks were closed, merged or nationalized, and
the government has recapitalized the system by taking over bad
loans wholesale. This has helped to shore up confidence, and
allowed banks to make new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan preferred to procrastinate instead. Only now is the
government at last recapitalizing the banking system _ six years
after the seriousness of its problems became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, economic activity has been depressed by firms' and
consumers' pessimism about the government's ability to resolve the
banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government deserves credit for its efforts. But
the job is far from complete. There are still many obstacles which
could hinder a full recovery.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   South Korea's economic strategy over the past four decades was
to follow a few paces behind Japan. Its economic model was based on
Japan's. It moved into new industries, such as television or
microwave production, just as Japan moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, South Korea might offer its former colonial
masters a lesson or two.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have had severe financial crises, which left them
with sick banking systems and massive overcapacity after years of
artificially cheap capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the big difference is that South Korea's economy seems to be
recovering quickly from recession, while Japan's continues to
languish in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year South Korea's GDP jumped by an
annual rate of 18 percent, to 4.6 percent above its level of a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists now predict that the economy will enjoy growth
of more than 5 percent for 1999 as a whole, following a decline of
5.8 percent last year. Industrial production is back at pre-crisis
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this rebound springs from firms adjusting their
inventories, but consumer spending and exports have also perked up.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, in contrast, industrial production is stuck almost 10
percent below its level of early 1997; the country's GDP is
expected to shrink again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics argue that it is easy to bounce back sharply after a
steep fall; and even if the South Korean economy does grow by 5
percent this year, it would still leave output 14 percent below its
previous trend growth line.
</P>
<P>
   But applying the same logic to Japan, where growth has averaged
only 0.7 percent a year over the past seven years, compared with a
previous trend rate of 3-4 percent, one could argue that Japan's
output has already fallen by as much as 15-20 percent relative to
its previous trend. Yet nobody expects Japan to bounce back
strongly this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's recovery partly reflects looser fiscal and
monetary policies; but the government's greater boldness in
pursuing reforms and cleaning up the banking sector have also been
important.
</P>
<P>
   Under IMF tutelage, the government has opened up the economy to
foreign direct investment and tightened accounting rules to make
business more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant of all, South Korea was quick to tackle its
banks' ills. Many banks were closed, merged or nationalized, and
the government has recapitalized the system by taking over bad
loans wholesale. This has helped to shore up confidence, and
allowed banks to make new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan preferred to procrastinate instead. Only now is the
government at last recapitalizing the banking system _ six years
after the seriousness of its problems became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, economic activity has been depressed by firms' and
consumers' pessimism about the government's ability to resolve the
banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government deserves credit for its efforts. But
the job is far from complete. There are still many obstacles which
could hinder a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest barrier is the country's heavily indebted
conglomerates, or chaebol. The government wants them to sell chunks
of their bloated empires to foreigners, to reduce their debts, but

CHASING HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
FREDERICKSBURG, Texas: Rode Sunday House.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be tempting to spend all day relaxing within a guest
house. But take a last sip of fresh orange juice and discover the
other enticements that abound in the Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   Diverse museums celebrate toys and miniatures in Fredericksburg,
Hummel collectibles and handmade furnishings in New Braunfels,
antiques and sightseeing treks in Comfort, frontier days and rodeos
in Bandera and cowboy art in Kerrville.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Fredericksburg, like many of its neighboring towns,
brims with a profusion of one-of-a-kind shops and old-time
atmosphere and history. And for now, it hasn't gotten too unwieldy
to tour on foot. So park the car and start pounding the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   For a glimpse of the past, start at the octagonal Vereins Kirche
(church society). Actually a 1935 replica of the first public
building, the structure is located at the center of Marktplatz
public park downtown. Built in 1847, the original building was used
for religious gatherings and community meetings. Today it houses
pictures and artifacts of life in the early days of Gillespie
County.
</P>
<P>
   Next, stroll over to the Gillespie County Historical Society's
Pioneer Museum Complex, 309 W. Main St. A must-see, it houses
several restored historical buildings, including a general store,
blacksmith shop, smokehouse, log cabin, wagon shed and schoolhouse.
Near the back of the grounds stand the one-room schoolhouse and the
1904 Weber Sunday House.
</P>
<P>
   Many fine buildings were designed by renowned architect Alfred
Giles, who lived here. Located at Adam and Main streets, the
Fredericksburg Public Library was built in 1882 from native
limestone from nearby quarries. Another of Giles' creations is the
old Bank of Fredericksburg, about a block down from the library on
Main Street. Although no longer a bank, the signage remains on the
building, noted for its impressive stone rampart and tower.
</P>
<P>
   One of Texas' most famous native sons was born in 1885 in a
pioneer home near the corner of Main and Lincoln streets. Indeed,
the ancestors of Chester W. Nimitz, the U.S. naval commander in
chief of the Pacific in World War II, were among the first German
pioneers to settle the area. To commemorate Nimitz' illustrious
career, his grandfather's Nimitz Steamboat Hotel at Main and
Washington streets was turned into the Admiral Nimitz Museum and
Historical Center, a state historical park managed by Texas Parks
and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Since the museum opened in 1983, Fredericksburg has become a
haven for retired military servicemen who come to trace Nimitz's
career and the events of World War II. Expect to spend a couple of
hours at the museum looking at picture murals and displays such as
the wheel and instruments of the SS Menhaden and a collection of
small and large relics from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Components of the park are scattered over several blocks. Behind
the museum is a courtyard, with a walkway paralleling the Memorial
Wall with plaques placed by families and shipmates of naval
servicemen who died in the Pacific. At the far end is the serene
Japanese Garden of Peace, a gift from the people of Japan to
symbolize the friendship between Nimitz and their national hero
Adm. Heihachiro Togo.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to the park, the $3 million National Museum
of the Pacific War and George Bush Gallery, is scheduled to open to
the public June 12. Located directly behind the Nimitz Museum, the
new 23,000-square-foot gallery will include life-size exhibits such
as a B-25 bomber and Japanese midget submarine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FOR NATURE LOVERS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of chasing history? Ready for fun in the great outdoors?
From canoeing and backpacking in Guadalupe River State Park to
water-skiing and golfing in Inks Lake State Park, the Hill Country
offers a wealth of opportunity to unwind in the sun and soak in the
rolling vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the one place that draws more nature lovers to this part
of the Hill Country is Enchanted Rock State Park, 18 miles north of
Fredericksburg. The 1,643-acre park is home to the second-largest
granite rock in the United States (the biggest is Stone Mountain in
Georgia). Shrouded in legends and myths, it was christened
Enchanted Rock because of the reported strange lights and odd
sounds emanating from the granite structure. And despite its
semi-arid facade, a closer inspection reveals a thriving community,
including more than 500 species of vegetation and 150 or more
species of birds.
</P>
<P>
   A real eye-catcher, the solid pinkish-gray dome is also a haven
for hikers and climbers, providing both easy routes for the less
hardy and real challenges for the adventurers. Once these
nature-bound visitors reach the summit, many find themselves lying
on their backs on top of the smooth granite dome, watching the the
vultures and hawks circling and weaving through the white clouds
and clear blue skies. Later, they might set up a tent or lay out a
feast at one of the many primitive campsites and picnic areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Hill Country is famous for its tapestry of blooms. Aside
from the signature Texas bluebonnets, there are scarlet flax,
purple coneflowers, rocket larkspurs, baby blue eyes, yellow
cosmos, yarrows, Texas paintbrushes and Indian blankets.
</P>
<P>
   When in season, a place to visit with your camera is the
600-acre Wildseed Farms, seven miles eastward of Fredericksburg on
U.S. 290. It's hard to miss, especially when acres of bluebonnets
and red poppies are blooming. Visitors can take a leisurely stroll
on the walking trails and find more than 5,000 wildflower species,
including blue flax, winecups and lemon mint. For $4, you can also
pick some wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   For an unusual experience, about 12 miles from Fredericksburg
off the Old San Antonio Highway is the Old Tunnel Wildlife
Management Area (Bat Tunnel). Open nightly June through October, an
observation deck provides the chance to sit and wait for millions
of Mexican free-tail bats to come out, hunting their nightly meal.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, many bat colonies take up residence under the
bridges and caves throughout the Hill Country. Another bat
destination is Austin's Town Lake. Visitors from near and far
convene along its shores to watch the nightly flight of bats from
the Congress Avenue bridge, one of the nation's largest urban bat
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Hill Country also includes several wineries that offer tours
and tastings. One of the oldest is the Bell Mountain Vineyards at
463 Bell Mountain Road. Also here are the Grape Creek Vineyard,
Fredericksburg Winery and Becker Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the wineries and other Fredericksburg
attractions, call the Convention and Visitors Bureau at
888-997-3600. Or access www.fredericksburg-texas.com on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on Fredericksburg-area guest houses or
B&AMP;Bs, call Gastehaus Schmidt Reservation Service at 830-997-5612 or
Hill Country Lodging &AMP; Reservation Service at 830-990-8455. Call
phone numbers listed elsewhere in this section for information
about B&AMP;Bs in other Hill Country locations. Many guest houses
require a minimum stay of two nights on weekends or during
holidays. Rates range from $65 to $140 per couple, plus $15-$25 for
each additional person.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, the comforting conclusion to be drawn from
the Cox report into Chinese spying: America does not find itself
suddenly facing a world-changing event, as it did in the Rosenberg
case (which revealed the secrets of the Manhattan Project to the
Soviet Union in the 1940s) or even during the missile crisis in the
Taiwan Strait in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by a committee headed by Christopher Cox, a
mild Republican congressman from California, revealed that China's
spying has been a long-running campaign, not a sudden incident.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the report is disturbing for three reasons:
because of what it suggests about China's military capability;
because of its timing; and because of what it reveals about
American failures to safeguard nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   These go back many years, but have become considerably worse
during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that China has stolen classified information on
seven nuclear weapons programs, including all the warheads deployed
in America's nuclear armory. It also claims that China has
obtained, by hook or by crook, information on satellite and
submarine guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   The details of precisely which secrets it has got remain
unknown. All the same, at the very least, the range of options
available to Chinese military planners has increased.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cox report says the Chinese are about to test a missile
_ the Dong Feng 31 _ based partly on stolen American technology.
</P>
<P>
   When deployed (which the report says will be in 2002), the DF31
will be the first in a new family of mobile, solid-fuel missile
systems that will make China's nuclear force, which is now on the
level of the Soviet Union's in the 1960s, into something more like
America's in the 1970s: far from parity with the United States now,
but a step up.
</P>
<P>
   Given China's willingness to project force to get its way in
foreign policy, that could have big implications in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither that nor the revelations in the Cox report necessarily
requires a radical change in American policy towards China.
Nevertheless, the report has brought into question parts of
America's policy of ``engagement'' with China _ or at least the way
in which it has been implemented. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The policy has meant, for example, that when a Chinese company
has wanted to buy high-technology goods in the United States, the
presumption was that it would get an export license. That is likely
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Military cooperation is also a dead letter; China has suspended
it anyway in the wake of the Belgrade embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the timing of the report _ just after that event _
will make improving American-Chinese relations even harder than it
would otherwise have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, opponents of China are a strange alliance
of right-wingers in search of a new Cold-War enemy and left-wingers
concerned about human-rights violations and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   They have relatively little support at the political center.
Indignation about the theft of nuclear secrets is widespread and
might provide such support.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, that might not mean China's bid for
membership of the World Trade Organization (its top priority in
international trade) is doomed. Before the Cox report, the
administration had been taken aback by protests from companies at
Clinton's refusal to support China's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, any attempt to reopen the issue now will be awkward.
But even Cox supports China's bid _ on the right terms _ and, in
the past, trade issues have usually been separated from broader
political ones. Unfortunately, that means that even if China gets
into the WTO, relations with the United States may still not
improve. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Cox report leaves both sides nursing grudges.
</P>
<P>
   But if America bears a grudge, it has only itself to blame. The
single most shocking fact revealed by the Cox report is not the
extent of China's spying, but America's failure to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   The first cases of Chinese espionage in America's nuclear
laboratories date from the late 1970s. The broad details of the
operation were known as long ago as 1995, yet, on two occasions,
the Department of Energy refused to act on investigations by its
own counterintelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until this April that a new energy secretary, Bill
Richardson, shut down the main computers to perform a thorough
check. By that time, the worst (and most recent) example of Chinese
spying had taken place _ after the completion of the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the committee remarked that it was ``concerned that
no procedures are in place that would either prevent or detect the
movement of classified information to unclassified sections of the
computer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was right to worry. When officials at the Department of
Energy read that passage, they checked the computer of Wen Ho Lee,
a Chinese-American scientist employed at the Los Alamos Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He had downloaded the so-called ``legacy codes'' on to an open
computer. These codes contain all the data the United States has
gathered in 50 years of nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy is finally slamming the stable door.
And if the Cox committee gets its way, security controls will get
tighter still.
</P>
<P>
   Its report lists 38 policy recommendations, from new binding
international controls on the transfers of sensitive technology, to
transferring authority over satellite licenses back to the State
Department. The day the report was released, the president said he
agreed with most of the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report's finer details raise three troubling
questions about America's response to China's recent spying.
</P>
<P>
   First, why did the Department of Energy demote the
counter-intelligence chief who originally raised the alarm?
</P>
<P>
   The man concerned, Notra Trulock, says he first knew of Chinese
spying in the mid-1990s and alerted the department, the secretary
of defense and so on at the time. He was demoted in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Second, why did the Federal Bureau of Investigation fail to act
against Lee and why did it and the Justice Department engage in
mutual recriminations about how to proceed?
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI in 1997 requested permission from Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, to monitor Lee's telephone conversations, she
denied the appeal, arguing that there was not enough evidence to
suspect him.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert Torricelli, a close ally of the Clinton
administration, called the attorney-general's failure to
investigate ``inexplicable,'' and questioned her fitness to remain
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Third, and most important, why did the chief of the National
Security Council, Sandy Berger, wait more than a year between
learning about the issue (in April 1996) and telling the president
in general terms (in July 1997)? And why did it take even longer
for the president to hear the details?
</P>
<P>
   In March of this year, Clinton claimed: ``To the best of my
knowledge, no one has said anything to me about any espionage which
occurred by the Chinese against the labs during my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   his was three months after he had received the Cox report.
Either he did not read it, in which case he should have done. Or he
did read it and was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the National Security Council says, he read the executive
summary it had prepared. This says there was proven Chinese nuclear
spying before his presidency; there was proven Chinese spying
during his presidency but against satellite tracking devices, not
nuclear weapons; and there was Chinese nuclear spying during his
presidency but it wasn't proven (the case of Lee, who is now in
retirement outside Los Alamos).
</P>
<P>
   To the White House, it seems, everything depends on the
definition of ``Chinese spying during my presidency.'' To the rest
of the world, such Clintonesque wordplay palls in the face of
massive nuclear theft. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, the comforting conclusion to be drawn from
the Cox report into Chinese spying: America does not find itself
suddenly facing a world-changing event, as it did in the Rosenberg
case (which revealed the secrets of the Manhattan Project to the
Soviet Union in the 1940s) or even during the missile crisis in the
Taiwan Strait in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by a committee headed by Christopher Cox, a
mild Republican congressman from California, revealed that China's
spying has been a long-running campaign, not a sudden incident.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the report is disturbing for three reasons:
because of what it suggests about China's military capability;
because of its timing; and because of what it reveals about
American failures to safeguard nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   These go back many years, but have become considerably worse
during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that China has stolen classified information on
seven nuclear weapons programs, including all the warheads deployed
in America's nuclear armory. It also claims that China has
obtained, by hook or by crook, information on satellite and
submarine guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   The details of precisely which secrets it has got remain
unknown. All the same, at the very least, the range of options
available to Chinese military planners has increased.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cox report says the Chinese are about to test a missile
_ the Dong Feng 31 _ based partly on stolen American technology.
</P>
<P>
   When deployed (which the report says will be in 2002), the DF31
will be the first in a new family of mobile, solid-fuel missile
systems that will make China's nuclear force, which is now on the
level of the Soviet Union's in the 1960s, into something more like
America's in the 1970s: far from parity with the United States now,
but a step up.
</P>
<P>
   Given China's willingness to project force to get its way in
foreign policy, that could have big implications in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither that nor the revelations in the Cox report necessarily
requires a radical change in American policy towards China.
Nevertheless, the report has brought into question parts of
America's policy of ``engagement'' with China _ or at least the way
in which it has been implemented. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The policy has meant, for example, that when a Chinese company
has wanted to buy high-technology goods in the United States, the
presumption was that it would get an export license. That is likely
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Military cooperation is also a dead letter; China has suspended
it anyway in the wake of the Belgrade embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the timing of the report _ just after that event _
will make improving American-Chinese relations even harder than it
would otherwise have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, opponents of China are a strange alliance
of right-wingers in search of a new Cold-War enemy and left-wingers
concerned about human-rights violations and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   They have relatively little support at the political center.
Indignation about the theft of nuclear secrets is widespread and
might provide such support.
</P>

membership of the World Trade Organization (its top priority in
international trade) is doomed. Before the Cox report, the

Clinton's refusal to support China's bid.

the past, trade issues have usually been separated from broader
political ones. Unfortunately, that means that even if China gets

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Drivers on freeways in California's Silicon Valley
were startled to see, last summer, giant billboards exhorting them
to ``upgrade to Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, sponsored by the Minnesota High Tech Council,
sounded desperate, and it was. This year, the council is trying a
subtly different tack: billboards in Minnesota imploring high-tech
workers not to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the point is clear: the state's labor shortage is
acute.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Minnesota plunged to a seasonally adjusted 2.1
percent in April, the lowest ever recorded in the state and the
lowest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis have become a
workers' paradise: unemployment there hit an all-time low of 1.6
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's labor pool is growing at only half the rate it
did in the 1970s. The result is a labor market that is tighter than
at any time since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   As national economic growth sputtered and died in the early
1990s, Minnesota clawed onward. Manufacturing defied national
trends and grew, while service companies sprang up all over the
place.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state therefore lingered a point or so
behind the rest of the country, and, when the time came for the
American economy to reawaken, Minnesota found itself without the
excess capacity the rest of the nation had.
</P>
<P>
   Today, indicators of an ever-tightening labor market are legion.
Companies are offering stock options to every employee, from CEOs
to shipping clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Over loudspeakers in department stores, reminders of special
offers are being replaced by announcements of job openings.
Entry-level wages, as seen on notices papered on storefronts, are
ticking ever upward.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of qualified entry-level workers, some companies
have started using prison labor.
</P>
<P>
   In this workers' market, anyone with a measurable pulse and two
fingers to peck at a keyboard is employable.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have lost their reluctance to ask for better benefits
or more money.
</P>
<P>
   What they have also lost is the desire to join a union. Both
nationally and locally, union power has eroded as non-union
employers offer bonuses to newly hired workers, and thick
wage-and-benefits packages to retain them.
</P>
<P>
   The age of the average union member is approaching 50, which is
near the time when many choose to take their pension.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry, one of the most heavily unionized, is
having particular problems. To keep building sites fully staffed,
unions are strengthening their apprenticeship programs, with some
success: programs for cement masons, pipe fitters and the like are
said to be bursting.
</P>
<P>
   Some unions are recruiting ``non-traditional'' workers (such as
women), and are calling local branches around the country to lure
those who want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   But labor is tight everywhere, and work is plentiful. The call
for new labor has reached immigrants in Honduras and Mexico, from
which a trickle of workers both legal and illegal are travelling
north to find work.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, the Senate voted to let 30,000 more foreign computer
programmers, health professionals and other skilled workers into
the United States to relieve local labor-market shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota they cannot come too soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a February 1998 survey of information-technology companies by
the Minnesota Department of Economic Security, 57 percent of
respondents said they were having trouble finding qualified
workers.
</P>
<P>
   More important, 42 percent said they were having trouble filling
work orders.
</P>
<P>
   If this persists _ and there is every reason to think it will,
especially as telecommunications and information technology become
the twin pillars of this economy _ a shortage of labor may soon
strangle growth.
</P>
<P>
   As for California's high-tech workers, they still seem reluctant
to heed those billboards and move east. It is not just Minnesota's
winters that deter them, but its high income tax.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the state's genuine allurements, such as the beauty
of its lakes, the renowned placidity of its people and its
top-notch public-education system, it has yet to see a big influx
of new, highly skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 net immigration dropped sharply as unemployment
plummeted all across the country. Local economists are now
beginning to worry that the job market may be tight for as long as
the next ten years. &QL;

<P>
   The age of the average union member is approaching 50, which is
near the time when many choose to take their pension.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry, one of the most heavily unionized, is

unions are strengthening their apprenticeship programs, with some
success: programs for cement masons, pipe fitters and the like are
said to be bursting.
</P>
<P>
   Some unions are recruiting ``non-traditional'' workers (such as
women), and are calling local branches around the country to lure

<P>
   On May 18, the Senate voted to let 30,000 more foreign computer

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Drivers on freeways in California's Silicon Valley
were startled to see, last summer, giant billboards exhorting them
to ``upgrade to Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, sponsored by the Minnesota High Tech Council,
sounded desperate, and it was. This year, the council is trying a
subtly different tack: billboards in Minnesota imploring high-tech
workers not to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the point is clear: the state's labor shortage is
acute.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Minnesota plunged to a seasonally adjusted 2.1
percent in April, the lowest ever recorded in the state and the
lowest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis have become a
workers' paradise: unemployment there hit an all-time low of 1.6
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's labor pool is growing at only half the rate it
did in the 1970s. The result is a labor market that is tighter than
at any time since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   As national economic growth sputtered and died in the early
1990s, Minnesota clawed onward. Manufacturing defied national
trends and grew, while service companies sprang up all over the
place.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state therefore lingered a point or so
behind the rest of the country, and, when the time came for the
American economy to reawaken, Minnesota found itself without the
excess capacity the rest of the nation had.
</P>
<P>
   Today, indicators of an ever-tightening labor market are legion.
Companies are offering stock options to every employee, from CEOs
to shipping clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Over loudspeakers in department stores, reminders of special
offers are being replaced by announcements of job openings.
Entry-level wages, as seen on notices papered on storefronts, are
ticking ever upward.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of qualified entry-level workers, some companies
have started using prison labor.
</P>
<P>
   In this workers' market, anyone with a measurable pulse and two

<P>
   Once a western force invaded Kosovo, it would, at least in
theory, have more than enough firepower to prevail over the Serb
forces. But getting NATO's armor inside a territory that is a
natural fortress ringed on all sides by mountains, and doing so
without great loss of life and equipment, would be much harder.
</P>
<P>
   There is simply no easy way for western forces to drive into
Kosovo. Of the neighboring countries, only Albania shows any
enthusiasm for being used as a launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   But the mountain road linking Albania to its embattled cousins
is a logistical nightmare. Without engineering on a huge scale, it
would simply crumble under the weight of a few tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Entering from Macedonia would be physically easier but
politically trickier, since that country is deeply reluctant to be
used as a staging post for war.
</P>
<P>
   The main road from Macedonia to Pristina, Kosovo's capital, is
in decent condition, though it passes through some high gorges and
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   A flatter route connects Macedonia with southeastern Serbia. But
any invasion of Serbia proper, as distinct from Kosovo, would have
to face hostile locals.
</P>
<P>
   All the obvious entry points have been heavily mined, and the
Serb army has dug in as heavily as it can.
</P>
<P>
   How much resistance could the Serb forces actually put up? In
its most detailed report to date, NATO said on May 19 that it had
destroyed 556 pieces of military equipment in Kosovo, of which 312
were tanks, armored cars or big guns.
</P>
<P>
   That, if true, would mean that some 30 percent of the Serbs'
``heavy forces'' in the province had been knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   General Michael Short, the American commander of NATO's air war,
said the other 70 percent could be destroyed or chased out within
two months. But the exact pace of this destruction is impossible to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   NATO claimed exceptional success on May 21, saying it had
knocked out a dozen tanks and as many armored cars. But it was
hampered by bad weather for the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbia's goal is simply to ensure that NATO pays a high
military and human price for any invasion, then it has not yet
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the skepticism of those who doubt that a NATO ground
offensive this summer is feasible was bolstered by this week's
pledge from NATO that it would boost its forces in the region to
50,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   A gradual buildup to those numbers looks much more like a
preparation for a peacekeeping force, to be deployed with Serbia's
consent, than a war-fighting plan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, conventional wisdom holds that the moment for mounting
any sort of intervention in hostile conditions may already be
coming to an end, given that it would take many more weeks to get
the troops and their heavy weapons in place, and winter sets in as
early as October.
</P>
<P>
   But there is just a chance that conventional wisdom may be
wrong, particularly over timing. Some experts argue that it would
take only a couple of weeks for America's 101st Air Assault
Division to fly to Italy and then start ferrying mortars, artillery
and light vehicles to the edge of the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that NATO could occupy two-thirds of Kosovo
quite rapidly, using American Marines and British and French
paratroopers to spearhead an operation in which western forces
might, with luck, lose only 200-500 men.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably true that once the political decision were taken
to make full use of America's support and attack helicopters, along
with the ``steel rain'' of multiple-launched rockets, the Serb
garrisons in Kosovo could be rapidly devastated.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range strike force of American tanks, gunships and
missiles that is building up in Albania, and could easily be
reinforced with units still in Germany, probably frightens Serb
commanders more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   So far, U.S. President Bill Clinton has explicitly forbidden the
use of Apache tank-busting helicopters; but he may be keeping that
option up his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing in the Albania-based force would sharply raise the
stakes all around. Serb armor, now hidden or immobilized to avoid
exposure to air strikes, would presumably reemerge and might
unleash as much firepower as it could before being destroyed or
routed.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces might well abandon all restraint, firing rockets
deep into Albania and Macedonia, in an attempt to horrify and
destabilize those countries, by selecting targets such as refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians trapped inside Kosovo might die in even
greater numbers than hitherto. Civil war might break out in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   If the war in Kosovo is a pain-endurance contest, the Serbs may
not prove to be a pushover. &QL;

   SOFIA _ Unlike several of its neighbors, Bulgaria has been
surprisingly unshy about backing NATO in the war for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Kostov, its center-right prime minister, has let NATO
aircraft fly through a large part of Bulgaria's airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish F-16 fighters, which Greece has refused to allow over
the Aegean, can fly across Bulgaria to attack targets in Yugoslavia
from the east. This, say NATO's planners, weakens Serbia's air
defenses, prepared as they are to repel attacks from across the
Adriatic to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bulgaria may be playing a more dangerous game than other
Balkan states. It has been almost literally caught in the cross
fire. Its capital, Sofia, is less than 50 kilometers (30 miles)
from Bulgaria's border with Serbia, and within range of Serbian
antiaircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   At least half-a-dozen NATO missiles that were meant to hit
Serbian air defenses have strayed off course into Bulgaria _ one
hitting a house in a Sofia suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The war is just as unpopular in Bulgaria as it is in Macedonia
and Greece, which both, however, refuse to let the alliance use
their airspace for combat missions. The Greeks and Macedonians are
also firmly against letting NATO troops move through their
territory to attack the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Over 90 percent of Bulgarians, say pollsters, are against the
war. Moreover, the number of those who want Bulgaria to join NATO
is down, from 60 percent before the war to barely half now.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's feelings for Serbia, however, are far from friendly.
A shared attachment to the Orthodox church, which seems to bind the
Serbs and Greeks together emotionally, counts for little with the
Bulgarians, whose quarrelsome bishops have damaged the church's
image.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bulgars and Serbs have fought on opposite sides in four
wars this century.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before fighting erupted over Kosovo, Kostov annoyed the
Serbs by handing over 150 Soviet-era tanks to Macedonia, which
Serbia's rulers still view as an upstart province rather than an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kostov and Petar Stoyanov, Bulgaria's pro-western
president, who has a big say in defense and foreign affairs, see
the war as a chance to strengthen Bulgaria's bid to join NATO and
the European Union. They were disappointed not to get a timetable
for membership at the alliance's summit in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   They also worry that Albania and Macedonia will soon catch up in
the race to join the EU, though, unlike Bulgaria, neither country
has an association agreement with it that is supposed to precede
eventual membership. Both, however, expect to get one as soon as
the fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
   The war is hurting Bulgaria's economy. Most Bulgarian exports go
through Serbia or along the Danube, now blocked by debris from
bridges bombed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, which was expected to grow by over 5 percent this
year, is now thought unlikely to expand by more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and other western donors have promised $750 million to
support Bulgaria's balance of payments and keep market reforms on
course. But that will probably not prevent many more jobs being
lost in Bulgaria's decrepit factories.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly galling for Kostov because western
businessmen, after years of viewing post-communist Bulgaria as a
disaster, were just beginning to take another look.
</P>
<P>
   The currency has been stable, Kostov has shown that he is
genuine about reform, and an array of state assets were to be sold
off this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as if the only big sale _ to a Greek-Dutch
partnership _ will be that of the state telecoms company; the war
will probably make the price much lower than it would have been.
</P>
<P>
   For Kostov and Bulgaria, a speedy NATO victory in Kosovo is
vital. &QL;

<P>
   LUANDA _ Aid workers in Angola have a hard time suppressing
their bitterness at the nonstop coverage of events in Kosovo as
they struggle to contain their own, equally grim but largely
ignored, disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angola should not become a forgotten emergency,'' says an
exhausted Francesco Strippoli, the director of the World Food
Program (WFP) in Angola. ``This is a very real tragedy of massive
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how massive should soon become clear.
</P>
<P>
   After a week-long tour of the country, a U.N. assessment team is
now back in Rome calculating how many Angolans may starve to death
in the next few months if help is not provided.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the resumption of the civil war between the
Angolan government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels, the Angolan
people are suffering as they have not suffered before, even in 25
years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, hunger is being used as a weapon in this
war.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, peasant farmers stayed on their land while the two
armies battled back and forth around them. Nowadays, rebel soldiers
are forcing them to leave their farms empty-handed, killing them
horribly if they try to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1 million people, about 10 percent of the total
population, have been driven off their land since the fighting
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   They have been herded by UNITA into the government-controlled
cities, which now stand, like besieged islands, surrounded by
hostile UNITA-controlled countryside. The only way out of the towns
is by air: the roads have been turned into impassable death traps
by rebel ambushes and land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' aim, it would seem, is to starve the population into
rebelling against the government.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no sign of such a rebellion. And starvation is
being staved off _ for the moment. Food aid, supplied by the WFP,
is keeping 800,000 people alive. Others are still surviving on
local produce.
</P>
<P>
   The rains this year were exceptionally good; in normal
circumstances, the farmers would now be harvesting bumper crops. In
fact, since so many farmers are being held hostage in the cities,
most of their crops have been stolen by soldiers, burned, or left
to rot. What little has been harvested is being instantly sold or
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's rainy season has now ended. The leaner dry season
started in mid-May. The crops harvested in the rainy season will
last a month or two at best, and nobody has been able to get to the
fields to plant for the next crop.
</P>
<P>
   People are being forced to eat their seed-corn, so that when the
next rainy season starts there will be nothing left to plant.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, an alarmingly large proportion of Angola's
more than 11 million people will be almost entirely dependent on
food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government is pumping all of its considerable oil
earnings into fighting the war, the job of feeding (and housing and
clothing) Angolans falls to the WFP and the aid donors. But the
relief agencies do not have nearly enough money to meet Angola's
constantly rising demands.
</P>
<P>
   In their annual appeal for Angola last autumn, before the
resumption of all-out war, all the U.N. agencies working there,
including the WFP, asked for $67 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the donors _ rich countries' governments that are tired
of pouring money into Angola _ have come up with only $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of Angolans in need of urgent assistance
has tripled and the cost of distributing food and other aid has
doubled, since, with the roads blocked, everything has to be
transported by air.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s 1999 appeal is to be raised to $110 million and the
WFP has launched a separate appeal for $8.8 million, solely for air
transport.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the unlikely event of the donors responding quickly to
these appeals, the situation will remain perilous.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA has already shown that it can close the airports of
provincial cities by shelling as and when it chooses. It is
prepared to attack cargo planes as well: at least six have been
shot down since the war restarted. If the rebels bring down just
one WFP plane, the whole food-aid operation will be grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, the question is asked why more is not being done
to bring an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Angola returned to fighting while still being monitored by a
$1.5 billion U.N. peacekeeping mission. The peacekeepers failed to
notice that UNITA was using the four-year lull in hostilities to
rearm and retrain its forces.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's mandate was finally ended in February by the
Security Council, which made vague promises about replacing it with
a small political mission.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects of the two sides talking to each other are poor. The
Angolan government has vowed never to negotiate with Savimbi again,
citing the fact that he has broken every peace promise he has ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   But does it have an alternative? The rebels have proved
surprisingly strong on the battlefield, defeating the government's
forces, in both conventional and guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the government's promised dry-season offensive were to
succeed in wiping out UNITA's conventional forces (itself
improbable), the rebels would still be able to use guerrilla
tactics to make the country ungovernable.
</P>
<P>
   Angolans, meanwhile, will be facing starvation. &QL;

NATO: DON'T READ TOO MUCH INTO THIS FICTIONAL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VYSKOV, Czech Republic _ Deployed on a weeklong military
exercise, soldiers from 20 NATO countries and allies are seeking to
end a hypothetical ethnic conflict and create a buffer zone to
resettle thousands of refugees forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Any resemblance between the exercise and the warfare taking
place two countries away is purely coincidental, insist officials
at the NATO camp in this eastern Czech town.
</P>
<P>
   Also coincidental, they maintain, is the exercise's possible
application for the broad peacekeeping mission envisioned by NATO
at the end of the Kosovo conflict, now more than 70 days old.
</P>
<P>
   On this Moravian hillside base, through Friday, 2,000 soldiers
are learning how to translate United Nations directives into
military operations, set up an international peacekeeping mission
in a hostile land, and meld 24 languages into one (English).
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no relation whatsoever to the situation in Kosovo,''
NATO spokesman Andy Wallis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Exercise Cooperative Guard 1999, planned 18 months ago,
according to NATO, is centered on a fictional mission on a
peninsula called Gem, where the armies of the countries of Coral
and Topaz have bombed themselves into rubble. After four months, a
cease-fire was declared and UN observers sent in.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is up to NATO to create a buffer zone between the two
hostile nations and patrol the resettlement of ethnic Topazians
into an enclave within Coral.
</P>
<P>
   The public information officers are even instructed on dealings
with the Topazian and Coral journalists. One has a free press and
the other is state-run, Wallis said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Vyskov camp, men and women of all ranks dress in
similar green or brown camouflage fatigues. Stripes and medals
differ from country to country. The general rule is to only salute
anyone from your army that you recognize as high-ranking, Wallis
said. Otherwise it could get confusing.
</P>
<P>
   The combined joint task force headquarters, the heart of the
operation, is housed in a dormlike room with camouflage netting
overhead and NASA-style computers across the front wall. Romanian,
Belgian, British, and German officials confer over desktop PCs,
deciphering made-up tasks or the positions of troops in a fake
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would be asked to deploy anywhere, this would be the
setup we'd use,'' said US Army Lieutenant Colonel John Oliver, of
Killen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Across campus, members of the Eurocorps wrestle with English
abbreviations in a NATO military order. Created in 1991, Eurocorps
began as a French and German initiative to launch peacekeeping
missions throughout Europe. Now composed of five countries (with
the addition of Spain, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Eurocorps is
participating for the first time in an English-language NATO
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no problem talking to someone in English,'' said Spanish
Major Jose Pardo de Santayana. ``But if you receive orders in
English, it's a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Air Operations Center, in an oversized white trailer,
about 70 men and women plan and track air missions and on
wall-sized computer screens. The center is a smaller version of the
air center in Vicenza, Italy, that directs the NATO air raids over
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing games here. We're assuming a challenging
situation, which could be done for real,'' said German Lieutenant
General Peter Vogler, the air center's commander.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added: ``But this was planned a while ago. Not for
Kosovo.''

<P>
   Leave your job, log on, click and _ hey, presto! _ you too can
turn into the newest pariah of America's stock markets, an
electronic day trader.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, it was Wall Street's takeover barbarians. Today it
is the amateurs in jeans and sneakers who sit in front of a
computer and trade 40-50 times in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did with the Gordon Gekko types in the 1980s, Wall
Street's great and good are demonizing day traders, accusing them
of distorting the stock market and causing volatility in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), does not even dignify day traders as speculators,
let alone investors: he says they are gamblers. And that, as Keynes
once said, is not what the stock market should be about, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the great and good are wrong. Electronic day traders are
merely the most fanatical of a new breed of investors, born of
regulatory changes and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In general, America's 5 million-odd people who buy and sell
shares on the Internet are a good thing. The stock market has been
democratized; Granny can do what was once reserved for boys in red
braces.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has freedom bred recklessness. Most online investors trade
only a little more than they did offline, and extra trades have
meant a more liquid market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also driven down trading commissions, to the benefit
of all investors.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core day traders, of whom there are fewer than 100,000,
also help the market.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite strategy is to scrutinize quotes offered by
market-makers (professionals who publish prices at which they will
buy or sell shares). If this uncovers a market-maker who is slow to
react when rivals change prices, the day traders attack. But this
encourages market-makers to be alert, resulting in more efficient
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as day traders must complete their trades quickly,
they often offer keener prices than market-makers. This narrows the
difference between best buy and sell prices, giving all investors a
better deal at the expense of intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   Against these benefits stands one big accusation: that day
traders who rush in and out of a company's shares make prices more
volatile. Actually, academic studies have found little evidence
that this is true, even for Internet shares, in which online
investors account for an unusually large slice of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than causing high volatility, day traders, who live or
die by exploiting short-term price movements, may be attracted to
shares that are volatile for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Internet shares, such volatility mainly reflects massive
disagreement among investors about what, if anything, the shares
are really worth.
</P>
<P>
   As for gambling, some day traders are doubtless in over their
heads. That is regrettable, but it is not a good reason to attack
day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, for people with a gambling addiction, if it were not
shares, it would be something else. And at least in the stock
market, unlike a lottery or a casino, the average punter is not
mathematically certain to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Most day traders would probably be better off putting their
money in a fund that tracked the stock market index. But that
applies equally to most professional equity-fund managers, who also
fail on average to beat the market index.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders may be mauled if today's high share prices prove to
be a stock market bubble. But they would not be the only investors
left looking foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with their expertise at trading fast and often, when the
conflagration comes, they may prove fleeter of foot than the big,
staid institutional investors who have been bad-mouthing them.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's great and good would do better to remind all
investors that being in the stock market at all is, at today's
prices, something of a gamble. &QL;

 &HT;    Payne's foundation reveals gifts given to IOC members
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billy Payne's private Olympic foundation revealed for
the first time today that it gave dozens of International Olympic
Committee members expensive gifts and donated $25,000 to a South
African anti-apartheid organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the U.S. House Commerce Committee, the foundation
provided a list of more than three dozen gifts that exceeded the
IOC's $200 limit, including a $948 carburetor kit for Bashir
Mohamed Attarabulsi from Libya and a live English bulldog for the
late Cuban member Manuel Gonzalez Guerra.
</P>
<P>
   The 38 gifts detailed by the foundation totaled $15,165 and
included many glass and crystal sculptures, clothing, a jewelry
box, a ruby pin, luggage and a set of surgical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation provided extensive
documentation in the report that was requested by the House
committee, primarily dealing with cash payments, scholarships and
excessive gift exchanges during its bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely hope that our report will demonstrate that
Atlanta won the 1996 Olympic Games fairly,'' said Payne, who
created the foundation in 1987 to bid for the Games and remains its
chairman. ``Although we occasionally exceeded the IOC's guidelines,
our work was always done with honest intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Young, who served as co-chairman of the foundation during
the bid, said the anti-apartheid donation to an organization called
the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee was important
because that country was preparing to rejoin the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many leaders of Atlanta's bid group were passionate about what
South Africa meant to the Olympic Games,'' he said, ``and our
financial support for its efforts was a small means by which we
could share our passion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the donation, South Africa had no representation
on the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also acknowledged spending $14,099 for special
tennis training for two players from the Republic of Congo at
expelled IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga's request.
</P>
<P>
   They also funded tuition and housing for a swimmer from
Mauritius who came and trained at the Dynamo swim club in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus, Tiffany &AMP; Co. and Frabel Gallery appeared to be
the favorite shopping spots. A dozen sculptures alone came from
Frabel and ranged in price from $200 to $424.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haggman, the IOC member from Finland who resigned when
allegations of bribery erupted over the Salt Lake City bid for the
2002 Winter Olympics last fall, was a big beneficiary of the
foundation's largesse. Haggman received clothing from Rich's and
British Passage totaling $937.66 in value.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hodler, the Swiss IOC member who elevated the bribery
scandal to an international crisis when he accused other candidate
cities of influence peddling, was also on the gift list. He
received a Steuben crystal skier from Neiman Marcus that cost
$457.24.
</P>
<P>
   IOC executive board member Kim Un-Yong of South Korea, who
received a severe reprimand when it was revealed the Salt Lake
bidders funded a job for his son, took home a $616.25 Tiffany
jewelry box from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts weren't the only excess detailed by the foundation. The
group facilitated the donation of a used MARTA bus to the city of
Lima, Peru. Backed by an Atlanta City Council resolution, the
foundation worked with the Peruvian IOC delegate, Ivan Dibos, to
secure the bus. The Del Taco company reimbursed the foundation
$10,310 to finance the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the foundation said that it did not make any
direct cash payments or offer scholarships to IOC members or their
families. The group did pay some minor medical expenses for IOC
members while in Atlanta, including a $480 bill to fix IOC member
Guirandou N'Diaye's broken tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our review to date, we are unaware of any action on
behalf of IOC members or on the part of GAAF that cast doubt on the
integrity of the bidding process for the 1996 Games,'' the
foundation wrote in its report.
</P>
<P>
   The report was sent to Rep. Thomas Bliley (R-Va.), chairman of
the House Committee on Commerce, and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.),
chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, which
launched the inquiry into the Atlanta bid last month.
</P>
<P>
   Upton said he planned to send congressional investigators to
Atlanta to examine records related to the bid contained in the
1,400 boxes of documents housed at the Atlanta History Center.

 &HT;    Payne's foundation reveals gifts given to IOC members
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billy Payne's private Olympic foundation revealed for
the first time today that it gave dozens of International Olympic
Committee members expensive gifts and donated $25,000 to a South
African anti-apartheid organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the U.S. House Commerce Committee, the foundation
provided a list of more than three dozen gifts that exceeded the
IOC's $200 limit, including a $948 carburetor kit for Bashir
Mohamed Attarabulsi from Libya and a live English bulldog for the
late Cuban member Manuel Gonzalez Guerra.
</P>
<P>
   The 38 gifts detailed by the foundation totaled $15,165 and
included many glass and crystal sculptures, clothing, a jewelry
box, a ruby pin, luggage and a set of surgical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation provided extensive
documentation in the report that was requested by the House
committee, primarily dealing with cash payments, scholarships and
excessive gift exchanges during its bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely hope that our report will demonstrate that
Atlanta won the 1996 Olympic Games fairly,'' said Payne, who
created the foundation in 1987 to bid for the Games and remains its
chairman. ``Although we occasionally exceeded the IOC's guidelines,
our work was always done with honest intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Young, who served as co-chairman of the foundation during
the bid, said the anti-apartheid donation to an organization called
the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee was important
because that country was preparing to rejoin the Olympic movement.
</P>

A SALUTE TO A POET WHO WASN'T JUST A POET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Never mind the war in the Balkans and the crisis in the
Kremlin. Forget about those election-year campaign posters. The
face gazing out from ubiquitous billboards and massive wall
posters, from vodka labels and matchbook covers, is not that of
some contemporary politician, but of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's
most celebrated poet.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring economic woes _ if just for a day _ Moscow's cash-poor
government has shelled out $4 million to celebrate Pushkin's gala
bicentennial birthday on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A poet in Russia is more than just a poet, and Pushkin is the
single greatest literary figure in a culture renowned for its
writers; a hero of his time whose lofty status has been recognized
by the czars, the Communists, and the leaders of post-Soviet
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Like William Shakespeare and English, Pushkin is the father of
Russian literature, a writer of ingenious verse who paved the way
for the Russian novelists whose names are more familiar to American
readers _ Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev, and Feodor Dostoyevsky.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shakespeare, Pushkin did not need a hit movie to get his
career back on track, not in a land where the exotic details of his
life _ his carousing youth in St. Petersburg, his clashes with the
czar's authority and periods of exile, his death in 1837 in a duel
with his wife's French suitor _ are common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   While many Americans struggle to read the Bard's English without
a glossary, many Russians easily recite from memory the works of
Pushkin. Pushkin is popular in Russia today not just because of his
dazzling technical innovations in an array of genres, from odes and
epistles to fairy tales and satiric prose, but because many
Russians believe he is still their best national spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks a simple language we can understand,'' said Pyotr
Paliyevsky, a professor at Moscow's Institute of World Literature.
``Pushkin says many different, contradictory things, but they are
all right and we can understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say that Pushkin in the early 19th century was able to
articulate the main conflicts of Russian society to this day:
Russia's relationship with the West and the tension between
religious and secular life, between the powerless and the powerful,
between individuals and the state. The 19th century novelist
Nikolai Gogol, himself a keen observer of the Russian Zeitgeist,
once hailed Pushkin as the ``Russian man of 200 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the mystery of the Russian soul,'' said
Andrei Chernov, a Moscow poet and Pushkin specialist. ``Pushkin
holds the secret to that mystery. He is the one who wrote the code
of our soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as President Boris N. Yeltsin put it, in an awkward
formulation that earned jeers for clashing with the poet's rule of
pristine syntax, ``Pushkin is our everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's 200th birthday bash approaches, Russian cultural
life has been dominated by events dedicated to Pushkin: theater
festivals, academic conferences, poetry readings, stamp-collecting
conventions, jewelers' competitions, all of it culminating this
week in a gala of parties, parades, and balls.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and magazines have run front-page stories about the
exact location of Pushkin's birth in Moscow in 1799, and the
details surrounding his death after his duel with the French
nobleman d'Antes in 1837 in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   One radio station plays ``interviews'' with characters from
Pushkin short stories, fairy tales, and plays. Russian Public
Television shows people on the street reciting from Pushkin's most
famous work, his novel-in-verse ``Eugene Onegin.''
</P>
<P>
   The station also has a TV quiz show ``Oh, That Pushkin,'' where
contestants send in answers to questions found on the wrappers of
Pushkin candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the prose of Gogol, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky, Pushkin's
best poetic work is not easy to translate (perhaps fitting for a
man who denigrated translators as ``the postal horses of
enlightenment.'') Pushkin is better known in the West as the author
whose ``Boris Godunov'' became a famous opera, and whose ``Mozart
and Salieri'' formed the nucleus of the Hollywood film ``Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pushkin remains accessible to Russians, something that
threatens to turn him into the country's first victim of corporate
exploitation. Coca-Cola is running an ad that uses verses from one
of Pushkin's famous romantic lyrics, ``I remember the moment.''
British Airways quotes the poet's comments on shopping in London.
Moscow casinos are playing up Pushkin's short story on gambling,
``The Queen of Spades.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have rushed to get in on the act. Former prime
minister and current Balkans envoy Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, not
known as a literary critic, wrote a preface to the latest edition
of Pushkin's complete works.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's populist mayor, Yury Luzhkov, has hung patriotic
Pushkin slogans all over town and has made sure that every
storefront displays the poet's portrait. The trouble when
politicians try to embrace Pushkin is that Pushkin contradicts
himself. Was he the fiery patriot who exhorted, ``Not for anything
would I like to change fatherlands, or have another history than
the one God gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   Or was Pushkin's real attitude more ambivalent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I, of course, regard my country with the utmost contempt, from
top to bottom, but I don't like it when a foreigner shares this
feeling with me,'' Pushkin wrote, in words mirroring the attitude
of many Russians today.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to attach an ideology to Pushkin is a problem the
Soviet regime ran into in the 1930s, when it tried to turn the poet
into a ``tool for further cultural growth and development.''
Pushkin, with his frequent digressions into fantasy, farce, and
parody, refuses to be cast solely in such a utilitarian light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try as they might, the Communists couldn't make Pushkin a
Soviet poet,'' said Nikolai Alexandrov, who runs a show called the
Pushkin Project on Ekho Moskvy radio. ``No matter how much the
authorities try to co-opt Pushkin now, as the symbol of democracy,
or nationalism, or orthodoxy, they cannot. Pushkin is still alive
and he's still a good writer. You can't pigeonhole him, because he
speaks for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin, like any literary figure in the 1990s, risks being made
obsolete by growing indifference to poetry in the face of pop
culture, video games, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Public Opinion Foundation suggested that
fewer Russians were reading Pushkin _ only 50 percent of 1,500
adults said they had picked up Pushkin since finishing school,
according to the foundation, and only 28 percent had turned to the
poet in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whenever a new Pushkin volume is released, it sells out
immediately,'' Alexandrov countered.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars fear that Pushkinmania is detracting from the
poet's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Pushkinist, I am disgusted by this anniversary,'' Chernov
said. He said the resources devoted to the holiday could have been
better spent upgrading fire safety at the 150-year wood hut where
Pushkin's original manuscripts are kept.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as too many holidays,'' writer Lev
Rubenshtein commented in a cover story in last week's issue of the
news magazine Itogi. ``So let's sit down at the table. Pour a
drink. Raise a toast. To what? Who cares? To everything. To our
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin could not have said it better.

A VOICE THAT CARRIES THROUGHOUT SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ In Tim Modise's voice you can hear how he would
play the trumpet. It rises from deep within, where the bittersweet
memories of a ghetto youth churn, a scratchy scat tumbling along
its own improvised scale, unhurried and melodic.
</P>
<P>
   For all its character, though, his voice is not what captivates
about South Africa's most prominent radio talk-show host. In fact,
in a country where diverse races are still wary of strangers, some
find it jarring, too ``African'' for the sheltered ear of whites.
What gets the listener in the end is the laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Modise laughs and white women beg him to run for president.
He laughs and black men feel a warm vibe of brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Modise laughs, light and disarmingly, he gets South
Africans _ voting Wednesday in their second election since
apartheid's end _ talking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is that rare broadcaster who appeals across the board,''
said Tony Lancaster, who manages current affairs shows on SAfm, the
public radio station of South Africa where Modise hosts a morning
call-in show. ``Whites don't find him threatening. Blacks identify
with his sense of humor. And there is an intellectual element at
the base of his work. He is a pro to the hilt.''
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in black radio, Modise (the last two syllables rhyme
with ``he say'') spent most of a decade breaking through the doors
of South Africa's white-run South African Broadcasting Corp. (SABC)
at the same time Nelson Mandela and others were tearing down the
political structures of the apartheid edifice. Now he is
ubiquitous, and represents the country's best hope for saving a
public network that for decades served as the mouthpiece for
minority rule and which is now struggling to compete for black
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic and unpretentious, Modise hosts two current affairs
television shows and writes a weekly newspaper column on politics
and the economy. In his free time _ and there isn't much of it _ he
travels on his own self-styled lecture circuit, sharing his
insights with communities and interest groups ``to keep the dream
alive,'' as he put it in a recent interview. Two weeks ago he flew
to London to urge business leaders not to lose faith as South
Africa continues its postapartheid transformation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is talk radio that Modise loves most and does best. Two
years ago the SABC put him behind the mike of a flagging two-hour
late-afternoon news program. He more than doubled its listenership.
Now the masters of public broadcasting hope he can turn the same
trick again, and recently bumped a white male host for Modise on a
coveted 90-minute morning call-in show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inherited a station that was dominated by a particular
group of white South Africans,'' said Thoraya Pandy, producer of PM
Live, the afternoon show Modise hosted before moving to the
morning. ``The biggest problem at the SABC is making a significant
shift from the past. We have to overhaul the entire thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to know for sure if Modise is changing the
complexion of the morning audience. Many of his callers are black,
but he's only been in the new time slot for two months and no
audience survey has been done.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no denying that, like a strong shot of espresso,
Modise has things hopping to an upbeat African tempo. The old show
started with a genteel signature tune of strings and brass. ``The
Tim Modise Show'' begins with street banter. Over the chaotic
sounds of an open-air market, a man shouts lyrically, ``Hey big
mama, what are you doing in the ghetto,'' his voice dissolving into
unabashed riffs of township jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something that would create an atmosphere, set things
in motion,'' Modise said of the song, Hugh Masekela's ``The Boys
Are Doing It.''
</P>
<P>
   Modise thrives in the freewheeling format, which allows him to
spar with callers and studio guests for as long as he pleases. He
coaxes and prods _ sometimes serious, sometimes whimsical, always
in control and acutely informed. He seldom goes for the jugular but
never lets a politician off the hook. His whole manner seems to
say, ``Our time has come; let's make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a long way to go in this country,'' he said over
tea and muffins after a recent show. ``Decision makers speak to a
script; you know where they are coming from. But the general public
_ we're not one nation yet. By opening up the forum people can
learn from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modise grew up in Ga-Rankuwa, a dilapidated township outside
Pretoria. Even as a boy he had a precocious instinct for the mike.
He once did a mock commentary of a rugby match in English class,
improvising and evoking the nuances of the game despite never
having seen it played. His schooling went as far as the first year
at Fort Hare, a black university, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But those were turbulent days of antiapartheid action, and
student protests led to the institution being closed. Modise had
been studying communications, and when he returned home, a friend
found him a job as a production assistant with 702, a radio news
station operating at the time from inside Bophuthatswana, a black
homeland established by the apartheid government as nominally
independent and therefore free to hire nonwhites.
</P>
<P>
   He became a full-time journalist for the first time in 1985,
reporting from Bophuthatswana for the SABC. The notoriously
pro-apartheid station cracked open its doors, he said, ``because it
needed blacks to work the townships and homelands.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he left SABC to join Radio Metro, the first
commercial station managed by and aired for blacks. And that's
where his subversive attempts to transform South African
broadcasting began in earnest. The state forbid Metro from
discussing politics on the air, but now and then Modise would float
a question between songs. Next he started a talk show on consumer
rights with Bulelani Ngcuke, who would become the first national
director of public prosecutions under Mandela's government.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States went to war with Iraq in 1991, Modise and
his Metro colleagues took a chance and created a current-affairs
talk show to keep blacks informed. They called it ``Jungle Fever.''
The country's main black paper, The Sowetan, threw its editorial
backing behind the show, and by the time they turned their focus to
local events, such as the nascent talks between the apartheid
government and the African National Congress, there was little the
state could do to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Modise's career has soared. He has won numerous
local and international awards, reported for the BBC in London, and
become South Africa's most celebrated broadcaster _ black or white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk shows were unknown to us, because whites had a view of
the world that didn't coincide with what blacks saw,'' said Aggrey
Klaaste, editor of The Sowetan. ``Then along came this bright young
black man who spoke our language, taking a lead in the direction of
self-expression. He would talk and then we'd give the issue space
in our next day's paper. It was all about nation building.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As easygoing as he is on air, Modise is surprisingly
businesslike in person. He reads avidly and has a keen interest in
economics. The big guns of South Africa's ruling class line up to
be on his show. It is evident, watching the way he relates to his
guests, and they to him, that Modise is a player _ a vital part of
the new discourse in his country.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes before a show the other morning, Modise walked
in slower and heavier on his feet than usual. He'd been in a car
crash a few nights before and was still off balance. He looked
tired as he sat down behind the mike. When his signature song faded
out and he began flipping through the morning papers on air, as he
does to start every show, he suddenly perked up. He saw a story
about a group in the United States calling for American women to
refrain from crossing their legs for a day.
</P>
<P>
   He read part of the story aloud. He invited calls. ``This is not
really a tongue-in-cheek kind of discussion,'' he said, his sense
of irony and his laugh awakening. ``This is a sort of legs-crossed
type of discussion. Why do you suppose women in the States should
spend an entire day not crossing their legs? Let's talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things started rolling. Modise hit his stride. When his guest
showed up, a leader from a minor political party contesting
Wednesday's elections, the discussion shifted to heavier topics:
abortion, the death penalty, the government's performance over the
past five years. The calls kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work keeps me going,'' he said after the show. ``It makes
me feel alive.''

DOCUMENTARY ON HOMOSEXUAL ISSUES IN SCHOOLS RAISES RUCKUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Debra Chasnoff cringed as she heard Pat Robertson launch into a
fiery speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention decrying
the damage homosexuals were doing to America's moral fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to be done, Chasnoff thought, to counter the
strident anti-gay rhetoric being virulently promoted by Robertson
and his sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Her weapon of choice was what she knew best _ film.
</P>
<P>
   What Chasnoff, an Academy Award winner, finally came up with was
``It's Elementary,'' and it has opened up a vicious new front in
the battle between gay advocates and conservative religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   While the film, which focuses on raising gay issues in school,
was controversial even before it was released in 1996 and became
widely used in school districts nationwide, the level of vitriol is
mounting now that it is scheduled to be broadcast this month on
nearly 100 public television stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this is the Joe Camel of the homosexual movement,
but instead of teaching kids to smoke they are teaching kids to
enter into a behavior that could take 30 years off their life,''
said Janet Folger, national director of the Center for Reclaiming
America, an outreach of Coral Ridge Ministries, a conservative
group based in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask me how to put together a manipulative
campaign that indoctrinates children in the homosexual agenda,
`It's Elementary' would be it,'' added Folger, whose criticisms are
typical of those leveled by conservatives at the film as it edges
closer to gaining a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, which its makers say is aimed at educators,
takes cameras into six elementary and middle schools to show what
happens when teachers raise the subject of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   It prominently features a discussion on gays at the private
Cambridge Friends School, including a schoolwide gay pride assembly
in which a gym teacher announces his homosexuality to the applause
and cheers of students.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors denounce the film as presenting a one-sided view of
homosexuality that takes a gratuitous slap at Christianity,
portraying Christians as violent oppressors of gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue of being open-minded,'' said Wendy Wright, a
spokeswoman for Concerned Women for America, a Washington
organization whose mission statement includes promoting ``biblical
values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our kids to be open-minded about alcohol, drugs,
or any other kind of unhealthy behavior,'' she said. ``It is not in
the best interest of children, families, or society to accept
homosexual activity as normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the film, which has been used in about 200 school
districts and 500 university teacher training programs, say ``It's
Elementary'' is a crucial resource to combat homophobia by
preventing stereotypes from taking hold among schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay and lesbian people exist, and they have a right to the
same safety and respect all of us have,'' said Nancy DiMella,
health education coordinator for Newton public schools, which use
``It's Elementary'' to train teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The film's makers say the documentary's major opposition has
come from religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the planned television broadcast of the film has raised the
stakes for conservative groups who view the film as part of a
campaign by gay activists to gain broader sympathy in society.
</P>
<P>
   WGBX &UR;  &LR; in Boston, one of at least 90 public television stations
planning to broadcast the documentary, has logged dozens of
telephone calls in recent weeks from detractors and supporters of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   That's rare, station officials, because the film does not even
air until June 18. ``It's not typical for there to be this kind of
controversy ahead of time,'' said Beth Potier, a WGBX spokeswoman.
``It's definitely on our radar screen as a show that brought with
it strong feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Several conservative Christian groups have mounted a massive
campaign attacking ``It's Elmentary'' and trying to prevent public
stations from airing the documentary. About 50 stations are still
weighing whether to broadcast the show, Chasnoff said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter urging members to mobilize against the airing of
``It's Elementary,'' Beverly LaHaye, chairwoman of Concerned Women
for America, describes the film as a ``major new effort to recruit
innocent children into the tragically destructive homosexual
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Chasnoff, who won an Academy Award in 1991 for a documentary on
nuclear weapons production, bristles at the attacks, saying they
are led by conservative groups creating the same climate of
intolerance that ``It's Elementary'' seeks to counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as indoctrination when we inform kids that
saying `faggot' on the playground is being disrespectful to an
entire community,'' said Chasnoff, in a recent phone interview from
her San Francisco production office. ``I think everyone would like
their kids to have the tools to function in a multicultural society
that includes gay and lesbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides letter-writing campaigns, opponents of ``It's
Elementary'' have produced and released their own videos rebutting
the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   One of the charges leveled in videos by the American Family
Association and Coral Ridge Ministries is that ``It's Elementary''
starts with the assumption that homosexuality is inborn. These
groups contend that plenty of gays have become heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific proof that one is born gay,'' said
Yvette Cantu, a policy analyst with the Family Research Council in
Washington who describes herself as a former lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   But Chasnoff said exploring the roots of homosexuality was not
the film's point. ``This was not intended to be a journalistic
piece of work,'' Chasnoff said. ``We wanted to make an uplifting,
inspiring film that showed people something maybe they had never
seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators, including Bob Chase, president of the National
Education Association, the country's largest teachers union, say
``It's Elementary'' has helped schools and teachers address a topic
that most schools have had a difficult time dealing with precisely
because it is so divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any issues we should back away from
when there are needs of students involved,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film takes on the issue of homophobia head-on and makes it
apparent that children are pretty receptive and pretty open to a
variety of ways of living,'' said Steven Luz-Alterman, assistant
professor of education at Tufts University, where ``It's
Elementary'' is used in several education classes.
</P>
<P>
   DiMella said she is not surprised the film has provoked such a
firestorm. ``From my view, homophobia is the one last form of
discrimination that is still endemic in our culture, and any time
an insitution _ in this case schools _ wants to rid itself of that
bias, you're going to come up against entrenched homophobia.''

   ``Exegi Monumentum'' is one of the most famous works by Russian
poet Alexander Pushkin. This translation is from Ernest J.
Simmons's 1937 biography, ``Pushkin.''
</P>
<P>
   I've raised my monument, unwrought by human skill;
</P>
<P>
   The people's path to it will not be overgrown,
</P>
<P>
   And its rebellious head will tower higher still
</P>
<P>
   Than Alexander's shaft of stone.
</P>
<P>
   I shall not die _ my spirit in the sacred lyre,
</P>
<P>
   My ashes will survive and still escape the flame _
</P>
<P>
   I shall be great in this sub-lunar world entire,
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The Kalmyk, friend of steppes unsung.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people I shall long be held a sage,
</P>
<P>
   Since I awakened with my lyre some tender feeling,
</P>
<P>
   Because I honored freedom in my cruel age
</P>
<P>
   And summoned favor for the kneeling.
</P>
<P>
   So to the will of God, O Muse, show reverence,
</P>
<P>
   Not fearing an offense or asking for the crown,
</P>
<P>
   Accepting praise or blame with full indifference,
</P>

TWO GRADUATIONS; TWO APPROACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Exemplifying the ideological chasm that separates them,
economic titans Alan Greenspan and Robert Reich next week will
deliver dueling commencement addresses on opposite sides of the
Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board will climb
the stairs of Memorial Church in Cambridge to face Harvard
University's class of 1999. That same day, the former labor
secretary will speak to graduates of the training program for the
homeless run by a shelter, the Pine Street Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one side of the river you have people beginning what are,
in the main, sort of fancy careers _ lives of privilege,'' said
Erik Butler, Pine Street Inn president. ``On this side of the river
you have people redeeming lost lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a supreme commencement matchup that contrasts the world's
richest university with a homeless shelter. It features a legendary
inflation-fighter who has helped steer the economy through the
longest period of peacetime growth in history against a a
self-described champion of working people and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year that the Pine Street Inn has held its
commencement exercises on the same day as Harvard's, though last
year's occurrence was a coincidence. ``We decided, why not do it
again?'' Butler asked. He said the yin-yang aspects of the
simultaneous ceremonies appealed to him in a ``wry sort of way.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, graduates clad in gowns or robes and traditional
mortarboard caps will march to music played by a live band. At Pine
Street, a microphone propped next to a boom box will provide
inspiration, and grads will be wearing suits and dresses donated
from the thrift shop _ no caps and gowns. ``We're a little lower on
the circumstance than Harvard,'' said Butler. ``But we do pretty
well on pomp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pine Street Inn picked Reich as a speaker before Harvard
selected his ideological opposite.
</P>
<P>
   N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor of economics, said he
would be hard pressed to find two mainstream political figures from
the Clinton administration with such polar economic viewpoints.
``The big question in economics is what is the role of government:
should it be a large or small role? It's clear that Reich is a
believer in a much larger, activist government and that Greenspan
is a believer in a more modest government role.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, who left the administration in 1997, frequently found
himself at odds with deficit-hawks, led by former treasury
secretary Robert Rubin and Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Locked in the Cabinet,'' Reich portrays Greenspan
as the real power in Washington, whose control over short-term
interest rates is the single most important governmental lever
affecting the US economy, with a crucial influence on whether
Americans have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tongue in cheek, Reich describes the things he wishes he'd said
to Greenspan at a 1993 lunch meeting if he'd had the guts.
</P>
<P>
   Reich: ``What's your purpose in life?''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan: ``To stamp out inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich: ``Even if that means high unemployment?''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan: ``You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich: ``Even if it means drastic cuts in federal programs that
help average working people and the poor?''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan: ``Absolutely . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In Reich's imagination, the fanciful scene ends with the two men
exchanging epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Reich: ``Well you can take your crummy lunch and cram it, you
robber baron pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan: ``Go suck a pickle, you Bolshevik dwarf.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, both Greenspan and Reich are more restrained.
Indeed, few expect rhetorical fireworks when Greenspan gives his
afternoon address in front of the throngs in Tercentenary Theatre.
Nonetheless, when Greenspan talks, the financial reporters who
trail him at all his public appearances will parse each of his
utterances for significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty rare that he says anything dramatic,'' said
Manikiw. ``Usually his job is to sound serious and cautious. He
doesn't want to get people riled up. That's one of the reasons he
sounds opaque.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, on the other hand, doesn't have to worry about upsetting
markets. He said he hadn't decided what he would say to the 77 Pine
Street Inn graduates of training programs in computers, culinary
arts, and commercial cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to preach to them,'' said Reich, a Brandeis
University professor. ``I don't want to take advantage of the fact
that Alan Greenspan is at Harvard.``
</P>
<P>
   But Reich said he might not be able to resist mentioning the Fed
chairman. ``The Fed at its last meeting decided to announce a bias
toward raising rates. If they do that, the people who are leaving
Pine Street, who have lost their jobs, are going to have a much
tougher time entering the job market. You can all but write them
off in terms of their getting a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said he isn't worried about the fates of Harvard graduates
if the Federal Reserve raises rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll do just fine in this new economy,'' he said.

A NEW DAY FOR THE IRISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DINGLE, Ireland _ Some of the rotting trawlers lashed to the
town landing look so decrepit you'd think they'd sink if not for
the lines holding them prisoner to the shore.
</P>
<P>
   But the tourist has replaced the fish as the cash crop of the
new Ireland. Ireland is hot. On the same weekend that Bruce
Springsteen prepared for a Dublin stadium concert, a Japanese woman
drove into this old fishing town.
</P>
<P>
   An English language instructor for a Tokyo high-tech firm, she'd
taken a week's vacation to fly to Amsterdam, then Shannon, for five
days of bouncing around the hilly peninsula that pointed the way
west for hundreds of thousands of emigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ireland is seen as clean, safe, and, if not cheap, at
least not as expensive as high-end touring in Paris or London,
foreign tourists and the hard currency they bring with them have
become an important component of the Celtic Tiger's staple diet.
</P>
<P>
   The overall European economy is gimpy, and the NATO war over
Kosovo is not helping, but Ireland, long the sick man of Europe, is
belting along like a Clancy Brothers tune.
</P>
<P>
   Housing costs in the republic are up 20 percent in a year, and
with mortgage rates down to 4 percent, real estate speculation is
in full flood. The peace process in Ulster is bogged down in the
kind of retrograde recriminations that made Northern Ireland for
decades the Balkans of the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtic Tiger has developed a taste for high living. The
Irish workforce is literate and well-educated; Ireland is easy to
get to, spotted between the European land mass and the United
States. The government is tax-friendly. So there has been a surge
in high-tech employment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Miami-based Bankers Insurance Group announced it
will expand its operations in a new round-the-clock Cork plant that
processes unemployment and disability claims for the United States
utilizing a high-speed data link.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's push for large-scale manufacturing investments ran
afoul of the cyclical nature of big-ticket items. Ford, Dunlop, and
Sunbeam first created jobs, then cut back, which made things
difficult. Now the development schemes emphasize high-tech and
pharmaceuticals, and outfits like Apple Computer, Sandoz, and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson have filled the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The centralization and economies of scale anticipated with the
introductory phasing in five months ago of the new euro have yet to
materialize. The Bank of Ireland tried to elbow its way to the
front of the queue by merging with Alliance &AMP; Lester, a move that
would see Ireland's second-largest bank joined to a middle-sized
British institution.
</P>
<P>
   To the Irish Times, the announcement ``is the most significant
development in the financial sector (in Ireland) in recent years,''
one motivated by the Irish bank's fear of ``becoming one of the
smaller regional banks in the euro zone.''
</P>
<P>
   While it will be two years still before the new euro coins and
notes begin circulating, eventually to replace the coinage and
currency of 11 different European nations (including Germany,
France, and the Republic of Ireland, but excluding Britain, among
others), the euro began trading on the first day of business after
New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   It nudged up to $1.18 against the dollar, but last week sank to
a five-month low of $1.04, triggering louder murmurs and complaints
about the new fiscal ground rules that make it more complicated for
individual countries to manipulate the worth of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar is still king, though some euro-fanciers continue to
maintain that the euro will one day, in the not so distant future,
threaten the mighty buck as the world's leading reserve currency,
the place to hide when economic cyclones strike.
</P>
<P>
   The destabilizing effect of the NATO campaign against the
marauding Serb forces of Slobodan Milosevic is difficult to
calibrate. The tensions exacerbated by the murders, shelling,
forced evictions and dislocation of a million Kosovar refugees
cannot be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, who take part in refugee resettlement and
international aid efforts in numbers far beyond their proportionate
share as a people, have mobilized in typical fashion. In every
village, in many shops and pubs, cash is solicited for Kosovo
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or 20 years back, Northern Ireland was the tinder box of
Europe, a sullen and fearful province wracked by sectarian murders,
military intervention, riots, and terror-bombing.
</P>
<P>
   There are still isolated episodes in the north, kneecappings or
sectarian murders, old scores being settled by violent men who see
no future for themselves and their limited talents and their work
ethic in the new high-tech Ireland of transistors, tubes, and
tourism. But in the republic, this is as good as it gets for a lot
of average folk.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has changed perspectives. The Irish are more worldly;
they travel now as middle-class tourists and not as mendicant
emigrants; they demand quality wines with their meals and shrewdly
consult their share prices in the financial columns.
</P>

NO WONDER BLACKS SHUDDER WHEN `THE FORCE' IS ON THE LOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For white Americans, the ``Phantom Menace'' is a long time ago,
in a galaxy too far away to personally experience the Force. On the
big screen, the Force ``surrounds us and penetrates us'' to ``bind
the galaxy together.'' African- Americans have a far less sanguine
interpretation of this, given how many times we have been
surrounded, penetrated, and blown apart by the Force.
</P>
<P>
   No white women need fear the Force like Tyisha Miller. Miller
was the 19-year-old woman with a flat tire who was awakened by
impatient members of the Riverside, Calif., police force.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had called her family to inform them of the flat. She
went back to her car to wait. She decided to take a nap, with doors
locked, windows rolled up, and her gun on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   When relatives arrived, they could not wake her. They feared she
was in medical distress. They called 911. The police came. They
could not wake her. But seeing the gun, they went from being the
advance guard for paramedics to imperial stormtoopers. The
relatives who watched said the police shouted, ``Throw out the
(expletive) gun or we will kill your black ass.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers said she reached for the gun. They pumped 23
bullets into the car, hitting her 12 times, including four times to
the head. The Force killed her in what was dismissed as ``Episode
I: The Mistake.'' The local DA said it was ``a mistake in their
judgment,'' but ``there is no evidence whatsoever that these four
officers killed Tyisha Miller because of her race.''
</P>
<P>
   No white immigrant need fear the Force like Amadou Diallo, the
unarmed West African immigrant who had 41 bullets fired at him in
at his apartment by four impulsive members of the New York City
police force. Nineteen bullets hit Diallo. The Force killed him.
</P>
<P>
   The officers are on trial for second-degree murder, but they
were cheered at a public rally by their white colleagues. To them
it was ``Episode II: Another Mistake.'' A colleague said, ``I don't
think any police officer should be treated like a criminal if he
makes a mistake. A mistake isn't a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   No white businessman need fear the Force like Jonny Gammage, the
African-American businessman and cousin of former Pittsburgh
Steelers player Ray Seals. Gammage was stopped in his luxury car in
suburban Pittsburgh and assaulted by police officers. The officers
threw him down to the ground, where he died of asphyxia.
</P>
<P>
   Gammage's family won $1.5 million in civil damages, but the
Force was cleared of any crime in ``Episode III: The Accident.''
The Brentwood police chief said, ``It was an accidental death.''
</P>
<P>
   The episodes of mistakes and accidents have piled up in the
1990s to a point were no one can seriously debate whether racism
remains a potent force, the force that determines who gets Officer
Yoda and who gets their throat crushed by Lord Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly white ministers are not literally scared to death by the
police as was Accelyne Williams in a botched Boston raid. White
people are not being dragged out of nightclubs and sodomized by the
police as Abner Louima was in New York. Unarmed white thieves and
knuckleheads are not being fatally shot or wounded in the back like
the 14-year-old black boy this spring in Hartford and the
16-year-old boy last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the signs point to another big ``mistake'' coming.
Since the Williams death, African-American cop Michael Cox was
beaten by white cops who thought he was a suspect. An
African-American officer found a noose, the American symbol for
lynching, on his motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in a foreboding irony, the Rev. Felipe Texera, of Cape
Verdean descent and known for his antiviolence work, was
handcuffed, called ethnic slurs, and jailed. When he is in his
clerical robes, Texera is an angel to police for his antiviolence
work. Without his robes, he is just another dark devil who is often
stopped and questioned for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest came as Police Commissioner Paul Evans and Mayor
Thomas Menino dismissed a call from the Rev. Eugene Rivers for an
outside commission to study racial tensions on the force.
``Whatever the outside look can bring, we've done it.'' Evans said.
Menino meekly said that he was satisfied with Evans's new internal
Committee on Fairness and Professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by the national search for answers in the shootings
in predominantly white schools, we of course would have a more
serious reaction if cops were suddenly to start firing 23 bullets
into the cars of 19-year-old blondes, 41 bullets at unarmed Irish
immigrants, or smothering cousins of Carl Yastrzemski.
</P>
<P>
   After the city settled with the widow of Accelyne Williams for
$1 million, Evans said, ``Out of every tragedy, some good comes.
Hopefully, we will have a better department.'' Three years later,
with many episodes of ``The Mistake'' playing nationally and with
plenty of trouble at his feet, Evans is in danger of being seduced
by the bad side. He wants us to believe that black folks are
whining about a phantom menace. Meanwhile, black folks, even in his
own department, wince and duck whenever someone says, ``May the
Force be with you.''

FEELING GUILTY ABOUT FEELING GUILTY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a friendly building just outside Kansas City,
GuiltAmerica.com continues its research and development of new ways
to use guilt in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   GuiltAmerica's latest product for use by nonprofit organizations
is called ``Kids 'n' Pledges.'' For example, children who attend
private school knock on doors getting neighbors to sign pledges to
pay a certain amount of money to the school for each lap they run
in a track event.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you already pay taxes to support the public
schools, and hate the idea of subsidizing a school where kids are
dropped off in Land Rovers and Jaguars. It's a kid at the door, a
neighbor's kid, and you can't say no.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of GuiltAmerica.com's motivational strategy. It's
not enough for people to give, buy or perform any action out of
generosity or desire. The basic formula for the company's Pledge
Division is, ``If you say no, you look like a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   That covers all those dance-a-thons and bike-a-thons in which
office workers go from cubicle to cubicle getting fellow workers to
sign pledges. In an ingenious new twist that recognizes the desire
of the end-used to say ``Just go away,'' GuiltAmerica invented the
option of paying an immediate $5 cash donation to avoid pledging
for each mile, thus ensuring the pledge collector won't return with
a bill.
</P>
<P>
   GuiltAmerica.com opened for business half a century ago as
Guiltco, selling the idea that kids should go door-to-door peddling
candies and cookies for their youth organizations, whose leaders
had the ability to guilt-trip the kids into doing it. The company
took its lead from mothers who always said, ``Finish your dinner.
Children are starving in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that didn't save any kids in China (or India or
Africa, as times changed and dinner table guilt stayed the same).
</P>
<P>
   But those kids darn well ate their spinach.
</P>
<P>
   No neighbors really bought all those cookies and candies. My Sea
Scout candy bars were bought by my mom because she felt guilty that
I was a lazy salesman. They should have called us See's scouts, but
the chocolate wasn't that good. The company that made the candies
raked in the bucks no matter who ate the chocolate or even if it
was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Who invented the idea of recycling bins, so neighbors could see
if you're recycling, and what kinds of bottles you're recycling?
Why, GuiltAmerica, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Who lobbied behind the scenes for warning labels on booze and
no-smoking bars and restaurants? Consultants for GuiltAmerica,
working soft hand in hard fist with lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Who marketed all those awards and bumper stickers, saying ``My
child is an honor student at Joe Blow Junior High''? GuiltAmerica,
and they did it with a complete horizontal and vertical integration
of the school guilt market.
</P>
<P>
   GuiltAmerica's Industrial Division has come up with a more
powerful motivator than ``If you say no, you look like a jerk.''
That principle, sold to human resources departments nationwide, is:
``If you say no, you look like an unemployed jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   GuiltAmerica set the goal of helping companies end paid overtime
by means of the use of a few simple questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're leaving awfully early today, aren't you Smedley? Are
you in a rush to watch Letterman?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you jog to work over the weekend? I didn't see your car in
the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to come to our motivational dinner and
team-building Tuesday night? No, spouses can't come, and I realize
it's your wife's birthday, but think of us as family.''
</P>
<P>
   If you say no, you look like an unemployed jerk. Works like a
charm. Poof, low overtime and the illusion of high productivity.
</P>
<P>
   GuiltAmerica.com is now doing some top-secret defense
contracting. The company is teaching the Pentagon brass and White
House national security advisers how to motivate the nation for
wars in unknown places.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism doesn't rouse the nation anymore, because large
segments of the populace feel guilty about being patriotic. The
trick for guilt consultants is to relieve guilt in one area, while
applying it in another.
</P>
<P>
   People must be kept from feeling guilty about civilian
casualties inflicted by our pilots, while basically being told
``Finish the job. Children are starving in Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the .com in the name GuiltAmerica.com? Well, my iMac just
told me ``This computer may not have been shut down properly the
last time it was used.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, guilt is going to be big on the Internet, and
GuiltAmerica.com is selling stock. You can't say no to that
offering, or you look like a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can just give them $5 and hope they go away.

   NARCISSUS LEAVES THE POOL &QL; 
Familiar Essays &QL; 
By Joseph Epstein &QL; 
Houghton Mifflin, 321 pp., $25 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time's winged chariot glides through Joseph Epstein's latest
collection of personal essays. He has bypass surgery, turns 60,
feels mildly depressed. And yet the zest of his prose is
exhilarating. Cheerfulness _ as James Boswell says in his ``Life of
Samuel Johnson,'' citing the philosopher Oliver Edwards _ is always
breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years Epstein edited The American Scholar and contributed
to its pages under the name Aristides. Lest this sound elitist and
chilly, Epstein is the kind of man who not only knows Aristides was
dubbed ``the Just'' in ancient Athens, but recognizes it as the
name of a famous racehorse. ``Narcissus Leaves the Pool'' is the
author's sixth collection of familiar essays; he's a master of the
form, and his range of allusion has few equals in contemporary
American letters.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Narcissus'' is darker than prior collections, it is also
equally effervescent. The personal essay demands strong opinions
and achieves its unique character when it has the quality of
intimate conversation. Epstein gets wonderful effects combining
this intimacy with an admixture of the erudite and a dollop of
self-deprecation. Here, for example, he recalls a long-playing disc
featuring June Christie, who sang with the Stan Kenton band in days
of yore:
</P>
<P>
   ``Her songs about loneliness, desertion, betrayal, and general
mistreatment at the hand of men made Ovid in the `Heroides' seem,
in the crying-the-blues department, strictly bush league. The
cumulative impression the album conveyed was of a beautiful woman
alone at a bar _ smoking a cigarette and two drinks ahead of
everyone else in the room _ who had gotten a very raw deal. . . .
(The questions of) why had so many men left her in the lurch, and
was there something fundamentally wrong with so habitually unhappy
a woman _ were, of course, best left unanswered. In musical
romance, only the unexamined life is worth living.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein's subjects are, typically, more serious than they
appear, though the tone is always casual and confiding. ``Grow Up,
Why Dontcha?'' deals with changing perceptions of adulthood. One
sees people in their 50s whose sartorial ideal belongs to the
1960s; moreover, the movies of other decades preferred to imply a
maturity among leading men (Bogart, Cooper, Milland) that is no
longer visible. ``What's in It for the Talent?'' scrutinizes nearly
everyone's inclination to prefer talent to genius. ``A Nice Little
Knack for Name Dropping'' treats name-dropping as a minor art
requiring a gossamer touch.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the titles derive from S. J. Perelman (his ``Beat Me,
Post-Impressionist Daddy,'' for instance), and the essays adroitly
deal with what Chesterton called ``Tremendous Trifles,'' yet two
stand apart: ``My Friend Edward'' is a handsome, elegiac tribute to
the memory of a colleague, and ``Taking the Bypass'' is a somber
look, and no wonder, at Epstein's operation.
</P>
<P>
   As he points out, it is exceedingly difficult to get a clear
picture of all that such surgery entails. Hospitals do their best
to educate patients, but no institution can delineate the patient's
inner life as he or she experiences the panic and pain of what is
euphemistically called ``the procedure.'' Epstein pulls no punches
in describing the sensations of a patient and ``an abiding
vulnerability I hadn't felt before.''
</P>
<P>
   His sense of a loss of control over his destiny is partially
offset, however, by reading ``The Assault,'' by the Dutch novelist
Harry Mulisch. The principal character, an anesthesiologist, finds
his patients changed forever by their ordeal. Joseph Epstein too
feels changed in inexplicable ways. The surgery and its attendant
suffering have left him uncharacteristically off balance, conscious
of mortality; but one suspects, given his resources, cheerfulness
will sooner or later break in.

A MARVEL OF A MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ Just a few minutes into our tour of the
spanking-new Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, photographer
David Bruneau points to a clutch of ladders in front of a mammoth
James Rosenquist pop art triptych. ``Are the ladders part of the
art?'' Bruneau asks. His comment is not meant to be a joke, and no
one laughs.
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA director Joseph Thompson has offered to escort me,
Bruneau, and Mat Gleason, editor of the subversive art monthly
Coagula (``Cruel, insensitive, unfair, and thoroughy readable from
cover to cover'' _ David Bowie), through his 250,000 square feet of
exhibition space. I had invited Gleason to join us mainly because
he is the coauthor of a book called ``Most Art Scks.'' As in fact,
most modern art does.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a genial art expert-cum-MBA, treats us with perhaps
more respect than we deserve. ``The least pretentious and
best-informed museum director I've ever met,'' Gleason says of
Thompson, outside his hearing. But it is hard to distinguish some
of MoCA's art from the construction materials littering the floor
before last weekend's opening. Later in our tour, Thompson directs
my attention to a work by Bruce Nauman, but I see only 20 feet of
studded drywall. Gleason instantly understands that the ``art'' _
some yellow neon lights _ is on the other side of the drywall.
Silly me.
</P>
<P>
   It's arguable that the art in MoCA's initial ``Test Site''
exhibition is beside the point. What is most impressive is that
MoCA exists at all. Fifteen years ago, these galleries were an
abandoned factory complex in an economically depressed Berkshire
mill town. Then, in 1988, a young Williams College-educated art
hustler named Thomas Krens convinced the Dukakis administration to
spend $35 million to transform the heart of North Adams into a
modern art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Massachusetts Miracle ran out of gas, and the
state refused to fork over the museum's authorization. Krens bailed
out to take over New York's Guggenheim Museum. The incoming
governor, William Weld, thought MASS MoCA was a dumb idea. ``Weld
said to us, `Just go home,' '' Thompson recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson didn't go home. Instead, he raised $11 million in
private donations to convince Weld that MoCA could fly. Working
with North Adams mayor John Barrett and then-state senator Jane
Swift, Thompson jawboned Weld's economic affairs aide Dan Gregory
to keep the project alive. When I asked Thompson why he spent six
long years in North Adams (think: Pittsfield without the glitz)
promoting a seemingly dead-end art project, he muttered some
platitudes about community involvement and the compelling nature of
the MoCA project. After a pause, he added: ``Besides, it was hard
to make a gracious exit.''
</P>
<P>
   So what about the art? Is MoCA just a ``dumping ground for
oversize works from big-name donors (read: the superannuated
Italian collector Count Giuseppe Panza di Buomo)'' whom the
Guggenheim ``couldn't afford to alienate,'' as I wrote in 1990? In
part, yes. Some of the lamer artists, like junkman John Chamberlain
and metal mucker Robert Morris, were slated to be exhibited here a
decade ago, when the funding collapsed. Even then, their work was
passe.
</P>
<P>
   My man Gleason calls Chamberlain, Morris, and yesterday's
minimalists like Robert Mangold and Carl Andre ``the equivalent of
the Rolling Stones. Just as the Stones have been releasing the same
album over and over again, these guys have been chugging away at
the same imagery since the late 1960s. Thompson isn't taking any
chances with this exhibit; I think he's playing it safe for the art
tourists. If you don't like the art, at least you won't be offended
by it. It's almost content-free.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what's good about MoCA? The galleries, some boasting
sightlines as long as two football fields, have been beautifully
restored by Cambridge architects Bruner/Cott &AMP; Associates. The vast
exhibition halls allow MoCA to display works like Robert
Rauschenberg's painted journal ``The 1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece,''
which is in fact a quarter-mile long.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the same cavernous space accommodates Joseph Beuys's
``Blitzschlag'' (translation: ``Lightning/Whipped Cream''), a
20-foot-tall pyramid of darkened bronze surrounded by
submarine-sandwich-size pieces of dung. The good news is that all
MoCA exhibits are temporary, so a year from now ``Lightning/Whipped
Cream'' will have to find a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Will MoCA be here a year from now? Yes, although the economics
promise to be lean indeed. The museum has scaled down its
anticipated attendance from 150,000 to a minuscle 100,000 visitors
a year, with 65 percent of them expected during July, August, and
October. In the winter months, MoCA will cut its staff in half,
turn down the heat, and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, MoCA doesn't have to live by art alone. The museum has
a sound stage it can rent out, and some of the renovated mill
buildings already have paying tenants. The local newspaper rents
here, as do Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co., a special effects
outfit; HealthShare Technology, a health-care information provider;
and eZiba, yet another company that will ``completely reinvent the
concept of online retailing,'' according to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few years, Thompson will use the $13 million
remaining in his state grant to rehab some space for art, and some
space for commercial leasing. ``That's how we'll survive,'' he
explains. Unbelievably, they will.

THE BEST AND WORST; MEN IN DECLINE; PYTHON PLUS 30 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing so satisfying as a good debunking.
</P>
<P>
   It does the heart good somehow to see an inflated reputation
reduced to a popped balloon by a few piercing words, or to see some
pillar of conventional wisdom given a boot in the old fundament. In
that spirit, American Heritage does solid service with its second
annual list of the most overrated and underrated people, things,
ideas, and events in US history.
</P>
<P>
   As with those Best-Worst lists, where your eye is drawn
irresistibly to the Worst, you may find yourself lingering upon the
``overrated'' list, especially given the scathing treatment some of
the subjects receive. Among those whose reputations are cut down to
size: Gloria Steinem, Al Capone, Ernest Hemingway, Isaac Asimov,
the '60s, Shel Silverstein, John Adams, Boss Tweed, atomic power,
Alfred Eisenstaedt, Hunter S. Thompson, Gary Cooper, the idea of
progress, Alexis de Tocqueville, Yalta, and the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   You won't agree with all the choices (Stephen Sondheim
overrated? Rubbish!), but American Heritage has chosen its
debunkers well from a roster of opinionated scholars and writers
who argue, in general, that icon-hood is often just a matter of
good PR. But there's more than knee-jerk revisionism here. Allen
Barra is persuasive in arguing that Capone was a lightweight who
inherited a crime machine built by others and who owes his enduring
reputation to ``The Untouchables.'' Nicholas Lemann sheds new light
on the GI Bill. And it's hard to think of Hemingway in the same way
after Nancy Caldwell Sorel is done describing the shoddy journalism
he practiced as a war correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the food for thought, there are many deliciously
nasty lines. Camille Paglia brands Steinem the ``chief deb of her
own little sorority, which awards honorary memberships to pampered
men of power, such as glad-handing presidential adulterers.'' Woody
Hochswender dismisses Halston as ``probably a better hatmaker than
clothing designer.'' Nathan Ward notes that reading pieces from the
gonzo school of New Journalism ``can now make you feel as if you're
in an elevator with a counterculture salesman whose floor never
arrives.'' And Bruce McCall tees off on the '60s, calling the
decade ``one spontaneous, protracted narcissistic binge with all
the intellectual clarity of a spoiled brat's tantrum . . .. The one
profound thing about the period is the mystery of why a society so
advanced so willingly fell under the spell of this mush-headed
vision of life as children's holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: American Heritage belongs on any list of underrated
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Except perhaps for a good debunking, there is nothing so bracing
as the sight of two first-rate minds engaged in mortal combat over
important ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The June Harper's generates some intellectual fireworks by
pitting essayist Barbara Ehrenreich against anthropologist Lionel
Tiger (coiner of the term ``male bonding'') to debate whether the
power of males is in decline and whether a ``fundamental shift'' in
the balance of power between men and women has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At a New York restaurant, Ehrenreich and Tiger range across a
wide terrain, from the nature of sex roles 25,000 years ago to the
state of male-female relations, pausing to quarrel over such issues
as the Pill, the corporate glass ceiling, women in combat,
single-mother families, and changing male attitudes toward family
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   At times Tiger is pedantic (must he say ``emerging kinship
system'' when the word ``family'' is available?) and at times
Ehrenreich is snide (can't she rebut Tiger without accusing him of
nostalgia for ``feudalistic ways of life''?) But both are skilled
polemicists, and in general, this is a pretty high-minded exchange.
Tiger and Ehrenreich run out of time long before they run out of
words or ideas. I wouldn't want to get into an argument with either
of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denver TV stations took some lumps for their coverage of the
Columbine High School massacre, in particular for airing interviews
with students trapped inside the school and for broadcasting police
rescue maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one station, CBS affiliate KCNC-TV, displayed
professionalism and restraint under harrowing circumstances on
April 20, according to a chronicle of the station's 13 hours of
nonstop coverage in the Columbia Journalism Review.
</P>
<P>
   Former Wall Street Journal columnist Dean Rotbart, who spent
that day inside KCNC, reports that the station videotaped, but
chose not to broadcast, gory footage of a SWAT team dragging two
victims' bodies across the Columbine High lawn. Though KCNC learned
the identities of the two shooters early and could have scooped the
competition, the station held off on airing their names until
reporters got triple confirmation. All around the newsroom,
according to Rotbart, people rose to the occasion, including a news
director who had arrived at the station just two weeks earlier and
was still learning reporters' names.
</P>
<P>
   ``KCNC's news coverage . . . defies many of the most common
negative stereotypes concerning broadcast journalism in general and
local TV in particular,'' writes Rotbart.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And now for something completely brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, it's been 30 years since ``Monty Python's
Flying Circus'' debuted in England. In the years that followed, the
Pythons would take sketch comedy to heights it had not seen before
and has not seen since. In Python-world, silly walks had their own
ministry, purse-swinging old ladies terrorized the British
countryside, lumberjacks just wanted to feel pretty, and no one
expected the Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Vanity Fair excerpts a good long chunk of David
Morgan's new oral history of the Pythons. It dwells overmuch on
Graham Chapman's drinking problem, and Morgan's stiff writing style
is strangely at odds with his subjects, but there are a few tidbits
in here for Python buffs. For instance, it turns out that the
famous dead parrot sketch originally had John Cleese trying to
return a faulty toaster to the store. But when Cleese performed it
for Chapman, the latter's only response was: ``Yes, it's boring,
why not make it a parrot instead?''
</P>
<P>
   The excerpt suggests why the Pythons worked together for such a
comparatively brief period: creative differences combined with
cranky temperaments (John Cleese and Terry Gilliam are portrayed as
the most prickly). ``Whether we will ever be able to agree on
anything ever again is moot,'' says Eric Idle. ``I think groups use
up all their agreements early and then all that is left is to
disagree. But I'm not sure whether I agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder some of us miss them so much?

<P>
   Politics and power are inseparable; there is nothing new about
that. But it is policies that, in the final analysis, define the
nature of a government, the goals that it pursues and the interest
that it serves.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the trend in many countries has been
to allow the prevalence of tactical, self-serving and even cynical
politics at the expense of responsible policy-making. This is
happening at a time when the world is changing rapidly and
fundamentally, when today's decisions could affect the future in
dramatic and defining ways. Hasty, thoughtless decisions have
already cost us dearly in a number of regions and even on a global
scale. The diagnosis of world politics today is very clear: The
patient is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   This disease has taken a particularly severe and acute form in
Russia. The political crisis here has become virtually permanent,
with reform its main victim. The attempt to solve overnight the
problems involved in the difficult transition from one system to
another has affected all aspects of Russia's life in the most
destructive ways.
</P>
<P>
   Politically bankrupt and clueless, Russia's rulers are flailing
about, rushing to extremes and changing ministers like gloves.
Endless intrigues serve to conceal continuous failure of policy.
Yevgeni Primakov and his cabinet are the latest victims of those
intrigues.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite clear from the start that President Yeltsin's
decision to dismiss the cabinet had nothing to do with his declared
intention of kick-starting the Russian economy. That was just a
pretext _ so much so that even Primakov's designated successor,
Sergei Stepashin, at first stated that he would continue the
economic policies of the previous cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, was the real reason behind the decision taken by the
small coterie of Yeltsin's close associates, whom many Russians
call the family politburo? One reason, which is clear at a glance,
was the Russian president's jealousy of Primakov's popularity and
well-deserved public support.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken over when Russia's economy was in ruins, Primakov
was able to keep the country from falling into the abyss and to
create an atmosphere of stability. And, although the life of the
average Russian has not yet improved, people were beginning to see
a ray of light, of hope that an end to chaos and some improvement
was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, of course, resented the fact that while his own
approval ratings had plummeted to 2 percent or 3 percent, Primakov
had the support of about two-thirds of the populace, according to
opinion polls. Still, that reason, while obvious, was not the main
one.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov stood in the way of those in Russia who had illegally
accumulated tremendous wealth, who had grabbed vast amounts of
property through corruption and outright theft. It is those people,
fearful of losing what they had plundered, who orchestrated an
anti-Primakov campaign, declaring war on him in the media and in
the corridors of presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   By firing Primakov, Yeltsin forfeited Russia's real interests
and acted in the interests of himself and of a group concerned only
with its own future _ and with finding a successor who could make
that future secure and comfortable. A self-proclaimed ``guardian of
the constitution,'' Yeltsin is acting more like the guardian of the
property and safety of a corrupt group.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the president's actions have destabilized the
situation in the country. The fact that the State Duma, Russia's
parliament, approved the choice of new premier does not at all mean
that the government crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is continuing, now in the form of a fierce struggle
for seats in the cabinet, levers of influence and control over
major financial flows. Stepashin, who did not want to appear as a
puppet in the hands of the president's entourage and the group of
crony capitalists, is being cut off from decision-making on these
matters.
</P>
<P>
   We see emerging from the shadows and put in key positions people
who don't care one bit about economic reform and even less about
democracy. The anti-corruption drive begun under Primakov has for
all intents and purposes been stopped, and indicted officials and
businessmen are being allowed to get away from justice.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Russia's final stretch to parliamentary elections later
this year and then the presidential election in 2000 will be even
tougher than it had to be. The Duma's approval of the new prime
minister's appointment was primarily meant to deprive Yeltsin of
any pretext for dissolving Parliament and perpetuating the regime
of one-man rule. I think that in doing so, the Duma acted properly.
The important thing now is where the leading Russian politicians
will go from here. They, and the political groups now being formed
around them, must act with a sense of utmost responsibility and
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Of great importance will be what Primakov decides to do. It
would be unfortunate if his dismissal and the insulting way he was
treated caused him to leave the Russian political arena. My advice
to him would be to give the entire situation serious thought. He
could retain his broad-based support. Significantly, he continues
to lead all opinion polls. If the elections were held today, he
would most probably be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has already offered Primakov a
partnership within the political group he is now creating.
</P>
<P>
   It is my considered opinion that the ``optimal way'' scenario
for Russia would involve amending the present constitution. We must
get rid of its authoritarian straightjacket. Prudent changes in the
constitution would strike a proper balance between the presidency,
a more authoritative and responsible cabinet of ministers and a
reasonably strong parliament. I continue to believe that within
such a structure of government, Primakov would be the best choice
for president and Luzhkov for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is capable of leaving behind the overly long and painful
stage of its ``start-up development.'' Responsible policies and
policy makers must replace its current strain of politics. And,
though conditions differ, many Western countries too could set for
themselves a similar goal.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is achieved, we could begin to address together the
challenges of the coming century.

ON BALLPARKS, COMPANY IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Throughout the expansive, four-floor
headquarters of HOK Sport, dozens of employees are busy designing
the real fields of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   On one floor, two architects huddle over blueprints for the new
Pittsburgh Pirates stadium. Nearby, plans for The Ballpark at Union
Station, the new home of the Houston Astros, with its distinctive,
roll-out-of-sight roof, sit on a drafting table.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell Park for the San Francisco Giants, new ballparks
for the San Diego Padres and the Cincinnati Reds, PSI Net Stadium
for the Baltimore Ravens, Philips Arena in Atlanta, and minor
league ballparks and collegiate stadiums are in various stages of
design. HOK Sport's architects also planned Stadium Australia, the
Olympic stadium in Sydney, and they are working on the replacement
for the legendary Wembley Stadium in London.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, when the Boston Red Sox decided to replace
Fenway Park, they, too, came to HOK. So did the New England
Patriots, whose new stadium will be an HOK Sport design.
</P>
<P>
   Sprouting 16 years ago from a theory that an architectural firm
could thrive by planning only sports facilities, HOK Sport has
emerged as the preeminent designer of stadiums in the country. It
has competitors, but its annual revenues are now bigger than the
next eight ranked companies combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``HOK has done for sports architecture what McDonald's did for
hamburgers, except in a very upscale way,'' said John Moag Jr.,
chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority, for which HOK produced
both the seminal design of Oriole Park at Camden Yards and the PSI
Net Stadium. ``They were first in many respects, they put a real
good product out there, and people like it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, HOK ignited the boom in retro-styled
baseball stadiums that has swept the country. Its position as the
leading architect for the National Football League is so well
established that last year NFL officials quietly encouraged owners
to solicit other designers to help drive down HOK's fees.
</P>
<P>
   While HOK clearly covets both the Red Sox and Patriots projects,
especially the challenge of replacing Fenway Park, in many ways the
projects are just two more jobs. The firm has designed more than
500 sports facilities, and it now has more than 30 stadiums in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stadium design is a relatively small niche in the field, but
they have a very high profile,'' said David Lee of the Boston
architectural firm of Stull &AMP; Lee Inc., designers of the South
Station renovation and the Roxbury Post Office on New Dudley
Street. ``And they carved out that niche early. There was a period
when there wasn't that many new stadiums being built, and they were
right there when things took off.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1983 by a small group of architects,
most of whom had worked together at various times at companies that
are now HOK's competitors. By 1988, the firm's revenues had reached
$7 million. But business accelerated after HOK designed a minor
league ballpark in Buffalo that became a new standard for stadium
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, officials in Buffalo asked HOK Sport to design
a ballpark in an old section of the city, hoping it would help
revitalize part of downtown. Originally planned as a major league
park, HOK shifted course when Buffalo was denied an expansion
franchise by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Field became the original retro-ballpark design in the
country. It demonstrates what observers say is another of HOK's
strengths _ the ability to match a stadium to its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a way of walking into a town and spending time in a
town before they give you anything,'' said Bob DiBiasio, a senior
vice president of the Cleveland Indians, who have had more than 300
consecutive sellouts in their HOK-designed Jacobs Field. ``Rather
than handing you some boilerplate stadium that they want to build
you, they look at the architecture in a city and the landscape in a
city _ you know, the smokestacks, the bridges over the rivers _ and
they work of off it.''
</P>
<P>
   The result in Buffalo was a downtown stadium that looks old, but
that has all of the amenties for fans and the revenue-producing
premium seating for the owner. That formula is the essence of HOK's
success in Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our design became a kind of specific solution for that city,
and that solution happened to be a retro look,'' said Earl Santee,
a partner at HOK who presides over most of the firm's baseball
designs. ``But we just started with what was a strong urban
environment, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubts about HOK's approach, Oriole Park at
Camden Yards confirmed the popularity of the retro design.
Reminiscent of old parks like Fenway and Wrigley Field, it
institutionalized the Pilot Field look. None of the new stadiums
look much alike, but they are reflections of the eras of Ruth,
Williams and the young Mays and Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ballparks are stated in revivalist architectural
language,'' said Robert Benson, chairman of the School of
Architecture and Design at Miami University in Ohio, and former
architecture critic for The Detroit News. ``It is a popular sense
of tradition and place, and it provides the flavor of a specific
site married to a specific community.''
</P>
<P>
   When Camden Yards was complete, HOK Sport's annual revenue had
tripled to $23 million. By 1997, revenues reached $64 million.
According to Street &AMP; Smith's SportsBusiness Journal, that was more
revenue than the combined total of the next eight largest
competitors in stadium and arena design.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we hit Oriole Park, it was clear to us that each
ballclub and each community wanted to have their own brand of
baseball, which meant a clear identity, and a clear sense of how
poeple used the facility,'' Santee said. ``And in Baltimore, Eutaw
Street, and the big warehouse, and the ambience of the old
neighborhood there, just kind of set the stage for what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, HOK is even more dominant in the National Football
League. While the strength of its new designs have powered its
asendancy in baseball, its business strategy has led it to
leadership among designers in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years and years they were the only firm that ever showed
up at the big NFL owners meeting in March,'' said a sports
consultant who asked not to be identified. ``They were always
peeling one or two key owners off.''
</P>
<P>
   The consultant also said that HOK won the favor of owners by
completing large portions of preliminary design work without
charging for it. According to the consultant, the Patriots have
received such consideration, and it has gone a long way to solidify
HOK's relationship with Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots officials declined comment on the choice of HOK Sport
as their architect, and officials at HOK declined to discuss plans
for the Patriots' new stadium. Privately, officials say that the
Patriots want to take many more steps, including garnering the
approval of officials in Foxborough, before they talk about the
preliminary design of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   HOK has worked for more than four years on the Red Sox project,
having studied various sites, from the old Megaplex design, to the
South Boston waterfront, to at least four potential sites around
Fenway Park, as well as the potential for renovation schemes.
Santee can talk about the decisions made on each site in detail,
ticking of street names and the locations of residential properties
and artists lofts as if he lived in the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of the Boston project is really understanding
what all of the issues are up front, and to take the time to make
sure that you are thoughtful about what the possible solutions are,
and looking at every option,'' Santee said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Red Sox unveiled their plans for a new ballpark two
weeks ago, Santee spent six days in Boston to help pitch the
proposal. When he flew back to Kansas City, the seams in the
sleeves of his jacket were badly in need of repair from hauling the
hefty model of the proposed new Fenway Park from meeting to meeting
around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   HOK, Santee said, is at the top of the mountain _ for now. He
said that eventually the boom in stadium construction will decline,
if not go completely bust. But the firm's biggest, toughest
projects are now in the works, Santee said, including the
complicated quests for new stadiums for the Red Sox and the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult projects are ahead of us _ and I would
definitely put Boston in that line, just because of the time it
takes to get it done and the difficult decisions that need to be
made on a project like that,'' Santee said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty of the new projects, Santee said, is the
public's increased awareness of stadium design. If it had been 10
years ago, he said, plans for the new Fenway Park could have been
rolled out with much less preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Santee said the firm accepts the public's growing interest in
stadium design as a challenge. ``The fans are really engaged,''
Santee said. ``The days of someone coming along and slam dunking a
project down the public's throat are long gone.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 For release: MAY 30 or thereafter  
 &HT;    When I was young, in South Africa during World War II, I was far
removed from the bombs, the nights in underground shelters, the
rationed food, in Europe.
 &HT;    I read reflections by those living through this experience, and
these were not what I had in my mind as the way life must be there;
I had constructed their lives out of a projection of my own
priorities in what makes life, my own fears of what would be most
threatened in imagined circumstances.
 &HT;    Our war _ South Africa's liberation struggle _ is over. On June
2, we shall cast our votes in our second post-apartheid elections.
We have been led to that day by one of the great men of this
century. He now displays the ultimate wisdom in closing his era at
his peak of accomplishments, the final one being the assurance that
his successor is the one equal to the era about to begin.
 &HT;    We have lived five years of freedom. Whatever the frustrations
as well as triumphs we've tackled, it is an achievement placed
toweringly beside the years of apartheid racism and before them the
years of colonial racism _ five years against three centuries.
 &HT;    Yet I see that this period is often the object of the same kind
of subjective projection I imposed on the reality of wartime Europe
50 years ago.
 &HT;    Again and again, when I am interviewed or find myself in
encounters with other people abroad, the burning question is,
``What is happening to whites?'' And again and again, my genuinely
surprised response is: ``What about blacks? Don't you believe there
are challenges to be met in their new lives?''
 &HT;    There are two obvious assumptions to be made of this approach to
South Africa by Europeans and North Americans. The majority of them
being white, they identify only with whites, whether consciously or
subconsciously. Because I am white, they assume I do the same. It's
the Old Boys/Old Girls Club producing its dogeared membership card.
 &HT;    The projection is of the priorities of their lives, along with
the old colonial conditioning that these belong with whiteness and
are ncontrovertibly, always, forever, threatened by the Otherness
_ blackness.
 &HT;    Five years into freedom. What kind of fossil should I be,
unearthed from the cave of bones that was apartheid, if my
essential sense of self were to be as a white?
 &HT;    There are some who still have this sense _ suffer it, I would
say, and unnecessarily, so it becomes a form of self-flagellation.
I don't posit this in any assertion of smug superiority; I should
just wish to prod them into freedom from confinement.
 &HT;    And there is also the other _ unadmitted _ side of feeling
superior as white: being ashamed of being white. An
overcompensation for the past, useless for living fully in the
present.
 &HT;    If you put the question to me, I hear it as, ``What about us?''
_ South Africans going as best we can about the business of living
together. Being white as a state determining my existence is simply
not operative. I was privileged through racism, I rejected and
actively opposed racism, I played my small part in the liberation
struggle and I know that as a result I am a South African and
nobody else, living in a country we are in the difficult, thrilling
process of creating. That we must create; for despite its natural
resources, its sophisticated infrastructure, its advanced
technology, what we want never existed for us before: a truly human
society.
 &HT;    Grand words. How does it feel to live day to day under their
imperative? Five years into freedom: For me, the great change comes
from others, from the change in atmosphere in the cities, the
streets. It is nothing new for me to ``mix'' with people of all
colors; my closest friendships and working relationships have been
in this context for many years. But the old life existed counter to
everything that defined and characterized the country.
 &HT;    It was _ even if triumphantly always in opposition _ surrounded
by the laws, the state, secular and religious traditions that
represented everything it was not. Although we said ``our
country,'' this was in reference to that which people were
suffering, striving, surviving to bring about _ there was no
identity with the official entity called South Africa. We had no
country.
 &HT;    I am aware now, every day, in so many ways, big and small, happy
and troubling, that I can speak of ``our country.'' If the air of
taking possession can be palpable, I feel it when I walk out of my
gate. I hear it in the volume of traffic. I know it when I pick my
way between vendors of everything from cell phones and fake French
perfume to tomatoes and toilet rolls on the pavements. I see it out
of the corner of my eye when I stand in a queue at my local post
office and eavesdrop on the black postmaster giving instruction to
the young Afrikaans employee at the counter. I hear it in the
accents of our many languages, listeners speaking English on radio
phone-in programs.
 &HT;    It is that indefinable quality called confidence; even the
member of the vast number of unemployed who guides me theatrically
into a parking bay has it _ yes, a contradiction of his actual
circumstances.
 &HT;    Well, I live in Johannesburg. A city in transition is full of
such contradictions.
 &HT;    Recently my bag was snatched from the car when the friend
driving stopped at a traffic light; I had forgotten to lock the
passenger-seat door _ our routine precaution, like the free
distribution of condoms against AIDS. I was indignant. House keys,
credit card, ATM card _ the fact that they were filched by someone
living on the streets who had no middle-class status to own such
things did not assuage me.
 &HT;    But on the same streets in the press of people flowing and
dodging round one another, the great mass whom had been shut out of
the city in ghettos and ``ethnic homelands,'' if someone jostles
me, I hear, ``Sorry, maGogo'' (``I apologize, Grandmother'').
 &HT;    Ordinary good manners, you will say. No. He apologizes. He
accepts me as a common relative in the human family; after he and
his forebears have been decreed outcast from it for generations,
both subtly and brutally, colonialist patronage to apartheid
rejection.
 &HT;    The benison of human feeling at once shines out against, and is
threatened by, violent crime. The second question fired by
individuals from abroad is one with a target that can't be missed.
Back to the first proposition of the contradiction: the snatched
bag.
 &HT;    ``What about crime?'' I shall not duck. The impersonal
statistics are there, never mind my credit card. The city I live in
is among those with the highest crime rates in the world.
 &HT;    That my French granddaughter, a student in Nice, has had her
little old car stolen is an incident of urban crime all over the
world, but it doesn't add up to the indicting total in one city,
one country, the way the loss of my bag will in the calculation of
those passing judgment on the progress of a country with a
five-year commitment to democracy as against the several hundred
years' experience of its evolution in the West.
 &HT;    The curious view from abroad is that only whites are threatened
by, and concerned about, street crime, hijackings and housebreaking
and the violence these involve. Again and again, there are
descriptions of suburban razor wire and Rottweilers as the
prevailing flora and fauna of the white suburbs. The facts are that
homes, humble as well as substantial and even complete with
swimming pool, in what are still the black townships of greater
Johannesburg, are also armed with wire and dogs.
 &HT;    Black professional and businessmen and -women who now take a
place among the affluent owners of fine cars (regarded primly as
suspect conspicuous consumers by observers who do not have the same
moral judgment of whites driving the same models) are also victims
of hijacking. We face the problems together.
 &HT;    But if you move about in my city, you don't need a criminologist
to identify the reason for crime's prevalence. And it is not a
bleeding-heart apologist response when the blunt answer is:
unemployment.
 &HT;    I have taught myself to drive, all over again, 50 or so years
after I was first licensed, because there has to be a new, nippy
know-how and understanding of an unwritten code among drivers to
weave among the buffalo herd of the road, the minibuses. We call
them ``combis'' because they are combination buses and taxis and
conduct themselves as a hybrid, which is confusing to the
uninitiated driver of a car.
 &HT;    They hoot continuously, to attract the attention of potential
passengers; they stop anywhere at the signal of a raised finger
from the curbside, the way a hailed taxi responds; they have
regular routes they follow like a bus but no obligation to restrict
themselves to any designated bus stops. They are always packed to
suffocation limit. They have solved the transport question, which a
succession of white regimes dealt with as the decision that blacks
use their legs.
 &HT;    To me, the combis are symbols of the immeasurable influx of
people to the city since freedom was confirmed at the ballot box in
1994, the trek of many thousands who come to find work, and for
whom there will be little or no possibility of finding it. When the
humiliation of begging fails, desperation offers one way to survive
_ crime.
 &HT;    This phenomenon of crime is not, as some observers take smug
satisfaction in regarding it, the phenomenon of freedom.
 &HT;    Things were not better in the old days of the apartheid regime.
They were kept out of sight. The unemployed and underemployed who
come to the city hungry in every way for a better life now were
corralled in that extraordinary experiment in social engineering,
poverty-ridden ``ethnic homelands.''
 &HT;    The social disease, unemployment, was quarantined. Migratory
labor from the rural areas, and from one province to another, was
permitted to enter the city only in numbers determined healthy by
the needs of industry.
 &HT;    And these workers were legally forbidden to take their families
with them. I have to remind myself of this when I see among us that
sad developing-world category of childhood, street children. Now
they are there before our eyes instead of underfed and
undereducated in the ``homelands'' of apartheid.
 &HT;    It is not a politically correct convenience to blame the past,
apartheid, for unemployment.
 &HT;    The plain fact is that dammed-up unemployment has burst upon us
from the inhuman confines of the past; it is not something inherent
in freedom, a kind of punishment for our people's audacity in
defeating whites-only rule. As a result of the policies of the
past, black people come to the city doubly disadvantaged.
 &HT;    First, industrial development, hampered through sanctions that
were necessary to end apartheid, has only limited employment to
provide in a period when, despite every effort toward expansion,
such development is affected by quaking conditions in world
finance.
 &HT;    Second, the majority of the unemployed do not have the education
or skills to take on such jobs that are available. Many are
illiterate or semiliterate, the products of the contemptible level
of education apartheid decreed for blacks. Few have any of the
basic skills demanded by an increasingly technological labor
market.
 &HT;    I cannot shrug and dismiss them as a lost generation. I am one
who will press for innovative large-scale government projects that
will institute skills training and employment at the same time.
When the adults are providers, the children will not be on the
streets.
 &HT;    And I am encouraged by the government's chivying of business to
give training in financial processes, and the condition laid down
to foreign investors that there must be a training component in
their most welcome decisions to profit from investment
opportunities here.
 &HT;    There is enthusiasm among Haves in the city to see a solution to
the unemployment of Have-nots in what they call, broadly, small
business, and there are formations that commendably provide modest
finance for this.
 &HT;    Yet when I pass, near a supermarket, a young man mending shoes
in a booth he has been supplied with, I can't help thinking this is
something of a dead-end for him. Couldn't he be learning to be an
electrician or plumber, even if he cannot become one of the
millennium's computer-literate?
 &HT;    His ``small business'' venture doesn't seem to have the vigor of
self-initiated brisk trading by those pavement vendors whom I note,
month by month, acquiring the acumen of what will arrest the gaze
of customers beyond a mere pile of bananas _ the latest sports-club
logo on a cap, the look-alike Nikes.
 &HT;    South African blacks are new to shopkeeping, having been barred
from owning shops in the city. They don't have the capital to do
so, yet, but you can see they're learning fast _ the hard way.
 &HT;    In awareness of sharing as a post-apartheid ethos, at what
levels is this evident? At the top economic level, which used to be
exclusively that occupied by whites, like begins to live beside
like. It was a pejorative _ aimed at white privilege in general _
to refer to ``Houghton,'' but now our President Mandela lives in
that residential area, more modestly than he would if he made the
conventional choice of the official residence occupied by the white
regimes' presidents in Pretoria.
 &HT;    Sandton _ the most luxurious of garden suburbs _ can't really be
regarded as the generic symbol of white capitalist living any
longer, because black dignitaries in professions, business,
communications and the arts now also favor the landscaped townhouse
complexes complete with security service. They are a minority among
blacks, of course.
 &HT;    At the broadest, basic level of the new social pyramid there are
changes that are not less contrasting, in their way, with the
living conditions of the past. Late last year, I was in the city's
old black township of Alexandra, in the brand-new three-room house,
built with government subsidy and a low-interest bank loan, into
which the Mashabela family of five had just moved after 17 years in
a one-room shack housing 14 people. This kind of leveling of
material conditions is my primary criterion of justice in my
country, the city I live in.
 &HT;    I know it could not possibly be brought about in five years, or
ever can be completely achieved, on the evidence of the chasms
between the life of rich and poor in developed capitalist countries
that have declared themselves dedicated to it for several hundred
years, and the failure of Socialist countries (of Socialism _ so
far in human history, but not forever, in my belief) to avoid
making freedom a prisoner of its own dictates.
 &HT;    South Africa _ like its combis _ has had to choose pragmatically
to be a hybrid: a mixed economy, with every bias it can afford
toward making the legal equality, now achieved, meaningful in
economic, material form for the impoverished majority.
 &HT;    It follows that community of purpose is particularly decisive
for us, coming as we do, rawly, from our divided, racist past. My
own natural preoccupations, within my life as I see it as a
responsible citizen, have always been in the arts, what are called
(rather embarrassingly for my taste) cultural formations, in which
race or color or even language differences were an irrelevance in
common enthusiasms, the realm of the imagination that couldn't be
annexed, even by apartheid.
 &HT;    But now, as it should be, in pursuit of South Africa as an
African country rather than an Africanized outpost of the West, the
initiatives and much of the innovation in culture are taken up by
blacks _ a form of unofficial, organic affirmative action that
creates a balance that was missing while partnerships between black
and white were always weighted by the fact that whites, by law, in
the ordinary pursuits of daily life, had access to opportunities
blacks did not have.
 &HT;    I feel at home _ in the real sense of the concept _ as never
before, even in working with my longtime close friend Mongane Wally
Serote, poet, former freedom fighter, now a member of Parliament
with a high position in the Department of Arts and Culture, and
with Walter Chakela, director of the Windybrow Center for the Arts,
in a total context that didn't exist for them and for me before.
 &HT;    Perhaps that may be regarded as a rather special area of race
relations, far from ``Sorry, maGogo'' in the street. In between, I
reflect on my feelings when, moving about the city and suburbs, I
pass a school at the hour when classes end. It was a whites-only
school I knew well.
 &HT;    I see the kids coming out, the small boys scuffling with one
another, the little girls tangling hands and giggling together.
They are all shades of color _ South African black, South African
Indian, South African milange, South African white. They are
growing up with a common initiating experience, into life.
 &HT;    They will never be subject to the unspeakable horrors that the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission has exposed to us, and that
have been so vital for us to face, what we did or what we allowed
to happen. These children are not being kept apart to learn to
hate, to fear the unknown, the untouched in one another.
 &HT;    One of the generation that was the victim of the horrors of
apartheid, Tokyo Sexwale, lately premier of Gauteng, of which
Johannesburg is the capital, and now a black-empowerment crusader
married to a white woman, said something this month that could be
our rubric to live by: ``If blacks get hurt, I get hurt. If whites
get hurt, that's my wife, and if you harm colored people, you're
looking for my children. Your unity embodies who I am.''

 By NADINE GORDIMER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 For release: MAY 30 or thereafter  
 &HT;    When I was young, in South Africa during World War II, I was far
removed from the bombs, the nights in underground shelters, the
rationed food, in Europe.
 &HT;    I read reflections by those living through this experience, and
these were not what I had in my mind as the way life must be there;
I had constructed their lives out of a projection of my own
priorities in what makes life, my own fears of what would be most
threatened in imagined circumstances.
 &HT;    Our war _ South Africa's liberation struggle _ is over. On June
2, we shall cast our votes in our second post-apartheid elections.
We have been led to that day by one of the great men of this
century. He now displays the ultimate wisdom in closing his era at
his peak of accomplishments, the final one being the assurance that
his successor is the one equal to the era about to begin.
 &HT;    We have lived five years of freedom. Whatever the frustrations
as well as triumphs we've tackled, it is an achievement placed
toweringly beside the years of apartheid racism and before them the
years of colonial racism _ five years against three centuries.
 &HT;    Yet I see that this period is often the object of the same kind
of subjective projection I imposed on the reality of wartime Europe
50 years ago.
 &HT;    Again and again, when I am interviewed or find myself in
encounters with other people abroad, the burning question is,
``What is happening to whites?'' And again and again, my genuinely
surprised response is: ``What about blacks? Don't you believe there
are challenges to be met in their new lives?''
 &HT;    There are two obvious assumptions to be made of this approach to
South Africa by Europeans and North Americans. The majority of them
being white, they identify only with whites, whether consciously or
subconsciously. Because I am white, they assume I do the same. It's
the Old Boys/Old Girls Club producing its dogeared membership card.
 &HT;    The projection is of the priorities of their lives, along with
the old colonial conditioning that these belong with whiteness and
are incontrovertibly, always, forever, threatened by the Otherness
_ blackness.
 &HT;    Five years into freedom. What kind of fossil should I be,
unearthed from the cave of bones that was apartheid, if my
essential sense of self were to be as a white?
 &HT;    There are some who still have this sense _ suffer it, I would
say, and unnecessarily, so it becomes a form of self-flagellation.
I don't posit this in any assertion of smug superiority; I should
just wish to prod them into freedom from confinement.
 &HT;    And there is also the other _ unadmitted _ side of feeling
superior as white: being ashamed of being white. An
overcompensation for the past, useless for living fully in the
present.
 &HT;    If you put the question to me, I hear it as, ``What about us?''
_ South Africans going as best we can about the business of living

not operative. I was privileged through racism, I rejected and

struggle and I know that as a result I am a South African and

built with government subsidy and a low-interest bank loan, into
which the Mashabela family of five had just moved after 17 years in
a one-room shack housing 14 people. This kind of leveling of
material conditions is my primary criterion of justice in my
country, the city I live in.
 &HT;    I know it could not possibly be brought about in five years, or
ever can be completely achieved, on the evidence of the chasms
between the life of rich and poor in developed capitalist countries
that have declared themselves dedicated to it for several hundred
years, and the failure of Socialist countries (of Socialism _ so
far in human history, but not forever, in my belief) to avoid
making freedom a prisoner of its own dictates.
 &HT;    South Africa _ like its combis _ has had to choose pragmatically
to be a hybrid: a mixed economy, with every bias it can afford
toward making the legal equality, now achieved, meaningful in
economic, material form for the impoverished majority.
 &HT;    It follows that community of purpose is particularly decisive
for us, coming as we do, rawly, from our divided, racist past. My
own natural preoccupations, within my life as I see it as a
responsible citizen, have always been in the arts, what are called
(rather embarrassingly for my taste) cultural formations, in which
race or color or even language differences were an irrelevance in
common enthusiasms, the realm of the imagination that couldn't be
annexed, even by apartheid.
 &HT;    But now, as it should be, in pursuit of South Africa as an
African country rather than an Africanized outpost of the West, the
initiatives and much of the innovation in culture are taken up by
blacks _ a form of unofficial, organic affirmative action that
creates a balance that was missing while partnerships between black
and white were always weighted by the fact that whites, by law, in
the ordinary pursuits of daily life, had access to opportunities
blacks did not have.
 &HT;    I feel at home _ in the real sense of the concept _ as never
before, even in working with my longtime close friend Mongane Wally
Serote, poet, former freedom fighter, now a member of Parliament
with a high position in the Department of Arts and Culture, and
with Walter Chakela, director of the Windybrow Center for the Arts,
in a total context that didn't exist for them and for me before.
 &HT;    Perhaps that may be regarded as a rather special area of race
relations, far from ``Sorry, maGogo'' in the street. In between, I
reflect on my feelings when, moving about the city and suburbs, I
pass a school at the hour when classes end. It was a whites-only
school I knew well.
 &HT;    I see the kids coming out, the small boys scuffling with one
another, the little girls tangling hands and giggling together.
They are all shades of color _ South African black, South African
Indian, South African milange, South African white. They are
growing up with a common initiating experience, into life.
 &HT;    They will never be subject to the unspeakable horrors that the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission has exposed to us, and that
have been so vital for us to face, what we did or what we allowed
to happen. These children are not being kept apart to learn to
hate, to fear the unknown, the untouched in one another.
 &HT;    One of the generation that was the victim of the horrors of
apartheid, Tokyo Sexwale, lately premier of Gauteng, of which
Johannesburg is the capital, and now a black-empowerment crusader
married to a white woman, said something this month that could be
our rubric to live by: ``If blacks get hurt, I get hurt. If whites
get hurt, that's my wife, and if you harm colored people, you're
looking for my children. Your unity embodies who I am.''

THE SHARKS ARE CIRCLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to be a shark to survive in the ultracompetitive auto
insurance business in Massachusetts. Right now, the sharks are
circling Trust Insurance Co., hoping to take a bite out of a
company that has been bleeding red ink.
</P>
<P>
   Trust, which has 4 percent of the state's auto insurance market,
or about 175,000 policyholders, recently reported a $21 million
loss for 1998 _ a huge loss for a relatively modest-sized company.
The setback wiped out roughly 40 percent of the Taunton company's
surplus, the cushion it has for future rainy days. Trust insists
everything is fine and that it is close to a deal that will inject
new capital into the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped rivals from approaching Trust's
insurance agents in a bid to get them to defect, according to
industry sources. Those same sources say that some of Trust's
agents, worried about their future, have put out the word that they
might be interested in defecting if the price is right.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, insurance agents are free agents. They can
move their business and their customers from one insurer to
another, which makes poaching a very serious matter. It also means
that rivals have an incentive to make it sound as if Trust is on
death's doorstep and Trust has an incentive to say everything is
just ducky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably some people in this industry spend their time
fanning rumors, trying to make mountains out of molehills,'' says
William Ryan, Trust's vice president of government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors may have been fueled by the skimpy details Trust made
public to explain its whopping loss. In a press release, the
company blamed investments in a new computer system and a
``software defect in a data processing system managed by an
outsider vendor.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders say some of Trust's computer work is performed
by CGI, a company based in Montreal. When CGI executives heard
about Trust's problems, they immediately put out the word that they
weren't at fault. ``CGI has nothing to do with the performance
shortfall referred to in a previous Trust Insurance press
release,'' says Ronald White, a CGI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan declined to elaborate on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to insurance agents mailed last month, Trust
president Craig Bradley hinted at some other possible reasons for
the loss. Bradley told the agents that Trust's line of homeowner
insurance was priced ``way below the competition,'' a situation
that has since been rectified. Bradley also refers to the ``war of
attrition in auto insurance pricing'' that has been going on for
several years in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   That price war has made it difficult for anyone to make much
money in auto insurance here. The state insurance commissioner has
cut rates more than 20 percent over four years. On top of that, the
insurers have offered major discounts to safe drivers and to
members of groups such as the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically some of the insurers try to pull back on the
discounts, but the genie of competition has proved to be difficult
to put back in the bottle. Insurers blame insurance Commissioner
Linda Ruthardt for their problems, but the heavy discounting has
made it easy for Ruthardt to justify further rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt's office says it spotted a ``discrepancy'' in one of
Trust's quarterly statements, which led to the discovery of the $21
million loss. The Insurance Division is currently conducting a
routine examination of Trust's books, so it cannot comment further
on the situation. A department spokesman did point out that Trust
has yet to file its results for the first quarter, information that
should have been filed by May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Trust continues to say it has the situation well in hand and
that its only problem is industry rumor-mongering. ``Our
competitors continue with their heavy-handed marketing,'' Bradley
complained to agents in a letter mailed last week. In that same
letter, Bradley said that despite the disinformation campaign,
``agency defections are no greater this year than last and they are
minimal at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust says it plans to sell two parcels of real estate that
would translate into at least $10 million that can be added to its
surplus. The company also promises that new capital is on the way
from a ``close strategic investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust won't name that investor but industry speculation centers
around American Re, a Princeton, N.J., reinsurance company that has
had a long and close relationship with Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Over the coming months, Trust will have to file quarterly
statements that will make clear how much progress it is making. In
an industry in which competitors traffic in rumor and innuendo,
those numbers should make it clear who can be trusted and who
cannot.

A GOLFER HITS HER STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ She has that unteachable golf skill, the
ability to visualize a shot, so it shouldn't be a surprise that
Karrie Webb can see a topic heading in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only my fourth US Open,'' she said. ``I answered these
sorts of questions at the Dinah Shore this year. This is my 14th
major that I have ever played in. I have a long career ahead of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't start asking her how much a major
championship would mean to her.
</P>
<P>
   As the 54th US Women's Open at Old Waverly Golf Club begins
Thursday, Webb is the best player in women's golf, one who has put
up an All-Star season in just five months. In 11 starts this year,
Webb has four wins, two seconds, and two thirds. She has yet to
play an event over par and her cumulative red number for the year
is a mind-boggling 137. Stroke average? Try 68.49, nearly a full
shot better than the next best.
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds up to her being the overwhelming favorite
here, right? Webb grimaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my chances are just as good as they are any year,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the LPGA Tour by storm with four wins in 1996, Webb
has been in the spotlight. She won three times in '97, twice more
the next year, and after her early-season rush in 1999, her win
total is up to 13. All this, and she's seven months shy of her 25th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That's something she wishes we would remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year I am learning how to play US Open golf courses,''
said the native of Queensland, Australia. ``I am not in a hurry to
win a major. If I win one, that is going to be great. But I think
it may just take a little bit of time.''
</P>
<P>
   A rather cautionary approach, to be sure, like a safe shot to
the middle of a green. But even Webb concedes that the young can
win this event (Korean sensation Se Ri Pak prevailed in a playoff a
year ago at the tender age of 20), and if she thinks that she'll
learn the secret to winning the US Women's Open, there's another
player in the field of 156 who begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost think there's a way to figure it out, and there's
not,'' said Nancy Lopez, who is winless in 22 of these national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   For all of her greatness (48 wins) and for all she has meant to
women's golf, it seems unimaginable that Lopez is without a US
Women's Open. She doesn't dodge the subject, however. At 42, Lopez
rejects sympathy and embraces the yearly challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking that I can (win),'' said Lopez, four times a
runner-up in the Open. ``I know there were years when I put too
much pressure on myself and years when I didn't care. But after
Pumpkin Ridge (in 1997, when she finished a tearful second to
Alison Nicholas), I realized that I need to really set that as a
goal again, and it's happening this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb does not dream of emotional victory scenarios. She is
methodical and very serious about her golf, like David Duval a
superstar behind wraparound sunglasses who demonstrates very little
emotion. Great composure is a staple to her game, but there are
times when it leaves her. Such as at last year's US Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely lost my patience with nine holes to go,'' said
Webb. ``I still had a chance at a decent tournament, and I just
really lost my patience.''
</P>
<P>
   She had opened 76-73 at Blackwulf Run in Kohler, Wis., but moved
from 48th place to 18th after a third-round 73 on a course playing
so tough that 75 felt like 65. Webb had a chance entering the final
day but ballooned to 78 and finished tied for 31st.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who kept their patience were the ones that had a
chance to win,'' said Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the learning process, perhaps.
</P>

A BIT OF A GIGGLE AT ENGLISHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo of Julian Barnes is being sent to NYTNS clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling
212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julian Barnes's new novel, ``England, England,'' imagines a
fantasyland of Anglophilia that crams into the ultimate theme park
a thousand years of Englishness: everything from Robin Hood and the
royal family to Magna Carta and marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   If such a place existed, the exhibits could include Barnes, too.
He's a bit of a dream version of Englishness himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with my Englishness in the banal sense that I
can't be anything else,'' he recently explained over lunch this
week during a stop in Boston on his book tour. It goes beyond that,
though. Barnes could more than suffice as an updated Oxbridge John
Bull.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than just a matter of their sharing initials. Barnes,
53, speaks in a satiny baritone that's at once refined and relaxed:
a voice for reciting lines from a drawing-room comedy written by
Monty Python (in one of their few restrained moments).
</P>
<P>
   Charmingly self-aware, he's a blend of reserve and merriment:
polished, polite, and very funny. Barnes's manner suits his face, a
calm, bashful rectangle. Bisecting that rectangle is a great, hawky
nose whose prominence emphasizes the amused squint of his deep-set
eyes. It's a face that wouldn't have looked out of place beneath a
helmet at Agincourt, nor does the resemblance end there: Barnes has
an archer's large shoulders and thick, long fingers.
</P>
<P>
   His digits are less likely to be gripping a longbow than a cue
stick or hoe. Barnes's echt-Englishness extends beyond appearance
to avocation. His North London house boasts a well-used snooker
table, and he's a passionate gardener. He handles the vegetables,
and his wife, Patricia Kavanagh, a prominent English literary
agent, tends to the flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``England, England'' is nicely timed. These are heady days in
the United Kingdom. For one thing, it may not be united much
longer, with Wales and Scotland likely to achieve some measure of
political independence soon. For another, there's always the chance
it might stop being a kingdom: British republicans patiently wait
for the royal family to finally wear out its welcome. As for Prime
Minister Tony Blair, he's doing his best to turn the national
orientation from glorious past to well-hyped future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair says, `We want you to admire us for what we are and not
for what we were,' '' Barnes noted. ``I think what we `are' has not
been very firmly decided. It's not something we're good at thinking
about, not the English, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``England, England,'' Barnes does his best to rectify that.
Set in 2005, it concerns the efforts of media mogul Sir Jack Pitman
_ imagine Rupert Murdoch on a bad day _ to honor his homeland and
turn a healthy profit. After surveying prospective theme-park
patrons on the ``Fifty Quintessences of Englishness,'' Sir Jack
proceeds to assemble them (either the actual item or a reasonable
facsimile) and moves them to the Isle of Wight, just off the
southern English coast.
</P>
<P>
   It's all quite ridiculous, of course, except that life has
already begun to imitate Barnes's art. The third item on the list
is the Manchester United Football Club, which is to soccer what the
New York Yankees are to baseball. Last summer, Murdoch tried to buy
the team. Unlike Sir Jack, he failed. The British edition of
``England, England'' was published a few weeks before Murdoch
announced his bid. ``Whenever I'd read that section of the book,''
Barnes said with a smile, ``I'd try to avoid all sort of
self-congratulation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, at least, Barnes is atypical. Since Blair's
election two years ago, Britain has been awash in
self-congratulation under the banner of ``Cool Britannia,'' which
sounds suspiciously like something Sir Jack had his marketing
people work up. Instead, Barnes assigns the blame elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Newsweek's fault,'' he laughed. ``They sent (over)
some poor journalist who'd had it explained to him how horrible
London would be. . . . He had a nice meal. He went to a nice club.
He met a nice girl. He had a nice drink. And all of a sudden
Britain's swinging again! Whereupon the government dropped on to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's true. If you go to Paris, they say, `Paris is so
dull. London is where it's at.' I've been taking the Eurostar train
(to France), and at 11 o'clock in the morning it's full of
hung-over Dutch and German kids who've gone to London for a good
night's clubbing. The youth culture, the drug culture, the club
culture is maybe the best in Europe _ not my speciality _ but the
idea that all of a sudden you can get a good meal in London, all of
a sudden people have smiles on their faces there which they haven't
in 20 years, is preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists and even the general public might be living it up in
Britain, but things have clearly settled down at Buckingham Palace.
Oh, there's the occasional headline about the son of Prince
Charles's inamorata, Camilla Parker-Bowles, using cocaine, or a
tabloid photo capturing Prince Edward's fiancee bare-breasted.
Still, by recent standards, it's been all quiet on the royal front.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hand it to them,'' Barnes agreed. ``They are
immensely resilient. I went to see Diana's funeral cortege pass by
with some friends. One said, `Well, this has made the royal family
safe for another hundred years.' I think it's true. They've behaved
quite cannily, as well. They've allowed her to be sort of canonized
while at the same time repositioning Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the emotional bind that the Diana-philes are in is
they say, `Beastly royal family: They were frightful to St. Diana!
Now she's dead, let's get rid of the royal family!' They can't do
that because that would be disenfranchising Diana's children . . .
the elder of whom looks so much like Diana it's uncanny _ the shy
sulkiness, the underhung lip and jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barnes grew up in suburban London, the son of schoolteachers. It
was a boyhood out of the poetry of Philip Larkin _ emotionally
tidy, culturally intent, resolutely understated _ English
middle-class life at its most middling. There were seaside family
holidays (the first overnight vacation Barnes remembers was to the
Isle of Wight) and the long train rides each weekday he took into
the city and back for school.
</P>
<P>
   The one incongruous element in an otherwise uncompromisingly
English upbringing derived from the subject Barnes's parents
taught: French. Growing up in a household abuzz with circumflexes
and cedillas helped foster in Barnes and his older brother,
Jonathan, now a philosophy professor at the University of Geneva, a
most un-English cosmopolitanism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only someone deeply in love with French culture could
have written Barnes's most celebrated novel, ``Flaubert's Parrot''
(1984). ``I go to France as often as I can,'' he said over lunch,
and just before starting his book tour he and his wife spent a week
in St.-Paul-de-Vence. Barnes makes light of his French, but to hear
the bouquet of vowel and consonant he makes of the words
``sauvignon'' and ``blanc'' when he orders a glass of wine is to
feel a breeze off the banks of the Loire.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Barnes, who went to Oxford, majored in French.
After graduation, he spent three years working as a lexicographer
for the Oxford English Dictionary. He once described his assignment
as the ``sports and dirty-word department.'' He briefly studied law
in London, then turned to literary journalism. It took him eight
years to write his first novel, ``Metroland,'' published in 1981.
He's since made up for lost time with seven more novels, a short
story collection, a gathering of his ``Letters From London'' for
The New Yorker, and four detective novels under the pen name Dan
Kavanagh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at home and writing, it's a morning's work, and then
it's an afternoon of desk-clearing, bill-paying, servicing the
career _ `after-sales service,' as they call it in France _ maybe a
walk on (Hampstead) Heath, and then something social or out to a
concert in the evening. I like being alone through the day as long
as I know I'm getting society at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   That society tends to be literary. Barnes belongs to a circle
that includes his fellow novelists Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan, and
Kazuo Ishiguro. It used to be a quintet of novelists, until Martin
Amis abruptly dumped Barnes's wife as his agent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of friends who are writers, and a lot of them are
very good. I like that. . . . I'm not one of those writers who
wants to be the only writer in their social group. There are two
ways of looking at it: Some people are threatened by it, and others
feel they've gotten their fill and want to spend time with real
people. I count writers as real people, despite some evidence to
the contrary.''

 By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her
husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham
Clinton turned her attention to her life after his presidency.
 &HT;    From before the first vote that day until long after the last,
she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the
White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first
time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her
to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off
when Rep. Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first
suggested it in a Chicago church last October.
 &HT;    She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image,
from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy
work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity
spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to
the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's
affair with that woman.
 &HT;    Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes _ a scarred veteran of New
York politics and a former aide to her husband _ moved from the
living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the
living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.
 &HT;    Would she really want to be one of a hundred senators? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
 &HT;    The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half
a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor
Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the
prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named
Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend.
 &HT;    But like so many parallels between the century's two most
compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences
as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was
importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious
nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation,
while Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
 &HT;    ``I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in
which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just
days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her
children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want
to burden herself with having to follow what she called ``the party
line.''
 &HT;    ``I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,''
Eleanor continued briskly, ``but I think the knowledge that I will
be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.''
 &HT;    ``Free of any obligation'' _ it is an expression lustrous with
meaning for political spouses, and particularly for first ladies of
the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a
state prisoner, first ladies have felt oppressed by arranging
flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough
of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations.
 &HT;    Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office
for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends
and advisers say _ freedom to participate in politics fully, with
her own constituents, on her own terms, for her own purposes.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton is about to become a liberated woman. Come
January 2001, for the first time since she moved to Arkansas as a
26-year-old lawyer in 1974, she will be able to walk her own path
regardless of her husband's political career. While most people
provided such an opening might be fantasizing about anonymity and a
long break, Clinton is methodically exploring her options for
staying in the spotlight.
 &HT;    If she does not pull out of the New York race in June, she is
likely to announce an exploratory committee in July, knowing that
that will be regarded as throwing her hat in the ring. With that
announcement, the Clintons would neatly reverse roles, at least
regarding New York. She would step forward to present herself as a
leader, while he would be relegated to behind-the-scenes,
supporting chores.
 &HT;    To be sure, since she graduated from Yale Law School and opted
for Bill Clinton and Arkansas, it has become unremarkable for women
to compete for higher office.
 &HT;    As she pondered the Senate race, Clinton was standing in the way
of another woman, Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County, and an
older but far less traditional political spouse, Elizabeth Dole,
was running for president.
 &HT;    Clinton's race would be path-breaking, but only because she
would be undertaking it while her husband was still in office. In
that sense, it would certainly be pioneering for Clinton and for
first ladies, but not for women generally. She is too late for
that.
 &HT;    But so what? Clinton did not sacrifice her ambition to her
husband's so much as yoke them together. As a result of that
decision, it has been her fate to be judged more for how she has
stood by her man than for what she has accomplished with him and
more for what she represents as a woman than for what she has done
as first lady.
 &HT;    As it happens, she has done quite a bit. And the flip side of
the loyal role she has played is that she regards his
accomplishments as hers too. When she was saving his presidency
last year _ condemning unnamed conspirators and then sticking with
him after he admitted they were right about his affair _ she was
also saving her own.
 &HT;    By now, Hillary Clinton is operating under the presumption that
she will run for the Senate, and she is looking for a house in
Westchester County. Her goals remain rather vague, but her ambition
for service and confidence in herself remain intact and vaulting.
It is just that Bill Clinton is no longer the best vehicle.
 &HT;    But that does not mean that she will run, and that points up
another difference between the Clintons. When it comes to politics,
he works from the gut as well as from his beloved polls, while she
is more cerebral. The risks and challenges of a race excite him.
They scare her. This is a defining life decision for her, perhaps
the biggest she has made since her marriage, and in the end she may
decide not to gamble her popularity and political clout.
 &HT;    She does not want to lose. Horse-race polls don't mean much now,
but the ones that showed her running away with victory have been
replaced by others showing at best that she might squeak by
Giuliani. And some of her advisers are more worried about a
possible challenge from Rep. Rick Lazio, the Long Island
Republican, or even Gov. George Pataki.
 &HT;    ``One of the lures of being senator is you're out on your own,''
one of her advisers told me. ''One of the liabilities is you lose
on your own.''
 &HT;    Paradoxically, Clinton's record in her husband's office is
clearest where it is least relevant to the voters who might elect
her. Far more than in the United States, Hillary Clinton has found
her own voice overseas. She has spent more days this year in North
Africa than in New York. And abroad, she conducts a sort of shadow
presidency, with advisers borrowed from assorted agencies and an
aging 707 whose port engine periodically bursts into flames.
 &HT;    She does it with what amounts to her own foreign policy,
promoting issues of women's rights, health care and development
that her husband addresses rarely, and almost always with her at
his side. In her speeches abroad, she seldom even mentions the
president, not wanting to muddy her message of female empowerment
by acknowledging that her influence derives from his power.
 &HT;    Yet Clinton's passion for that role could be a problem in New
York, where it plays into what her advisers view as her chief
liability: the suspicion that she would have her eye on concerns
far from Binghamton or the Bronx. It has probably not helped her
that in her remarks about a possible race, she has tended to dwell
on why New York is big enough for her, rather than vice versa.
 &HT;    ``New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she recently told
reporters in Manhattan. Chuck Schumer has advised Clinton that if
she decides to run, she will have to devote herself completely to
the race. ``You can't be both first lady and candidate,'' he says.
 &HT;    As first lady, she has had two luxuries that will vanish if she
presents herself as a candidate: picking and choosing what issues
she wants to address and falling back on exhortation rather than
specific proposals to solve the problems she raises.
 &HT;    Her record of passionate concern for children would surely give
her great credibility on issues like gun violence in the schools,
which after Littleton she is turning into a crusade. (``I have not
stopped thinking about it,'' she told me.)
 &HT;    When I asked her what specifically she hopes to accomplish as a
senator or citizen, she began by replying, ``Well, you know, I'm
concerned about a broad range of issues.''
 &HT;    Then she gathered speed. ``You know, much of what I care about
falls into the broad categories of creating conditions for children
to grow up and be healthy and well educated and productive
citizens. And so that means I'm interested in everything from
economic policy to education policy to adoption and foster care and
welfare policy to health care.'' She laced her fingers together as
she added, ``I think that all of these social, political, economic,
cultural issues intersect.''
 &HT;    Clinton is widely viewed as more liberal than her husband, but
there is not much evidence to support that. In Arkansas, it was
Hillary who persuaded Bill to advocate the testing of public-school
teachers. The efficacy of the test is debatable, but there is no
question it angered some of their staunchest liberal supporters.
 &HT;    ``You know, people think she's such a big lib,'' says Maggie
Williams, Clinton's former chief of staff and one of her closest
friends. ``I think she's extremely conservative. I think she has
more in common with people in upstate New York than in New York
City, in a lot of ways.'' Williams calls Clinton ``patriotic and
practical. She thinks it's important to spend money on social
programs, but she wants to know that they work.''
 &HT;    Maybe so. But until she stands on her own politically, none of
us can know.
 &HT;    After Clinton stuck by her husband through the Lewinsky scandal,
she came to present a fat target for those who found her wanting as
a feminist. And it is hard not to wince these days over some things
she says, at times so self-righteously.
 &HT;    ``We can point to many problems around our world today where
women _ for reasons of history, culture, discrimination, prejudice
_ are used to lift up patriarchy, are used really as objects in
order for others to exercise power,'' she said in commemorating
International Women's Day this year.
 &HT;    Clinton makes no apologies for her decisions last year. In the
interview, she said at first that ``people have to make their own
judgments about that,'' but then went on to suggest they had no
business doing so. A bit paradoxically, she presented her actions
as evidence of her independence and self-sufficiency.
 &HT;    ``I would hope that young women _ women of all ages _ understand
how important it is to live your own life according to your own
values,'' she said, unspooling one of those lengthy sentences
characteristic of either Clinton, ``and not be constantly looking
over your shoulder to think what anybody else is thinking about you
or saying about you, because ultimately, at the end of the day, you
have to live with yourself and you have to do what you think is
right. And again, my choices may not be someone else's choices.''
 &HT;    When it comes to the Clintons, it is hard to separate the
personal and the political. Regardless of her feelings for him,
leaving her husband last year would have brought down a presidency
she believes in to her bones.
 &HT;    Some of the Clintons' closest associates have regarded their
relationship for years as a partnership with staged shows of
affection _ ``what they had to for the moment,'' as one of them put
it to me. Even some of Hillary Clinton's friends wonder if she will
stay with him after they leave the White House.
 &HT;    But politics did not keep the Clintons together, according to
other, closer friends of Hillary. She considered leaving him last
year, they say, but her daughter and her marriage vows stopped her.
Most important, they insist, she still loves him.
 &HT;    ``She loves him, and she doesn't have to, but she does,'' one
said. Part of the reason, this friend said, is their intellectual
bond: ``Whether you think they're changing things for better or
worse, they're always going to have something to say to each other
about it.''
 &HT;    But maybe it is time to leave wondering if the Clintons truly
love each other to the historians and to focus on the
accomplishments, failures and ideas that define his presidency and
would define her Senate race.
 &HT;    If Clinton runs, she is likely to limit her husband's role,
though he will try to meddle. Indeed, it has not escaped some of
her friends that being forced onto the sidelines would be
excruciating punishment for him, as, without a campaign of his own,
he watches his wife and his vice president run.
 &HT;    But Hillary Clinton wants to find out what she can do on her
own, they say. Further, having her husband front and center would
make her look weak.
 &HT;    And therein lies a delightful switch. For years, White House
aides have praised Hillary Clinton's ability and contributions
while in the next breath minimizing her influence in order to build
up the president. Now, Hillary's allies are unself-consciously
treating her husband the same way.
 &HT;    ``She'd be a fool not to work with him very closely on this,''
one of them told me. ``It will, however, be Hillary Rodham
Clinton's campaign. It'll be her voice, and it'll be her persona. I
see him playing very much a behind-the-scenes role.''

 By JAMES BENNET  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the windy Friday in February that the Senate acquitted her
husband of perjury and obstruction of justice, Hillary Rodham
Clinton turned her attention to her life after his presidency.
 &HT;    From before the first vote that day until long after the last,
she met with her friend Harold Ickes on the second floor of the
White House, in the family quarters, to weigh whether for the first
time to promote herself rather than Bill Clinton for public office.
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton felt flattered that Democrats were begging her
to run for the Senate from New York, an idea she had laughed off
when Rep. Charles Rangel, the mischievous Manhattan Democrat, first
suggested it in a Chicago church last October.
 &HT;    She was delighted with the shift under way in her public image,
from passive victim to political heavyweight. After all her policy
work and speechifying, it had galled her to watch her popularity
spike upward in the past year as she turned her lapidary smile to
the world and suffered through the revelations of her husband's
affair with that woman.
 &HT;    Now, for four hours, as she and Ickes _ a scarred veteran of New
York politics and a former aide to her husband _ moved from the
living room to lunch in the family dining room and back to the
living room, she plumbed the risks of a race for the Senate seat
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan had decided to vacate.
 &HT;    Would she really want to be one of a hundred senators? Could she
survive a street fight with a nasty opponent? Could she stand the
pawing of New York City's feral reporters?
 &HT;    The backing and forthing with Ickes had fitting precedent. Half
a century ago, a woman Clinton regards as a role model, Eleanor
Roosevelt, mulled running for the Senate from New York at the
prompting of a former adviser to her husband. He was also named
Harold Ickes; he was the father of Hillary Clinton's friend.
 &HT;    But like so many parallels between the century's two most
compelling first ladies, this one illuminates as many differences
as similarities. Hillary had summoned her Harold, while Eleanor was
importuned by hers. Pulled between her lofty aims and her cautious
nature, Hillary was embarking on months of painstaking cogitation,
while Eleanor almost immediately turned her Harold down.
 &HT;    ``I feel very strongly that running for office is not the way in
which I can be most useful,'' she wrote him on May 26, 1945, just
days after he raised the idea. She did not want to burden her
children with another office-holding parent. She also did not want
to burden herself with having to follow what she called ``the party
line.''
 &HT;    ``I hope to continue to work with the Democrats and for them,''
Eleanor continued briskly, ``but I think the knowledge that I will
be free of any obligation may at times be very healthy.''
 &HT;    ``Free of any obligation'' _ it is an expression lustrous with
meaning for political spouses, and particularly for first ladies of
the United States. Since Martha Washington likened herself to a
state prisoner, first ladies have felt oppressed by arranging
flowers or delivering speeches, by wielding influence or not enough
of it, by the private compromises and the planetary humiliations.
 &HT;    Eleanor Roosevelt feared continued limitation in winning office
for herself. Hillary Clinton glimpses freedom, or so her friends

PROFIT AND PRINCIPLE: INVESTING WITH SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS

   When the New England Aquarium went shopping recently for a new
investment choice to add to its employee retirement plan, it joined
The Gap, Hewlett-Packard, and the American Medical Association in
choosing an alternative dedicated to principles as well as profits.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund that the Aquarium selected, Domini Social
Equity, marries the pursuit of riches with environmental and social
concerns by shunning stocks in companies that pollute,
discriminate, or make harmful products.
</P>
<P>
   Such do-good funds, whose ideological roots lie in the
18th-century Quakers' aversion to liquor and gambling outfits, have
quietly gained in popularity among some investors in recent years.
Now they are starting to show up in retirement plans, the principal
savings vehicles for millions of working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So-called socially responsible funds generally avoid investing
in companies that make cigarettes, alcohol, or military weapons,
and employ elaborate screens to select firms based on their
environmental record or hiring policies.
</P>
<P>
   But as they exhort investors to make ethical choices and seek to
improve corporate America, principled portfolios raise a host of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that socially responsible funds hold most of the
same blue chips that other funds hold, and decry them as mostly a
clever sales pitch. What is so virtuous, they ask, about owning the
Wal-Marts and Intels everyone else has?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think of the missionaries who went to Hawaii to do
good and wound up doing well by owning lots of land,'' said A.
Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Inc., the fund tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, socially responsible stock funds _ there are around
50 of them _ are still only a fraction of the nation's $5.5
trillion fund business, which offers investors more than 8,000
different funds. Barely several hundred of the country's more than
700,000 retirement plans include a social fund.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons? Many such funds are viewed as underperformers that
swap returns for political correctness _ not a selling point in a
bull market. The average socially responsible growth fund gained
11.6 percent over the past 12 months, compared with 19 percent for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the broad market measure that has
produced most of Wall Street's gains in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many corporate retirement plan sponsors fear they could be
shirking their duties in offering a fund that may produce lower
returns by refusing to own certain stocks. Against that
conservative ethic, only well-known, mainstream funds tend to make
it into 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, improved returns by many social portfolios have
given them fresh appeal. Sales of such funds, a mere $70 million in
1995, were $520 million over the first four months of this year,
nearly as much as in all of 1998, according to Lipper. The rise
comes amid a slowdown in general equity fund sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard Group, a giant fund firm that is considering
creating a socially responsible fund, has seen ``a modest uptick''
in demand for such portfolios, according to spokesman John Woerth.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of
America, a group for retirement-plan providers, said that state
associations, nonprofits, and university endowments are especially
keen on social funds, since they have fewer legal shackles than
companies in choosing retirement plan offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most traditional money managers are troubled by the
subjective criteria that social portfolios use to anoint one stock
but skewer another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do see some interest for socially responsible funds from
retirement plan sponsors, primarily nonprofits,'' said Debra
McConnell, a spokeswoman for Fidelity Investments, the nation's
biggest fund firm and manager of one in four US retirement plans.
But while Fidelity sells Domini's fund, it has no plans to create a
similar fund of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for us,'' McConnell said, ``is that it's difficult
to define what is socially responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who fervently believe that investors can change the
world wrestle with that question.
</P>
<P>
   Take Amy L. Domini, the doyenne of social investing and manager
of Domini Social Equity.
</P>
<P>
   Domini won't buy shares in General Electric, whose operations
include defense contracting, or Texaco, the oil giant that had
problems with discrimination. And she doesn't own shoemaker Nike,
because of its alleged sweatshop operations in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But she does hold Reebok _ a competitor accused of the same
offense. ``Nike was removed from the index because so many
activists called for it and it attracted so much attention,''
Domini explained. ``Until they do the same to Reebok, it stays on
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   And take Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Domini loves the retailer's ``Buy America'' stance and focus on
recycled packaging. But she admits to discomfort over Wal-Mart's
sales of guns, especially after the school shootings in Littleton,
Colo. ``Wal-Mart sells guns but doesn't make them, so they don't
flunk the gun screen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Merck, a pharmaceutical stock that many social
funds shun. Domini owns it, despite Merck's 12 Superfund
environmental cleanup sites. The reason: the company also spends $1
million a year on a biodiversity project in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definitions can get a little squishy,'' said Domini,
adding that she did not see gray areas as a deterrent to cracking
the lucrative retirement plan market.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe investors don't need to define what's socially
responsible,'' she said. ``Maybe they just need to become better.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor habits are a window onto the Zeitgeist, and observers
posit various causes behind recent fresh interest in social
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Investing with a conscience first emerged in the 1980s as a way
for investors to avoid stocks in companies that did business in
apartheid-era South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   These days, according to Steve Scheuth, president of the
non-profit Social Investment Forum, concern over corporate
polluters and workplace diversity have replaced political worries.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that far from becoming more ethical, investors are
simply chasing returns that let them feel good _ the wealth effect
with a guilty conscience. Others observers, like Lipper, wonder if
images of Kosovo refugees aren't subconsciously spurring do-good
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Still others point to lawsuits that have demonized tobacco
makers, Hollywood's support of Tibet, and a rise in shareholder
activism. Marketers cite a growing willingness by consumers to ally
purchasing habits with personal ethics _ a philosophy behind niche
social funds like the Timothy Fund, which targets Christian
fundamentalists opposed to companies associated with abortion, and
the MFS Union Standard Equity fund, which is designed to appeal to
labor union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the interest is palpable. At Domini Social
Investments, the Boston and New York firm that launched modern
social investing, Domini Social Equity has tripled in assets in the
past 15 months _ in part to a rising stock market, but also due to
a flood of new cash. The fund, which has $966 million in assets and
is the best known of the genre, is taking in $2 million a day in
new money, four times 1997's level.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, one-quarter of its assets are now in retirement
plans, compared with 1 percent in 1998. At the Wisconsin Education
Association, a teachers' union, employees are putting nearly as
much retirement cash into Domini's fund as into Vanguard's popular
Index 500 fund.
</P>
<P>
   One appeal of Domini's portfolio is its index fund structure _
the flavor of the moment among investors. The portfolio holds 400
stocks that Domini and partners have screened for their Domini
Social Index, a barometer styled as an ``ethical'' version of the
S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   But Domini Social Equity's main draw may be its long-term
results. While up only 3.2 percent this year through last Thursday,
less than the average growth fund, it rose 33 percent in 1998 and
36 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With its Puritan overtones, it is no surprise to find social
investing's modern capital in New England and nearby. A dozen or so
outfits, led by Domini and including Citizens Trust in Portsmouth,
N.H.; Progessive Asset Management in Wellesley; the Calvert Group
in Bethesda, Md.; and Trillium Asset Management and Green Century
Funds, both of Boston, manage money and analyze companies' hiring
practices, community involvement, product safety, and employee
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms file shareholder resolutions at companies whose
stocks they own. Those actions, Domini said, empower investors and
help corporations improve their practices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lipper said social funds will never have more than a
niche appeal to investors.
</P>
<P>
   But others see a different future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a company like Hewlett-Packard now has a social
fund,'' said Wray, the retirement forum head, ``will make the rest
of the business community sit up and take notice.''

MAGAZINE MARKS SERIOUS STRIDES, BUT WHAT OF KIDS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Twenty years ago this month, a group of women writers and
editors came up with a novel idea: Why not create a magazine that
speaks to the concerns of working mothers?
</P>
<P>
   A test issue of ``Working Mother'' magazine, which was published
in 1978, included an article entitled, ``How Can I Leave That Baby?
Mothers Tell Why They Return To Work So Soon After Birth Of Their
Babies.'' Another explained how children rate babysitters. An
overwhelming response to that edition led to the magazine's birth
in 1979. Since then, circulation has grown from 200,000 to 925,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, it is clear that the influx of women into the
workplace, the growing reliance on technology, and a changing
economy have had a profound impact on how and where we work.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that had valued ``face time'' above all else now have
programs that include part-time work, job sharing and four-day work
weeks. Workers who were once tied to the office now work from home,
with the help of computers, faxes, e-mail and video conferencing.
Some firms now have day-care centers on their corporate campuses,
while others are erecting schools. Paternity leave, not as
widespread as maternity leave, offers a small cadre of fathers time
to bond with their children. And a push to expand the Families and
Medical Leave Act to include paid time off is expected to extend
the benefit to those who can ill afford any time off from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pioneers, women who went to work in the 1960s, faced
blatant sexism at work and at home,'' said Judsen Culbreth,
editor-in-chief of ``Working Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was common practice for a woman to hand in her resignation
at the same time that she announced her pregnancy. In contrast,
women starting their careers in the 1990s, the inheritors, are
likely to be given a tour of the lactation facility and on-site
day-care center,'' Judsen said.
</P>
<P>
   But while today's working mothers have far more options than the
women whom ``Working Mother'' first profiled, many have similar
concerns. New mothers still feel guilty about leaving their young
children, even when they know the children are being cared for
properly.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, sociologist Nancy Chodorow said that some of the
guilt working women were feeling had stemmed from the way they had
been socialized, and from the fact that men were not assuming full
parenting roles. Chodorow reasoned that if women did all the child
management and household chores, their daughters would acquire
attributes necessary for mothering.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chodorow said, their boys would avoid the very
qualities the mothers were trying to teach. She maintained that
when raised in households where women always care for the young,
boys assume dominant, masculine roles to prove their masculinity.
To break the cycle, men and women must begin to share parenting,
Chodorow reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, men and women are still grappling with this
issue. One reason, said Francine M. Deutsch, author of ``Halving It
All: How Equally Shared Parenting Works,'' (Harvard University
Press 1999, $24.95) is that men's attempts at hands-on parenting
are often ignored or treated as aberrations, by outsiders, and
sometimes by wives. The wives, it was found, are afraid to
relinquish part of their role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers are often treated like invisible parents,'' Deutsch
said. ``Imagine this scenario: The mother of a child's friend calls
to arrange a play date. Dad answers the phone. The mother who has
called asks to speak to the child's mother. In this very normal and
everyday occurrence, the father, who is expected not to know
anything about playdates, has been told that he is superfluous.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch says the expectation that women know more about child
care than men has become a reality because women have been given
more encouragement. Moreover, men have been forced to act like
invisible dads in the workplace, especially in traditional
corporate cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powerful social expectations are conveyed even before the baby
is born,'' Deutsch wrote in her book. One father, identified only
as ``Larry,'' took paternity leave so that he could bond with his
newborn child and was surprised by the differences in questions
that were posed to him and his wife after the infant's birth.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that when his wife, Joyce, was pregnant, people said
to her, ``So, when are you quitting work?'' They turned to him and
asked whether he planned to take on more hours, or another job, not
realizing that the couple had decided that Joyce would work
full-time while Larry worked fewer hours to care for the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a working mother must still fight to retain her
standing in a corporate world that assumes she will be less engaged
in her job once her baby is born. Some mothers never mention their
children at work, or show their pictures, for fear that such
displays might be seen as unprofessional. Others become Super Moms,
a tendency that almost became the norm in the 1980s, when women
were first trying to climb the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In its anniversary issue, ``Working Mother,'' reported that
women have gained more than a toehold on that ladder. Armed with
undergraduate and advanced degrees, many are now primary
breadwinners. In fact, of 54 million households with married
couples, 5.5 percent now rely on the wife to bring home a
significant chunk of the family's total income. And, in some
dual-earner families, nearly 25 percent of the women earn more than
their husbands, up from 18 percent in 1987 and 4.4 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The women's organization Catalyst reported that of 461 female
vice presidents surveyed in 1996, 75 percent were primary
breadwinners. In addition, 72 percent were married, and 64 percent
had children.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of these changes is that the issue of sharing
responsibility at home, for the first time, is being turned on its
head. Now the biggest challenge is whether working mothers and
fathers who share child care and housework can fully alter their
workplaces and social norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are now seeing is that more and more parents, not just
women, are demanding flexibility and are bucking the whole issue of
face-time,'' Katherine Cartwright, senior editor of ``Working
Mother,'' said. ``Women have tried for years, but we also need dads
to buy into this in order to take it to the next level. Slowly, we
are getting there. But I think it will take another 20 years before
we can look back and say, `Look how far we've come.' ''

 &HT;    
 By LISA BELKIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Operating room No. 5 at University Hospital in Denver is chilled
almost to the point of refrigeration, but already the team of
surgeons is sweating. The noxious scent of burning flesh fills the
air as a cauterizing instrument slices through the skin. Next comes
the snapping sound of bone, first one rib removed, then another,
until finally the target is in view.
 &HT;    ``His lung looks awful,'' says Dr. Marvin Pomerantz, one of a
small fraternity of surgeons in the world who would even attempt
this operation. ``I always hope it will be better than expected,
but it never is.''
 &HT;    The young man on the table has tuberculosis. His is a sinister
strain, resistant to all known medication, and his right lung, or
what remains of it, shows the devastation of the disease. A lung
should be pink, nestling in the chest like a delicate balloon. This
one is mottled and marbled, a red so dark it is almost black.
Beneath it, unseen, is the heart. As it beats, the lung jumps,
looking dangerous and angry.
 &HT;    The scarring from both the illness itself and the techniques
used to fight it have left the landscape of this chest cavity
scrambled beyond recognition. ``Nothing,'' Pomerantz explains, ``is
where it should be.''
 &HT;    This is less a surgery, therefore, than an excavation, as the
surgeons chip their way through the anatomical debris. The
operation began at 9 a.m.. More than two hours pass before
Pomerantz finds something familiar. ``Here's the edge of the
diaphragm,'' he says, his eyes dark with concentration over his
surgical mask. ``This is my first good landmark.''
 &HT;    The digging and snipping will go on for six hours, and Pomerantz
grows tired as he works. ``I'm a dinosaur,'' he says, and that is
exactly why he is here.
 &HT;    Medicine is supposed to march forward. Drugs, therapies,
surgical procedures _ they are all expected to become ever simpler
and more effective. That, by definition and historical precedent,
is scientific progress. But while the past decade has brought
hurtling advances, it has also brought a growing awareness that
medicine cannot always maintain its slim lead.
 &HT;    Not all that many years ago, doctors had declared victory over
infectious disease. Then the plague of AIDS appeared from nowhere
and, at the same time, bacteria that had been considered drugged
into submission mutated anew into a formidable threat.
 &HT;    ``The ancient Greeks warned of this,'' says Dr. Michael Iseman,
a pulmonologist at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center
in Denver and one of the country's leading experts on tuberculosis.
``It was hubris to believe our own press notices. We thought we
were going to conquer tuberculosis just as we thought we were going
to conquer infectious disease. But DNA wants to replicate itself,
it wants to live on and it will mutate and survive in a Darwinian
way.''
 &HT;    The same can be said of modern medicine, which is undergoing its
own unexpected counter-evolution. While still looking forward for
answers, investing in ideas that are new and untried, science is
also beginning to look back, reinvesting in ideas that have long
been abandoned. Removing all or part of a lung to stop tuberculosis
was the treatment of the 1950s.
 &HT;    Even then it was seen as a drastic and brutal approach, and by
the early 1960s a powerful generation of medications made the
surgery obsolete. Now, more than three decades later, Pomerantz
this year will perform about 30 lobectomies (partial lung removals)
and pneumonectomies (complete lung removals) on patients with
incurable microbacterial infections (a total of 350 since he began
anew in 1983).
 &HT;    ``Drugs put us out of business,'' Pomerantz says. ``Drug
resistance brought us back.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz gives his age as ``more than 60, less than Medicare.''
While he was completing his residency at Duke University Medical
Center between 1959 and 1967, TB was still a part of his training.
 &HT;    But his was the last group of surgeons to learn their trade in
the era of TB wards and sanitariums, and when surgery was later
resurrected to fight TB, Pomerantz called his own former mentor,
now a retired octogenarian, for advice. Then he tried to teach what
he remembered to a generation of young surgeons who have never
navigated their way through a TB-marred chest.
 &HT;    This return to the old ways has its notes of vindication. ``It
reminds us not to devalue the types of treatments that came
before,'' says Dr. Barron H. Lerner, a physician and medical
historian at the Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons and the author of ``Contagion and Confinement,'' a history
of tuberculosis. ``Generally, people look back at these types of
procedures with disdain. They were seen as the types of things
people did when they didn't know what they were doing. But it's
really fortunate that there are people around who can still do
these operations.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz takes no satisfaction from the new premium being put
on his old skills, nor from this new awareness that medicine is not
a straight road but a looping and meandering one.
 &HT;    ``Don't think for a minute that I want to be doing this,'' he
says. ``It would be better if the drugs worked for everything _
cancer, heart disease, TB, but drugs will never be the 100 percent
answer. It's time we stop believing in a magic pill.''
 &HT;    The patient, Sonesacksith Choummanivong, is a 22-year-old
fine-arts student who is known to his family and his doctors as
Toon. The word means ``groundhog'' in Laotian, his native language,
and it became his nickname because, as an infant, he had chubby
cheeks. The moniker has stuck, a sad counterpoint to all the years
of illness that have left him gaunt and pale.
 &HT;    There is poignancy, too, in the fact that this gentle young man,
with his delicate artist's fingers, represents everything today's
infectious disease doctors fear. To them he is the personification
of contagion, the harbinger of an epidemic, the future of
tuberculosis in the United States.
 &HT;    Complacency, they remind us, led to a sharp spike in cases of TB
during the early 1990s. Vigilance then brought the numbers back
down within the country, but while Americans have been looking
inward, pleased with their progress, a new danger has arisen from
without. Last year, 40 percent of patients with tuberculosis had
come to the United States from other countries, an increase from 16
percent in 1982.
 &HT;    And therein lies the threat. The overall TB rate in New York
City is down to 21.3 per 100,000. Compare that to Bombay, where the
rate is 500 per 100,000. The crisis in Russia's prisons, in turn,
makes the Bombay statistics seem insignificant.
 &HT;    ``If you were a diabolical terrorist and you wanted to
manufacture multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, you would create an
environment and a system of care like the one in the Russian
prisons,'' says Dr. Lee B. Reichman, executive director of the New
Jersey Medical School National Tuberculosis Center.
 &HT;    He recently toured those prisons and saw, among other things,
poorly ventilated rooms where 30 prisoners shared 10 beds, sleeping
in shifts. Last year 20,000 Russian prison inmates fell ill with
strains of TB that resisted known medications. Many of those
infected inmates were then released, and they spread the disease to
15,000 civilians.
 &HT;    Some illnesses are virulent in their contagion. Put a student
with chicken pox at the front of a large lecture hall, and he
could, within minutes, infect a large percentage of the room. AIDS,
by contrast, is remarkably difficult to catch, because its
transmission requires contact with bodily fluids.
 &HT;    Tuberculosis falls somewhere in the middle. In the days before
antibiotics, doctors did experiments that included placing TB
patients in a closed room and directing air from that room into
cages filled with guinea pigs. They learned that a person must, on
average, exchange 11,000 cubic feet of air to have a 50 percent
chance of being infected. That translates into two months of
24-hour-a-day contact or six months of 8-hour-a-day contact.
 &HT;    ``Whenever there's an outbreak, reporters start calling and they
all ask, 'Can you get it on the subway?''' Reichman says. Because
the above figures are an average, he says, ``we tell them,
'Statistically, the answer is yes, you can, but it's more likely
the subway will crash.'''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, researchers estimate that each person with active
TB will go on to infect between 9 and 12 others, meaning a minimum
of 3.5 million new drug-resistant cases in Russia alone in the next
year. Now add modern transportation to this mix. ``It's tempting to
some people to talk about keeping the foreigners out,'' Reichman
says. ``Unfortunately _ or fortunately _ you can't. So we have to
confront the problem, not hide from it.''
 &HT;    Toon Choummanivong escaped from a crowded and chaotic Thai
resettlement camp in 1983, when he was 5. He, his parents and five
siblings legally settled in Holland, Mich., which is 45 minutes
south of Grand Rapids. A few years later, his father developed a
shortness of breath, night sweats and fever _ symptoms similar to
ones he'd had as a refugee in Thailand.
 &HT;    Although the family's medical history is sketchy, Toon's doctors
assume his father had been treated in Thailand with the ``first
line'' tuberculosis drugs that could once automatically cure this
disease. Because he was a penniless man in a poor country where the
health-care system was haphazard at best, he probably took those
medicines only long enough to feel better, which was not long
enough to kill all the TB bacilli in his body.
 &HT;    When he stopped taking his pills, the bugs that remained
continued to grow. Those bacilli were, by definition, the strongest
and most resistant. When he became ill again years later, in
Michigan, his disease had mutated beyond the power of the drugs. He
died in 1989.
 &HT;    Determined to live a healthy life, Toon played tennis and
soccer. He funneled his extra energies into his artwork _ bold
portraits and colorful landscapes. He ate carefully and did not
smoke or drink, even during his first semester at Dordt College in
Sioux Center, Iowa. By Christmas break in December 1995, however,
he was haggard and hacking. The symptoms were alarmingly familiar,
and they led him to Kent Community Hospital in Michigan, the same
hospital where his father died.
 &HT;    The diagnosis for Toon, too, was tuberculosis, and he was placed
in a jury-rigged isolation room for three months. Ventilation is
one low-tech but effective weapon against TB, so an unrelenting
fan, the size of a night table, was placed inches from his bed. It
ran night and day.
 &HT;    Too exhausted to tie on a mask and walk to the lounge down the
hall, he spent weeks alone, drawing with pencils in his
ever-present sketch pad. It was the dawning of the new reality of
his life _ months when no one would talk to him without hiding
behind a mask. He dared not hope for any relationship deeper than
friendship.
 &HT;    ``I've never been with anyone,'' he says. ``How can I be?'' His
life lacked even the intimacy of a smile. His portraits from that
time are striking in that they have no faces.
 &HT;    Every day he took dozens of pills _ multicapsule doses of INH,
rifampin, PZA and ethambutol. Those medications were probably the
same ones his father had taken, the ones that still cure nearly all
non-drug-resistant patients. In retrospect, his doctors now say,
they were not the best choice. Toon, they now know, did not bring
his strain of TB with him from the camps; he caught it from his
father, meaning the bugs were already resistant.
 &HT;    The medications worked well enough that within a few months Toon
felt better. The microscope, however, saw things differently. When
a sputum sample was ``cultured out,'' it grew TB bacilli, evidence
that he still harbored the disease in his lungs. The hospital sent
him home in March 1996 with a month's supply of pills. No matter
how healthy he felt, they said, he had to swallow those pills.
 &HT;    Toon had no objection to taking his medicines, because these
first-line drugs had no side effects. He also willingly observed
the restrictions on enclosed spaces _ no shopping malls or stores
or movies _ because he was reared with a respect for the rules. The
day he left the hospital, he went to the park with his brother and,
fueled by the exhilaration of being outdoors, played soccer for
three hours, until he was exhausted. He was celebrating the end of
an ordeal. He was celebrating too soon.
 &HT;    This young man lost his right lung in November. I was in the
operating room, gowned and wearing the ultraprotective mask that
resembles a duck's bill, as Pomerantz finally freed the diseased
and disfigured tissue from the chest wall and sent it off to the
pathology lab.
 &HT;    This was not my first time in an operating room, and the times I
have been lucky enough to observe surgery, I have found it
mesmerizing and beautiful. Watching a heart transplant I was awed
by the vibrant colors _ a work of art that nature never intended
for us to see _ and the moment when the donor heart was tripped to
life.
 &HT;    Choummanivong's surgery was another defining experience. It was
not beautiful; it was brutal _ hour upon hour of chipping away at
an enemy that would not surrender. The other procedures I had seen
were about giving back, replacing or fixing. This was only about
loss.
 &HT;    For several months after the final pneumonectomy,
Choummanivong's health improved. He was discharged from the
hospital before Christmas, and he weaned himself from the tanks of
oxygen that he considered such a burden. His monthly cultures were
negative for TB.
 &HT;    In late February, Toon got permission to drive with his brother
the 19 hours back to Michigan for a visit. While there, he fell ill
and thought he'd caught the flu from his young nephew. Back in
Denver, he arrived at his next appointment with an oxygen tube in
his nose, dragging the heavy canister behind him. He was shivering
and short of breath and he had dropped more than 10 pounds from his
already frail frame.
 &HT;    The next few months were agony for Choummanivong. Tests showed
he did not have the flu at all. The empty space in his right chest
had filled with TB-infected fluid. Because some surgical staples
had detached, the fluid _ with its traces of TB _ had crossed over
into his remaining lung.
 &HT;    It would take two more surgeries and an experimental new
antibiotic to control the problem. His doctors say it is still too
soon to say whether this fine young man will survive.

 By LISA BELKIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Operating room No. 5 at University Hospital in Denver is chilled
almost to the point of refrigeration, but already the team of
surgeons is sweating. The noxious scent of burning flesh fills the
air as a cauterizing instrument slices through the skin. Next comes
the snapping sound of bone, first one rib removed, then another,
until finally the target is in view.
 &HT;    ``His lung looks awful,'' says Dr. Marvin Pomerantz, one of a
small fraternity of surgeons in the world who would even attempt
this operation. ``I always hope it will be better than expected,
but it never is.''
 &HT;    The young man on the table has tuberculosis. His is a sinister
strain, resistant to all known medication, and his right lung, or
what remains of it, shows the devastation of the disease. A lung
should be pink, nestling in the chest like a delicate balloon. This
one is mottled and marbled, a red so dark it is almost black.
Beneath it, unseen, is the heart. As it beats, the lung jumps,
looking dangerous and angry.
 &HT;    The scarring from both the illness itself and the techniques
used to fight it have left the landscape of this chest cavity
scrambled beyond recognition. ``Nothing,'' Pomerantz explains, ``is
where it should be.''
 &HT;    This is less a surgery, therefore, than an excavation, as the
surgeons chip their way through the anatomical debris. The
operation began at 9 a.m.. More than two hours pass before
Pomerantz finds something familiar. ``Here's the edge of the
diaphragm,'' he says, his eyes dark with concentration over his
surgical mask. ``This is my first good landmark.''
 &HT;    The digging and snipping will go on for six hours, and Pomerantz
grows tired as he works. ``I'm a dinosaur,'' he says, and that is
exactly why he is here.
 &HT;    Medicine is supposed to march forward. Drugs, therapies,
surgical procedures _ they are all expected to become ever simpler
and more effective. That, by definition and historical precedent,
is scientific progress. But while the past decade has brought
hurtling advances, it has also brought a growing awareness that
medicine cannot always maintain its slim lead.
 &HT;    Not all that many years ago, doctors had declared victory over
infectious disease. Then the plague of AIDS appeared from nowhere
and, at the same time, bacteria that had been considered drugged
into submission mutated anew into a formidable threat.
 &HT;    ``The ancient Greeks warned of this,'' says Dr. Michael Iseman,
a pulmonologist at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center
in Denver and one of the country's leading experts on tuberculosis.
``It was hubris to believe our own press notices. We thought we
were going to conquer tuberculosis just as we thought we were going
to conquer infectious disease. But DNA wants to replicate itself,
it wants to live on and it will mutate and survive in a Darwinian
way.''
 &HT;    The same can be said of modern medicine, which is undergoing its
own unexpected counter-evolution. While still looking forward for
answers, investing in ideas that are new and untried, science is
also beginning to look back, reinvesting in ideas that have long
been abandoned. Removing all or part of a lung to stop tuberculosis
was the treatment of the 1950s.
 &HT;    Even then it was seen as a drastic and brutal approach, and by
the early 1960s a powerful generation of medications made the
surgery obsolete. Now, more than three decades later, Pomerantz
this year will perform about 30 lobectomies (partial lung removals)
and pneumonectomies (complete lung removals) on patients with
incurable microbacterial infections (a total of 350 since he began
anew in 1983).
 &HT;    ``Drugs put us out of business,'' Pomerantz says. ``Drug
resistance brought us back.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz gives his age as ``more than 60, less than Medicare.''
While he was completing his residency at Duke University Medical
Center between 1959 and 1967, TB was still a part of his training.
 &HT;    But his was the last group of surgeons to learn their trade in
the era of TB wards and sanitariums, and when surgery was later
resurrected to fight TB, Pomerantz called his own former mentor,
now a retired octogenarian, for advice. Then he tried to teach what
he remembered to a generation of young surgeons who have never
navigated their way through a TB-marred chest.
 &HT;    This return to the old ways has its notes of vindication. ``It
reminds us not to devalue the types of treatments that came
before,'' says Dr. Barron H. Lerner, a physician and medical
historian at the Columbia University College of Physicians and
Surgeons and the author of ``Contagion and Confinement,'' a history
of tuberculosis. ``Generally, people look back at these types of
procedures with disdain. They were seen as the types of things
people did when they didn't know what they were doing. But it's
really fortunate that there are people around who can still do
these operations.''
 &HT;    Pomerantz takes no satisfaction from the new premium being put
on his old skills, nor from this new awareness that medicine is not
a straight road but a looping and meandering one.
 &HT;    ``Don't think for a minute that I want to be doing this,'' he
says. ``It would be better if the drugs worked for everything _
cancer, heart disease, TB, but drugs will never be the 100 percent
answer. It's time we stop believing in a magic pill.''
 &HT;    The patient, Sonesacksith Choummanivong, is a 22-year-old
fine-arts student who is known to his family and his doctors as
Toon. The word means ``groundhog'' in Laotian, his native language,
and it became his nickname because, as an infant, he had chubby
cheeks. The moniker has stuck, a sad counterpoint to all the years
of illness that have left him gaunt and pale.
 &HT;    There is poignancy, too, in the fact that this gentle young man,
with his delicate artist's fingers, represents everything today's
infectious disease doctors fear. To them he is the personification
of contagion, the harbinger of an epidemic, the future of
tuberculosis in the United States.
 &HT;    Complacency, they remind us, led to a sharp spike in cases of TB
during the early 1990s. Vigilance then brought the numbers back
down within the country, but while Americans have been looking
inward, pleased with their progress, a new danger has arisen from
without. Last year, 40 percent of patients with tuberculosis had
come to the United States from other countries, an increase from 16
percent in 1982.
 &HT;    And therein lies the threat. The overall TB rate in New York
City is down to 21.3 per 100,000. Compare that to Bombay, where the
rate is 500 per 100,000. The crisis in Russia's prisons, in turn,
makes the Bombay statistics seem insignificant.
 &HT;    ``If you were a diabolical terrorist and you wanted to
manufacture multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, you would create an
environment and a system of care like the one in the Russian
prisons,'' says Dr. Lee B. Reichman, executive director of the New
Jersey Medical School National Tuberculosis Center.
 &HT;    He recently toured those prisons and saw, among other things,
poorly ventilated rooms where 30 prisoners shared 10 beds, sleeping
in shifts. Last year 20,000 Russian prison inmates fell ill with
strains of TB that resisted known medications. Many of those
infected inmates were then released, and they spread the disease to
15,000 civilians.
 &HT;    Some illnesses are virulent in their contagion. Put a student
with chicken pox at the front of a large lecture hall, and he
could, within minutes, infect a large percentage of the room. AIDS,
by contrast, is remarkably difficult to catch, because its
transmission requires contact with bodily fluids.
 &HT;    Tuberculosis falls somewhere in the middle. In the days before
antibiotics, doctors did experiments that included placing TB
patients in a closed room and directing air from that room into
cages filled with guinea pigs. They learned that a person must, on
average, exchange 11,000 cubic feet of air to have a 50 percent
chance of being infected. That translates into two months of
24-hour-a-day contact or six months of 8-hour-a-day contact.
 &HT;    ``Whenever there's an outbreak, reporters start calling and they
all ask, 'Can you get it on the subway?''' Reichman says. Because
the above figures are an average, he says, ``we tell them,
'Statistically, the answer is yes, you can, but it's more likely
the subway will crash.'''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, researchers estimate that each person with active
TB will go on to infect between 9 and 12 others, meaning a minimum
of 3.5 million new drug-resistant cases in Russia alone in the next
year. Now add modern transportation to this mix. ``It's tempting to
some people to talk about keeping the foreigners out,'' Reichman
says. ``Unfortunately _ or fortunately _ you can't. So we have to
confront the problem, not hide from it.''
 &HT;    Toon Choummanivong escaped from a crowded and chaotic Thai
resettlement camp in 1983, when he was 5. He, his parents and five
siblings legally settled in Holland, Mich., which is 45 minutes
south of Grand Rapids. A few years later, his father developed a
shortness of breath, night sweats and fever _ symptoms similar to
ones he'd had as a refugee in Thailand.
 &HT;    Although the family's medical history is sketchy, Toon's doctors
assume his father had been treated in Thailand with the ``first
line'' tuberculosis drugs that could once automatically cure this
disease. Because he was a penniless man in a poor country where the
health-care system was haphazard at best, he probably took those
medicines only long enough to feel better, which was not long
enough to kill all the TB bacilli in his body.
 &HT;    When he stopped taking his pills, the bugs that remained
continued to grow. Those bacilli were, by definition, the strongest
and most resistant. When he became ill again years later, in
Michigan, his disease had mutated beyond the power of the drugs. He
died in 1989.
 &HT;    Determined to live a healthy life, Toon played tennis and
soccer. He funneled his extra energies into his artwork _ bold
portraits and colorful landscapes. He ate carefully and did not
smoke or drink, even during his first semester at Dordt College in
Sioux Center, Iowa. By Christmas break in December 1995, however,
he was haggard and hacking. The symptoms were alarmingly familiar,
and they led him to Kent Community Hospital in Michigan, the same
hospital where his father died.
 &HT;    The diagnosis for Toon, too, was tuberculosis, and he was placed
in a jury-rigged isolation room for three months. Ventilation is
one low-tech but effective weapon against TB, so an unrelenting
fan, the size of a night table, was placed inches from his bed. It
ran night and day.
 &HT;    Too exhausted to tie on a mask and walk to the lounge down the
hall, he spent weeks alone, drawing with pencils in his
ever-present sketch pad. It was the dawning of the new reality of
his life _ months when no one would talk to him without hiding
behind a mask. He dared not hope for any relationship deeper than
friendship.
 &HT;    ``I've never been with anyone,'' he says. ``How can I be?'' His
life lacked even the intimacy of a smile. His portraits from that
time are striking in that they have no faces.
 &HT;    Every day he took dozens of pills _ multicapsule doses of INH,
rifampin, PZA and ethambutol. Those medications were probably the
same ones his father had taken, the ones that still cure nearly all
non-drug-resistant patients. In retrospect, his doctors now say,
they were not the best choice. Toon, they now know, did not bring
his strain of TB with him from the camps; he caught it from his
father, meaning the bugs were already resistant.
 &HT;    The medications worked well enough that within a few months Toon
felt better. The microscope, however, saw things differently. When
a sputum sample was ``cultured out,'' it grew TB bacilli, evidence
that he still harbored the disease in his lungs. The hospital sent
him home in March 1996 with a month's supply of pills. No matter
how healthy he felt, they said, he had to swallow those pills.
 &HT;    Toon had no objection to taking his medicines, because these
first-line drugs had no side effects. He also willingly observed
the restrictions on enclosed spaces _ no shopping malls or stores
or movies _ because he was reared with a respect for the rules. The
day he left the hospital, he went to the park with his brother and,
fueled by the exhilaration of being outdoors, played soccer for
three hours, until he was exhausted. He was celebrating the end of
an ordeal. He was celebrating too soon.
 &HT;    This young man lost his right lung in November. I was in the
operating room, gowned and wearing the ultraprotective mask that
resembles a duck's bill, as Pomerantz finally freed the diseased
and disfigured tissue from the chest wall and sent it off to the
pathology lab.
 &HT;    This was not my first time in an operating room, and the times I
have been lucky enough to observe surgery, I have found it
mesmerizing and beautiful. Watching a heart transplant I was awed
by the vibrant colors _ a work of art that nature never intended
for us to see _ and the moment when the donor heart was tripped to
life.
 &HT;    Choummanivong's surgery was another defining experience. It was
not beautiful; it was brutal _ hour upon hour of chipping away at
an enemy that would not surrender. The other procedures I had seen
were about giving back, replacing or fixing. This was only about
loss.
 &HT;    For several months after the final pneumonectomy,
Choummanivong's health improved. He was discharged from the
hospital before Christmas, and he weaned himself from the tanks of
oxygen that he considered such a burden. His monthly cultures were
negative for TB.
 &HT;    In late February, Toon got permission to drive with his brother
the 19 hours back to Michigan for a visit. While there, he fell ill
and thought he'd caught the flu from his young nephew. Back in
Denver, he arrived at his next appointment with an oxygen tube in
his nose, dragging the heavy canister behind him. He was shivering
and short of breath and he had dropped more than 10 pounds from his
already frail frame.
 &HT;    The next few months were agony for Choummanivong. Tests showed
he did not have the flu at all. The empty space in his right chest
had filled with TB-infected fluid. Because some surgical staples
had detached, the fluid _ with its traces of TB _ had crossed over

ALL WORK AND LITTLE PLAY FOR DIRECTOR OF `LIMBO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John Sayles doesn't look bad for a guy who has
just spent the past two weeks hawking his 12th movie to gaggles of
international reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He emerges from the bedroom of the San Francisco hotel suite
he's sharing with his longtime producer and equally dedicated
partner, Maggie Renzi, with a vague Cannes hangover. There, he'd
been practically asking to be drummed into numbness by giving 20 to
30 interviews a day because his film ``Limbo'' had been selected to
compete for the Palme D'Or, the festival's biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to Cannes maybe five times and I think I've seen one
movie,'' he sighed. ``It's wall-to-wall work. It's nice to show the
film, but it's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayles' meeting the foreign press was as much a grassroots
public-relations blitz as it was a campaign to sway the haute
couture masses _ and on a smaller level the jury, which was led
this year by Canadian fleshmeister David Cronenberg.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work. The Palme D'Or went to a French film no one had
expected would win called ``Rosetta.'' But ultimately it was a nice
deal for team Sayles _ particularly for Renzi, whose neck is
temporarily locked in a brace thanks to bad yoga. Not only did she
and Sayles generate word of mouth for ``Limbo,'' but she got to see
her beloved saunter down that red carpet in an Armani tux.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something men should know about women,'' she beamed.
``It's a stupid formal uniform, but, golly, he looked good!''
</P>
<P>
   Today, dressed in a pair of faded deep gray khakis and a
shortsleeved pink button-down, Sayles looks like he's been
delivered from the Croisette to a less glamorous realm; he evokes
your favorite English professor or a good friend's dad. In middle
age, the 49-year-old writer-director's face has taken on the early
traces of the taut leathery lines and creases that have settled
into the rawhide skin of Clint Eastwood, who, also well over 6
feet, could be Sayles' more sinewy doppelganger. Sayles' mouth has
a similar pencil-thinness, but his lips curve up into a tiny,
permanent smile, where Eastwood's lie slightly askew in a more
intimidating scowl.
</P>
<P>
   But it's their eyes that actually separate them. Eastwood's
remain locked in an impenetrable squint that seems focused on an
object in his sightline that he appears to hold in contempt.
Sayles' are wide open, roving, probing, but not with X-ray-vision
presumption _ he would never suppose he could see through you.
Rather, he looks into you to allow you to reveal your strengths and
shortcomings yourself, without passing judgment on them, letting
the evidence speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   That physical point of departure _ the eyes _ aptly characterize
what makes Sayles one of the sager figures making movies about
America in the increasingly dehumanized final moments of the 20th
century. Sayles' large vision has an attention to detail that is
uncanny, almost atavistic at a time when directors increasingly
rely on the visual details of storytelling: How much hellzapoppin'
and star-power can distract from the fact that nothing's happening?
</P>
<P>
   That would explain why Sayles abandoned the music video industry
after directing three Bruce Springsteen clips, most notably the
sweetly suggestive ``I'm on Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments in Sayles' movies are usually composed, then placed on a
large historical or geographical canvas: 1920s miner/union strife
(``Matewan''), the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal (``Eight Men
Out''), the revisionist West (``Lone Star''). Twice they've crossed
the border (``Men With Guns'') or have sailed overseas (the Irish
``Secret of Roan Inish''), but what unites the disparate themes of
his films is that eye, which is wholly devoted to the investment of
humanity to the characters living on the pages of his scripts.
</P>
<P>
   In a given film, Sayles' ambulatory Steadicam can follow up to
30 significant characters whose dialogue overlaps into a braided
assortment of regional patois. And his generosity as a writer and
his indifference to having stars in his films for the sake of
making a buck often has side characters endowed with large
monologues and lead actors who speak nary a word.

<P>
   During the spring and summer months, homeowners keep their
windows open to allow fresh air to circulate through the house. It
is important to make sure the screens are clean before opening the
windows; otherwise, dirt on the screens will blow into the house.
Dirty screens can also obscure visibility and restrict air flow.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to clean the screens is by washing them on a flat
surface, like a picnic table. First, cover the table with an old
rug or towels. Wet the screens by spraying them with a garden hose,
then scrub them with a soft-bristle brush and detergent solution.
Rinse the screens with another spray, then stand them against a
wall so they can air-dry.
</P>
<P>
   You can also clean window screens with foaming bathroom cleaner,
although this can be expensive if you have a lot of screens to
clean. Spray the foam on the screens and let it set for a few
minutes, then rinse it off with the garden hose. Foaming cleaner
should not be used on plastic screens, only metal ones, because it
can erode the material.
</P>
<P>
   As you wash the screens, inspect them carefully for tears and
holes that could let insects inside. Small holes can sometimes be
filled with quick-drying waterproof glue. Place a drop or two of
glue on the screen and spread it over the hole with a toothpick.
Use acetone-based glue for fiberglass screens, but read the label
first (or test it on spare screen fabric) to make sure it will not
melt the material.
</P>
<P>
   Repair tears by temporarily holding the torn edges together with
masking tape. Place the tape on one side of the screen and spread
glue across the tear on the other side. Allow time for the glue to
dry, then gently pull off the tape.
</P>
<P>
   You can repair a larger hole with a patch. Most hardware stores
and home centers stock press-on patches for aluminum screens. These
patches have small hooks around the perimeter that grip the mesh
around the hole in the screen.
</P>
<P>
   You can also make your own repair from spare screening material.
Use scissors or tin snips to cut a patch larger than the hole.
Unravel the wire around the edges of the patch to create a fringe
about 1/2-inch wide on all four sides. Bend the free ends of the
patch and push them through the mesh around the hole in the screen.
For aluminum and metal screens, you can bend the ends back on the
other side to secure the patch in place. For plastic or fiberglass
screens, you will need glue to hold the patch in place.
</P>
<P>
   Patches made from new aluminum screening will be bright and
contrast with the old screening. Darken the patches by spraying
them with flat black enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Screens with extensive damage should be replaced. If the frame
is solid and in good shape, you only need a roll of new screening
material. Screening material is available in fiberglass and
aluminum. Aluminum is more durable, and more expensive. It is also
less forgiving if you make a mistake when you are installing it.
Once you press aluminum screening into the frame grooves, it forms
permanent crimps that cannot be flattened out.
</P>
<P>
   You will also need a package of spline -- the flexible strip
that locks the screening in the groove -- and a rolling tool to
install the spline. All of these items are available at home
centers and well-stocked hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   Use a narrow-tipped screwdriver to pull out the old spline from
the screen frame. Remove the screening and discard it. Cut a new
piece of screening to the outside dimensions the frame. Center the
piece on the frame, then cut each corner at a 45-degree angle at
the point where the spline grooves meet. These cuts will keep the
screening from bunching up at the corners when the spline is
installed.
</P>
<P>
   With the rolling tool push the spline and screening into the
frame groove. Begin at one corner and work your way around the
frame. The screening material may wrinkle as you roll the spline in
place. A few small wrinkles are acceptable; they will flatten out
when the splining is complete. If the screening bunches up, pull
the spline out, smooth the screen, then replace the spline.
</P>
<P>
   At the corners push the spline ends into the groove with a dull
screwdriver. Trim any excess with a utility knife so the ends butt
together.
</P>
<P>
   After the spline is in place, use aviation snips, or a utility
knife with a sharp blade, to trim the excess screen material around
the spline. If you use a utility knife, hold it in a horizontal
position so the blade is parallel to the screen frame and points
toward the outside edge.

   Booting Up In `Safe Mode' &QL; 
Q. What's so safe about Safe Mode in Windows? What exactly does it
do when you restart in Safe Mode? A. If you are having system
problems that cause Windows to hang or freeze when you boot up your
computer normally, Safe Mode is an option you can pick from the
start-up menu. (To get to the menu with the start-up choices,
Windows 98 users should press the Control key as the computer
restarts. Windows 95 users should press F8.)
</P>
<P>
   Windows will also boot in Safe Mode automatically if it is
having a problem. When in Safe Mode, Windows will load only a
simple system configuration that temporarily disables the drivers
for your hardware devices (except for keyboard and mouse) and uses
only the standard video adapter for your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason to start in Safe Mode is to get the system up
and running so that you can begin to figure out why it won't boot
normally. If the machine starts in Safe Mode without a problem,
then there might be a hardware conflict, incompatible programs or
device driver programs, or system configuration problems. If you
had recently installed a hardware device or new software before the
problems started, you should uninstall it and try to boot normally
to see if the problem goes away.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users who are experiencing unexplained crashes or
freezes as the machine starts up can also load a minimal system
configuration for troubleshooting. As the Mac reboots, hold down
the Shift key to temporarily disable the nonessential extensions
and control panels.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Is it possible to send e-mail to more than one address
simultaneously without revealing each recipient's name and e-mail
address?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Just about every e-mail program has an option in the header
field called ``Bcc.'' This stands for blind carbon copy, and it
lets you fill in addresses that you can see on your original
message, but your recipients cannot. Most programs will just show
the recipient's address in the header field, or display the line
``recipient list suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Blind carbon copy is used quite a bit for mailings to large
numbers of people _ the notorious junk mail from spammers, for
example _ and in corporate situations where e-mail memos are
discreetly sent to other recipients.  &QL; 
 &QL;

THIS RADIO COSTS A LOT; IT SOUNDS IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans bought more than 58 million radios for the home last
year. In fact, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association
reports that most homes have at least eight of them. If car radios
are included, that number rises to 9 or 10 per home, with 82
million sold annually, making radios easily the most ubiquitous
consumer electronics device in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for the home radios purchased last year was
about $17. So why on earth is the Bose Corp. selling a clock radio
for $349 _ or $499 for the model with an integrated CD player? The
answer, Bose says, is that it sounds better than other radios _
lots better. In fact, Bose calls it ``the world's best-sounding
radio.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to escape advertisements for the Bose Wave Radio, in
magazines and newspapers and on local television _ and of course on
the radio, where Paul Harvey, the pitchman, croons appreciatively
about the wonders of this little device. The basic clock radio has
been on sale since the summer of 1993; the new version with CD
player has been available only since February.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about whether the Wave Radio sounds good enough to be
worth an extra $332 (or an extra $482 for the CD model)? Bose more
or less requires you to take it on faith, because for people who do
not live near one of the 57 Bose company stores nationwide, the
only way to buy a Wave Radio is by phone, mail or over the Internet
_ direct from the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have confidence,'' acknowledged Steve Kingsbury,
general manager of direct marketing for Bose. If you're not
satisfied, the company allows you to send it back within 30 days.
But buying direct from the company insures that the price will
really be $349. No Fourth of July discounts, no special deals from
mail-order houses.
</P>
<P>
   Amar Bose, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who is the founder and president of the company, said he
chose to sell the radio directly because he was certain that
high-end audio-video stores would see it as a threat. ``Who wants
to show something like this _ a $300 hi-fi system?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of home radios actually increased by 5 percent last
year, suggesting that Americans, by and large, were not convulsed
with concern about the quality of the sound pouring forth from the
little speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation seems to be that Americans generally are inured
to radios and put them in the same class as refrigerators _
something so taken for granted that you seldom think about it any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most people have forgotten, or never knew, that FM
radio can actually be a high-fidelity source, capable of
reproducing music with nearly the sonic range, or frequency
response, of a compact disk. They have forgotten, or never knew,
because nearly all of the radios Americans purchased last year and
over the previous few decades were capable of reproducing only a
narrow slice of this musical range.
</P>
<P>
   So to many people, the Bose Wave Radio seems like a new product
category: a radio that sounds good. And while the Bose radio is not
the only one _ Cambridge Soundworks, among others, sells a similar
product _ the Wave Radio is probably the best known.
</P>
<P>
   The Bose Corp. makes high-fidelity speakers, and the company has
reveled in producing unconventional products ever since introducing
its first product, the Bose 901 speakers in 1968 _ the first
successful speaker that projected the music both forward, as
traditional speakers do, and against the rear wall to expand the
sound field, producing room-filling sound.
</P>
<P>
   Bose, an engineer and inventor, has also from the beginning
pursued a quest to produce rich, deep bass through engineering,
obviating the need for the 12-inch woofers that have traditionally
been the minimum prerequisite for satisfying, full-range bass. That
has made Bose speakers easier to place in the living room. And that
helped lead to the Bose Wave Radio. It produces far deeper bass
than its tiny, 2.5-inch speakers ought to be capable of.
</P>
<P>
   But Bose said that when he introduced the product, ``I just went
on a hunch that people would want something that gives you the full
benefits of a hi-fi but be as simple as a refrigerator.'' And in
fact, Bose is selling as many of these $349 radios as it can make,
hundreds of thousands of them a year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Normally speakers that size are able to produce only a narrow
swath of sound in the middle of the frequency range, where human
voice falls. If voices sound nasal, or tinny, it is largely because
the bass frequencies are missing.
</P>
<P>
   These frequencies are not missing on the Bose Wave Radio. Bose
says it has solved the problem by designing a complex, twisting
sound baffle that wends around for 27 inches, back and forth,
through the body of the small tabletop radio, whose exterior
measurements are only about 14 inches wide by 9 inches deep by 4
inches high. Looking at a diagram of this ``wave guide,'' as Bose
calls it, brings to mind high-school biology class diagrams of the
inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   The wave guide works the same way a pipe organ does, noted
William R. Short, a Bose fellow. It uses a precise volume of air to
amplify the vibrations of the speaker cone. The vibrations of the
cone vibrate the air in the baffle, too. ``It matches the motion of
the air with the motion of the speaker,'' Short said.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the wave guide seems to work. I've had a Wave Radio
for review for several weeks, and I've listened to FM radio and to
a variety of CDs I already knew to be sonically (as well as
musically) pleasing. And the clear, visceral impression is that the
music is richer and fuller than anyone would normally expect from a
radio, of all things _ especially one this size.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Wave Radio does not produce thunderous bass that shakes
the cabinet doors. On the top end of the spectrum, the high treble
that comes from cymbals, bells, triangles and some strings sounds a
bit muted. But the truth is, on most home radios you probably
wouldn't even know that the high treble was there. And the bass
would be a mere suggestion, not an appreciable part of the music.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate music production is not the result just of frequency
response. Most full-range audio systems also play certain
frequencies at higher volumes than others, leading to overblown
bass or harsh, strident treble. But the Bose radio manages to
reproduce fairly smooth sound across the spectrum. I was not able
to measure it, but the music sounded relatively uniform _ or
``flat,'' using the jargon of the trade _ from low bass to high
treble.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a radio that sounds quite pleasing _ surprisingly,
given its size. It was also able to play at higher volumes than
most other small radios, without distortion, or ``clipping,'' from
the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bose Wave radio cannot compete with any serious stereo
system with separate speakers and an FM tuner: housing both
speakers in one 14-inch cabinet greatly diminishes the stereo
effect. But this is a clock radio with all the functions of one,
including a snooze button. It is intended primarily for use in the
bedroom or the kitchen, where high-quality sound is not usually
found. For that, the Wave Radio is quite expensive. But it is also
unique and adept.

GARDEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DORA GALITZKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Better Redder  &QL; 
Q. When I recently purchased a maroon-leaved form of Cimicifuga,
the nurseryman told me it needs a lot of sun. I have other,
green-leaved Cimicifugas that I know are shade plants. Where will
the maroon-leaved one do best?  &QL; 
A. Exactly why some plants have purple-red foliage is not
completely understood, but their appeal is clear, and plant
breeders have been offering more of them.
</P>
<P>
   The compounds in the leaves that cause the red color are
anthocyanins, which are composed of, among other things, sugars.
The more light the plant receives, the more sugars it makes, and
more sugars mean more anthocyanins. So, everything else being
equal, the purple colors will be more vivid when the plant gets
more light, and duller, with more green, when grown in shade.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, when there is more sun, the soil dries out faster
and the Cimicifuga (whose botanical name has recently been changed
to Actaea) will use water faster than its green relatives in the
shade. You want it to be red because it's happy, not because it's
stressed and hollering for water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sour Grapes  &QL; 
Q. I planted a two-year-old grapevine about four years ago. Two
years later, I had plenty of tiny bunches of grapes on the vine,
but they grew only to the size of buckshot. Last year, I had many
more bunches. The grapes grew a little bigger, but then quit. Am I
going to taste a grape this year, or am I going to be buying my
grapes in the supermarket again? Please help.  &QL; 
A. There's a reason wine costs so much: grapes can be hard to grow
well. The period starting two or three weeks before flowering and
lasting until two or three weeks after the fruit sets is fraught
with danger. During that time, the plants are especially vulnerable
to several fungus diseases, including black rot, the disease that
is most likely causing your problems.
</P>
<P>
   Proper cultivation can help produce a better crop of grapes.
Don't overfertilize, which encourages the growth of leaves at the
expense of fruit. Don't ask more of your vines than they are
prepared to give: thin them to four to six fruit-bearing shoots for
each foot of vine. In the spring, before the buds swell, prune the
vine enough, so that when the grape clusters form, they will have
plenty of light and good air circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Wise, viticulture research specialist at Cornell
Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County in Riverhead, N.Y., said
that black rot did not respond well to most low-toxicity
fungicides, leaving homeowners with few choices. Copper- and
sulfur-based sprays, common treatments for fungus diseases, may not
be a good answer because many grape varieties are very sensitive to
them, and spraying may burn the leaves. If you do choose to use a
fungicide labeled for use on grapes, be sure to follow the
directions carefully, especially if you intend to eat or make wine
from the grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Since your trellises are already set up, why not switch to
morning glories? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Those Basils of Yesteryear  &QL; 
Q. I adore basil. A few years ago, it was a fabulous herb, aromatic
and delicious. It had small leaves, and one needed only to brush it
to be overwhelmed by its exquisite aroma. The taste of pesto sauce
was divine. Today, stores offer a basil that has huge, tasteless,
bitter leaves, aroma-less. Does anyone still sell basil seeds for
planting that hark back to what was?  &QL; 
A. In the beginning, there was basil, and it was good. And instead
of resting, breeders hybridized and selected and cross-pollinated
and experimented, and it was, perhaps, not so good for traditional
culinary use, but terrific for new ethnic dishes (think Thai) and
for ornamental use (think tiny, frilly or wrinkled, green splashed
with purple ).
</P>
<P>
   So now there are dozens of variations of Ocimum basilicum. The
straight species is usually called sweet basil, and is still widely
grown, but each cultivar has its own idiosyncrasies, fans and uses.
Trying to declare one basil to be the best is just asking for an
argument. Try several (seeds and seedlings are still some of the
best bargains around), and choose the one that suits you.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for basil include Shady Acres Herb Farm, 7815 Highway
212, Chaska, Minn. 55318, (612) 466-3391, catalog $3; and
Shepherd's Garden Seeds, 30 Irene Street, Torrington, Conn. 06790,
(860) 482-3638, free catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, all right. Genovese. There, I've said it. Genovese is the
best basil for tearing up onto sliced tomatoes or for pounding into
pesto. And I expect I'll hear a few contrary opinions.
</P>
<P>

NINTENDO CHARACTERS SHOW DARKER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nintendo has always been considered the kinder, gentler console.
When Sega's Mortal Kombat was splashing gore across the screen,
Nintendo had Mario. The Playstation is home to gun-slinging Lara
Croft and the industrial destruction zone of Metal Gear Solid.
Nintendo has the Legend of Zelda, a magical adventure set in the
verdant kingdom of Hyrule.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo characters are round. Nintendo characters are cute.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo characters have gone ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   In Super Smash Bros., all of the sweet, cuddly characters we've
grown to love over the years have been thrown into the ring. That's
right: combat. No holds barred.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine all the puppets on ``Rogers' Neighborhood'' suddenly on
the rampage, and you'll have some idea of how darkly absurd and
thrilling Super Smash Bros. can be. This is a game that allows
Yoshi, Mario's endearing dinosaur sidekick, to beat his little
friend into submission. Link, the Legend of Zelda's knight errant,
can throw Donkey Kong over a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon's adorable mascot, Pikachu, sneezes destruction. It's a
high-pitched baby sneeze _ ``Pika-CHOO!'' Then lightning bolts
shoot out of his dainty mouth, frying anything within range.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, the most adorable creature in Nintendo's pantheon _ a
pink puffball with blinky eyes _ turns out to be hiding a machete
somewhere in that little round body, and if you hit the right
button combination, he wields it with a viciousness you wouldn't
expect from a plush animal.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small arsenal of shiny, happy weapons, if you're
quick enough to pick them up when they spontaneously appear. A
bowling ball with legs will explode if lobbed at the enemy, or just
waddle around until its timer reaches zero.
</P>
<P>
   A fire flower, once plucked, functions as a flame thrower. A
magic wand can be used to shoot stars at your opponents from a
distance or clobber them over the head at close range.
</P>
<P>
   All of this takes place in a series of environments that make
Disneyland look gothic. Mario's battle zone is in the upper reaches
of Princess Peach's castle. On Yoshi's home turf, a pink
heart-shaped sun smiles, showering sunbeams through orange and blue
clouds. In Kirby's Dreamland, the Teletubbies would not look out of
place among the friendly trees, crystalline water puddles and
pastel flowers dotting an emerald lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a combat game in this environment, with these
characters, is shocking and funny, and vaguely horrifying. It's
like seeing ``Das Boot'' staged aboard the Yellow Submarine _ a
dizzying cocktail of aggression and kitsch. David Lynch could not
have done it better.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to hand it to Nintendo for giving its candyland a
sharp elbow to the ribs. Because it's more fun to watch martial
arts performed by stuffed animals. It's exciting, because stuffed
animals are not supposed to be gladiators. They're meant to be
soft, harmless cuddling objects.
</P>
<P>
   Watching them clobber one another is a subversive thrill on the
order of ``South Park'' or ``Celebrity Death Match.'' Probably more
so, because it introduces an element of uncertainty into a universe
of plush merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   After you've seen Kirby whip a giant blade out of nowhere, it's
hard to trust your Kirby doll in the same unconditional way. Do you
really want it in your room while you're sleeping?
</P>
<P>
   It's mind-boggling that Nintendo would put Mario in the same
category as Chuckie. And it's equally surprising that the company
would allow its characters, who are all supposed to be friends, to
shake it up.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, kids do this all the time with their toys. Little
boys set G.I. Joe on fire and little girls hack Barbie's hair off,
but not with the blessings of Hasbro and Mattel. (I have yet to see
a commercial with Barbie and Skipper in a cat fight.)
</P>
<P>
   But this is the sort of play-acting that Nintendo has sanctioned
with Super Smash Bros. Forget the Super Friends. In the Smash Bros.
arena, it's every elf, dinosaur, plumber and gorilla for himself.
There are levels where Donkey Kong might fight with you against
Mario and Luigi. But in the next level, he's not going to show you
any mercy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what makes a combat game different from an adventure
game or a shooter, or any of the other genres that feature Nintendo
characters. In a combat game, there are no good guys. There are no
bad guys. There are only winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, it's much more like an athletic event than an
odyssey or quest, Nintendo's stock in trade. Every character has
the right to win, and you can root for any contender because of his
skill, or for purely personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mario: eye of the tiger, babe. Eye of the tiger.

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ On Sunday, they came at dawn, the smoke rising above
the Belgrade suburbs in a grey blanket, the thump of bombs broken
by the bells of the early 19th-century Church of the Communion and
the scream of starlings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, they arrived just after dusk to bomb the
Bezanijska Kosa power station and plunge us all into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ljubo Ososlija turned up for coffee at my hotel Tuesday
morning with wounds to his legs and feet, he had a bone to pick
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just walking with a neighbor and we were 200 meters (650
feet) from the power station when we saw the first missile,'' he
said, sipping Turkish coffee because the hotel has run out of
espresso. ``The second one got me. It blew me five feet into the
air and almost broke my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Ososlija is a publisher who is currently signing up volunteers
to pay for new volumes of best-selling fiction and children's
stories: all profits go for the purchase of cigarettes for soldiers
at the war front. NATO, of course, bombed the tobacco factories
more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ososlija, I hadn't taken a shower Tuesday morning. The
power cuts have severed the water supply again. My taps roar at me
like a sick lion and the red plastic bucket on my balcony collects
an inch of grey rainwater from Belgrade's polluted skies;
definitely not for brushing my teeth, maybe _ just _ enough to
flush the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   No power, no water, no cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels and London and Paris, you might be forgiven for
believing that NATO's wishful thinking represents reality; that
Serbia is on its knees, that its people are on the verge of
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But returning to Belgrade after a month away is a weird
experience. The mood is harder, more cynical, more resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I walked into the candlelit office of ``The
Independent's'' Belgrade travel agent, I was met with fury. ``This
is not a war like you people claim,'' he shouted. ``It's an attack.
If I was ordered to go down to Kosovo now, I would go at once and
fight there. Here I sit and wait and can do nothing. We cannot
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't understand the mentality of the Serbs. We are
stubborn. At the beginning of this, I might have given up. But now,
I will never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   I heard much the same from the icon-seller on the end of Knez
Mihailova street. A bearded refugee from Krajina _ site of the most
unreported ``ethnic cleansing'' in the Balkans, presumably because
the Serbs had the cleansing done to them rather than the other way
around _ he offered me a black Angel Gabriel painted on the back of
a broken wooden floorboard. He only wanted 65 pence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO told the Hague tribunal to charge Milosevic and I know
what that means,'' he said, leaning against his wall opposite the
Tsar Cafe. ``NATO is burning Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans won't be able to negotiate with someone they
call a war criminal. So they don't want to talk. They don't want
Chernomyrdin to succeed. So the war will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a new joke making the rounds _ even Goren Martic, a
Yugoslav government minister was passing it on Tuesday _ based on
the premise that NATO will always sabotage peace hopes when the
Russians try to negotiate: ``Watch out!'' the joke goes,
``Chernomyrdin's coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   And it sometimes feels like that. Every night, the jets go for
Rakovica where, so the rumors have it, the Yugoslav military
hierarchy work from a bunker deep beneath the airfield runways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to destroy the bunker but they don't know
exactly where it is,'' a Serb friend says. ``It was built after the
breakup of the old Yugoslavia _ the Bosnians and the Croats who
were in the Yugoslav army don't know its location so can't give it
to the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real bunker lies, I suspect, within every Serb. Not so
much the stubbornness that my travel agent talked about. Certainly
not any maniacal loyalty to President Slobodan Milosevic. More a
refusal to lie down, an absolute unwillingness to accept the
demands of foreign powers, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Serbs are not being told of the terrors visited upon
the Albanians of Kosovo. Only opposition news agencies report an
anti-war rally banned in Cacak and the sentencing of three military
conscripts to almost five years' imprisonment for failing to return
to their units.
</P>
<P>
   But even the chairman of the Cacak municipal assembly is now
saying that his protest was of ``a civil and patriotic character,''
one which shared every Serb's abhorrence of ``NATO aggression.'' &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   I've come across only one man who has been truly broken by the
bombings. I saw him last a month ago, weeping in the arms of his
neighbors and promising to commit suicide because he had survived
the NATO bomb which killed his wife, son, daughter-in-law and all
his grandchildren in Surdulica.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the town on Monday _ after NATO had killed another 18
innocents when it scored a direct hit on the local hospital _ I
asked a friend of Vojeslav Milic if he had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The man shook his head. ```Voja' is very bad,'' he said. ``He
has a big poster of photographs of all the members of his family
who died _ and now he goes around town and sticks their pictures to
the windshields of parked cars. We try to keep him sedated. You
see, in the past two weeks he has tried to kill himself twice.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ On Sunday, they came at dawn, the smoke rising above
the Belgrade suburbs in a grey blanket, the thump of bombs broken
by the bells of the early 19th-century Church of the Communion and
the scream of starlings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, they arrived just after dusk to bomb the
Bezanijska Kosa power station and plunge us all into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ljubo Ososlija turned up for coffee at my hotel Tuesday
morning with wounds to his legs and feet, he had a bone to pick
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just walking with a neighbor and we were 200 meters (650
feet) from the power station when we saw the first missile,'' he
said, sipping Turkish coffee because the hotel has run out of
espresso. ``The second one got me. It blew me five feet into the
air and almost broke my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Ososlija is a publisher who is currently signing up volunteers
to pay for new volumes of best-selling fiction and children's
stories: all profits go for the purchase of cigarettes for soldiers
at the war front. NATO, of course, bombed the tobacco factories
more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ososlija, I hadn't taken a shower Tuesday morning. The
power cuts have severed the water supply again. My taps roar at me
like a sick lion and the red plastic bucket on my balcony collects
an inch of grey rainwater from Belgrade's polluted skies;
definitely not for brushing my teeth, maybe _ just _ enough to
flush the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   No power, no water, no cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels and London and Paris, you might be forgiven for
believing that NATO's wishful thinking represents reality; that
Serbia is on its knees, that its people are on the verge of
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But returning to Belgrade after a month away is a weird
experience. The mood is harder, more cynical, more resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I walked into the candlelit office of ``The
Independent's'' Belgrade travel agent, I was met with fury. ``This
is not a war like you people claim,'' he shouted. ``It's an attack.
If I was ordered to go down to Kosovo now, I would go at once and
fight there. Here I sit and wait and can do nothing. We cannot
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't understand the mentality of the Serbs. We are
stubborn. At the beginning of this, I might have given up. But now,
I will never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   I heard much the same from the icon-seller on the end of Knez
Mihailova street. A bearded refugee from Krajina _ site of the most
unreported ``ethnic cleansing'' in the Balkans, presumably because
the Serbs had the cleansing done to them rather than the other way
around _ he offered me a black Angel Gabriel painted on the back of
a broken wooden floorboard. He only wanted 65 pence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO told the Hague tribunal to charge Milosevic and I know
what that means,'' he said, leaning against his wall opposite the
Tsar Cafe. ``NATO is burning Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans won't be able to negotiate with someone they
call a war criminal. So they don't want to talk. They don't want
Chernomyrdin to succeed. So the war will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a new joke making the rounds _ even Goren Martic, a
Yugoslav government minister was passing it on Tuesday _ based on
the premise that NATO will always sabotage peace hopes when the
Russians try to negotiate: ``Watch out!'' the joke goes,
``Chernomyrdin's coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   And it sometimes feels like that. Every night, the jets go for
Rakovica where, so the rumors have it, the Yugoslav military
hierarchy work from a bunker deep beneath the airfield runways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to destroy the bunker but they don't know
exactly where it is,'' a Serb friend says. ``It was built after the
breakup of the old Yugoslavia _ the Bosnians and the Croats who
were in the Yugoslav army don't know its location so can't give it
to the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real bunker lies, I suspect, within every Serb. Not so
much the stubbornness that my travel agent talked about. Certainly
not any maniacal loyalty to President Slobodan Milosevic. More a
refusal to lie down, an absolute unwillingness to accept the
demands of foreign powers, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Serbs are not being told of the terrors visited upon
the Albanians of Kosovo. Only opposition news agencies report an
anti-war rally banned in Cacak and the sentencing of three military
conscripts to almost five years' imprisonment for failing to return
to their units.
</P>
<P>
   But even the chairman of the Cacak municipal assembly is now
saying that his protest was of ``a civil and patriotic character,''
one which shared every Serb's abhorrence of ``NATO aggression.'' &QL;

<P>
   I've come across only one man who has been truly broken by the
bombings. I saw him last a month ago, weeping in the arms of his
neighbors and promising to commit suicide because he had survived
the NATO bomb which killed his wife, son, daughter-in-law and all
his grandchildren in Surdulica.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the town on Monday _ after NATO had killed another 18
innocents when it scored a direct hit on the local hospital _ I
asked a friend of Vojeslav Milic if he had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The man shook his head. ```Voja' is very bad,'' he said. ``He
has a big poster of photographs of all the members of his family
who died _ and now he goes around town and sticks their pictures to
the windshields of parked cars. We try to keep him sedated. You
see, in the past two weeks he has tried to kill himself twice.''

 &HT;    CLINTON TO PRESS HOUSE FOR STRONGER GUN MEASURES, AIDE SAYS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration will press the House for
stricter gun controls than those contained in a bill approved by
the Senate, President Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser,
Bruce Reed, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast with reporters, Reed said the administration
would seek to raise the minimum age for purchasing a handgun from
18 to 21 and to require background checks on anyone who buys
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also will push to renew the federal law
requiring a three-day waiting period for obtaining guns. The law
expires this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``the only way to reduce the chances of more Littletons
is to attack on all fronts,'' Reed said, expanded gun control
measures would help prevent the kind of tragedy that occurred at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Littleton was a defining moment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the deaths of 14 students and a teacher at Columbine
High led the Senate to pass legislation that would require
mandatory background checks on gun buyers at gun shows, require
trigger locks or similar safety devices to be sold with handguns,
and ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP House leadership, which only four years ago vowed to
repeal a ban on assault weapons enacted at Clinton's behest, has
now agreed to vote on a version of the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those rare times when the national consensus
demands that we act,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
just before Congress recessed last week for the Memorial Day
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's comments Wednesday are an indication that the
administration senses that after the Littleton tragedy, and last
month's wounding of students at a high school in Conyers, Ga., the
country is ready for stronger gun control concessions than the
House is prepared to offer.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll last week indicated that 66 percent of Americans
believe gun ownership laws should be stricter, while only 7 percent
said such laws should be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only 10 states prohibit the sale of handguns to
persons under 21: Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Maryland,
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, the chief lobbying organization
for gun owners, is mounting a campaign to defeat the Senate-passed
measure and to stop any extension of the three-day background check
law.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has issued an ``alert'' to its members this week calling
the Senate legislation ``unreasonable ... unworkable ...
unacceptable ... and to our Founders who gave us the Second
Amendment, unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members do a good job of contacting their representatives,
and they will be watching,'' Bill Powers, the NRA's chief
spokesman, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Reed's suggestion that the age for handgun
ownership to be raised to 21, Powers said, ``What's next _ that you
have to be 21 to vote? At some point, we have to recognize that if
we're going to send our young people to places like Kosovo to
fight, then they are probably old enough to be trusted at home.''

HUNGER PREVAILS DURING THE DEPRESSION, BUT THE FOOD INDUSTRY
MARCHES ON

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many American decades, the 1930s were a dichotomy of
despair and progress.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. stock market crashed in October 1929. As the next
decade opened, America imposed the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which
raised import taxes on goods from abroad. Our Depression became the
world's Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, residents battled with dogs and cats for the contents
of garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the International Apple Shippers Association
gave its fruit on credit to jobless men to sell on street corners
to help the association dispose of its surplus. By November 1930,
6,000 men were selling apples on New York sidewalks. By spring
1931, the city declared the men a nuisance and ordered them off the
street.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of record wheat yields followed by a devastating
drought hit American farmers with a one-two punch. In 1931, some
Kansas counties waived taxes to help farmers. The wheat crop had
broken all records, driving down prices. Banks began to foreclose
on loans, forcing farmers off the land.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Wood painted ``American Gothic,'' a composition of a dour
woman and her equally dour husband, clad in overalls and holding a
pitchfork, expressing the outlook of a farm couple living in
depressed times.
</P>
<P>
   Women were encouraged to look for jobs to support unemployed
men. Because female workers were paid less than men, it was easier
for them to find jobs. Life Savers hired about 150 women to do
piecework and paid them $24 to $25 for a five-day week. Baby Ruth
bar manufacturer Curtiss Candy Co. advertised for women and girls
to wrap its products.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, ``Okies'' and ``Arkies'' devastated by the weather in
the Dust Bowl begin migrating to California. More than 350,000
farmers moved west over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet time also brought progress. Auguste Escoffier, creator of
the peach Melba and the father of modern cuisine, presided over a
dinner to celebrate the opening of the Hotel Pierre on Fifth Avenue
in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Pan Am Clipper flights provide the first hot meals
served in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Production of home appliances escalated _ America was enchanted
with modernism. Design became streamlined; function followed form.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit London Chop House opened in 1939 with 75-cent steak
dinners and 25-cent scotch-and-sodas. The Pump Room opened in
Chicago the same year. Lawry's The Prime Rib premiered in Los
Angeles (later to pioneer valet parking).
</P>
<P>
   Women's clubs came into their own as ladies of leisure banded
together through charitable events, gardening and bridge. Light
club food (creamy, dainty and sweet) was the norm. The absence of
liquor and domestic help, to say nothing of the gloomy economy,
made entertaining more a family event.
</P>
<P>
   Americans found solace in simple things. Marshmallows were a
craze, as were candy and silly garnishes such as pineapple circles
and maraschino cherries. Waffles were the rage, much simpler to
make now that electric waffle irons were available. Waffles were
served for breakfast or lunch, and for Sunday night suppers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were circling the hearth as a foreign war loomed.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1930: In 1930, the average household worked 91 days to buy a
year's worth of food and spent 25 percent of the household income
on food.
</P>
<P>
   1930: 4.5 million people are unemployed; the number rises to 8
million in 1931 and 12 million in 1932 (a total of 25 percent of
the work force).
</P>
<P>
   1930: Jiffy biscuit mix, sliced Wonder bread and Hostess
Twinkies are born.
</P>
<P>
   1930: The Brenham Creamery Co. changes its name to Blue Bell
Creameries. The company has been making ice cream since 1911 in a
wooden tub filled with ice, and has a production ceiling of 2
gallons a day. In 1936, the company buys its first refrigerated
truck and continuous freezer. In 1939, 1-pint ice-cream containers
are used for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   1930: The average distance between the field where fruits and
vegetables are grown and the markets in which they are sold is
1,500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   1930: Birdseye introduces frozen food; electric stoves appear.
</P>
<P>
   1930: Pat and Harry Olivieri of Pat's Restaurant in Philadelphia
claim to have created the Philadelphia cheese-steak, although they
say the cheese wasn't added to the beef sandwiches until 1948.
</P>
<P>
   1931: St. Louis widow Irma Rombauer publishes ``The Joy of
Cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   1932: The first Minyard Food Store opens in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   1932: Maytag advertises its washers as a boon for the
hard-working family. A farm family is pictured with its own laundry
workhorse.
</P>
<P>
   1932: Americans are more hungry or ill-fed than ever before. The
average weekly relief check for a family of five in New York City
is $6. Nearly 1 million Americans leave the cities to return to the
land, many of them on farms or land outside the money economy.

LAREDO SPELLING WHIZ GOES OUT IN BEE'S FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ricardo Cigarroa, 13, failed by one letter
Wednesday to make the second round of the 72nd National Spelling
Bee here.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa, who just completed the seventh grade at United Middle
School in Laredo, Texas, failed to correctly spell basmati, an
Asian long-grain rice. He used the letter ``z'' rather than ``s.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most contestants unfamiliar with a particular word,
Cigarroa asked the contest judge, or pronouncer, to define it.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa started spelling: B-A, then a pause, then Z-M-A-T-I.
</P>
<P>
   When the bell that signaled his error rang throughout the hushed
Grand Hyatt Hotel ballroom packed with 248 other contestants and
their relatives, Cigarroa knew he had been eliminated from the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed disappointed when he left the stage where the
contestants were sitting, but he soon emerged from a backstage room
with a smile. He said he was looking forward to touring the
Smithsonian Institution's National Air &AMP; Space Museum later
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He had been through a rough few days for Cigarroa. Sponsored by
the Laredo Morning News, Cigarroa caught a cold shortly after he
and his family arrived in Washington last Saturday. So he missed
touring the Washington, D.C., area with the other contestants and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa said that the night before the contest, which is run by
Scripps Howard newspapers, he hardly slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept rolling around and looking at the clock,'' he said. At
one point he got up to study some of the words that are provided in
a 3,400-word handbook. But the contest words are not limited to the
handbook. The spellers can be given any word from the Webster's
Third New International Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa will take home $50 and a commemorative watch. He
defeated 50 other students in the Laredo Spelling Bee championship
in April to earn a place at the national contest.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa said he sometimes studies spelling for ``a couple of
hours a day.'' His mother, Melissa Cigarroa, said much of his study
time in the past few weeks went to studying for seventh-grade final
exams.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to continue teaching himself Latin and someday wants to
become a physician like his father, who also named Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   Young Cigarroa said he plans to keep entering spelling contests
and hopes to be back here next year. The National Spelling Bee is
open to students under 16 who have not finished the eighth grade.

KING RANCH CHICKEN RULES THE ROOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The image is clear.
</P>
<P>
   A tough old vaquero in the brush country of far South Texas
hovers over a smoky campfire. He slowly tears hand-made tortillas
and drops them into a pot, then adds a few peppers, some bruised
tomatoes (where he got them is a mystery), and finally some strong
Mexican cheese and either shredded chicken or beef.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, beef probably, since he's on the 800,000-acre King Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   I can't account for the cans of cream of mushroom and cream of
chicken soup that he uses. And, oh yeah, on those occasions he
doesn't have that tomato or the chiles, he uses a can of Ro-Tel
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it doesn't matter what he used. He wasn't even there
in the first place. As far as anyone can tell, King Ranch chicken _
or as it is sometimes known _ King Ranch casserole, doesn't have
one single thing to do with the King Ranch or a vaquero.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know exactly where it started, but it has
clearly taken on a life of its own. There are rules in some
churches that say there can be no picnics, no socials, no circle
meetings without King Ranch chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Some marriages, christenings and divorces have been nullified
because no King Ranch chicken was served in celebration. Family
reunions use the same rule, probably because several members of the
family go to the same church.
</P>
<P>
   On those hard-to-take Mondays, downtown Fort Worth workers flock
to the Sundance Deli and Market for the King Ranch chicken
blue-plate special. Barry Harper said the casserole is one of his
more popular items. Theoretically, he serves it from 11 a.m.-2
p.m., but it's usually gone by 12:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   King Ranch chicken is a staple at many cafeterias, especially on
the days the buses come. It is clearly a comfort food that happens
to have a memorable name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here 31 years _ and you know how women like to
always collect recipes wherever they go?'' asked Kathy Henry of the
King Ranch visitors' center in Kingsville. ``Well, when I moved to
Kingsville, the first one I got was for King Ranch chicken. So I
know it has been here for at least 31 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But in all her time working for the sprawling King Ranch, Henry
has never found a link between the popular casserole and the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it was developed perhaps back in the 1950s,'' she
said. ``The word is, a lady in Robstown may have entered it in a
national cooking contest like the Pillsbury or Campbell Soup
contests. She didn't win the big prize but maybe a second or third.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just named it King Ranch chicken because Robstown is in
this area and she thought it would be a catchy name.''
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said she has never been able to research the story, but
whatever the case, she's certain the dish was developed between
1945 and 1965. ``That's the best I can come up with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   People have certainly adopted the dish. Henry said the visitors'
center gets hundreds of calls each year from people wanting the
recipe. For years, the ranch disavowed any connection, but now it
offers a standard recipe printed on small, wooden postcards.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the western motif, the recipe looks as if it has been
burned into the card like a brand. There are two choices: the
chicken version, which is the most popular, and the beef kind,
because King Ranch raises beef.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the official King Ranch recipe for the chicken
casserole:
</P>
<P>
   KING RANCH CHICKEN CASSEROLE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 6
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2-4 pound chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 chopped green bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
</P>
<P>
   1 can cream of mushroom soup
</P>
<P>
   1 can cream of chicken soup
</P>
<P>
   1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles
</P>
<P>
   1 package (15) corn tortillas, quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Cheddar cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   Cook chicken in boiling water, covered, until tender. Strain,
reserve 3 cups broth. Cool chicken, then skin, bone and cut into
bite-sized pieces. Blend soups, chili powder, garlic salt and
tomatoes. Saute green pepper and onion; add to soup mixture. Thin
mixture to desired consistency with reserved broth. In 13-by-9-inch
pan, lightly greased, layer tortilla pieces along bottom, then
chicken, soup mixture, grated cheese. Repeat. Bake at 350 for 30-40
minutes.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Archaeologists hoping to find more about extinct Karankawa Indians 
 
(Photos available on NYT database) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REFUGIO, Texas _ If the accounts of Texas explorers and settlers
are to be taken for gospel truth, and surely they are not, the
Karankawa Indians of the Gulf Coast were 7 feet tall. They were
naked and ugly and they smelled bad, too.
</P>
<P>
   And they were so mean, they'd start eating you while you were
still alive to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But historians of the day _ Spanish priests trying to
Christianize the nomadic Indians and settlers trying to drive them
off their land _ were hardly objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of spin going on and the Karankawa got some
bad PR that continues even today,'' said University of Texas
archaeologist Britt Bousman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Karankawa were a group of giants, large and
mean,'' he said. ``And this whole cannibalism thing, I just don't
think there's anything to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many questions about the Karankawa, who disappeared from Texas
by the mid-1800s, will never be answered. But archaeologists now
have another piece of the puzzle to study: Last week, in the middle
of a major highway construction zone, they started digging up the
graves of what are believed to be the last of the Karankawa.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-year-old remains, first uncovered by Texas Department of
Transportation workers in early March, are among those of at least
127 Europeans and Indians buried in a cemetery on the grounds of
Nuestra Senora del Refugio, the last Spanish mission built in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery brought the $6.2 million expansion of U.S. 77, the
major north-south artery between Houston and Corpus Christi, to an
abrupt halt at the front steps of Our Lady of Refuge, a historic
Catholic church that eventually replaced the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as long lines of cars and 18-wheelers squeezed into
one lane and rounded a curve at the south end of this town of
3,100, archaeologists began sifting through the dirt. Later,
they'll tear up the other lane, and continue the excavation before
widening the highway in an effort to alleviate a weekend bottleneck
that sometimes backs up traffic in Refugio for three or four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The skeletal remains and any other artifacts found buried with
them will be taken to UT's San Antonio campus for identification
and study before they are reinterred, probably a couple of years
from now, at a new location.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Karankawa are extinct, several other Native American
tribes, including the Tonkawa, the Apache and the Caddo, are
working with state authorities to find an appropriate reburial site
and to identify any possible descendants of the mission Indians who
may have merged with another tribe along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are 200-year-old remains, so it's a difficult thing,''
said Don Patterson, president of the Oklahoma-based Tonkawa. ``I
can't say with any certainty that they are part of us, but it's
possible that some straggler or remnant Karankawa may have joined
up with the Tonkawa.''
</P>
<P>
   Although burial records from the mission survived, it's unlikely
that any relatives will step forward to claim the remains. Still,
Bousman and his colleagues, under a $200,000 contract with the
transportation department, will try to distinguish the Spaniards
from the Indians and hope to determine the age, sex and cause of
death for as many as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Since only those graves falling in the highway right-of-way will
be disturbed, archaeologists estimate they will recover the remains
of about 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this is going to be very easy,'' said Nancy
Kenmotsu, supervisor of the archaeology studies program at the
transportation department. ``We know the names of the 127, but we
don't know which name goes with which grave, and we won't have
every grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Texans have been taught in school about the
Karankawa comes from the journals of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca,
the 16th-century Spanish trader and medicine man who lived for
eight years among several South Texas Indian tribes. He described
the Karankawa as extremely tall and muscular, and said the men were
naked with their lower lips and nipples pierced with cane. Both men
and women tattooed their bodies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, archaeologists had little data to confirm the
trader's accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only skeletal evidence of the Karankawa is from
prehistoric sites, and most is too old to confidently say it was
Karankawa,'' said Robert A. Ricklis, a Corpus Christi archaeologist
who wrote a 1996 book on the Karankawa. ``This could be very
significant in terms of understanding the physical characteristics
and the health of the people. There's lots of potential here.''
</P>
<P>
   Research by Ricklis and others indicates that the Karankawa were
nomadic fishermen, hunters and gatherers who wandered from
Galveston Bay in the north to Corpus Christi Bay in the south. In
the fall and winter, they set up temporary villages along the Texas
Gulf Coast and on the offshore islands as base camps for fishing
expeditions in dugout canoes. In spring and summer, they split into
smaller family groups of 30 or 40 people and moved inland to hunt
deer and other animals, and to gather nuts and berries. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; After Cabeza de Vaca's years among the Indians, there was
little documented contact with the Karankawa until the French
explorer Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. Seriously lost in
his quest to locate the mouth of the Mississippi River, La Salle
landed in Matagorda Bay in 1685 and established Fort St. Louis in
the middle of Karankawa territory. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Many in La Salle's party drowned, starved or died of snake
bite; the Karankawa were said to have massacred most of the rest. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Later settlers, even when they were being kind, described the
Karankawa as ``cannibalistic,'' ``atrocious,'' ``bad-tempered'' and
``ungrateful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the most savage looking human beings I ever saw,''
wrote 19th-century blacksmith Noah Smithwick. ``Their ugly faces
were rendered hideous by the alligator grease and dirt with which
they were besmeared from head to foot as a defense against
mosquitoes.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But others noted the Indians' extreme fondness for children,
and described the women as affectionate and pretty, with their
bodies decorated with tattoos of animals, birds and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Cabeza de Vaca and his crew told how survivors of their
shipwreck, near death in the cold of November, were rescued and
nursed back to health by the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there were a lot of derogatory things said by the
people who were trying to kick the Karankawas off of their land,
and what was recorded about the Karankawa depended on whether the
writers were at war with them at the time,'' Ricklis said. ``I've
read all the standard stories about them being scavengers and what
horrible people they were, but there is so much we don't know about
the Karankawa. &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In an effort to convert and ``civilize'' the Indians, Spanish
priests built the mission in 1795 on the north bank of what is now
called Mission River. The priests considered the mission a failure
because they were never very successful at keeping large numbers of
Indians on the grounds. They came for the free food, and when it
ran out, so did the Indians, they said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But Ricklis dismisses theories that the Karankawa came to the
mission only to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never did become a sedentary, Christian community, but
many did become Christians,'' he said. ``They had an arrangement
with the Spanish: `We're not going to be farmers and Christians in
your community, but we'll come and go and participate.' They even
took their newborn babies to be baptized there.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission closed in 1830, and the Karankawa, driven out by
settlers, dispersed and headed south of the Rio Grande. By 1850,
they no longer existed as an identifiable tribe. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In addition to identifying the remains, Bousman and other
archaeologists are anxious to calculate definitively how tall the
Karankawa were, and to try to determine what their health was like,
what they ate, and how they buried their dead. They also might be
able to determine whether there was intermarriage between Europeans
and Karankawa at the mission or in the surrounding community.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study is unlikely to answer two burning questions
Ricklis and others have been pondering for years: Where did the
Karankawa come from and how long did they live here?
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are endless,'' Ricklis said. ``There's so much
that we can learn from this, but there's also so much that we'll
never know.''

   ERBIL, Kurdistan _ Safeen Omer knows the secret to those Iraqi
street rallies for Saddam Hussein shown so often on television. And
now he can talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Omer lives in Iraqi Kurdistan, a region in northern Iraq that,
through a combination of tragedy and coincidence, has been
liberated from Hussein's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds often opposed Saddam. In return, his armies killed
them by the tens of thousands, including once with nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Hussein drove a million Kurds into the mountains near
Iran in an exodus rivaling that of today's Kosovar Albanians. It
was shortly after the Gulf War and U.S. officials, who had ignored
Hussein's Kurdish massacres in the past, now saw the creation of a
Kurdish ``safe haven'' as a way to nurture opposition to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds went back to their cities, but life is far from
perfect. With a mix of gratitude and anxiety, they tell American
visitors that Hussein will return as soon as U.S. planes stop
patrolling the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of Iraq, the region is under the poverty of eight
years of economic sanctions. The Kurds' wars among themselves have
occasionally turned the cities into battlegrounds. But, for now,
the 3 million Kurds can do something their fellow Iraqis cannot
dare to do -- speak openly about their president.
</P>
<P>
   Omer, in his late 20s, is the cheerful aide to a local Kurdish
politician and was my translator for a day. I asked him about the
street rallies I had covered and seen so much of on television. He
knew them well from the days of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   A day or two before a rally, his high school would be visited by
officials from Hussein's Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
   They frequently carried guns and they told students they would
be expelled from school or denied entry to college if they were
missing from the rally. Signs and banners would be supplied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was obliged to carry pictures of Saddam,'' he says. ``It was
not nice to be forced to do something you did not like to do. We
couldn't refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Omer and I sat in a cafe on the slope of Erbil's old city
section, a giant plateau called the Citadel where people have lived
for 8,000 years. We looked down at the crowded city of several
hundred thousand and saw trappings of modern life that are still
not allowed in the rest of Iraq, controlled by Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   For one, satellite dishes are sprouting up on hundreds of
flimsy, corrugated tin rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of Iraq, the dishes are banned with cold Orwellian
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Dish owners do jail time and pay a fine that is then shared with
the neighbor who reported them. Iraqis are left with the four
official TV channels, which sing Hussein's praises.
</P>
<P>
   In Kurdistan, dishes provide access to not only the world's
media, but also the more than 15 local TV stations that have opened
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   There are also dozens of local newspapers sold on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Another visible difference was the absence of Hussein's
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of Iraq, the portraits are almost everywhere -- in
offices, stores and street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's picture is cared for like an icon. I was told that
Iraqis under Saddam fear throwing out newspapers with his picture
and often cut out his photos before tossing the rest of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A foreigner told me he saw gas station attendants in Baghdad
recoil in fear when a customer dropped a bill of Iraqi currency,
which carries Hussein's picture, and stepped on it to keep it from
blowing away. No one wanted to be near the incident.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But, in Kurdistan, they tore down the Hussein portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, non-Kurdish, Arab Iraqis are taking note of the freedom in
Kurdistan. Hundreds have fled to the Kurdish city of Suleimaniyah,
where leaders are especially hostile to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Many face jail in Iraq for refusing to serve in the army or are
suspected of disloyalty by Hussein's agents.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign reporters are a rare sight here. That explains why a
crowd of refugee Iraqis gathered around me one night near a
street-side kabob cart.
</P>
<P>
   They swapped stories of beatings in Iraqi jails and the trouble
that comes to people who speak freely in Iraq. They told me a joke
about Saddam, just a pun comparing Hussein's brother ``Barzan'' to
jungle dweller Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, they said, such a punch line could land you in jail.
But, in the late night darkness on a street corner in Kurdistan,
they repeated it over and over, and laughed out loud.

 &HT;    MULTI-TIERED WHITE HOUSE KOSOVO TEAM STAYS 'FLEXIBLE' IN CRISIS
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0603.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like most effective managers, President Clinton
tends to think of problems in one of three ways: those that can be
ignored, those that can be solved and those that must be managed.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which box Kosovo fits into.
</P>
<P>
   Here, after all, is a foreign policy crisis with at least four
key dimensions -- military, humanitarian, diplomatic and political
-- each of which is affected daily, sometimes hourly, by
developments in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Each breaks down further into layer upon layer of sub-issues,
the fumbling of any of which could cost lives and spell disaster in
one of the biggest high-stakes gambits of Clinton's 6 1/2-year
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been closely engaged across the board, at times
surprising military commanders with questions that go quickly to
the heart of complex matters no one expects a president to master.
He will meet Thursday with his senior uniformed military advisors,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to discuss possible options for using
ground troops if NATO decides to invade Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He's avoided micro-management, however. Besides being contrary
to Clinton's style, that approach probably wouldn't work very well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton relies on a flexible, multi-tiered team with
diplomats, generals and lawyers at its core to manage U.S. policy,
objectives and long-term strategy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The top-tier of the effort is Clinton and his national security
chiefs: Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; National Security
Adviser Samuel E. Berger; Defense Secretary William Cohen; Joint
Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Hugh Shelton; CIA Director George
Tenet: White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This team, known inside the White House as the national security
principals, generally meets twice weekly in the ornate West Wing
Cabinet Room or the windowless Situation Room in the White House
basement. They discuss developments and options on the Kosovo
crisis, even as Berger keeps Clinton updated daily _ sometimes
hourly _ in person or by secure phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Berger generally meets twice a week with the other principals,
minus the president, to examine issues and make decisions not
requiring Clinton's input.
</P>
<P>
   By the time an issue reaches the principals level for a
decision, it has, in most cases, already been vetted, examined and
analyzed by a third tier called the deputies committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chaired by Berger's deputy, James Steinberg, the deputies
committee is in many ways the guts of the management operation,
what Steinberg describes as the ``senior operating committee,'' of
the Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies have met, with few exceptions, seven days a week
since the Kosovo crisis boiled over into a full-blown military
operation March 24.
</P>
<P>
   A bit more fluid than the principals, this committee generally
groups Shelton's vice chairman, U.S. Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston,
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the undersecretary of
defense Walter Slocombe, CIA Deputy Director John Gordon, the
undersecretary for political affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, and Vice
President Al Gore's security adviser, Leon Feurth.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies' role is to clarify priorities, lay out specific
policy options and try to assess the risks each alternative poses.
They then send their analysis up the management ladder to the
decision-makers. The idea is to keep the executive level from
getting bogged down with excessive detail or distracted by policy
sideshows so that they may stay focused on the big picture and the
broad goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to frame the issues for the principals,'' said Ralston,
``to make sure that all the views are represented. Nothing's
overlooked, and we eliminate as much of the underbrush as we can so
that the principals can deal with the core issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the principals, the deputies committee was active even
before the Kosovo crisis erupted. Part of its challenge, said
Steinberg, is to continue managing the broad panoply of national
security issues before it -- from nuclear nonproliferation to
international terrorism -- that don't touch directly on the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to not lose sight of the fact that you've
got multiple priorities here,'' said Steinberg. ``We have a lot of
other positions in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is something called the interagency working group,
charged chiefly with coordination efforts such as keeping the cable
traffic current between the White House and key U.S. embassies and
missions abroad. This group also helps to iron out interagency
conflicts and pool ideas and initiatives among the military,
diplomatic and political shops.
</P>
<P>
   Key players in the working group are Greg Shulte, the National
Security Council's Balkans point man; and diplomats Robert Gelbard
and James Dobbins, both of whom hold ambassadorial status and
Balkans portfolios.

diplomats, generals and lawyers at its core to manage U.S. policy,
objectives and long-term strategy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The top-tier of the effort is Clinton and his national security
chiefs: Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; National Security
Adviser Samuel E. Berger; Defense Secretary William Cohen; Joint
Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Hugh Shelton; CIA Director George
Tenet: White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This team, known inside the White House as the national security
principals, generally meets twice weekly in the ornate West Wing
Cabinet Room or the windowless Situation Room in the White House
basement. They discuss developments and options on the Kosovo
crisis, even as Berger keeps Clinton updated daily _ sometimes
hourly _ in person or by secure phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Berger generally meets twice a week with the other principals,
minus the president, to examine issues and make decisions not
requiring Clinton's input.
</P>
<P>
   By the time an issue reaches the principals level for a
decision, it has, in most cases, already been vetted, examined and
analyzed by a third tier called the deputies committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chaired by Berger's deputy, James Steinberg, the deputies
committee is in many ways the guts of the management operation,
what Steinberg describes as the ``senior operating committee,'' of
the Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies have met, with few exceptions, seven days a week
since the Kosovo crisis boiled over into a full-blown military
operation March 24.
</P>
<P>
   A bit more fluid than the principals, this committee generally
groups Shelton's vice chairman, U.S. Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston,
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the undersecretary of
defense Walter Slocombe, CIA Deputy Director John Gordon, the
undersecretary for political affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, and Vice
President Al Gore's security adviser, Leon Feurth.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies' role is to clarify priorities, lay out specific
policy options and try to assess the risks each alternative poses.
They then send their analysis up the management ladder to the
decision-makers. The idea is to keep the executive level from
getting bogged down with excessive detail or distracted by policy
sideshows so that they may stay focused on the big picture and the
broad goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to frame the issues for the principals,'' said Ralston,
``to make sure that all the views are represented. Nothing's
overlooked, and we eliminate as much of the underbrush as we can so
that the principals can deal with the core issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the principals, the deputies committee was active even
before the Kosovo crisis erupted. Part of its challenge, said
Steinberg, is to continue managing the broad panoply of national
security issues before it -- from nuclear nonproliferation to
international terrorism -- that don't touch directly on the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to not lose sight of the fact that you've
got multiple priorities here,'' said Steinberg. ``We have a lot of
other positions in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is something called the interagency working group,
charged chiefly with coordination efforts such as keeping the cable
traffic current between the White House and key U.S. embassies and
missions abroad. This group also helps to iron out interagency
conflicts and pool ideas and initiatives among the military,
diplomatic and political shops.
</P>
<P>
   Key players in the working group are Greg Shulte, the National
Security Council's Balkans point man; and diplomats Robert Gelbard
and James Dobbins, both of whom hold ambassadorial status and
Balkans portfolios.

ONCE OBSCURE, ARGENTINE COMPOSER IS NOW OMNIPRESENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, most of us had never heard of Astor Piazzolla.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his music is everywhere. A classical guitar concert without
the music of Piazzolla is a rarity these days; Russian violinist
Gidon Kremer surprised Fort Worth audiences with a solo by
Piazzolla for his encore when he appeared with the St. Petersburg
Philharmonic at Bass Performance Hall in October. And on the
classical concert scene, Piazzolla's music has been recorded by
Kremer, Daniel Barenboim, Yo-Yo Ma, the Kronos Quartet and the
Orchestra of St. Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Schubert and J.S. Bach, Piazzolla had to wait until
after he was dead to be famous: After decades of, at best, regional
recognition in South America, the Argentine composer had just begun
to attract international recognition by the time he died at 71 in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Who was Astor Piazzolla?
</P>
<P>
   He was the composer who wanted to do for the tango what Chopin
did for the waltz: to turn a popular dance form into a classical
concert form.
</P>
<P>
   Piazzolla's obituary in ``The New York Times'' in July 1992 was
simple but explained his extraordinary cross current of musical
influences. Born in Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires, he spent
his early years in New York, where he absorbed the influence of
jazz, klezmer and classical music _ including piano lessons with
one of Rachmaninoff's pupils. There, he also met the ``King of
Tango,'' Carlos Gardel.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazzolla returned to Argentina as a teen-ager, he
continued his exploration in many directions, studying classical
composition with Alberto Ginastera while playing the bandoneon in
tango orchestras. His ``Sinfonia de Buenos Aires'' won him a
scholarship to study in Paris with Nadia Boulanger (teacher of
Aaron Copland and numerous other key figures in American
20th-century music); he returned to Buenos Aires in the 1950s ready
to create the ``new tango.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Argentina,'' Piazzolla later told interviewer Jon Pareles,
``you can change the government, you can change the literature, you
can change the architecture. But if you change the tango, there is
trouble. ... Traditional tango listeners hated me. I introduced
harmonies, fugues, counterpoint and other irreverences; people
thought I was going crazy. All the tango critics and the radio
stations of Buenos Aires started criticizing me; they called me a
clown, they said my music was `paranoiac.' And they made me
popular. The young people who had lost interest in tango started
listening to me. It was a war of one against all _ but in 10 years,
the war was won.''
</P>
<P>
   While revitalizing and reforming the tango, Piazzolla kept the
key underlying element: sex. Which explains the sometimes
irrationally repetitious segments and the predominance of mellow
melodies.
</P>
<P>
   Area audiences have been introduced to Piazzolla's music in
choreographed settings by Fort Worth-based modern dance
choreographer Bruce Wood and former Fort Worth Dallas Ballet
artistic director Paul Mejia; Gutierrez presented the Bandoneon
Concerto and the short ``Oblivion'' for bandoneon and strings in a
concert with the Fort Worth Chamber Orchestra in spring 1998.
</P>
<P>
   We're not likely to run out of new music by Piazzolla for some
time. He produced a body of 750 works _ enough concertos, operas,
and film and theatrical scores to keep performers busy for years.
</P>
<P>
   Why the relatively sudden increase in interest in Piazzolla?
</P>
<P>
   Piazzolla's music was written during an era, the 1960s and
1970s, when atonal music dominated and excluded other music, such
as his.
</P>
<P>
   But the current eclectic, neoromantic era has taken to
Piazzolla's music enthusiastically, embracing not only its
traditional values of immediate audience appeal and melody but its
unique sound. It's entirely unlike anything else in the classical
repertoire, thanks to its combination of tango, jazz and classical
strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Schubert or Mozart,'' says pianist Emanuel Ax, who
has recorded and performed two-piano arrangements of Piazzolla's
music with Piazzolla protege Pablo Ziegler. ``But it's exciting,
beautiful, often fun. And that's enough.''

WITH FRIENDS LIKE THIS, YOU NEED A BEER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON and ELLIOTT KNIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people just don't have a sense of humor. Take my friend
Elliott. I wrote about him in a recent column, and now he's
irritated with me. ``Made me sound like a moron,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why _ all I did was call him a Philistine and imply
that he's a sot. ``I was just joshing,'' I replied. ``Too bad you
can't write your own column, ha-ha.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the swine did it. And to show what a nice guy I am, I
persuaded the editor to run it, and here it is:
</P>
<P>
   ``So my buddy the Beer Nut, Mister Big-Shot Column Writer, gives
me the pen _ actually, the keyboard _ and says through gritted
teeth, `Knock yourself out.' And I knew he meant it _ literally.
See, we go back a long way. I know all the dirt on the Beer Nut.
But since he knows all the dirt on me, too, I'll be fairly gentle
on him.
</P>
<P>
   I travel a lot for work nowadays, so we don't get together as
often as we'd like. But when we do, the Beer Nut and I head to the
Flying Saucer, a great Fort Worth joint that serves beers from
around the world. And while he professes to be a sophisticated
imbiber, I've seen him pound down his share of generic no-name
beers. His only requirement: cold, so he can't taste 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Because to the Beer Nut, image is everything. He drives fancy
cars and lives in a fancy house in a fancy, historic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   `(The Beer Nut notes: My car is nine stinkin' years old, and the
term ``historic'' must mean ``dilapidated,'' because the joint is
falling down around our ears. Where does he get this hoity-toity
stuff?)'
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet I always think about his bumper sticker, now long gone
from the tail-end of his old Toyota: `Decadence ... a Way of Life.'
To my mind, that says it all about the Beer Nut: He's a
beer-swiller in the land of high-rollers!
</P>
<P>
   `(The Beer Nut notes: What a great sticker that was.)'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm here to tell you about a recent late afternoon we
spent sampling beers with our kids at a local watering hole. With
our kids!!!?! We were both amazed at this turn of events, because
we've known each other since before the kids were born! This just
gives you a clue as to how old the Beer Nut actually is!
</P>
<P>
   Patrick (his son) and Kellie (my daughter) educated us geezers
as to the finer points of their beer selections. Their primary
decision points were: 1) `Hey! It's $2.50-a-pint day!' and 2) `If
you order a Bass, you get a free glass!'
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Bass, no question, but decided to let them enjoy their
brews while we moved on to Murphy's Irish Cream. It's the kind of
smooth, palatable stout that appeals to folks who like the idea of
a Guinness, but find the actual stuff too strong. Murphy's is soft
where Guinness is bitter, smooth as opposed to tart, and on the
whole, a very forgiving pint of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which brings me back to my nearly three decades of friendship
with the Beer Nut: I like him despite his extremes, probably
because of them. He's a bit tart, a little bitter, but soft on the
inside _ pretty much like a Murphy's, when you get right down to
it. My suggestion: Take his advice and sample the beers he
recommends. All I know is that, after nearly 30 years, I have yet
to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his choice of beers, that is.''
</P>
<P>
   `(The Beer Nut notes: Just remember, old pal, paybacks are
hell.)'

WHERE THERE'S A `WILL,' THERE'S A ZIPPY, QUIPPY SEAN HAYES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARRISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sean Hayes, master scene thief, got his star turn as a heartsick
gay photographer in the 1997 independent film ``Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss.'' An NBC casting executive saw the movie at a Sundance
Film Festival screening and faxed him the entire ``Will &AMP; Grace''
script.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the 28-year-old Hayes, whose perpetual smile
occupies half his face, had the producers reaching for contracts.
``Timing, wit, execution, nerve, gumption _ he had what we wanted
and something a little more,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace'' producer and
co-creator Max Mutchnick said of Hayes, who grew up in suburban
Chicago glued to ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, his talent for making lame lines hilarious is
innate. As Jack McFarland, the wisecracking, unconditionally
self-possessed gay sidekick to Eric McCormack's strait-laced (read:
boring) gay lawyer Will, Hayes often amplifies the zing of a punch
line by throwing in an assortment of devices _ firing off a look of
distress, nausea or glee; striking a gaudy pose; flipping into a
headstand on a chair; spinning his legs as though on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hayes' Jack who gave the series a swift kickoff when,
during the second episode, he crossed verbal swords with the show's
other standout, the squeaky-voiced Karen (Megan Mullally), snippy
assistant to Grace (Debra Messing). The two ended up rubbing
bellies and trading fashion faux pas. If there was a funnier sitcom
scene this season, I'd like to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, a motor-mouth of train-wreck proportions, is easily the
best thing about this year's rookie hit, which ranked 40th in the
Nielsen rankings, pulling in a weekly viewership of 12.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' was written with NBC viewer sensibilities in
mind: Its pace, rhythm and snappy dialogue is right out of a
``Friends'' script. NBC even toyed with the idea of a
Thursday-night slot for the comedy, but when the fall schedule
arrived, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' was perched at ... 8:30 p.m. Tuesday,
sandwiched between ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a no-brainer that Hayes plays the most outrageous character
introduced this season on any show, and that includes the disaster
that was Desmond Pfeiffer. His is also a character that has
shrewdly served a prime purpose: to be so flamboyantly gay that it
takes the pressure off Will. (To kiss or not to kiss finally came
to a head in the season finale, when NBC decided that a written
smooch ``didn't work creatively,'' which means they still feel it's
too early.)
</P>
<P>
   Having support characters show up the leads is hardly
jaw-dropping (see Michael Richards in Jerry Seinfeld's ``Seinfeld''
and everyone with a line in Kirstie Alley's ``Veronica's Closet,''
a show for which, ironically, Hayes was turned down). But it is
unusual for a network to zero in on a back-up player the way NBC
has by airing those 30-second ``Jack spots,'' complete with a
montage of Jack footage and a Jack theme song.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who is said to be mulling film scripts, only seems to
have come out of nowhere. He started in regional musicals,
eventually moving on to Chicago's famed Steppenwolf Theater. He
spent two years in an acclaimed original work called ``Role Play''
before rolling dice in Hollywood, where casting directors were
immediately taken with his disarming charm and choirboy good looks.
(He looks no more than 15.)
</P>
<P>
   Lots of commercial work followed. His big, high-profile moments:
as a henpecked husband thirsting for a Bud Light and as an
overeager Doritos fan. His three-headed partygoer in an ad for
Geico Insurance is a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Now right in the high-profile mix on a weekly basis, Hayes has
earned such across-the-board kudos for his boundless energy and
spicy irreverence you wonder if ``Will &AMP; Grace'' would be the same
without him. (Pssst: It wouldn't.)

DEALING WITH BIRD KARMA HAS ME POOPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I shuddered immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It was staring at me with cool, beady eyes that were the murky
color of an eight-ball. It didn't flinch, flutter or turn away.
From its perch at the top of one of the columns on my front porch,
its gaze was hard and direct, steady and unwavering.
</P>
<P>
   I had seen that same look before, some 11 years ago, and it
haunts me still.
</P>
<P>
   On that hot, wavy afternoon in 1988, I made contact with another
pair of those black-bubble pigeon eyes and I honked. I honked
again. Another pigeon, squatting next to it, flapped its wings and
split. The other one, however, turned to look me directly in the
eye as my car cast its shadow on the bird, eclipsed it, and then
spat out a thousand feathers falling in front of the sun in my
rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   It was my friends Jeff and Jamie who truly cast horror on the
episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lazy bird didn't even make an attempt to get up,'' I
assured them. ``How can that be my fault?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like the bird was deaf,'' Jamie said. ``You killed a
handicapped bird!''
</P>
<P>
   ``And apparently, the spouse witnessed the whole thing,'' Jeff
said. ``Pigeons mate for life, you know. What a sad little nest
that must be tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How was I supposed to know it was a special-needs bird?'' I
said defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You owe that pigeon family a life,'' Jeff informed me. ``And
you know that karma returns tenfold, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten fowl will darken your doorway until your debt is repaid,''
Jamie added.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't believe their words until exactly 24 hours later, when
I was walking with a very cute boy from my class at ASU. Suddenly,
a pinecone struck me on the head, and as I reached my hand up to
rub my scalp, a warm ooze of bird crap spread across my forehead.
The cute boy pointed and said, ``I think you're going to need shots
for that,'' before he handed me a dirty piece of newspaper from the
ground to clean myself up with.
</P>
<P>
   The prophecy was indeed proven true that day and has continued
to grow throughout the decade as I've been haunted by birds.
</P>
<P>
   A sparrow became trapped in my bathroom vent, worked its way
into the bathroom and refused to leave for four days, crashing into
the shower door and the mirror repeatedly. I had to start feeding
it because I was afraid that it would die, and I finally got rid of
it after it knocked itself unconscious and I captured it with a
large bath towel, but not before it pooped on my toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   I was forced to chase a neighborhood child's pet, a diseased
pigeon with a broken wing, down the street and into various
neighbors' yards in my pajamas one morning when it escaped. After
delivering the bird safely into the hands of the child, the imp
looked me square in the face and said, ``When you were bent over
chasing Petey, we all saw your boobs.''
</P>
<P>
   One crafty bird hid in my car and staged an ambush the minute I
got on Loop 202 and was lighting a cigarette, which resulted in a
small but manageable fire that proved Twinkies really don't burn,
they just sort of liquify.
</P>
<P>
   While I was eating lunch with a friend on an outside patio,
another bird emptied its bowels on me, hitting me with its best
shot on the shoulder, and then, in a second attack, it turned my
half-eaten burrito into an enchilada-style one.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save a baby bird that managed to fall out of its
nest, I took it to a lady who had turned her kitchen into a bird
sanctuary. When she asked me for a $35 donation for the 3-ounce
bird's room and board, I diverted her attention by saying, `Hey,
your cat sure is eating something big!` and then ran to my car.
</P>
<P>
   After watching me take her offspring away in a shoe box, the
mother of the baby bird began to target me for several months every
time I left my house, pecking me repeatedly in the head, arm and,
most predominately, the right _ and firmer of the two _ butt cheek.
One time it hit me behind the ear, and I looked up just in time to
see it fly away with a chunk of my hair.
</P>
<P>
   So when I recently saw the pigeon glaring at me from atop the
porch column, my blood naturally turned to ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead,'' I said as I stood beneath it, providing the bird
with a perfectly good target. ``Let's just get this over with.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bird made no move. Instead, it devised a devilish
torture that consisted of swooping down on me in a mad attack every
time I opened the front door, causing me to scream and bat my hands
wildly about.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when the bird was running errands, I took a broom and
knocked down the nest, and blocked the area with a large ceramic
pot. My strategy worked until the next day, when I saw the
beginnings of another nest on the next porch column.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't take it anymore,'' I complained to my husband as I sat
on the couch in our living room. ``One day that bird is going to
pluck my eyeballs out, you just wait and see!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be lucky if that thing didn't affix itself to your face
and try to pull your brain out through your nose,'' my husband
said. ``You owe them a life, remember! That thing is probably just
trying to lay some eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then _ and may God strike me dead if this isn't the truth _
I heard a rather loud FLAP, FLAP FLAP noise. As I turned to look, a
big, black raven swept toward me like I was a prairie dog. Due to
my bird battle experience, I rolled onto the floor, covered my nose
and screamed.
</P>
<P>
   My husband saw the assault, grabbed a towel and batted at the
raven until he had herded it into the bathroom, where he promptly
opened the bathroom window and shut the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did that come from?'' he asked, breathing heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a warning! Don't you understand? That bird,'' I
shouted, getting up off the floor, ``was Number NINE!''
</P>
<P>
   My husband looked at me quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number Ten,'' I explained, ``is waiting to be born up in that
nest on top of the column! It's the life I owe! My karma is DONE!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' he said, pointing me toward the kitchen sink.
``Number Nine left a big Number Two on your head. And when you bent
down to hit the floor, I saw your boob.'' &QL;

PARADISE FOUND: TROUT COOKED IN THE WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photo available on the Wieck database)

 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ All that hiking and wading along treacherous
stream bottoms is great physical exercise. The solitude and
continual gurgling of the waters in the background soothe the most
frazzled nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how you fish for trout, the game itself, the
pursuit, can be as challenging as the rules and equipment you
choose. Right at the top of grand advantages to trout fishing,
though, is that catching your own provides the precious luxury of
truly fresh fish for the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I was a wee lad of about 12 and knew everything there
was to know about trout fishing, my parents dropped me and a
like-minded friend off for a five-day camping adventure.
</P>
<P>
   I remember we had an old tent and sleeping bags, an ancient
pump-up Coleman stove and minimalist provisions. Milk, sugar,
flour, a couple of big cans of Dinty Moore stew, and Campbell
soups, and just enough loose change for one frosty Yoo-hoo a day
from the camp store at the campground entrance. I recall my
father's last words, in French, complete with Gallic wry smile as
he drove off in the sunset leaving us there: ``Dinner, gentlemen,
is still swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem. We were already self-reliant little trout killers on
the streams back home and we knew what we had to do. Stun a few
black-nosed dace in the shallows, stick them on a bare size 10 hook
and let them drift free under big rocks. And it worked. We had all
the fresh trout we wanted, in the 10-inch range, which is prime
frying pan material. Never in my life were trout easier to catch
than when it never occurred to me we could fail.
</P>
<P>
   Failure came at a different place. Catching trout is one thing.
Cooking them so they are not just edible, but delicious is quite
something else. That little adventure, and several others like it
with the Boy Scouts and on our own, provided a lifetime of don'ts
when it comes to cooking freshly caught trout streamside.
</P>
<P>
   Don't use an open fire for cooking unless you have the patience
to wait for uniform hot coals. Don't try to fillet the little
suckers; clean and then cook them whole every time. Don't place
trout on a grill over an open fire and expect the fish to remain on
top of that grill when it's cooked, or cook evenly. Watch a day's
worth of catch slip through the grill into the fire as you
frantically try to save bits and pieces.
</P>
<P>
   I swear by _ rather than at _ a few key utensils. No to a
fireplace. Yes to a propane Coleman camp stove every time, the
sophisticated progeny of my childhood adventures. Gas gives good
control. The two-burner stove is light enough to maneuver anywhere
but sufficient for complicated preparations if necessary. A picnic
table, or just a pile of rocks, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   For trout in the wild, I strongly favor a seasoned cast-iron pan
with not too high a lip.
</P>
<P>
   But always remember the center piece is fresh, delicate trout.
Sweet fleshed and very dainty, a gentle flavor easily masked by too
strong batters or spicing, or even too much flame. Keep it simple,
that's always the best way.
</P>
<P>
   The best sizes are 8 to 10 inches, although let's face it, the
best fish are those you have. There's a neat, easy way to clean
them from front to back that takes away the gill plates along with
the vicera and just leaves the head attached by the back bone. If
that's a problem, just slit from anal opening to gills and the
insides come out easily. Don't forget to scrape away with the back
of your thumb the dark line at the inside center. This serves as
the fish's kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Swish the fish around briskly in the water you caught him from,
plucking away bits and strands that cling.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper bag mix half flour, half corn meal, salt, pepper and
maybe an inkling of paprika. Drop the freshly cleaned fish into the
bag, flip around, pull out and stuff heartily with either fresh
dill, tarragon or cress. The last is best. At the aforementioned
camp from my youth, there are patches of natural wild cress that we
used for salads and to stuff our little brookies. I like the
moisture the fresh herbs impart, and an unmistakable flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Cook over medium heat, with a little vegetable oil or butter in
the pan. No olive oil, please, unless you want to smoke up the
campsite. Don't overcook. A few minutes on each side, until the
flesh starts to pull away from the bone, and voila.
</P>
<P>
   With bigger fish, such as we had, separate the fillets in big
pieces after they're mostly cooked, pulling away the bones in
single strands, then finishing off those pieces with a little added
salt and pepper. But again, don't overcook. Remember, trout as
sushi is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   On a fishing trip one recent day, we finished our trout in the
wild with pretoasted almonds sizzled for a few moments, fresh lemon
wedges, and more rose. A good, dry rose is excellent with trout
because it doesn't overwhelm and our $27 bottle of Domaine Ott from
France was all of that.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, roses are not as popular as they ought to be in
this country and almost always are too sweet for serious work.
Otherwise, a chardonnay finished in the European style, that is,
non-oaky, is also fine for delicate trout as is a semi-dry light on
the acid riesling. Stay away from the big-bodied, bold whites, or
the acidic ones.
</P>
<P>
   On the side we cooked up a little store-bought polenta and some
little red potatoes with thyme.
</P>
<P>
   FREDDY'S TROUT MEUNIERE
</P>
<P>
   1 trout per person, head on or off (the trout, not the person)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup white flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Chopped herbs for stuffing
</P>
<P>
   Chopped parsley and chopped whatever herb used to stuff the fish
for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup toasted almonds
</P>
<P>
   Combine flour, cornmeal, salt and pepper in a paper bag. Drop
the trout in a paper bag with the seasoned flour and toss about.
Stuff trout with fresh herbs, then brown in a cast-iron skillet
with the oil at a medium heat, about 3 minutes a side. Remove fish
to a serving platter and cover with foil. Brown the butter in the
skillet, add lemon juice and chopped herbs. Pour hot over the
trout.

 &HT;    KUKES: A POOR ALBANIAN CITY HOSTS EVEN POORER REFUGEES
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., June 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ In the cool springtime mornings here, acrid
smoke hangs close to the ground from the burning garbage in a dump
at the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The water supply, now rationed to two-hours per day, is low and
only the lucky few who rise before the sun will have showers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everywhere is the rank odor of open sewage and sweat as
the sun inches higher in the sky, and the temperature rises with
it.
</P>
<P>
   So begins the day for 25,000 locals in Kukes and four times as
many refugees living in and around the ramshackle town now
distinguished as the home to Kosovo's dispossessed ethnic
Albanians. Roughly 400,000 refugees have passed through Kukes, and
100,000 have remained in dusty tent camps and crowded private
homes, making it the epicenter of Europe's biggest humanitarian
crisis since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of fame we could have done without,''
concedes Mayor Safet Sula, 37, a democratic reformer and former
university professor. ``It goes without saying that we have big
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a tide of impoverished refugees descending on a similar
small town in the United States. Now, imagine this town was already
dirt poor, falling apart and rife with unemployment before the
influx of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of Kukes, a town blessed with beautiful
mountains and cursed by fate. Situated in remote northern Albania
and, like the rest of the country, severed politically for much of
this century from the rest of the world, Kukes is a town that
history largely passed by.
</P>
<P>
   The current town, with its deteriorating block apartments and
potholed streets, was built between 1962 and 1978 after the
construction of a huge hydro-electric dam, whose reservoir flooded
the valley and the historic village of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the people residing among the Alp-like Vikut
Mountains here stretch back to the Illyrian tribes, identified by
the Greeks when they settled the coastal areas of what is now
Albania in the 7th century B.C. Next came the Romans, whose
spreading empire incorporated the area as part of the province of
Macedonia in 146 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Turks followed to encompass the remote area as
part of the Ottoman Empire. But frigid in the winter and broiling
in the summer, Kukes never showed much promise for settlement or
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, historian Edward Gibbon wrote of Albania
that ``within sight of Italy is (a land) less known than the
interior of America.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   No one can seem to agree on why the place is called Kukes (which
Albanians alternatively pronounce ``kook-ESS,'' ``KOOK-see,'' or
simply ``KOOKS''). One legend says Kukes derives its name from the
cuckoo bird. Others believe two more plausible theories: that the
name either comes from the Illyrian word for ``forest,'' or that
Kukes took its name from a 17th century Turkish military leader who
commanded a garrison nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its roots, it was never a large place. A 1938 estimate
put the population at only 1,800. Electricity did not arrive until
1946, when engineers plundered a German tank left behind after the
war and used its diesel engine as a generator.
</P>
<P>
   Italian engineers carved the roads across the rough mountains in
the 1920s and little has been done to improve them since. Until
1991, private ownership of cars was restricted by the communist
regime, so few automobiles plowed the paths now being chewed up by
heavy trucks delivering supplies and moving refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the region's knotty history, schoolchildren learn of
legendary battles fought in the Kukes valley between Albanian
militias outnumbered by powerful armies -- the Turks in 1909 and
the Serbs in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In Communist times, under the rule of Albanian dictator Ever
Hoxha, Kukes was eyed as a potential tourist spot, as it sits
astride the man-made lake and scenic mountains. But mining of
copper and chromium, once the town's major job-producer, dumped its
by-products directly into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   When Communism fell, the mines went out of business, leaving
people in Kukes without jobs and with a lake tainted by heavy
metals.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest public building, the whitewashed Mosque of Salim Ben
Mahfuz, was opened in 1995, financed by an Egyptian religious
foundation. But almost no one attends it. While Albania is a mostly
Muslim country, its legacy of Communism means there are few devout.
</P>
<P>
   The annual per capita income of Albania, a country of 3.4
million, is $830, the lowest in Europe. Officially, unemployment in
Kukes was 40 percent before the onset of the refugee crisis.
Unofficially, the figure is put at 80 percent. gap???
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the refugees live in private homes, not the
camps, stretching the resources of Kukes to their breaking point.
The city has asked international relief agencies for help to expand
its aging water system. The mountains of garbage being generated by
the population boom are simply being piled at the northern end of
town and torched.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very poor place. There are no jobs for the Albanians
who live here, much less for the refugees,'' said Imri Gashi, 38,
who worked as a construction foreman in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The main occupation is trading, much of it illegal. Since
Communist rule collapsed in Albania in 1991, the government has
been unable to control its borders. Bandits rule in much of the
northeast, emblematic of the nationwide lawlessness following a
coup in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the world will never really know us -- ever,''
laments Nasif Dukle, a local teacher and the town's historian.
``I'm afraid it will be a strong and lasting memory of war and of
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis has been a boom to local hotels and restaurants
in the town. English-speaking Albanians are earning as much as $100
a day working for aid agencies and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like it was sent from heaven. It is raining money, and
maybe it will last only another month. But everyone is making as
much as they can now,'' says Jonas, a local translator.
</P>
<P>
   One tangible gift of the refugee crisis is a new dirt and gravel
airfield, built by engineers from the United Arab Emirates and
replacing an unusable runway built in 1937 by the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   The town's mayor wants more. He puts faith in NATO that the
Balkans can be put straight, and Kukes will for the first time in
its history have a chance to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that things will change in a good way,'' Sula, the
mayor, says. ``If the problems of Kosovo are solved and the border
is open, we can have new markets for our goods and new friendships.
This could be an important crossroads for that.''

ADULTS TAKE UP MUSIC FOR THE LOVE OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By day, Dr. Robert Kelly deals with disease and life-or-death
matters.
</P>
<P>
   But every night, for an hour or so before going to bed, Kelly's
mind turns to Chopin, Tchaikovsky and J.S. Bach, as he practices on
the restored antique Kohler upright piano that he inherited from
his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to point your mind in a different direction,''
Kelly says. ``It's so different from what I do all day'' as an
internal medicine specialist.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, piano lessons were something kids took from a
grown-up teacher. Now, although no one keeps precise numbers, a
growing number of adults are taking piano lessons, often from a
teacher younger than themselves. Kelly, 44, studies with Igor
Resnianski, a 33-year-old Siberian-born graduate student at Texas
Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Even the esteemed Cliburn Foundation has taken notice; next
week, it will sponsor the first International Piano Competition for
Outstanding Amateurs. Modeled on a similar competition in Paris _
and not to be confused with the ``real'' Van Cliburn International
Piano Competition, to be held again in Fort Worth in 2001 _ the
amateur competition will feature 97 devoted amateurs from 10
countries in solo competition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the contestants are probably much like Kelly, who took
lessons as a youth but then became busy with school and career.
Kelly's three children had taken lessons from Resnianski for
several years. One week, when one of the youngsters was sick, Kelly
took a deep breath and asked if he could take the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, at the first amateur concerto concert at the
TCU/Cliburn Piano Institute, Kelly auditioned with a movement of
Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21. Kelly didn't make the cut, but
he'll back this year with a movement from J.S. Bach's Concerto No.
5 in F minor, once again dreaming of the chance to play with a
professional orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional in a high-prestige and high-pressure field,
Kelly is certainly not alone in his devotion to amateur
music-making, says Amanda Byars, a Dallas teacher who specializes
in teaching adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority have been in scientific fields, or bankers, or
lawyers,'' she says. ``Surprisingly, very few have been
homemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars says that her oldest student is in his early 70s, though
the average age is 37-47.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not successful with my first adults,'' she says. ``I had
to learn and research why and how adults come for piano lessons.
They really want to be there, and have a genuine interest in
classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   Janie Brown, 43, of Fort Worth works as a training instructor at
Boeing Aircraft in Irving and is about to become a grandmother.
With her family grown, she decided to use her spare time to
concentrate on what she calls her ``heart's desire'' _ studying
music. She found Fort Worth teacher Patricia Brown in the telephone
book, began with voice lessons about four years ago and added piano
about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat tells me I'm further along than I should be,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   But Janie Brown has more ambition than just having fun. She
wants to enter college as a music major, and more important, ``I
want to be able to show my grandchildren how to play the piano,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Brown teaches voice and piano to children and adults at
her traditional-style in-home studio in south Fort Worth, and
admits: ``Some teachers like teaching first- and second-graders,
but the adults are my favorites. I like relating to someone who's
doing it because he or she wants to _ not for any other incentive.
And I can relate to how they have to schedule it around family,
jobs and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The TCU/Cliburn Piano Institute had been around for decades as a
summer program for aspiring amateurs. Tamas Ungar, the
Hungarian-born pianist who heads the piano department at TCU, and
who founded and directs the Cliburn/TCU Piano Institute, added the
amateurs' program when he began to notice an increase in amateur
adult interest in the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults have more time,'' he says. But he has also noticed the
particular interest among members of what he calls the
``intellectual professions. People like doctors and lawyers, who
need the creativity outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ungar's guidance, Fort Worth has become a focal point for
many amateurs, who have arrived from all over the world at the
institute for three consecutive years to play in master classes
(essentially, lessons in front of an audience), take lessons,
participate in group discussions and share ideas. And, starting
last year, they could compete in the one-of-a-kind event in which
several are chosen to perform with the Fort Worth Chamber
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Rust, a California-based consultant in urban economics,
amateur oboist and publisher of ``Music for the Love of It,'' a
bimonthly newsletter for amateur musicians, also notes a definite
increase in adult amateur musical activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are living longer, retiring earlier and finding that
music is a wonderful thing to do with their time,'' he says. ``It's
a way of keeping the mind and spirit young, and a way of keeping in
touch with other people. It's a form of spiritual renewal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996, I watched the TCU/Cliburn Piano
Institute's newly instituted ``amateur weekend'' with pure envy.
</P>
<P>
   I was there as part of my job as Star-Telegram classical music
critic. But as often happens to reporters at events they cover, I
came away a changed person.
</P>
<P>
   After watching grandmothers and anesthesiologists struggle
through _ but thoroughly enjoy _ Mozart and Schubert, I was
determined to play the piano again. But I realized that, in spite
of years of piano lessons, I couldn't sit down and play a whole
piece.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about my job is the chance to hear the
greatest pianists in the world, live, almost weekly. But the piano
wasn't invented just to be listened to from afar. To play a prelude
of Chopin is the equivalent of owning a pencil sketch by Rembrandt;
with a few dollars' worth of music and a few minutes of daily
practice, one can ``own'' a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   I was fortunate to grow up in a small town in Oklahoma that was
the home of one of the best independent studio teachers in America,
Jonetta Hinkle. That kind and vivacious lady introduced me not only
to Bach, Beethoven and romantic composers, but to the energy of my
favorite 20th-century music.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as I flailed with hopeless teen-age nonchalance through
the lean textures of a Mozart sonata, she very seriously told me
that it was time I started actually caring about the notes _ every
single note. That is a standard I have tried to hold myself to, and
it is the one absolute value I hold for all the musicians I review
and criticize.
</P>
<P>
   When I moved on to Baylor University in Waco to major in music
history, I was assigned to the studio of Jane Abbott, one of the
best college piano teachers in America. Fortunately, she had the
patience to work with my interest in piano music, which was
immense, rather than being discouraged by my minuscule talent.
</P>
<P>
   But, at 40, I had last taken lessons 13 years earlier from a
fellow graduate student at the University of Iowa. So, for my
renewed practice regime, I picked pieces that were lots easier than
those I used to play. Instead of a Bach fugue, I went for a
two-part Invention by Bach. I added some short, noisy pieces by
Bartok, and a sort-of-hard but not very long Etude of early
20th-century Russian Alexander Scriabin.
</P>
<P>
   I thoroughly enjoyed the first days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Other people at my house, both of whom play the piano, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons were in order, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had hundreds of piano lessons from some of the finest
teachers in America, taught piano myself AND have two degrees in
music,'' I pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   I was outvoted, 2-to-1. So I called Tamas Ungar, head of the
piano department at Texas Christian University and founder and
director of the TCU summer institute _ and therefore the person
whose fault all of this was. He wisely and diplomatically declined
to give me a lesson but referred me to a graduate student, a young
fellow from Siberia named Igor Resnianski.
</P>
<P>
   Igor was about 30, a good decade behind me. Still green to the
ways of America _ his English at the time was charmingly halting _
he was years ahead of me not only musically but in the experience
of growing up. A former member of the Russian army, he had managed
to find a way out of a turbulent situation, making connections and
building friendships at competitions in Russia and China, until he
secured the attention and scholarship money of the TCU piano
department.
</P>
<P>
   I met him on a Sunday afternoon at TCU. He was late, as he would
always be. He had long, floppy pianist hair, smiled more often than
not, and wasn't at all intimidated _ if he even realized _ that I
was the much-feared local music critic.
</P>
<P>
   We found a vacant classroom with a piano. Being a Russian, he
zeroed in on the Scriabin. He showed proper horror at my
fingerings, then proceeded to dissect the piece _ which I had
regarded as mostly pretty romantic frill _ as if it were Bach or
Schoenberg.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he threw in bits of Russian romantic
pictorialism: ``These are church bells,'' he would say, adding life
and meaning to what had previously been a pair of lifeless chords.
Then, with his typical and irrepressible humor, he'd point at a
similar pattern a measure away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church bells in a different part of town,'' he'd say.
</P>
<P>
   He showed me how I had to practice. Not just play through, which
was more fun. I had to do it for Igor until it was as perfect as I
could get it, and it was still not half as good as when he shoved
me off the bench and showed me how it could really be done.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours, I had a headache and was more exhausted than if
I had run a mile.
</P>
<P>
   It's been three years now. I missed a whole year at one point,
then came back for more. Finally, I learned the Bach, dropped the
Bartok, added Mozart and Hindemith _ and, this winter, managed to
get in enough practice that I could come in every other week or so
and show progress.
</P>
<P>
   I'm proud that I taught him to respect Scott Joplin. Igor
sneered when I first brought in the lyrical Heliotrope Bouquet rag
but dived in with the same attention he had paid to Scriabin,
making my brain ache with implications. The second time, he
admitted that it was decent music; the third time, he allowed that
he might get some Joplin rags himself. Last time, he pondered the
possibility of a whole Joplin program.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also proud that I can once again play an entire Bach
Invention from memory (though Jonetta Hinkle and Jane Abbott, after
pulling me through countless sonatas, would be disappointed that
that's all I can do).
</P>
<P>
   But I'm sorry that, now that I'm finally practicing ``and''
learning music, Igor is moving away, lured by the chance to
complete a doctorate. I'll be looking for another teacher: one who
doesn't mind if I miss half a year or so now and then, one who
isn't shocked about how badly the music critic really plays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Igor, good luck and thanks for making me practice
right, for shoving me off the bench and showing me how it's really
done, and for reminding the guy who writes about all the pianists
in the world about how hard it really is to do it right _ and that
writing about piano music is a mere shadow of playing it.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Dr. Dorothy Williams Kingery, owner of the most
famous _ some say infamous _ house in Savannah, walked down her
front steps and past a family of tourists who were clutching
guidebooks and wearing cameras like bandoliers. ``Excuse me,
ma'am,'' the man said, stepping forward and making an almost
imperceptible bow, ``but could we get a tour?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Dr. Kingery replied between clenched teeth. ``This is a
private house.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might disagree. Dr. Kingery, a retired sociology professor,
is well known, at least here, as the sister of Jim Williams, the
antiques dealer who was tried four times in the 1981 shooting death
of 21-year-old Danny Hansford. The killing occurred in the study of
this house and was the focus of the best-selling ``Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   She is about to be even better known.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kingery has put the house, which was given to her by her
mother, on the market for $8.95 million. (In his will, her brother
left her $10, his papers and the rights to ``Psycho Dice,'' a game
he invented.) If it brought anything near that price, the mansion,
known as Mercer House, would be the most expensive residence ever
sold in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate prices have soared in this city of 143,000, but this
week townsfolk are wondering whether $8.95 million for Mercer
House, magnificent though it is, isn't a stretch. Celebrity has
little to do with real estate values, experts say. A house
connected with a killing? That might subtract value. After all, the
new owners of O.J. Simpson's house tore it down _ and it wasn't
even the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert E. Jones, an agent with Cora Bett Thomas Realty, the
local company handling the property with Sotheby's International
Realty, said notoriety had ``very little to do with the price.''
Mercer House is ``a phenomenon,'' he said, but not because of the .
. . er . . . shooting. (``Please don't say `murder,' '' Jones said.
``If you have to mention it, call it a `killing.' '' Although
Williams was twice convicted of murder, both verdicts were
overturned; his third trial ended in a mistrial, and he was
acquitted in the fourth.)
</P>
<P>
   The Italianate mansion, built for a Confederate general _ the
great-grandfather of the songwriter Johnny Mercer _ sits with its
carriage house on an entire block facing one of the city's 22
squares. ``It's the only house left in private hands that fills an
entire trust lot,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The asking price was arrived at in consultation with Dr.
Kingery, Sotheby's and his own company, Jones said, adding that he
expects the sale to bring close to that amount. He warned against
using Mercer House as an example of Savannah's market, thereby
perhaps scaring off potential buyers. In the last year, only 15 or
16 houses have sold for more than $500,000, and only 3 for more
than $1 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a house sells for over a million, 20 people at a
cocktail party want to put their dogs on the market,'' he said.
``They don't understand that Mercer House is unique.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale has not been advertised in the local newspaper, but
some townspeople who know about it are amused at the price. Lee
Adler, who has been honored by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation for his work restoring houses in Savannah, lives next
door, in an equally imposing Italianate house. Adler, peering over
his tortoise-shell half-glasses, called both the house and the
price ``remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't even mind the mobs outside,'' he said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   John Duncan is a retired history professor who operates an
antique book and print shop across Monterey Square. ``From the time
it was built, Mercer House was a trophy house,'' he said. ``It was
one of 10 or 15 in town. It would have been just another trophy
house until Jim Williams shot Danny Hansford and John Berendt wrote
the book. Then it became `the premiere house in Savannah.' Dr.
Kingery should be grateful to John Berendt _ it should be called
the Mercer-Williams-Berendt House.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kingery refers to Berendt's book as ``the book.'' She calls
it inaccurate, saying that her brother died of ``a major
coronary,'' not pneumonia, as Berendt wrote. But Dr. James Metts
Jr., the coroner, said that the cause was pneumonia, complicated by
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kingery also does not approve of artists' and entrepreneurs'
making money by using the image of Mercer House _ at least without
her permission. In 1997, she received a trademark for the facade,
and her lawyer has sent letters to local artists _ including the
Lady Chablis, a transvestite who was featured in the book and was
pictured on a postcard posing in front of Mercer House _ demanding
that they stop or give her 10 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``A home is private property,'' Dr. Kingery said this week.
``When people use it indiscriminately, one questions what rights
one has. I did what I wanted to protect the house. But no, I don't
run out and stop people.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the crowds outside, ``I've adapted well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kingery moved into Mercer House shortly after her brother
died in 1990. That year, she did not give the annual Christmas
party that he had been known for, only a small birthday party for
their mother, Blanche B. Williams, who had been left the house and
almost all of Williams' property. (In his will, Williams stipulated
that Dr. Kingery's two daughters should inherit the bulk of the
property if his mother died before him. Three people familiar with
the family said Williams and his sister did not get along and that
on one occasion he asked her to leave the house.)
</P>
<P>
   Other than saying that the house had been a gift from her mother
and that she was currently its sole owner, Dr. Kingery said that
she did not wish to discuss the will. But she graciously gave a
reporter a tour of her house, from the second-floor dome, with its
spectacular stained glass, all the way down to what she calls ``the
moat,'' a trough running around the basement. Only the three
bedrooms and the study where the shooting took place were off
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everything is original,'' she said, folding a set of
white shutters into their window pockets. ``Look at these arches.
Look at these pocket doors. They still slide as beautifully as when
the house was built.''
</P>
<P>
   The house was designed by John Norris, a New York architect who
came to Savannah to design the U.S. Custom House and stayed long
enough to design many of the town's finest houses. ``He designed
the house in 1859, and construction began in 1860,'' Dr. Kingery
said. ``But as a result of the hostilities, construction ceased, so
it wasn't finished until after the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   The library is still filled with Williams' mementos, a melange
of eccentric, striking objects that he still watches over in a
photograph, hung by his sister, in which he holds his favorite cat,
Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quite a handsome man,'' Dr. Kingery said. ``With his
dark hair and eyes, he looked like our father.'' In the small
library, there are Audubon prints, pre-Columbian pots, a carved
eagle from the first tugboat that plied Savannah's harbor and, in a
frame, a wasps' nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was fascinated by wasps' nests,'' Dr. Kingery said ``He
loved their structure.''

   She apologized for the boxes of scrapbooks in the dining room,
with its chandelier and exquisite blue-and-white Canton china. She
is compiling a book: essays Williams wrote about the houses he
restored. She said she was publishing it herself, ``so I can get it
out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kingery said she had decided to sell the house because
``we've reached a new stage of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jim died nine years ago,'' she said, ``I had one daughter
still in college, and my mother was living in her hometown. Now
perhaps it's time for someone else to enjoy Mercer House.'' She
said she ``probably will stay in town.''

   Later that afternoon, another family of tourists, this one from
Germany, were snapping photographs _ the father against the
backdrop of Mercer House, then the mother and fresh-faced teen-age
daughter. ``Why are we here?'' the father said. ``Is this not the
place in the book?''
</P>
<P>
   He checked his map. They were told the house was for sale for
almost $9 million. ``We have no intention of buying the house,' he
said nervously. ``We took pictures because it is in the book.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The loft, it has been changing.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, when Abstract Expressionists like Barnett
Newman moved into lofts, they wanted their spaces big and empty,
the better to wield the paintbrush to make mammoth art. But by the
1970s, artists were no longer the sole habitants of lofts.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the '70s, loft living was far less transgressive, far less
pioneering,'' said Mayer Rus, the editor of Interior Design
magazine and author of ``Loft'' (Monacelli, 1998). ``It was an
option not just for artists but for families. Family is a major
catalyst for having privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter, then, the box.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades into the loft age, the box, a
floor-to-near-ceiling structure, became an important design element
_ an architectural treasure chest that made loft living open and
airy, yet intimate. Placed in the center of the loft, or
off-center, it can contain closets, drawers and cupboards, or
enclose bedrooms, bathrooms and offices. Doors can slip from hidden
pockets within the box, or discreetly materialize from a recessed
slot nearby, to provide what even the most committed loft dweller
usually requires: a modicum of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The box has played a starring role in three new Manhattan lofts.
David Ling, a Manhattan architect, even tossed the box a curve.
When he was asked to transform two adjacent one-bedroom apartments
in Greenwich Village into a single loft with a home office, he
first drew a box _ the office _ within the rectangular loft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I loosened up,'' Ling said. He designed the office as an
asymmetrically curved cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like curves juxtaposed against the geometry of rectangles,''
he said. ``The outside is smooth and spare; inside, it's intimate
and nurturing.''
</P>
<P>
   For privacy, the architect designed doors that are recessed in
the outer walls at opposite ends of the office but close to create
a guest room. With the doors open, the office is a sculptural
divider between the living-dining area and the bedroom. The curving
wall keeps part of the loft hidden, slightly mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Ling also used architecture as a source of reflected light. In
the office, a soft golden light (from fluorescent bulbs) glows from
beneath the soffits. In the bedroom area, reading lights are
recessed in the cantilevered canopy and are as narrowly focused as
seat lights in airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Ling, who likes minimalist architecture, is not blind to its
defects. ``Pure minimalism is too reductive, too devoid of life,''
he said. ``And you need storage to make minimalism work.'' (To that
end, he lined one wall of the bedroom with floor-to-ceiling
closets.) Call the loft, whose box, including doors and lighting,
cost $3,000, warm minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the office-guest room don't reach the ceiling, and
the couple who own the loft, a banker and an artist, feared that
they would be disturbed by sleep-over guests. But no. ``The street
noise masked the snores,'' the artist said.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew Bernheimer and Jared Della Valle, designers in
Manhattan, met their clients, a married couple who work in finance,
they had just bought a 1,600-square-foot loft in Chelsea. The
clients gave the designers a wish list. ``They wanted a red
bedroom, an open kitchen and maximum storage, openness and views,''
Bernheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a deep-red box of aniline-dyed birch, roughly 14
feet square and 8 feet high. The box has multiple functions. The
two walls facing the kitchen and the living room contain a laundry
closet, a pantry, a storage closet for bulky items like luggage and
skis, and a coat closet. A steel door slides out of the wall facing
the living room and provides privacy for the master bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the box, invisible from the living room, are a bathroom
and a second bedroom. A series of pocket doors, recessed into the
box, divide one room from another, while natural light from windows
facing north and south streams over the box from one end of the
loft to the other.
</P>
<P>
   From the private rooms tucked behind the box, the owners look
north to the Empire State Building and the scalloped crown of the
Chrysler Building. From the wide-open living and dining areas, they
look south as far as the World Trade Center and the World Financial
Center. The cost of the transformation, including construction, new
appliances, new windows, lighting, central air-conditioning and
audio-visual equipment, was $300,000. The box, including shelves
and closet interiors, cost $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the red box, which has a dark solidity about it, the box
that Robert Young, a Manhattan architect, designed for the
Greenwich Village loft of a film producer is subtle, partly
translucent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the contemporary loft feeling, but I didn't want that
overdone industrial look, all gray and metal,'' said the loft
owner, who shares his home with his girlfriend, who works in
advertising, and her white cat. What they needed were a bedroom and
an office.
</P>
<P>
   Young obliged with a spare and serene design and a box that is
so unobtrusive that it seems at first to be an L-shaped wall, set
in the pale rectangle of a loft where only the living room has
windows.
</P>
<P>
   To take advantage of the light, the loft is painted in pale
colors. The ceiling, beams and columns are chalk white, the
perimeter walls are cream, the box is khaki. The woodwork is
equally understated _ all golden-tone woods. Against this neutral
background are occasional bolts of color. Cobalt glass tiles
sparkle on the kitchen back splash; the sofa is tangerine; a chair
is coral.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial look makes brief appearances in the 1910
building, which was once used by marble cutters. The front door is
the original stainless steel, and the window frames were stripped
down to their bare nickel alloy, then sealed with clear lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   But what orders the space is the box, 25{ by 9{ feet, which
hides the bedroom, closet and home office-guest room. Young
inserted elements that perform double duties of a small but useful
nature. Light passes through a fiberglass panel, which supports
bookshelves on the outside and forms the headboard of the bed on
the private side. A closet dividing the two small rooms opens on
both sides: a sleep-over guest can pluck his clothes from the
closet without disturbing anyone asleep in the adjacent room, and
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The loft, which cost $70,000 to build, excluding appliances and
furniture _ the box, including the bookcase, closet and doors, cost
$11,000 _ would be a peaceful oasis if not for the cat. ``She's
nice to my girlfriend, but not to me,'' the owner said. ``She
bites. She scratches.'' He looked at her, sitting docilely on the
coral chair. ``Is there kitty Prozac?'' he asked.

<P>
   In January, Anna Spinello, a clothing designer in Buenos Aires,
set up a Web site to help boost sales of her spring line. By
clicking on a little flag, a viewer can see the site in English,
Spanish or Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering we haven't publicized it, we've had an amazing
response,'' said her son Francesco Spinello, 42, who manages the
small, family-run business (www.annaspinello.com) that sells to
boutiques in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. ``We've made a
lot of contacts that should pay off with the next collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spinellos are part of a wave of Latin Americans who have
recently discovered the Web. Lagging perhaps two years behind the
United States, Japan and Western Europe in its development, the
Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking Internet market is one of the
fastest-growing in the world and has emerged as the latest
battleground for viewers among such Internet titans as America
Online and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year the scales are tipping,'' said Heather
Killen, the vice president of Yahoo International, who oversaw the
start-up of a Spanish version of the Yahoo portal
(espanol.yahoo.com) in June 1998. ``The shape of the Internet is no
longer a comet with the U.S. as the head and this thin trail
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Latin American governments, aware of the need to promote local
Internet access and business so that more precious dollars do not
flow overseas, are also beginning to look at ways to encourage more
people to get on line.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of Argentina and Chile, for example, have
mandated that privately held phone companies charge half price for
local Internet access phone calls. Recent privatization of the
state-run phone company in Brazil, which is the only
Portuguese-speaking country in Latin America, is expected to lead
to reduced phone charges and better infrastructure and service in
that country, the most populous in the region, accounting for
roughly half the Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't allow citizens on line, they realize their
country is going to be at a significant disadvantage in the
future,'' said Annika Alford, chief Latin American Internet analyst
for IDC, a market research company in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Internet's contributions to Latin America will be
allowing the Spinellos and other merchants to expand their reach
across borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is an extraordinary medium to improve
communication and exchange among different cultures and
languages,'' Spinello said. ``In Brazil, for example, we have few
clients now but there is great potential for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies in the United States, faced with slowing
growth at home, are looking for expansion through service in
languages other than English. This year, for the first time, there
will be more people gaining access to the Web from outside the
United States than from within, many of them preferring to do so in
their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-speaking population in the United States also holds
growth potential for Internet companies. Luis Hernandez, 18, a
bilingual senior at Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, uses the
Internet to search for information about his favorite Latin bands
and to chat with childhood friends living in Mexico as well as
other Spanish speakers using one of America Online's Hispanic chat
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish language ``is easier for me to write in _ I'm
faster,'' he said, adding: ``It's our culture. We understand
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As they rush to sign up Spanish-language consumers, Internet
giants in this country face stiff competition from both Latin
American media companies and existing Spanish-language portals _
the industry term for a site that is both a primary destination and
a gateway to the Internet at large _ based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of these portals, Starmedia Network (starmedia.com), which saw
its stock nearly double on the first day of trading in its initial
public offering last week, has grabbed much of the attention for
its Spanish-Portuguese site.
</P>
<P>
   But other ventures are vying for the same users, and the last
few weeks have seen a flurry of announcements of new sites in the
Spanish-language Internet sector. Among the competitors are Que
Pasa (quepasa.com), a Spanish-English site, and Yupi (yupi.com),
which recently acquired Ciudad Futura, a Spanish-language online
entertainment site (www.ciudadfutura.com), and says it is the
front-runner with more than 5.7 million users and 80 million page
views per month from both the Yupi and Ciudad Futura sites.
Starmedia lays claim to 60 million page views per month and 2.4
million users.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg recently announced that it would soon open a bilingual
personal finance site for Hispanics in the United States
(www.negociosbloomberg.com).
</P>
<P>
   Just how many Hispanic Internet users there are is the subject
of some debate. The number of users of the Internet at large _ or
of a specific site _ is hard to measure, in part because of
differences in the methods of measurement in the fast-changing
world of electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   While operators of Web sites typically keep detailed logs of
user traffic, there is no generally accepted industry auditing
process for that data. And outside companies that try to compile
Web usage data, a la television's Nielsen ratings, must extrapolate
from audience samples that are widely thought to undercount
Internet use from work and ignore or undercount Internet use from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Starmedia, lumping together Hispanics in this
country, Portuguese-speaking Brazil, the countries of
Spanish-speaking Latin America, Spain and Portugal, come up with a
figure of about 20 million users worldwide, two-thirds of them in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   IDC, which takes a slightly more conservative approach, based on
its figures showing that there is an installed PC base in Latin
America of nearly 16 million computers and an Internet penetration
rate of 20 percent, estimates that by the end of 1999 there will be
7 million Latin Americans on line. IDC predicts that number will
grow to 19 million on line by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics in the United States are another large and growing
market for Spanish-language sites. Data from Nielsen Net Ratings,
which monitors Web traffic, indicates that about 5 million of the
30 million Hispanics in the United States are on line. A study by
Forrester Research, however, put the figure closer to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   A focus group study by Yahoo indicated that 70 percent of
American Hispanics preferred to get at least some of their content
in Spanish. That would suggest that there might be as many as seven
million Hispanics in this country surfing Spanish-language sites.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yupi, with headquarters in Miami Beach and offices in seven
Latin American countries, estimates that 20 percent of its traffic
comes from American users.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics in this country may be an important sector of
the Spanish-language audience, the big growth in the user base is
expected to come from Latin America, particularly Brazil, with a
population of 160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Rosa, 33, a writer and translator in Rio de Janeiro, said
he downloaded software and regularly communicated via e-mail with
other writers in the United States and elsewhere. He also conducts
much of his research on line, sometimes using the Brazilian search
engine Cade (cade.com.br), sometimes an English or French one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me access to a lot of dictionaries and translating
tools,'' said Rosa, who has also taken screen-writing courses over
the Web through a company called Online Learning, based in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Web is breaking down national barriers. On
Starmedia's bulletin boards and classified pages, for example,
people from many Latin American countries post notices side by side
or banter in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Winning over locals like Rosa may prove a challenge for United
States companies moving into an increasingly crowded market.
Already there are in the neighborhood of 450 Internet service
providers in Brazil, 240 in Mexico and 170 in Argentina, according
to numbers from America Online's Latin American unit, as well as
long-established major destinations, many of them sponsored by
Latin American media giants like TV Globo (globo.com.br) and Grupo
Folha (uol.com.br) in Brazil and Grupo Clarin (clarin.com.ar) in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   A common strategy is to find local partners who can help pave
the way in a market where personal relationships are key to
business success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sit in a city on another continent and say, `Right,
I'm going to launch something in Chile,''' said Phil Ingram,
marketing manager of Orientation.com, which is based in New York
and is creating a network of country portals. ``You have to have
local contacts who can build bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Orientation.com plans to carve a niche for itself by focusing on
some of the smaller, overlooked countries _ Colombia, Costa Rica,
Chile _ with a network appealing to business travelers, offering a
currency converter, weather forecasts and trade show information in
English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has formed a 50-50 partnership with the Cisneros
Group, a major entertainment and telecommunications force in Latin
America that is based in Venezuela. And last month, the two
partners hired Charles Herington as president and chief executive
of AOL Latin America, which will first tackle the Brazilian market
and later Argentina. Herington previously helped Taco Bell and
Pizza Hut spread their franchises in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing Internet services, however, will prove more
complicated than selling fast food. Sites must be locally tailored.
Jack Davies, president of AOL International, promised that
Brazilians will not find themselves force-fed a service planned for
North Americans, but will instead find a product reconceived for
their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very bright, very alive, very colorful, more
so than corresponding AOL.com's because of the festive nature of
Brazil,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Though features like chat, e-mail and up-to-the-second news have
proved enormously popular in Latin America, as they have elsewhere
in the world, electronic commerce, including sales of books, CDs,
computer equipment and clothing, may catch on more slowly because
of cultural and logistical differences.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, for example, does not have the United States' extensive
tradition in mail-order catalog buying on which to build an
electronic commerce market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Brazilians like to see the thing, touch it, like to be sure
we're going to have something,'' said Rosa, who once ordered books
from Amazon.com but had to wait seven weeks for them to arrive and
vows never to buy on line again.
</P>
<P>
   Further slowing the expansion of the Internet user base in Latin
America has been the regional economic crisis. The number of
Internet users in the region more than doubled from 1997 to 1998;
the 1999 growth appears to be only half as fast, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Herington at AOL, among others, said that the Internet itself
might provide the solution by improving communication and
distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the obstacles for Latin American Web surfers are
underdeveloped telephone systems, the relatively high cost of
Internet access and the fact that many phone companies in Latin
America charge by the minute for local calls.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, who estimates he spends an average of 60 hours a month on
line, pays the equivalent of $20 a month to his Internet service
provider for unlimited access, but local toll charges add another
$40 to his monthly phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people can afford this?'' Rosa said of his fellow
Brazilians. ``Most people don't have enough money to afford a
computer. The base isn't going to expand unless we do all sorts of
socioeconomic development.''

MONDAVI AIMS TO RAISE THE IMAGE OF AMERICAN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PEG MELNIK   
 Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ Wine icon Robert Mondavi wants to make the ugly
American a Renaissance man. The groundbreaking of The American
Center for Wine, Food and the Arts has set in motion Mondavi's
goal: to make American civilization more civilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looked upon as being as cultured as other
countries,'' says the 85-year-old Mondavi. ``As I traveled the
world over, I saw that no one else had attempted to put food, wine
and the arts in one location. I knew this would help raise our
image.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, expected to open by fall 2001, will be in the heart
of wine country on a 12-acre spread on riverfront land. The
centerpiece will be an 80,000-square-foot main building housing an
auditorium, a cafe, teaching kitchens and 13,000 square feet of
exhibition space. A 500-seat outdoor amphitheater will be built for
musical and theatrical performances, the focal point of the
center's 3.5 acres of gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking Tuesday began a weeklong celebration, ending
with a free, community picnic on the downtown Napa site Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The $70 million project was initiated with $20 million from
Mondavi. The board is hoping to raise another $10 million for the
building and another $20 million for an endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wine business, I was able to make more money than I
expected to,'' Mondavi says. ``I had the means to take care of my
family and I wanted to give something back to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi says the museum's artifacts will date back to primitive
man, the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans, showing why food,
wine and the arts enhance the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime supporter of food and wine, Mondavi helped create the
American Institute of Wine &AMP; Food nearly 18 years ago. His wife,
Margrit Biever Mondavi, inspired him to make art a part of the trio
after she had coordinated cultural events at the Robert Mondavi
Winery for years.
</P>
<P>
   The founders expect 300,000-plus visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people will see is that it has been the same since the
beginning of civilization, that food, wine and the arts have
enhanced people's lives for 7,000 years,'' Mondavi says. ``People
will no doubt say, `Hey, there's something to this.' ''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. _ Not long after Eliel Saarinen's brand
of kiln-fired, loom-woven, handcrafted modernism was elbowed aside
by the harder-edged International style, development all but
stopped on his architectural masterwork: the ensemble of museums,
schools and design academy now known as the Cranbrook Educational
Community.
</P>
<P>
   But today, a sinuous Y-shaped canopy of copper mesh and
stainless steel rises over a new entrance to the institution's
deeply wooded, 315-acre campus. It stands poised over the roadway
like sheltering wings or an echo of the rolling landscape beyond.
Or _ perfect for a Detroit suburb _ a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the iconology, the message is unmistakable. Cranbrook
is building again, on a campuswide scale, for the first time since
its flowering in the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Cranbrook offers a vibrant reminder that modernism
is not exclusively the realm of sharp right angles and cold, flat
surfaces, of glass and steel. In other words, that there is a place
for the tactile, the colorful and the irregular, for the handiwork
and sensuousness of rough masonry and glazed tile, even _ dare one
say it? _ for the picturesque.
</P>
<P>
   More than $100 million worth of construction and renovation has
been completed or is now contemplated at Cranbrook. This time,
there is no single designer. Instead, Steven Holl of New York, Jose
Rafael Moneo of Madrid, Peter Rose of Montreal, and Tod Williams
(Cranbrook '61) and Billie Tsien of New York are working almost
simultaneously on campus, exploring connections to the past while
forging Cranbrook's new architectural identity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dan Hoffman, the campus architect and a
professor at the University of Michigan, has broadened Cranbrook's
artisanal tradition to include skilled machinists at factories
around the Great Lakes, whose work he has incorporated in
small-scale projects like the entrance canopy.
</P>
<P>
   All of the designers are interested, as Saarinen was, in
architectural context, in the details of the building process and
in the relationship between structures and the natural environment.
They speak of weaving _ weaving rich materials into their
structures, and then weaving their structures into the landscape of
towering conifers and the legacy of Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   For in the end, the most important architect in the
revitalization of Cranbrook is Saarinen himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planning ideas, the buildings that make space, the
condition of perspective and termination and the secret axes
through the landscape are something very special and important,''
said Holl, who has designed an expansion and renovation of
Saarinen's Institute of Science. ``To be able to put a building
there as part of that network is an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Holl said one of his goals in architecture is to ``bring essence
back into experience'' _ smell, sound and touch _ and to give ``a
tactile and material dimension to everyday existence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a connection to Saarinen,'' Holl said. ``He believed
in the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Saarinen's own work is being restored to luminous life following
decades of heavy use and inadequate care. He is emerging from the
shadow cast first by the Bauhaus and then by his own son, Eero, who
worked on Cranbrook as a young man but later soared to worldwide
renown for swooping abstract monuments like the TWA Flight Center
at Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Eliel Saarinen, whose roots were in the Romantic nationalistic
styles of his native Finland, came to America in 1923 at age 50,
using the second-place prize money he had won in the competition to
design the Tribune Tower in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   His losing entry, one of the more influential unbuilt buildings
of the 20th century, eliminated cornices and employed setbacks to
create an exceptionally vertical composition. But this was no
stripped-down building; Saarinen planned Romanesque arches at the
base, foreshadowing his work at Cranbrook.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, he was invited by George Gough Booth, who published The
Detroit Evening News and had helped found the Detroit Society of
Arts and Crafts, to work on the design of a new kind of
educational, cultural and spiritual community that Booth and his
wife, Ellen, were planning at Cranbrook, their estate about 25
miles northwest of downtown Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the complex would include a graduate art academy and
art museum, a science museum, elementary and secondary schools and
a church, which was later separated from the group. Today, there
are 1,550 students from prekindergarten to the 12th grade and 150
graduate students in the Cranbrook Academy of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Saarinen was the resident architect for the campus from 1925 to
1950 and the president of the Academy of Art from 1932 to 1946,
during which time he attracted students and teachers like Harry
Bertoia, Charles and Ray Eames (who met and married there),
Florence Knoll, Jack Lenor Larsen and Harry Weese.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were few places in the world _ the vastly more
significant Bauhaus, of course, was one _ where every field of
design, from textiles and metalwork to architecture and city
planning, was encompassed in so comprehensive a curriculum,'' Allan
Temko wrote about Cranbrook in ``Eero Saarinen'' (George Braziller,
1962).
</P>
<P>
   Even though he did not attend the academy, Williams, who now
practices architecture in New York with Ms. Tsien, was exposed to
the academy's influence as a youngster in the boys' school. ``By
the age of 12, I was welding chairs,'' Williams recalled. ``You
don't get to do that in many high schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliel Saarinen's approach to architecture was as wide-ranging as
the academy's curriculum. The boys' school, called Cranbrook
(completed in 1929), feels like a Romanesque cloister. The girls'
school, Kingswood (1931), glides along the horizon, Prairie-style.
The Cranbrook Institute of Science (1938) stands as foursquare as a
1920s German factory by the likes of Peter Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   Saarinen's own house, which was completed in 1930 and lustrously
restored in 1994, is a cross between Finnish serenity and Art Deco
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No architect, God forbid, who considered himself a modernist
would have used velvet portieres,'' said Gregory Wittkopp, the
director of the Cranbrook Art Museum, before drawing aside these
plush curtains to reveal Saarinen's jewel box of a dining room,
with its gold-leafed dome, hemispherical brass chandelier and
flute-backed side chairs of fir and maple.
</P>
<P>
   The new architects are neither replicating nor repudiating
Saarinen. ``They want to do something that reflects and enhances
what came before, rather than compete with it,'' said Dr. Robert
Gavin, the president of the Cranbrook Educational Community, as the
ensemble of institutions is now known. ``There's a strong feeling
about compatibility and integration, but not mimickry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavin inherited many of the projects from his predecessor,
Lillian Bauder, who in the mid-1980s began the much-needed process
of updating and expanding the campus.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first significant new building to be completed, in 1996, was
a $9.5 million addition to and renovation of Brookside, the lower
school. Cranbrook chose Rose, the Montreal architect, for the job
in part because of his work within other historic contexts. One of
his best-known designs, in Montreal, involved a new building for
Phyllis Lambert's Canadian Centre for Architecture, which had to be
integrated with the historic Shaughnessy House of 1874.
</P>
<P>
   To Brookside's delightful 1929 jumble of storybook cottages,
Rose cobbled a two-story addition with its own lively tiled
roofscape and a facade of deliberately mottled concrete blocks in
varying hues and intensities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the block factory,'' Rose said. ``We did what
Saarinen did, which was we got involved in the construction
process. So what you get from this very base, ordinary, inexpensive
material is a richness of texture and color.''
</P>
<P>
   Holl, who has reversed the Saarinens' Finnish-and-American
cross-fertilization as the architect of the new Museum of
Contemporary Art in Helsinki, was chosen for the next significant
commission: a $29 million expansion and renovation of the Institute
of Science. He was picked, Cranbrook said in a statement, because
he ``shares Saarinen's interest in the theoretical issues of
science, the use of craft, and an interest in the integration of
art, architecture and nature.''
</P>
<P>
   As a museum of natural history and science that draws 250,000
visitors a year, the institute is by far the most public of
Cranbrook's buildings. And Holl's addition, clad in bright,
sand-colored Kasota stone and concrete block, loses no time in
performing its educational mission.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-foot-high entrance hall doubles as what Holl calls a
``light laboratory,'' where various characteristics of light are
demonstrated by a curtain-wall patchwork of seven different types
of glass, each of which transmits or diffuses or refracts daylight
in different ways. A thick speckled rainbow greeted museumgoers on
a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Within, the plan is exceptionally open and draws visitors along
sloping pathways bathed in natural light, past bursts of
contrasting colors and playful displays. By attaching a new
structure to bridge Saarinen's U-shaped plan, Holl created a
courtyard and brought a sense of motion and circulation to a layout
that had previously ended in cul-de-sacs.
</P>
<P>
   Water in all of its forms _ liquid, vapor and solid _ is the
theme of the terraced outdoor courtyard that Holl created. The
centerpiece is a bulbous 15-foot ``ice house'': in warmer months it
looks like a giant steel woven basket, but come winter, sprayed
mist turns the frame into thick walls of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Water in another form _ an eight-lane, 25-yard swimming pool _
will be at the heart of the $10 million natatorium now under
construction, to designs by Williams and Ms. Tsien.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the Cranbrook spirit, Williams said, there will
be ``an inextricable relationship between inside and outside.''
Weather permitting, the pool can be opened to the sky through two
enormous oculi that have retractable roofs. And at all seasons, a
length of windows along one wall will allow swimmers to see trees
pass by.
</P>
<P>
   Because brick appears almost everywhere on campus, its use was a
``foregone conclusion'' for the natatorium, said Martin Finio, the
project architect at the Williams and Tsien firm.
</P>
<P>
   But at Cranbrook, brick is no simple matter. To help the
building recede into the landscape, Williams and Ms. Tsien chose an
extra-long, dark, plum-colored brick with iridescent spotting,
accented by panels of blue and green bricks that are meant to
recall sky, trees and Cranbrook's copper roofs. Getting just the
right translucent wash in those glazes involved much trial and
error for the brick makers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Williams said, ``I intend for the trees to come
back and screen it so that it becomes more a part of the landscape
than an object.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy's new student art studios, workshops and gallery are
now being designed by Moneo, the recipient of the 1996 Pritzker
Architecture Prize. They will be joined to the building complex
that includes Cranbrook's signature structure, the Peristyle
(1942), an open-air columned pavilion that intersects a grand
north-south vista, framed by a fountain, pools and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The need for new work space is acute. It is not simply that the
existing studios are antiquated, but their small size inhibits the
production of large-scale contemporary art. ``If you have a library
with six-inch shelves,'' said Gary Griffin, the metal smith in
residence, ``you're probably going to have six-inch books.''
</P>
<P>
   On the facades facing the grounds, Moneo plans to follow the
early Cranbrook model of a strongly horizontal building of
interlocking masses, covered in dark brick and roofed in copper. On
the courtyard facades, he is proposing a more industrial look, with
a chorus of chimneys counterbalanced by the grid of a glass curtain
wall.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a struggle to keep the studio project within its
allotted budget. But financial squeezing is not a new exercise at
Cranbrook, which took almost 40 years to recover from the deaths,
one after the other, of Cranbrook's founders, Ellen Booth in 1948
and George Booth in 1949, and of Eliel Saarinen in 1950. To meet
expenses in the 1970's, Cranbrook sold off 60 percent of the
artwork from its Academy of Art collection.
</P>
<P>
   The physical plant was suffering, too. ``The dorms were
originally furnished in Stickley furniture,'' said Mark Coir, the
director of the Cranbrook archives. ``That wore out. Then it was
Aalto furniture. That wore out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he joked, ``it's Sears Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1985 with a $38.5 million windfall from the sale to
the Gannett Company of the Evening News Association, in which
Cranbrook was the largest stockholder, the institution recovered
its financial footing and began piecing its aging campus back
together.
</P>
<P>
   There was much to repair. For example, the cantilevered eaves of
the copper roofs of Saarinen's Kingswood buildings had been
extensively damaged because the gutters had deteriorated. And the
surface of the floor tiles had worn away.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration has now begun at Kingswood. The other day, when a
tile worker saw a visitor taking a photograph of the custom-made
floor tiles, in more than a dozen shades of green, he suggested a
better angle _ one that would show how exactingly he had laid the
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again at Cranbrook, the craft tradition reasserts
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Trellis Bridge (1994), a 58-foot-long pedestrian crossing
over a branch of the River Rouge, was largely built by students in
the studio. The project architect, Ted Galante, was a student at
the time. (Hoffman, now the campus architect, was the designer.) It
is covered by an interlaced network of crisscrossed pine struts,
gently bowed into a wishbone shape, creating a dappled and
ever-changing profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ur-craft is weaving,'' Hoffman said, ``and weaving and
repetition produced all these wonderful qualities. And it was woven
into the education.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has tried another kind of weaving, as well _ weaving the
work of skilled machinists into Cranbrook's architectural
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The mesh in the entry canopy was made by Phoenix Wire Cloth of
Detroit, whose products are ordinarily used for hydraulic
filtration or industrial waste treatment. The columns were made by
a Wisconsin company that supplies piping to nuclear power plants.
And a curving steel retaining wall along the roadway was made by a
shipbuilding yard on Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the thread between building construction and
high-quality fabrication practices has been lost in this country,''
Hoffman said. ``We have attempted to re-establish this
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Saarinen himself wrestled with the question of how the machine
would affect art and architecture. In ``Search for Form''
(Reinhold, 1948), he seemed to anticipate Hoffman's harnessing of
the craft potential in industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should it happen that the new disposition of mind may be
mechanized,'' Saarinen wrote, ``this will not be a lasting state of
things; for undoubtedly, mechanization of mind will turn _ when the
time is ripe _ into humanization of the mechanized mind. Form is
bound to follow the same metamorphosis.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After his first grueling day as a software tester, Matthew Moore
went home, had a snack and an early bath, and was asleep by 7:30,
snuggled under his little quilted green blanket. At the time,
Matthew was 1 year old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the software company called and said they had a program
for him, I said: `You must be mistaken _ you must want one of my
older children,''' recalled Matthew's mother, Megan Moore, a nurse
who lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the software evaluators at Knowledge Adventure assured her
that it was Matthew and not one of his three older siblings _ all
experienced testers _ they were after. So a few days later, the
little boy sat on his mother's lap in the company's testing
laboratory in nearby Torrance, a comfortable carpeted room equipped
with a computer, a hidden camera and a big mirror covering one
wall. The evaluation team on the other side of the mirror could see
through a one-way window, observing as Matthew jabbered in
excitement when an animated teddy bear appeared on screen. Matthew
pounded on the keyboard. His mother moved it away. Matthew reached
for the mouse, then pounded it with a little fist. Repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Matthew became a computer user, Knowledge Adventure
introduced the teddy bear to the marketplace on a CD-ROM called
Jumpstart Baby, and Matthew, enamored of the program, begged
incessantly at home to play what he calls ``Star Baby.'' The title
became an immediate hit, climbing to No. 13 on a 1998 list of the
best-selling software for preschoolers compiled by PC Data of
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jumpstart Baby and Matthew Moore are at the vanguard of a
trend in introducing younger and younger children to computers.
``We call it baby programming,'' said Idit Harel, the founder and
chief executive of Mamamedia, which operates a Web site
(www.mamamedia.com) where a baby can create an animated story by
clicking on icons. ``You take a character and attach it to a
behavior, and that is programming. You take the same creative tools
designed for older children, and often even a baby can learn from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, that same motto _ even a baby can learn _
encouraged well-meaning parents to hang black-and-white mobiles
above cribs to stimulate newborns and to press headphones to their
pregnant bellies to expose the unborn to Mozart. These days, many
parents view the computer as a symbol of a technology-laden
tomorrow and want even the tiniest citizens of the future to be
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by eager parents who want to give their children a
head start, a growing number of companies have begun to develop and
release an avalanche of products aimed squarely at techno-toddlers.
America Online is developing a new content area to serve children
ages 2 to 5, encouraged by an online poll earlier this year of
10,000 parents; 25 percent said their children had begun using a
computer by age 2.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, diaper-dragging lap-sitters can choose from an array
of products, from software programs like Babywow! (published by
Bowwow House) to video console games like Elmo's Number Journey (by
Newkidco, for Sony Playstation) to Internet sites intended to lure
infants on line. The Children's Television Workshop is about to
release Baby and Me, the company's first software program for the
growing market of 1- to 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   But even as sales of the top 20 software titles for children 4
and younger increased 25.5 percent last year, to $45.8 million from
$36.5 million in 1997, skeptics raise a basic question: What can a
baby possibly get from a computer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine this: software for babies?'' said Ann
Stephens, president of PC Data. ``This category didn't even exist
five years ago. It's absurd. What next, womb ware?''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Armour Polly, author of ``The Internet Kids and Family
Yellow Pages'' (Osborne-McGraw-Hill, 1999), said: ``Little kids
should be down on the floor banging on pots and spoons, not banging
on the keyboard. I saw a Web site where you can drag a pine cone
over to a sink to see if it floats. Why not just turn off the
computer, go outside and pick up a pine cone so the toddler can
learn what a pine cone is?''
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of early introduction to computers say it will
make it easier for children to use the computers they will almost
assuredly confront as soon as they get to school. In addition, they
say, computer time creates one more activity that parents and
children can share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to help children learn in one way other
than the traditional ways of books and explanatory toys,'' said
Peter Doctorow, president of Knowledge Adventure, which this year
is greatly expanding its line of software for preschoolers. ``It's
wonderful when little kids become comfortable and excited about
what they can do with computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of the programs don't require much from the children
_ a good thing, given that many of them would be just as happy
pouring a cup of orange juice into the keyboard as manipulating
objects on the screen. Some programs don't even make use of a
mouse; any key a baby bangs will prompt a response.

 UNDATED: a response.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As rudimentary as some of these programs are, some parents swear
by them. Peter Borish, a futures-fund manager who lives in
Manhattan, has three children, ages 8, 6 and 4. He said his
youngest child was introduced to computers earlier than the others,
sitting on his lap while he surfed with the older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given a choice of using the computer or watching TV, my
oldest, a second grader, will want to sit down and watch an hour of
TV,'' he said. ``But my 4-year-old will always choose the computer,
and I think it's because it's been more a part of her life, from an
earlier age. Is it critical that at age 4 she's computer literate?
No, but I like the fact that she's doing something that's more
engaging and more intellectually stimulating than watching
television.''
</P>
<P>
   The Borishes' experience is typical of how computers insinuate
themselves into family life. There is a trickle-down effect. First,
parents buy a computer so their older children can use it for
educational purposes, like research and homework help. Inevitably,
younger siblings clamor for equal time at the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it becomes a shared experience with parents because you
just don't see many 2-year-olds sitting at the keyboard alone,
tapping away,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this generation will become when they get older is
something we're thinking of as post-modern kids, who will be more
prone to split their attention, to watch TV while they're on the
Internet and talking on the phone, all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun maybe, but there is no evidence to suggest either a benefit
or drawback to introducing very young children to computers. ``With
older children, there's plenty of research that shows that good
software benefits them. But that's all research done in social
settings, such as schools, and with kids who are 3 and up,'' said
Daniel D. Shade, a professor of child development and early
childhood education at the University of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   According to guidelines set by the International Society for
Technology in Education, a teachers' group in Eugene, Ore.,
children as young as 4 should learn to use a mouse and keyboard.
But since there's no evidence that it will speed a younger child's
physical development, ``I doubt seriously that a child who starts
at a young age of 2 or so will have an advantage,'' said Anita
Best, editor of Learning and Leading With Technology, the society's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some toddlers just are not interested in computers.
Louisa Campbell, a writer and mother of two who lives in Brooklyn,
says her 5-year-old son likes the computer. But her 2{-year-old
daughter does not. ``My son, who is sort of technically oriented,
has been using CD-ROM's since he was 2,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``But
my daughter is much more physical and likes to run around a lot.
She doesn't like to sit at the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers and manufacturers predict a steady increase
in products aimed at younger and younger children. ``We know there
are four million kids born in this country every year, and all of
them will need to know how to read and do math,'' said Jonathan
Harber, chairman of Newkidco, which this year released two
educational video console game titles for 2-year-olds. ``So what is
the right age to start a child on a computer? I'm not so sure there
might not be a place for a computerized rattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Moore is now well past the computerized rattle stage.
Now 2{, he has graduated to more sophisticated programs like ``The
Cat in the Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives him a great sense of accomplishment to be able to do
something that his older sisters and brother do,'' Ms. Moore said.
But he still hasn't learned to use the mouse.

GEORGE WASHINGTON GARDENED HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   Mac Griswold is the author of ``Washington's Gardens at Mount
Vernon: Landscape of the Inner Man,'' which was just published by
Houghton Mifflin.  
 (bl)  
 By MAC GRISWOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this late date, the 200th anniversary of his death, you might
think that anything and everything about George Washington had long
been chewed over. But wait: what was the connection between the
beautiful, whoppingly productive gardens of Mount Vernon and those
famous false teeth? And by the way, what could our first president
 &UR; eat &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much!'' said Dr. John Hyson, director of curatorial
affairs at the Dr. Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry in
Baltimore. ``I'm sure he chewed with great difficulty, and since he
was a proud man, he must have felt great embarrassment about eating
in front of an audience. It was awkward to manipulate those things
the way the springs bounced around.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when Washington sat down to dinner at 3 in the afternoon
after his daily ride (about five hours) overseeing Mount Vernon's
7,600-plus acres, he must have eyed the table warily to see what a
man with very few teeth could gracefully manage. (He lost his first
tooth at 22, and when he became president, at 57, he had only one
natural tooth left.)
</P>
<P>
   What grew in the garden would have been his first choice, said
Hyson, who noted that the great man especially liked fruit _
berries and baked apples.
</P>
<P>
   Peas and artichokes were also favorites, according to
Washington's own letters and diaries. When George and Martha headed
home after one of their many absences, Martha wrote ahead to say
she hoped the gardener would have ``every thing in his garden that
will be nessary in the House keeping way as vegetable is the best
part of our living in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1797, one Amariah Frost visited Mount Vernon. ``The dinner
was very good,'' he wrote, ``a small roasted pigg, boiled leg of
lamb, roasted fowls, beef, peas, lettuce, cucumbers, artichokes,
etc., pudding, tarts, etc. etc.'' Except for a few exotics like
ginger or tea, it was all homegrown.
</P>
<P>
   Before dinner, Frost had toured the two shield-shaped,
brick-walled gardens, the upper and the lower, each about an acre,
which he found ``very elegant, abounding with many curiosities, Fig
trees, raisins'' _ meaning table grapes _ ``limes, oranges, etc.,
large English mulberries, artichokes, etc.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, both gardens are again chockablock with rows of
vegetables, clumps of flowering herbs, and fruit trees, which stand
in beds or are espaliered to the brick walls. Some are dwarfed into
space-saving cordons around the edges of the beds. In the upper
garden is the conservatory, where the limes and oranges that Frost
saw were wintered over, as their descendants are today.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Mount Vernon's four-acre fruit garden was laid out
with berry patches and 25 varieties of apple, plum, peach, pear and
cherry. In the fall, field orchards produced as much as 120 gallons
of hard and sweet cider and homemade brandy a day. And besides the
gardens and orchards that fed Washington's family and guests, 316
slaves grew ``garden truck'' to supplement their daily ration of a
quart of cornmeal and 5 ounces of salt herring.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Head gardeners were often indentured. There was a lot of
turnover (10 between 1762 and 1797), and Washington had a hard time
finding good staff.
</P>
<P>
   In 1771, he wrote a grumpy letter to his English agent: ``I do
not desire any of your fine fellows who will content themselves
with Planning of Work, I want a Man that will labour hard, knowing
at the same time how to keep a Garden in good Order and Sow Seed in
their proper seasons in ground that he has prepard well for the
reception of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dean Norton, Mount Vernon's 34th head gardener, scours
the globe for the heirloom fruits and vegetables that are now part
of the process of historic preservation. His job is easier than it
was when he started 22 years ago, thanks to the explosive interest
in old varieties among home gardeners. He prizes his collection of
beans, as decorative as they are edible, and the trimly espaliered
cherries _ May Duke, Morello and Montmorency.
</P>
<P>
   Washington would not be surprised at what Norton is putting in
at the beginning of June. He is still planting some of the same old
beans, like the bush bean Black Valentine, the lima bean called
Worcester Indian Red, and Blue Coco, an 18th-century pole bean.
Yellow crookneck squash and other squashes will thrive if planted
now, and so will sweet corn.
</P>
<P>
   Norton is most excited about 11 kinds of antique fruit trees due
to arrive in the fall, the gift of the Worshipful Company of
Fruiterers, in London, founded in the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken many hands to get these old bloodlines back to
Mount Vernon _ gardening is still a hands-on business, just as it
was when Washington was grafting cherry scions given to him by a
friend. (Another myth dispelled: Instead of cutting down cherry
trees, Washington grafted hundreds himself.)
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Sam Benowitz of Braintree Nurseries in Morton,
Wash., the London fruiterers tracked down scions (small cut
branches) at Nick Botner's farm in Yoncalla, Ore. Botner has three
refrigerators full of plastic bags containing thousands of scions
of different varieties that he cut when the trees were dormant, and
he makes grafting a scion on a fruit tree you already own sound
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Grafting was the bio-engineering of centuries past: scions will
produce their own kind of fruit while deriving strength from the
host.
</P>
<P>
   So if you have a Bing cherry tree and you want May Duke cherries
like Washington's, you graft on a scion, and if it takes, you'll
soon have two kinds of cherries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some grafts will make fruit the following year,'' Botner said,
``because if you are grafting on an existing tree, you already have
established vigor.'' Plant a May Duke cherry tree from scratch, and
you'll wait several years for the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Like his Virginia planter contemporaries _ and like a lot of
gardeners today _ Washington enjoyed the status that comes with
growing produce no one else can grow. Those cherries and squashes
also embodied security; he knew where his next meal was coming
from.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal order in a chaotic world _ a balance of use and beauty
_ was part of Washington's vision, as it is for today's gardeners.
He hoped that the orderly agriculture and horticulture of his
plantation would be a model for the new nation.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the simple pleasures of observation and
anticipation, pleasures that frequently burst through our
gardener-President's usually measured demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherries, Plumbs, Pears and Apples bloomed forth,'' he wrote
happily in his diary almost every spring over his 45 years of
vegetable and fruit gardening at Mount Vernon. By June, those
cherries would be in fruit and the fruit on the table _ stewed,
perhaps, for easy eating.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago on a visit to Disney World, Neal Stephenson saw
something that struck him as unusual even by the standards of the
Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through Disney's faux-middle-America Main Street in the
midst of a large crowd, he found himself behind a man who was
taking in the scene by watching it through the color flat-panel
screen on his camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than go see a real small town for free, he had paid
money to see a pretend one, and rather than see it with the naked
eye, he was watching it on television,'' Stephenson writes in a
37,000-word manifesto denouncing America's growing obsession with
graphical user interfaces, the point-and-click control panels that
have become the standard way to control personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, who is known for his best-selling science fiction
novels ``Snow Crash'' and ``The Diamond Age,'' has a new novel,
``Cryptonomicon,'' that has reached No. 15 on the New York Times
best-seller list despite being 918 pages long and having
cryptography as its central subject.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be surprising that a writer willing to take on that
kind of writing challenge has issued another challenge, to an
icon-obsessed culture that increasingly is interposing a graphical
computer interface between people and the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   He is disturbed by a society that has come to depend on the
metaphor of the graphical user interface, or GUI, to get access to
and control every electronic device. A passionate defense of the
point of view that not everything in the world can be reduced to an
icon or a check box, Stephenson's essay, ``In the Beginning Was the
Command Line,'' can be found on the Web site of ``Cryptonomicon,''
which was published last month by Avon Books
(www.cryptonomicon.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that are simply not reducible to a
point-and-click interface,'' he said recently in a telephone
interview. ``There are some kinds of textual communication that can
convey things that can't be conveyed visually.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a view that echoes the alarms of George Orwell, who in his
novel ``1984'' envisioned the idea of Newspeak, a totalitarian
language that narrowed the range of thought so that an individual
could not even think critical or subversive thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the radical social philosopher Herbert Marcuse
proposed the idea of ``one-dimensional thought'' to explain the
language of the 1950s and 1960s, which introduced phrases like
``clean bomb'' and ``harmless fallout.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Stephenson is warning that the rise of a computerized visual
interface culture may have the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lonesome view in a computer world in which mice and
other pointing devices have become the ubiquitous controls for GUIs
that mediate between people, computers and ultimately the rest of
the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to shield computer users from complexity, the GUI
first emerged in the early 1970s from a small research laboratory
at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center that was developing a computer
environment known as Smalltalk.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the late 1970s, on a visit to the center, Steven P.
Jobs, a founder of Apple Computer, saw it and chose to enshrine it
as virtual religion in his Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the first Macintosh had such a fanatical commitment to
the mouse that it did away with cursor keys on the keyboard.
Microsoft followed suit with Windows and brought mice and icons to
the rest of the computing world.
</P>
<P>
   Now that evolution is about to jump beyond the desktop computer.
In the emerging post-PC world, technologies like Sun's Jini,
Microsoft's Ultimate Plug and Play, Sony's Home Audiovisual
Interface and Nokia's Wide Area Protocol are competing to extend a
computer metaphor outward toward controlling all of the appliances
that surround us with the same desktop PC metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Such an ``interface culture,'' Stephenson argues, is the next
step toward a global monoculture that was first created by the rise
of television. ``To traditional cultures, especially word-based
ones such as Islam, this is infinitely more threatening than the
B-52s ever were,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   If Stephenson has become a GUI heretic, he is far from a
Luddite. A skilled programmer who once considered producing his
novel ``Snow Crash'' as a CD-ROM multimedia game before concluding
that computers didn't have enough horsepower, he now writes with
fountain pens on a thin masonite ``laptop'' board that he travels
with. He has taken to traveling without a portable computer, saying
that he decided to give up ``on the hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   However, once he has written a first draft on paper, he sits
down in front of his computer at his Seattle home and rewrites and
edits the text before sending it to the publisher.
``Cryptonomicon'' took him two years to write by hand and another
year to rewrite on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   His computer runs the free Linux operating system and he
rewrites his fiction with the Emacs text editor, favored by the
world's most skilled programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a professional writer _ i.e., if someone else is
getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and
printed _ Emacs outshines all other editing software in
approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars,''
he writes. ``It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes
everything else vanish.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a believer in Emacs because of the remarkable control it
gives writers over their words compared with other text editors or
word processors.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson's essay is written in the form of a long
autobiography of a computer user, stretching from his first
acoustic-coupler connected terminal to a recent infatuation with
the Be operating system. It is not entirely a love affair.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fervent Macintosh user until sometime in 1995, when,
while he was on a trip in San Francisco, the version of Microsoft
Word running on his Powerbook crashed in such a catastrophic
fashion that neither of two disk repair utilities could find any
trace of the long document he had been writing.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that when he returned home he was able to
salvage an earlier version from a backup disk. But the event was
clearly traumatizing and it undermined his trust in the Macintosh
operating system forever.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving the Macintosh world, Stephenson went back to what he
calls ``the oral tradition'' of the Unix-Linux operating world.
</P>
<P>
   Linux may one day rival Windows and the Mac for ease of use, but
that is not an era he would look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   Today Linux is a computer hacker's paradise that exposes all of
the innards of a computer to the user to be tweaked and customized.
Indeed, the Unix tradition is the exact opposite of Apple-Macintosh
operating systems, which try to protect the user from the
complexities of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson acknowledges that even though Linux is relatively
``bomb proof,'' free and powerful, it may not be for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   He draws an analogy by comparing computer operating systems to
auto dealerships, all operating at an intersection along a highway.
In this world the Mac OS becomes an attractive Euro-style sedan
whose innards are hermetically sealed from the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows becomes a colossal station wagon with all
the esthetic appeal of a Soviet worker housing block (``It leaked
oil and blew gaskets, and it was an enormous success''). By the
same token Windows NT is an off-road vehicle and the Be OS is a
Batmobile.
</P>
<P>
   And Linux? Linux is not even a car dealership, but rather a
bunch of people who live in yurts, tepees and geodesic domes in a
field, building super tanks and giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   He portrays an imaginary conversation between a Linux hacker and
a potential station wagon buyer:
</P>
<P>
   Hacker: ``But if you accept one of our free tanks, we will send
volunteers to your house to fix it for free while you sleep!''
</P>
<P>
   Buyer: ``Stay away from my house, you freak!''
</P>
<P>
   Hacker: ``But ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Buyer: ``Can't you see that everyone is buying station wagons?''

TURN UP THE VOLUME FOR E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo.)   (af)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing about e-mail: it's not a phone call. No jarring
rings jolting you out of a nap, no on-the-spot replies required,
and if you're not interested, the Delete button is just a few
inches away.
</P>
<P>
   But like it or not, the communications industry keeps trying to
find ways to merge the Internet with the telephone. A recent effort
is the introduction of Beep, which lets you send voice messages via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Offered by Vstream, a company specializing in Internet-based
teleconferencing, Beep works like this: you log onto the Vstream
Web site (vsnetcall.vstream.com/beep) and enter your e-mail address
along with the e-mail address of the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   You are then given a six-digit identification number and
instructed to call either a toll or toll-free phone number
(depending on what part of the country they live in). When a
Vstream recording answers the call, you enter your ID number on the
phone keypad and leave a message up to two minutes long, which is
recorded and converted using streaming technology.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a message saying ``You've been beeped!''
lands in the recipient's e-mail In box, and the person is given a
link to a Vstream site to retrieve the message. Streaming enables
users to start receiving the contents of the audio file before it
has been completely transmitted, resulting in almost immediate
playback of the message.
</P>
<P>
   As with a lot of novelty items on the Web (think electronic
greeting cards), getting the final product can be a bit dicey.
Listening to the Beep message requires the receiver to have either
Windows Media Player or Real Networks' Real Player (for Macintosh
users), software that allows your computer to play the message.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 includes Media Player; for users of other operating
systems who must first download a player, the entire
message-retrieval process can take several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   David Latham, a rankled test recipient of Beep, said he spent
too much time trying to download the Windows Media Player without
success. ``A pox on your beep,'' he fired back to the sender.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Berberian, co-founder and chief executive of Vstream, which
is based in Boulder, Colo., said the company introduced Beep in May
to give ``recognition to the convergence of multiple
technologies.'' In April, Vstream introduced Netcall, its core
product.
</P>
<P>
   Netcall is a fee-based Internet software utility that lets you
send business presentations and other graphic information via
e-mail to a Vstream server. Vstream converts the content, again
using streaming technology, and makes the presentation available
for viewing by up to 1,200 people at a time.
</P>
<P>
   As for Beep, Berberian said it would remain a free service (with
the exception of the toll call required in some areas), and added
that the company was in discussions with electronic greeting card
companies, electronic photography companies and portal sites about
adding a voice layer to their products. Can telephone soliciting
over the Internet be far behind?

MY CONVERSATION WITH LIDDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, June 3)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID GRIMES Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I read where Elizabeth Dole, winner of the Ladies' Home Journal
``One Smart Lady'' award and also a candidate for some sort of
political office, has taken to making surprise 5-minute phone calls
to random journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when you'll be sitting at your desk and get a
call from Elizabeth Dole,'' said spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Richard Berke of The New York Times is one of several
journalists who has been caught off guard by a Dole phone call.
Berke said he had no questions prepared, since he wasn't expecting
the call, and that it was so brief as to be of little use.
</P>
<P>
   I do not intend to let that happen to me. When Elizabeth Dole
calls - and I feel certain that she will - I will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to hem and haw when your wife calls you at work
to inquire about the $200 Visa bill you rang up at the Cheetah
Lounge and quite another thing when a candidate for president of
the United States calls to chat about the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Some cynics say that Dole is randomly phoning journalists to
dispel her image of being overly scripted. Last March, The New York
Times reported that Dole ``prepares so thoroughly for appearances
that she even requires aides to count the steps she must take to
the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why Dole requires aides to count the number of
steps she must take to the podium _ perhaps her eyesight is bad and
she's afraid of walking too far and toppling off the stage and into
the audience _ but it's certainly something I'd like to discuss
with her when she rings me up &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for purposes of research, I have taken to
counting my steps to certain selected destinations to determine if
that is one of the secrets of Powerful People. For example, I now
know that it is 20 steps to the coffeemaker, 27 steps to the
bathroom and 107 paces to the front door and freedom. Perhaps it is
this attention to detail that allows people like Elizabeth Dole to
be named one of the Ten Most Fascinating People by Barbara Walters.
When she calls, I will ask.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole is, of course, married to Bob Dole who ran for
some sort of political office a few years back and now spends his
time doing Viagra commercials. It would be interesting to know what
Mrs. Dole's thoughts are on this matter, and whether she's worried
that a failed presidential bid on her part might lead to her
shilling for some prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   (To be honest, I would be much too embarrassed to discuss this
with Mrs. Dole, who reminds me a lot of my mother, assuming my
mother was a Harvard-educated lawyer and former secretary of
Transportation and Labor. Plus, I don't want to be the guy who
causes Dole to change her mind about randomly calling journalists.)
</P>
<P>
   It would probably be safer to ask Dole a question pertaining to
foreign policy, inasmuch as there is a lot of that going around
lately. To get things rolling, and to make it clear to her that I
am a serious journalist who thinks deeply about things, I might ask
her something like, ``So, what kind of name is Slobodan, anyway?''
Say what you want about the situation in Kosovo, just about
everyone I've talked to thinks Slobodan is a terrible name and may
actually be making things worse in that part of the world than they
would otherwise be. I would ask Dole, if she were elected
president, if she would favor changing Slobodan's name to something
less belligerent-sounding such as ``Timmy'' or, perhaps, ``Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   This would probably take care of my 5 minutes, but if there were
any time left over, I could ask about Mrs. Dole's pets, assuming
she has any, and perhaps share a story or two about my pug dog,
Buster, who is unique in that he is neither a candidate for
president nor a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he wouldn't appreciate a call.
</P>

PLAYWRIGHT FOOTE REMEMBERS CHILDHOOD IN TEXAS TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``Farewell: A Memoir of a Texas Childhood''; By Horton Foote;
Scribner, $24. 
 
By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The predominant question of Horton Foote's childhood in Wharton,
Texas, during the early decades of this century was, ``I wonder why
the Brooks boys are like they are?''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooks boys were Foote's three uncles on his mother's side:
Billy, Brother and Speed. Promising young men, sons of one of their
town's most respected citizens, all three wound up as
ne'er-do-wells, leading dissipated lives marked by varying
configurations of womanizing, alcoholism, drugs, prison and new
career paths hopefully begun and abruptly abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasted, tragic lives, I had by 12 observed, seemed nearly
always to occur to at least one male member of the families we knew
_ but to have the only three males of a family turn out so was most
unusual,'' Foote recalls in ``Farewell,'' his bittersweet memoir.
</P>
<P>
   By expressing his lifelong desire to understand the people
prominent in his early life, by depicting a family whose favorite
pastime was telling tales of their kin and the surrounding
community, Foote's memoir reveals the roots of his inspiration as a
dramatist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farewell'' will be best appreciated by those who have enjoyed
Foote's plays and screenplays through the years, including the
Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Young Man From Atlanta'' and the
Oscar-winning screenplays for ``Tender Mercies'' and ``To Kill a
Mockingbird.'' One meets the real-life models for many of his
characters, particularly those in his more recent, frankly
autobiographical ``The Orphan's Home'' cycle of plays chronicling
his parents' early lives.
</P>
<P>
   Foote's free-flowing reminiscences cover events from his
childhood, overheard bits of family history, stories of friends, of
hard times, of race relations and perseverance. Always there is the
picture of the inquisitive ``Little Horton'' _ his dad was ``Big
Horton,'' gentle proprietor of a men's clothing store _ questioning
his elders about family mysteries and secrets. Those white robes
found at the bottom of a trunk? And what is the Ku Klux Klan?
</P>
<P>
   As in his dramatic writing, the strengths of Foote's memoir are
simplicity and honesty. But this is no whitewashed, Norman Rockwell
vision of small-town life from Foote's birth in 1916 until his
departure in his late teens to pursue a career as an actor, an
ambition that would soon be redirected to playwriting. Amid the
colorful characters, Saturday-night dances and folksy banter, there
is a good deal of complexity, darkness and pain. Little Horton
hears of murder, lynching, floods, the 1918 influenza epidemic,
business reversals, betrayal, adultery, alcoholism and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a loving family, it's a tough life. Foote has an
almost Chekhovian knack for quietly revealing human frailty. His
people are just a bit hapless, bewildered by life _ including his
kindly, ineffectual father. They never quite understand why things
turn out as they do, good or bad, but they never stop wondering
why.
</P>
<P>
   The recollections sometimes ramble, a tad random and
scattershot. Yet overall the book is held together by the character
of curious Little Horton, particularly as he strives to comprehend
thornier matters, such as racism. By the later chapters, as his
seemingly arbitrary desire to become an actor gathers steam, the
book gains narrative motion as he bids a poignant farewell to
various relatives and sets out by train for the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   He gives us neat, often memorable character sketches, such as
the one of Lily Dale, his maternal aunt, who lives in Houston and
struggles to be artistic, composing piano pieces. There is Mrs.
Willford, who felt ``it was her duty before she died to teach the
men in Wharton to act like gentlemen, and so whenever she met a man
up in town who didn't tip his hat and say, `How are you today, Mrs.
Willford?' she would take her walking stick and hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentle humor arises from the dialogue's sometimes odd mixture of
naivete and down-home wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I going to get to be a movie star in Wharton, Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, don't stay in Wharton, Texas _ go on out to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote did go to Hollywood and to New York, but eventually, in
his 70s, he moved back to Wharton. Given the prominent role those
early influences and preoccupations have played throughout his
quietly illustrious career, one might say he never left.

   Everyone gets spam for ``XXX hotpics!'' and get-rich-quick

unopened. But I must admit, sometimes I do read it, and sometimes
I'd like to reply. Of course I haven't, yet. That might encourage
them. It would be hard to imagine, but I might get even more, even
worse junk e-mail. So, although I can never send them, just writing
these replies did make me feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Here they are, unsent replies to actual e-mail solicitations I
have received. But all names and addresses have been changed to

   I am a 38-year-old mother of two small children, and though it

   Dear Manemeister:
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for your recent inquiry as to whether or not I would
be happier, more confident and more sexually attractive to women if
only I had more hair.
</P>
<P>
   As a woman myself, I have spent years trying to reduce the
amount of hair I have on my body and so, you see, more hair is just
not for me.
</P>
<P>
   Should I ever feel like being sexually attractive to women
however, and come to believe that more hair is somehow the key
ingredient, I will contact you.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks!

   Although I am not interested in purchasing your sex-attracting

your hopes that my sex life will awaken soon. I'm sure it is just
napping.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks!

   Now, this seems like a great idea! Instead of going to college,
I could have just sent you $300 or $400 and gotten a real diploma
from your ``eminent, nonaccredited university.'' Wow, I could have
saved my parents $59,700 or $59,600.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, since I already have a diploma, I will not be
needing your service, even though I'm sure a B.A. from diplomas.uni
would look much more impressive on my resume than Mt. Holyoke
College.

</P>
<P>
   I appreciate your job offer to sell dream vacations to thousands
of Internet users from the privacy of my own home. In the privacy
of my own home, I generally do not sell dream vacations, so I feel
I am not qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Do you mind if I ask how you got my name? If it was that pesky
headhunter who keeps sending me e-mail about working in the
modeling business (no experience necessary), don't take her word
for my qualifications. She seems to think anyone can do anything.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you will find the right person to fill this job, but
for now you can take me off your short list. Despite what you have
heard, I don't think I could dream-vacation-sell without it
sounding like a scam.

   Thanks!

   Dear Slim:
</P>
<P>
   As a petite woman tipping the scales at 110, I received the
invitation to join you and thousands of others in your
revolutionary diet plan with not a little surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the thought of losing four clothes sizes in two weeks
is a bit frightening. Your comment that people will really start to
notice me when they see that my clothes are so saggy is scary too.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose those closest to me might notice that under all those
saggy togs, I was dead.
</P>
<P>
   If I really wanted more people to notice me, perhaps I could
come up with a safer way.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks!
</P>
<P>
   Reply to: credit(AT)badcreditfixer.crd
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for approving me for the unsecured Visa card I did not
order. It is truly empowering to know that I, despite my dozens of
low-paying jobs and chronic late payments, have finally earned an
unsecured Visa.
</P>
<P>
   You say I can use up to $2,500 in credit, right away, without
mention of interest rates. That would be great. What does unsecured
mean anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks!

   Dear J.E.:
</P>
<P>
   I read with much interest your service that provides access to
the FBI files of anyone I know. I was always curious to know
whether my spouse was ever convicted of a major drug crime.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbors _ have they ever been institutionalized or ever
behaved in such a manner that resulted in the loss of life? They
are so quiet, always keep to themselves. It makes me wonder.
</P>
<P>
   I understand you can also run down info on children. I would be
quite keen to get the lowdown on my 7-year-old's recess friends.
Who are they, what do they do for a living, are they felons, pimps,
have they ever declared bankruptcy, etc. It would comfort a mother
to know these things.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks! Thanks! And Thanks! Again!

QUIETLY, SORENSTAM GEARS UP FOR RUN AT U.S. WOMEN'S OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID COOPER   
 The Tuscaloosa (Ala.) News   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ Coming into the 54th U.S. Women's Open,
Annika Sorenstam has yet to win during the 1999 LPGA season.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly why the other 149 golfers are picking her as a
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam comes to Old Waverly Golf Club in an eerily similar
fashion to 1995 and 1996. In both of those seasons, the Swedish
phenom came into the biggest major of the women's season without a
win.
</P>
<P>
   Both times she walked away with her name engraved on the cup.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Sorenstam comes to her sixth U.S. Open having
competed in nine tournaments this year and with top 10 finishes in
six of them. She has finished alone or in a tie for second three
times, including her last two tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   And now she re-enters the arena of her two greatest
performances. The Open begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my game is better than it was two years ago,''
Sorenstam said Tuesday. ``I am hitting longer off the tee. I think
I am more consistent in general. It is just when you come to a
championship like this, it is not just how you have been hitting
it. It is more mental than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch Sorenstam, on the course and off, is a technical study
in consistency. Through her photogenic schoolgirl smile, she
handles the glare of media attention with understatement and
simplicity. When it comes to golf she embraces the notion that the
safe play usually unwinds into a winning one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I try to live my life,'' Sorenstam said. ``I've
never been a gambler. Some tournaments it pays off and others it
doesn't. I feel if I play the way that I'm comfortable with I'll
always get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for her durability with longer fairways and ability to
gauge her own abilities, even Sorenstam admits the technical
variance of U.S. Open courses brings out the best in her patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one of my strengths in the Open. I always go
for the high percentage shot. I just do the shots that I know how
to hit. If I'm in trouble I try to get out as soon as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without a win, it's been hard to find anything wrong with
Sorenstam's game in '99. She currently stands fourth on the money
list with $360,026 of earnings in nine events. Her scoring average
of 69.50 is the best of her career and second to current LPGA
leader Karrie Webb.
</P>
<P>
   She is also third in greens in regulation with a percentage of
.783 and has hit 25 of her 32 rounds under par. In the last four
years, she was been the Player of the Year winner three times.
</P>
<P>
   Another proof of Sorenstam's consistency is the fact that her
nine appearances are the fewest of anyone in the top 15 of the
money list.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam says she rarely competes more than three weeks in a
row. Last week she laid off for the LPGA Corning Classic to prepare
for the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big event ... and I want to be as ready as I can. I
don't play in as many tournaments as some of the other girls. You
want to be fresh and it helps you a lot through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the week off, Sorenstam has a bit of a stealth cover
from the national media coming into this week's play at Old Waverly
in rural northeast Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-hole playoff between defending champ Se Ri Pak and
amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn from last year at Kohler, Wisc., still
has fans and broadcasters buzzing for an encore performance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the magnifying glass on Webb, who has won four
times this season and finished in the top 10 in all 11 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories, along with the sentimental favorite Nancy Lopez,
keep spectators asking all types of questions toward the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But the answer of the 54th U.S. Women's Open could well come
from the quiet voice of consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got to have certain criteria to do well in the Open,
that is for sure,'' Sorenstam said. ``You need patience and you
really need the desire to win this week.

BUSH PREPARES TO TEST POLITICAL WATERS IN IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush will make the maiden trip
of his still-unofficial presidential campaign next week, heading to
two early-primary states as the leader in the polls and flush with
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to go to Iowa on June 12 ``to look people in
the eye, and shake their hands and let them know what's on my heart
and hear what they have to say as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-term governor is regarded as the front-runner among
the Republican presidential hopefuls in early preference polls. And
he has eclipsed other Republicans in raising money without spending
any time on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   His exploratory committee raised some $8 million in the first
quarter of the year and is expected to raise at least that much in
the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio also
are scheduled to be in Iowa on June 12. There are no plans for any
joint appearances, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, whose husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, was the GOP nominee
in 1996, comes the closest to Bush in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a two-man race. It's going to come down to
Elizabeth Dole and George W. Bush. That's a good contest,'' said
Ari Fleischer, Dole's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is focused on the four main themes of her campaign,'' said
Fleischer, who added that Dole welcomes Bush to the campaign trail.
``We are looking forward to a good contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole will address voters on the four main themes of her
campaign: cutting taxes, a stronger defense, education and making
the war on drugs a national priority.
</P>
<P>
   David Beckwith, a Bush spokesman in Austin, said: ``We are
preparing to present Governor Bush's ideas to the public, and we
will let other campaigns take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush won $1.8 billion in tax cuts from the
just-adjourned Texas Legislature, giving him an issue as he begins
to campaign, he has been criticized for failing to come out with
specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show the son of the former president leading the
GOP pack in Iowa, but his numbers are far off the mark posted by
Bob Dole during the last presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, Sen. Dole was supported by 52 percent of likely
Republican voters in Iowa. A May poll showed Bush with just 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bob Dole was supported by 51 percent of voters
surveyed in a June 8, 1995, poll.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, two polls last month in that state showed Bush
with 28 and 30 percent of support from likely GOP voters. Those
same New Hampshire polls showed Elizabeth Dole with 17 and 15
percent of support from GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of campaign trail to travel,'' Fleischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and Kasich are bunched at the bottom of most public
opinion polls. Other GOP candidates _ including Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, television commentator Pat Buchanan, former Vice President
Dan Quayle, and magazine publisher Steve Forbes _ have
organizations established in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush formed a presidential exploratory committee earlier this
year and has all but announced his intent to seek the party's
nomination. The formal declaration is expected in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   He begins a month of campaigning next Wednesday, with a four-day
trip to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to get out and start moving around some and make
sure the sentiment that I'm told is out there is out there,'' Bush
told reporters in Austin earlier this week.

SOME POINT-AND-CLICK GUIDES TO URBAN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TOM VANDERBILT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Leading the Blind,'' his study of nineteenth century
European guidebook travel, the writer Alan Sillitoe traces the
emergence of guidebooks like Baedeker's and Murray's to the
increasing popularity of travel among those outside of the strictly
leisured classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourists,'' these newly itinerant classes would be derisively
called, were the first hardy souls the guidebooks, which Sillitoe
called ``educated dogs which led the blind.'' But they were
essential to understanding the character and mores of foreign
places for those travelers unprepared by their upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The hazards were many. In France, Murray's guide warned, the
civilized traveler ought to eschew dining at the common table at
inns, for the company was less than desirable: ``Without denying
that there are exceptions among these gentry, it is impossible to
have sojourned in France for any time without the conviction that a
more selfish, depraved, and vulgar, if not brutal, set does not
exist, nd gentlemen will take good care not to encourage their
approaches, and to keep a distance from them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, one guide counseled, buying a memento is a
challenge as imposing as the Matterhorn: ``There is hardly a
country in Europe which has so complicated a currency as
Switzerland; almost every canton has a coinage of its own, and
those coins that are current in one canton will not pass in the
next.'' In Italy, train travel made for a less arduous journey, but
one still had to be wary of brigands and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to this litany of risk, the concerns of today's
guidebooks seem petty. Tourism is now the world's number-one
industry and much of travel seems like an assembly-line process:
automated car rental, last-minute E-fares, global ATM card access.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of brigands, the most intimidating obstacle can be
something like getting frequent flier credit for that last leg of
the trip to Caracas on Avianca. Still, the increased frequency of
travel and the increased travel population make information all the
more important.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers on the Grand Tour of the Continent might have had time
to take in events as they discovered them, but today's weekend
continent-hoppers need up-to-the-minute information. With new
restaurants opening (and closing weekly), what hope does even an
annually updated guidebook have of charting New York?
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising then that city guides emerged as an early,
much-touted presence on the Internet. With a seemingly infinite
amount of space for listings, an ability to perform searches
targeted under any number of criteria, and, increasingly, the
option of purchasing tickets for events using the same site, the
Internet city guides seem to offer a guidebook, the Yellow Pages,
the daily newspaper, and even the rancor of public discourse all
rolled into one, a tribune for our time.
</P>
<P>
   There are limitations, however. For one, tracking all that
information still requires people to input it, and many online city
guides are less current than they suggest. Another limitation is
the guides' scope: not every guide covers every city. Citysearch,
for example, has a Danish version and is planning a Phoenix edition
but lacks Chicago in between. Even here, however, the Internet has
spawned myriad quirky, if low-budget, ocally produced guides.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever their weaknesses, they have become a sort of daily
guidebook to an increasingly complicated life. To test these
guides, I attempted to navigate each site in the hope of finding
one of the 53 Alfred Hitchcock films being shown this month at the
Museum of Modern Art and, for later in the day, a local video store
for something more current.
</P>
<P>
   In my estimation, the best way of experiencing a city is merely
wading into the human flow and letting the city's own rhythms and
contours carry one along, with stimulation of the senses the only
destination. But for those who favor the cultural equivalent of
global positioning systems, these latter-day educated dogs have
learned a few new tricks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CITYSEARCH.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spanning a network of cities from Las Vegas to Copenhagen,
Citysearch, now owned by Ticketmaster, offers a wide range of
listings and original content. For visitors to the New York City
area, these include the gossip-magazine-style ``Insider's Guide to
the Hamptons,'' a thorough description of Hoboken and passable
music reviews.
</P>
<P>
   One of Citysearch's most useful features is personalization,
which allows one to, among other things, receive an e-mail alert
when a favorite performer is due in town (provided Citysearch knows
about it).
</P>
<P>
   Unique to Citysearch is its ``Virtual Tours'' function, which
presents a ``slide show,'' accompanied by text, of various city
attractions. The prose, as one might expect, is roughly on par with
a Circle Line spiel. Of the Brooklyn Bridge, the tour notes: ``A
symbol of American urbanization and industrialization, the Brooklyn
Bridge is an immediately recognizable milestone in New York City
history and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding my Hitchcock film was a snap on Citysearch. I merely
clicked ``Movies,'' then a second heading titled ``Film
Festivals.'' I scrolled down a list to the ``Alfred Hitchcock''
listing, and was presented with a complete list of times and dates
for the 53 films the Museum of Modern Art is showing. Finding out
the time for ``The Trouble with Harry'' turned out to be no trouble
at all.
</P>
<P>
   When I queried Citysearch on video stores in my zip code,
however, I was informed that there were no video stores within a
quarter of a mile. Strange, I thought, given that there are at
least three within a few blocks of my home; perhaps not the highest
caliber, but with a copy of ``Vertigo'' nonetheless. I would have
been willing to walk more than a quarter mile, but apparently this
is the limit for an urban trek, and I saw no immediate way to
change the parameter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SIDEWALK.COM  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This much-touted Microsoft site has a similar reach to the other
guides, but its online content, despite being localized, seems
almost entirely oriented towards consumer information. This is not
surprising, since the link to E-commerce is seen as the ultimate
way to make city guides financially viable online.
</P>
<P>
   No virtual tours here, simply features on ``shower heads that
know how to handle pressure'' and tips on buying a new lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   One link that caught my eye _ shopping for ``mod furniture'' in
Brooklyn, turned out not to exist the first day I tried it (it did
the following day, but who wants to keep visiting?).
</P>
<P>
   Navigationally, Sidewalk is a bit confusing, often sending the
user to a national online retailer when a local one is desired,
which is odd since Sidewalk's main virtue is presenting shopping
and entertainment options in one's own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Looking under ``book shops,'' I was made aware that within
blocks of my home I had at my disposal The Center for Thanatology
and the God Build Christian Book Store. Although Sidewalk tells you
the distance each store is located from your address, this
information is otherwise simply a Yellow Pages listing.
</P>
<P>
   My search for Hitchcock proved a bit more vexing on Sidewalk.
Entering ``Hitchcock'' under the entry for ``Find a Movie,'' I was
given a listing for ``Dial M for Murder'' (in 3-D), but none of the
Museum of Modern Art showings. Similarly, looking under
``Revivals,'' I was shown ``The Trouble With Harry,'' but none of
the other Hitchcock films. By the time my computer crashed, I was
already longing for a simple newspaper page.
</P>
<P>
   As for videos, there was no clearly apparent heading, so I
clicked ``Block by Block,'' hoping to get a rundown on my
neighborhood. After reading through a list of ``Cool
Neighborhoods,'' I selected Court St. between Union St. and First
Place, but this listing, which included the All Pets Go to Heaven
Funeral home and Helen's Restaurant, featured no video stores. My
usual video store, located on the corner of Henry and Sackett,
apparently suffers from an uncool address. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIGITALCITIES.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America Online's foray into the city guide field has been fast
and furious, and it now boasts the most hits of any such site. The
New York version is something akin to the opening screen of America
Online itself, with news headlines, weather, and ticket offers.
</P>
<P>
   The local content is a bit sparse, with none of the newsy
features of Citysearch or Sidewalk, and a click on the ``book
shopping'' link brings up the Barnes and Noble site (no charmingly
bumbling used bookstore clerks here).
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a New Jersey ``bar cam'' that allows one to
view the action at Martell's in Point Pleasant; the picture is of
people sitting at plastic tables. I am not sure who would want to
watch this, or whether Martell's patrons knew they were being
filmed, but I had no intention of seeing how long the guy in the
plaid shirt would be on that bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   This site seems designed less for its own sake than for
packaging material available elsewhere on line. Looking for my
Hitchcock, I enter the director's name in a search field on the
movie page, which yields nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking video in the hopes of finding a video store, I was
given a Yellow Pages alphabetical listing of every video store in
the city. A subsequent search allowed me to ask for those stores
located only within a half mile of my house, but here I kept
getting the message, ``We've run into an error _ ours, not yours.''
Instead of Hitchcock, I decided to watch zoom-camera images of the
Jersey Shore, ``Rear Window'' style, and hoped that I didn't
witness a murder. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NYTODAY.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many newspapers large and small have gotten
into the business of online city guides. So it is with New York
Today, owned by The New York Times. Readers of the newspaper will
find pretty thin gruel here _, articles simply reprinted from the
pages of the Times (albeit of a higher quality than most online
content) _ although nytoday does feature the listings,
personalization, and mapping services offered on other city sites.
</P>

   To search for Hitchcock, I called up the ``movies'' entry, which
allowed searches by type of film, location, and date. Luckily, I
guessed Hitchcock would be under Suspense/Thriller, and I was given
the time of ``The Birds.'' To find a video store, I clicked the
``Near My Home'' entry, and was then given a fairly intimidating
borough-wide video store listing, with no discernible way to narrow
the search. &QL;

   While not a city guide like the others, the ``land use
database'' maintained by the Center for Land Use Interpretation
offers a wonderful assortment of ``unusual and exemplary land use
sites'' in just about any locale in the country, revealing a layer
of the city far removed from the usual bistro openings.
</P>
<P>
   With its official-looking globe symbol and sober motto
(``Dedicated to the increase and diffusion of information about how
the world's lands are apportioned, utilized and perceived''), the
Center offers deadpan assessments of a variety of sites, which can
be searched by location or by categories such as ``waste sites''
and ``nuclear/radioactive sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Typing ``New York City,'' one is given a list of a dozen or so
sites, each containing a brief description and the simplest of
directions; highlights include the ``Meadowlands Trash Museum,''
which features a landfill cross-section (a ``veritable wall of
trash viewed through a glass wall'').
</P>
<P>
   At points, this site seems like a parody, but that might be
expected from a group that once put a sound-emitting device in a
remote desert area _ the noise was dripping water _ to see if
anyone would hear. On second thought, that does not seem much more
preposterous than training a webcam on a beachfront bar.

 &HT;    Jazzing up Bob Marley? Alexander makes it work
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of blending a mostly straight-ahead jazz approach to
the work of reggae giant Bob Marley may seem ghastly. But pianist
Monty Alexander and his crack, handpicked Jamaican rhythm section
more than deliver. The anchor of the effort is Alexander, whose
fluid, melodic playing respectfully explores the music of his
Jamaican boyhood. What could have been a jarring train wreck of
musical ideas becomes an uninterrupted flow of reggae and jazz
themes. Both musical forms embrace improvisation, and drummer
Rolando Wilson, bassist Trevor McKenzie and guitarist Robert Angus
take full advantage of the freedoms. With a rhythm section this
formidable instead of a more conventional trio setting, Alexander
has to be on his toes. His solos are inspired; Alexander even finds
a way to drop a reference to the Beatles' ``Eleanor Rigby'' into
``Jammin.' '' It all works, even the energetic take on ``I Shot the
Sheriff,'' which sports both a trombone and conch-shell solo.

 &HT;    Mainstream hasn't stopped Jamiroquia, a band on the move

   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Just because the mainstream finally discovered one of London's
most soulful exports doesn't mean Jamiroquai has decided to simply
float along in it. This is a band on the move. Lead singer Jay
Kay's got ``Canned Heat'' in his heels on the first single, and the
strings and rhythm guitar can't help but spark any other sole
within earshot. Don't listen too closely, though, as Jamiroquai
often relies on the lyrical sensibility of a disco tune. Which
means almost every song is a different way of saying dancing will
make you feel better. An affable point punctuated with the salsa
break midway into ``Planet Home,'' the insistent bass on ``Soul
Education'' and the exclamation mark of this act's fourth album _
the taut, multirhythmic single with which it should have closed the
album, ``Where Do We Go From Here?''

 &HT;    Loco for Lopez: Sweet sounds match good looks
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come on, admit it. Before you even listen to Jennifer Lopez's
first album, you want to hate it. You want the screen star of
``Selena'' and last year's smoldering ``Out of Sight'' to do a Don
Johnson and fall flat on that sculptured face. After all, skeptics
say, it would only be fair. Someone with such good looks and
considerable acting talent couldn't possibly have vocal skills as
well. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, this debut is hardly a disappointment _ and not because
Lopez is a particularly remarkable singer. But with such skillful
pop success miners as Emilio Estefan (Gloria's husband), Rodney
Jerkins (Brandy's hit maker) and Sean ``Puffy'' Combs (Lopez's
rumored-to-be other half) involved, her serviceable abilities are
buffed to a remarkably likable glow.
</P>
<P>
   And as she should, the supermodel on seemingly every magazine
serves her varying backdrops well: sounding vulnerable against the
breezy flamenco guitars on ``Should've Never,'' then certain of
herself on the album's first single, ``If You Had My Love'' and
like she could start a party on the horn-powered ``Let's Get Loud''
and Combs' bouncy contribution, ``Feelin' So Good.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bloat on this streamlined package is the unnecessary
reworking of ``No Me Ames'' and the numbing plea, ``Promise Me
You'll Try.''

 &HT;    The ``Alien'' series re-released, digitally mastered and
THX-certified
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years after we learned an acoustical fact about screaming
in space, Fox is re-releasing the four ``Alien'' movies (packaged
as ``Alien Legacy''), digitally mastered and THX-certified,
available in three forms: VHS widescreen ($19.98 each), VHS
pan-and-scan ($14.98 each) and DVD ($29.98 each).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Aliens'' (R; 1986) _ Writer-director James Cameron is best
known as the daddy of the Terminator and the guy who re-sank the
Titanic. But his entry in the ``Alien'' franchise not only tops
Ridley Scott's original flick, it's one of the coolest (and
creepiest) action movies of the '80s. It stands up to repeat
viewing, especially now that it's available in crisp DVD.
</P>
<P>
   This director's cut, previously available on collector's-edition
VHS, reinstates 17 minutes of footage trimmed from the theatrical
release. This includes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) receiving news
that her 10-year-old daughter has grown up and died during her
mom's 57-year hypersleep. It underscores the surrogate-mom bond
between Ripley and orphan Newt (Carrie Henn). We also see that
Newt's parents were responsible for accidentally introducing the
aliens into their settlement. And there's a nice, tense sequence
involving an alien assault and four motion-sensing machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   The extra footage extends Cameron's nail-biting buildup, as
Ripley and a squadron of Marines (including Michael Biehn and Bill
Paxton) journey to the planet of the crashed alien ship _ now
colonized by humans, who have mysteriously stopped contacting
Earth. It's a solid hour before any of the big action sequences
begin. Cameron saves his real ammo for the last 40 minutes,
culminating in the exhilarating fight-to-the-death between Ripley
and the alien queen. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Alien'' (R; 1979) _ Ridley Scott's Space Age haunted-house
movie still holds up fine (except for those cheesy twinkling lights
meant to represent a computer). The film's balance between
excruciating suspense and bursts of violence remains startling.
Twenty years ago, when that nasty li'l alien popped out of John
Hurt's stomach, it was one of the most gruesome sights ever seen
onscreen. Things have changed, huh? Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Alien Resurrection'' (R; 1997) _ Like Ripley herself, this
latest film from Jean-Pierre Jeunet (``Delicatessen'') is an odd
hybrid. Half action film, half existential meditation, it casts
Weaver as a clone, part Ripley, part alien. While some of the
action scenes rock, the ``newborn'' monster and the finale are more
whimper than bang.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Alien 3'' (R; 1992) _ The third installment betrays the
faith of fans of ``Aliens,'' killing off two major characters in
the opening credits. But that's not all: Director David Fincher's
feature debut, stranding Ripley and one of those darned aliens in
an all-male penal colony, is loud and claustrophobic, with action
scenes so hectically staged you rarely know what the heck is going
on. Let's not even talk about the ending. Grade: D+

 &HT;    An odd Irish wake worth attending
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   Your twee alarm may go off at the very idea of this comedy: It's
the tale of a small Irish village where Ned, the new winner of a $7
million lottery ticket, has died of shock.
</P>
<P>
   The death inspires one old rogue named Jackie (Ian Bannen) to
try to convince all the townsfolk to pretend his pal Michael (David
Kelly) is actually Ned. The idea? If they can fool the lottery
officials, everyone in town gets to share the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   First-time writer-director Kirk Jones isn't in the same league
as Bill Forsyth, whose Scottish idyll ``Local Hero'' remains a
lyrical touchstone of 1980s filmmaking. But Jones elicits charming
performances from a mainly older cast that manages to steer clear
of cliched Irish blarney. Or at least most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures obviously hoped ``Ned''
would be its ``Full Monty'' of '98. No such luck, but it's worth a
look on your VCR. Grade: B

 &HT;    It's all that: Teen-life flicks with real substance
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only one thing can come of Hollywood's recent teen movie glut: a
teen video glut.
</P>
<P>
   Several less-than-stellar depictions of American teen life are
headed for the video stores in coming weeks, including ``Varsity
Blues'' (June 29), the teachers-as-aliens ``The Faculty'' (June
15), the sinister ``Jawbreaker'' (June 22) and the ain't-all-that
``She's All That'' (July 13).
</P>
<P>
   The kids will be out of school soon, and if you don't want
multiple hours of their summer spent with ``Blues' '' James Van Der
Beek and his tin-eared Southern accent, you'll have to do
something.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a dozen, mostly older, videos depicting various aspects
of teen life. They may not all be great movies, but the truths they
more artfully present make for time better spent.
</P>
<P>
   You might even find yourself watching one of these with your kid
_ and maybe later even having a conversation about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``American Graffiti'' (PG; 1973) _ Before George Lucas lost
his mind with ``Star Wars,'' he made this funny, endearing homage
to 1962 cruising in California. Good performances, especially from
Charles Martin Smith and Candy Clark. At the time, many critics
didn't like this movie, either. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Breaking Away'' (PG; 1979) _ Dennis Christopher leads a band
of going-nowhere young men in a test of mettle in a college-town
bicycle race. Oscar for screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Crucible'' (PG-13; 1996) _ Yes, Daniel Day-Lewis gets a
little involved with young hellion Winona Ryder. But the glee with
which the 17th-century Salem, Mass., townsfolk absorb Ryder and her
girl gang's hysterical cries about devil worship reveals a lot
about how humanity never really changes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dead Poets Society'' (PG; 1989) _ The Australian director
Peter Weir's heartfelt drama of a free-spirited English teacher
(Robin Williams) using poetry to inspire kids in a taut prep
school. Your kid will spot Ethan Hawke in the talented cast. Oscar
for screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fiddler on the Roof'' (G; 1971) _ One of the finest movie
musicals, it's a poignant look at Jewish life and racism that
includes a father's struggle to accept change brought about in part
by his daughters' emerging individualism. Oscars for
cinematography, sound and scoring adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The 400 Blows'' (unrated; 1959) _ OK, so the kid in this
movie is 12. So what. Francois Truffaut's remarkable French film
(with English subtitles) about a child with nowhere to turn is one
of the must-see movies of all time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Great Santini'' (PG; 1980) _ Long before he married
Bonnie Raitt, Michael O'Keefe got an Oscar nomination for
portraying the eldest son of a big-as-life _ and abusive _ military
man (Robert Duvall). Often forgotten among all the fine
performances is Stan Shaw's delicate but effective work as
O'Keefe's African-American buddy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Last Picture Show'' (R; 1971) _ Growing up in Texas
isn't easy, either. Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges and Cybill
Shepherd were young once. And here they're at their best in Peter
Bogdanovich's adult-themed masterpiece. Oscars for supporting actor
(Ben Johnson) and supporting actress (Cloris Leachman).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Native Son'' (R; 1986) _ Not entirely well-made, but it's
well worth watching this adaptation of Richard Wright's brilliant
novel of a 19-year-old black youth's experience of living in
America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ordinary People'' (R; 1980) _ Before there was a Matt Damon,
a Ben Affleck and a ``Good Will Hunting,'' there was a Timothy
Hutton and this moving story of a high school kid and his therapist
coping with his family's tailspin following a death. Oscars for
best picture, director (Robert Redford), screenplay and supporting
actor (Hutton).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rebel Without a Cause'' (unrated; 1955) _ The real deal.
With James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Romeo and Juliet'' (PG; 1968) _ Who needs Leonardo DiCaprio
and Claire Danes? Leonard Whiting, 17, and Olivia Hussey, 15,
explode with youthful passion in Franco Zeffirelli's provocative _
and, unfortunately, mod-era dated _ adaptation of Shakespeare's
tragedy. Oscars for cinematography, costume design.

   AMERICAN AIRLINES CRASH
</P>
<P>
   CRASH _ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ An American Airlines flight with 145
people aboard skidded off a rain-slickened runway during a storm,
broke apart and burst into flames. A source familiar with the
investigation said nine people were known to have been killed. At
least 80 people were injured and taken to hospitals. The deaths
were the first on a major U.S. airline in nearly 1 1/2 years.
Flight 1420, a Super MD-80, crashed just before midnight Tuesday.
It had 139 passengers and six crew members and was due to arrive at
9:41 p.m. The flight from Dallas was delayed for more than two
hours and arrived just as the storm was hitting Little Rock with
lightning, hail and winds gusting to nearly 90 mph.

for Kosovo. (Deans, Cox News Service) Developing.

<P>
   w/KOSOVO-TEAM _ WASHINGTON _ Like most effective managers,
President Clinton tends to think of problems in one of three ways:
those that can be ignored, those that can be solved and those that
must be managed. Guess which box Kosovo fits into. Here, after all,
is a foreign policy crisis with at least four key dimensions _
military, humanitarian, diplomatic and political _ each of which is
affected daily, sometimes hourly, by developments in the other.
Clinton relies on a flexible, multi-tiered team with diplomats,
generals and lawyers at its core to manage U.S. policy, objectives
and long-term strategy in Kosovo. (Deans, Cox News Service)

   KOSOVO-FORTDIX _ FORT DIX, N.J. _ Overseeing the arrival of
Kosovar refugees at Ft. Dix in New Jersey is a military mission
that requires more of a soft heart than a steady trigger finger.
Gen. Mitchell Zais, dispatched from Atlanta's Fort MacPherson on
May 1 to oversee Operation Provide Refuge, has a lot of heart for a
Vietnam veteran and the son of a four-star general. He has cried
many times looking into the faces of the families arriving here,
getting processed and then leaving to settle into apartments and
jobs across the country. With a PhD in psychology, a distaste for
mornings and cryptic military acronyms, General Zais is not very,
well, General-like. We spend a day following him as he goes about
his business tending to the needs of 3,700 refugees housed at Ft
Dix. (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   OLY-GIFTS _ ATLANTA _ Billy Payne's private Olympic foundation

South African anti-apartheid organization. In a report to the U.S.
House Commerce Committee, the foundation provided a list of some
three dozen gifts that exceeded the IOC's $200 limit, including a
$948 carburetor kit for Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi from Libya and
the now famous live bulldog for the deceased Cuban member Manuel
Gonzalez Guerra. (Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

deploy to Texas and other Southwestern border states. Now the
academy, located on a former naval base, is quiet. The head count
has dropped to less than 150, all but two of the last eight
incoming classes have been canceled, and the remaining classes have
been pared down _ all because of a sudden shortage of recruits that
has put a crimp in the Border Patrol's expansion plans and brought
the wrath of Congress on the agency's tiny recruiting staff.

Schools Superintendent Ida Love has taken an approach that no other

want their children to be evacuated. After seven bomb threats at
Decatur High in the past month, Love became frustrated at the
weekly evacuations. Because they all turned out to be pranks, she
decided to let parents decide whether they want their kids to miss
class if another bomb threat comes in. (Loupe, Atlanta

ADULTS TAKE UP MUSIC FOR THE LOVE OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By day, Dr. Robert Kelly deals with disease and life-or-death
matters.
</P>
<P>
   But every night, for an hour or so before going to bed, Kelly's
mind turns to Chopin, Tchaikovsky and J.S. Bach, as he practices on
the restored antique Kohler upright piano that he inherited from
his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to point your mind in a different direction,''
Kelly says. ``It's so different from what I do all day'' as an
internal medicine specialist.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, piano lessons were something kids took from a
grown-up teacher. Now, although no one keeps precise numbers, a
growing number of adults are taking piano lessons, often from a
teacher younger than themselves. Kelly, 44, studies with Igor
Resnianski, a 33-year-old Siberian-born graduate student at Texas
Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Even the esteemed Cliburn Foundation has taken notice; next
week, it will sponsor the first International Piano Competition for
Outstanding Amateurs. Modeled on a similar competition in Paris _
and not to be confused with the ``real'' Van Cliburn International
Piano Competition, to be held again in Fort Worth in 2001 _ the
amateur competition will feature 97 devoted amateurs from 10
countries in solo competition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the contestants are probably much like Kelly, who took
lessons as a youth but then became busy with school and career.
Kelly's three children had taken lessons from Resnianski for
several years. One week, when one of the youngsters was sick, Kelly
took a deep breath and asked if he could take the lesson.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, at the first amateur concerto concert at the
TCU/Cliburn Piano Institute, Kelly auditioned with a movement of
Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21. Kelly didn't make the cut, but
he'll back this year with a movement from J.S. Bach's Concerto No.
5 in F minor, once again dreaming of the chance to play with a
professional orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional in a high-prestige and high-pressure field,
Kelly is certainly not alone in his devotion to amateur
music-making, says Amanda Byars, a Dallas teacher who specializes
in teaching adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority have been in scientific fields, or bankers, or
lawyers,'' she says. ``Surprisingly, very few have been
homemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Byars says that her oldest student is in his early 70s, though
the average age is 37-47.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not successful with my first adults,'' she says. ``I had
to learn and research why and how adults come for piano lessons.
They really want to be there, and have a genuine interest in
classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   Janie Brown, 43, of Fort Worth works as a training instructor at
Boeing Aircraft in Irving and is about to become a grandmother.
With her family grown, she decided to use her spare time to
concentrate on what she calls her ``heart's desire'' _ studying
music. She found Fort Worth teacher Patricia Brown in the telephone
book, began with voice lessons about four years ago and added piano
about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat tells me I'm further along than I should be,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   But Janie Brown has more ambition than just having fun. She
wants to enter college as a music major, and more important, ``I
want to be able to show my grandchildren how to play the piano,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Brown teaches voice and piano to children and adults at
her traditional-style in-home studio in south Fort Worth, and
admits: ``Some teachers like teaching first- and second-graders,
but the adults are my favorites. I like relating to someone who's
doing it because he or she wants to _ not for any other incentive.
And I can relate to how they have to schedule it around family,
jobs and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The TCU/Cliburn Piano Institute had been around for decades as a
summer program for aspiring amateurs. Tamas Ungar, the
Hungarian-born pianist who heads the piano department at TCU, and
who founded and directs the Cliburn/TCU Piano Institute, added the
amateurs' program when he began to notice an increase in amateur
adult interest in the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults have more time,'' he says. But he has also noticed the
particular interest among members of what he calls the
``intellectual professions. People like doctors and lawyers, who
need the creativity outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ungar's guidance, Fort Worth has become a focal point for
many amateurs, who have arrived from all over the world at the
institute for three consecutive years to play in master classes
(essentially, lessons in front of an audience), take lessons,
participate in group discussions and share ideas. And, starting
last year, they could compete in the one-of-a-kind event in which
several are chosen to perform with the Fort Worth Chamber
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Rust, a California-based consultant in urban economics,
amateur oboist and publisher of ``Music for the Love of It,'' a
bimonthly newsletter for amateur musicians, also notes a definite
increase in adult amateur musical activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are living longer, retiring earlier and finding that
music is a wonderful thing to do with their time,'' he says. ``It's
a way of keeping the mind and spirit young, and a way of keeping in
touch with other people. It's a form of spiritual renewal.''

COUNTING ONES BLESSINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Happiness, as we all know but usually forget, is a
state of mind. Take, for example, Winnie, Beckett's indomitable
spirit whose hymn to the minutiae of daily life forms the basis of
``Happy Days,'' his last full-length play. ``Not a day goes by that
there's not a blessing,'' Winnie muses, rummaging happily through
her handbag, then adds as anafterthought, ``in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Half buried in a mound of earth in a bleak landscape with only a
dubious parasol for protection, she observes, ``What a blessing
nothing grows.'' Sorrow, of course, keeps breaking in. And there is
all that time to fill between blessings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is one to do?'' she asks. ``All day long? Day after
day?'' After the morning prayers and ablutions, after the
toothbrush has been read, what is there to occupy oneself before
the earth completely swallows her up? There are always the handbag
and the music box and the gun and the hope that this will be the
day Willie will sing for her. That would be a really happy day.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's existential Everywoman is one of his most brilliant
and evocative creations, and has always been a strong lure for
actresses. Angela Vitale, a former stalwart for the Jean Cocteau
Repertory, has returned to undertake the part, and she gives an
intelligent if sometimes uneven reading of Winnie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vitale, who always brought a certain elegance and refinement
to her roles for the Cocteau, presents a Winnie who is almost
delicate and ladylike, with little of the earthiness one normally
associates with the character. A larger problem is the slow, almost
static pacing that Jonathan R. Polgar, the director, sets from the
opening. Ms. Vitale lingers over each line and each action _ for
example, in taking off her glasses, setting them down, putting them
back on, all with considered deliberation _ so that the performance
becomes self-conscious and mannered.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. Vitale moves more comfortably into the character, and
some sections are more effective than others. But the tentativeness
in other passages also undermines much of the considerable humor in
the play. It almost seems as though Ms. Vitale is still working on
defining her character; in some scenes she has found it, but in
others she's still searching.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Hazard delivers an admirable turn as Willie, whose grunts
and groans and mustache twirls provide most of this production's
laughs. Mary Myers' stark set looks like Arizona in August and
creates an appropriate sense of desolation.
</P>

THE DUVEL MADE ME DO IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good Catholic boy that I am, I'd never advise anyone to consort
with the devil. On occasion, I've suggested that a few individuals
could pay him a visit _ that guy in the white Trans Am who cut me
off this morning comes to mind _ but I'd never recommend going over
to the dark side. Until now. And don't blame me for this sudden
conversion: It's all the Belgians' fault.
</P>
<P>
   You see, from this tiny, picture-pretty postcard of a country
comes a stunning variety of hearty brews that rival the wines of
the Belgians' French neighbors in complexity and style. Indeed,
many of Belgium's more substantial offerings come in sturdy
winelike bottles, capped with a cork and a wire cage.
</P>
<P>
   Duvel, Flemish for ``devil,'' is one such masterful brew. It
defies easy categorization: A top-fermented ale, it's pale like a
lager, probably thanks to the imported pale barley grown just north
of France's Champagne region. But the huge bouquet and enormous
head immediately put to rest any sense that this will be a treacly
batch of suds. The spicy Bohemian hops create a generous but
surprisingly subtle palate, whereas the long, yeasty finish gives a
final note of clarity with no cloying sweet aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Duvel is often served as an aperitif, but don't let
that limit your enjoyment of this fine beverage: I've found that it
works equally well as an accompaniment to spicy meats and heavy
cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Brewed since 1871 at Moortgat Brewery near Malines, Duvel is
unfiltered and unpasteurized, with a fine layer of yeast at the
bottom, but otherwise surprisingly clear. Try to pour gently, so
that the goo remains undisturbed. (If you see ``Duvel'' lettered in
green on the label, you've come across the inferior pasteurized
version _ always ask for Duvel in red).
</P>
<P>
   ``But Beer Nut,'' you cry, ``whither the name, Duvel?''
Supposedly, one of the brewers tasted the as-yet unnamed brew and
remarked, ``This is a devil of a beer.'' Sounds apocryphal: The
name probably has more to do with the devilishly difficult brewing
process _ two to three months of fermentation and maturation at
both ale (warm) and lager (cold) temps, then a final dose of yeast
in each bottle.
</P>
<P>
   So if you'll excuse me, I'm off to confession now. ``Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned. I cavorted with the devil three times in
the past week.''

QUIZ: WHOM DID THE `KILLER RABBIT' ATTACK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Was Jimmy Carter really attacked by a rabbit when he was
president? _ A.D., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: April 20 was the 20th anniversary of President Carter's
encounter with a ``killer rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Carter was fishing in Plains, Ga., when a rabbit swam
toward his canoe making hissing noises and baring its teeth,
according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The president responded by hitting the animal with his paddle or
by splashing water at it until it swam away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service having been caught flat-footed _ I'll grant
you an amphibious rabbit assault is a tough thing to defend against
_ the president did what he could to protect himself,'' Cecil Adams
wrote in 1995 in his column, ``Straight Dope.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident did not become public until August 1979, when press
secretary Jody Powell let the rabbit out of the hat by telling
reporter Brooks Jackson about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the meaning of Sigourney Weaver's first name? _ J.T.,
San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: Susan Weaver was 14 when she decided to take the first name
Sigourney, inspired by the name of a minor character in ``The Great
Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old actress comes from a family with an interest in
unusual names. Her parents, former NBC President Pat Weaver and
actress Elizabeth Inglis, named their son Trajan and almost named
Susan ``Flavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans can write to Sigourney Weaver in care of International
Creative Management, 8942 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90211.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Elia Kazan movie ``A Face in the Crowd'' available on
videotape? I've looked for it on television, but it never seems to
air. _ F.S., Spencer, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Crowd,'' a 1957 film that stars Patricia Neal and Andy
Griffith, is available from several video retailers.
</P>
<P>
   One place to find it is the Internet movie retailer Reel.com,
which is selling new copies for $16.99 at www.reel.com. Or, call
its Berkeley, Calif., retail store at (888) 707-7335.  &QL;

TIME-TESTED AND CREATIVE WAYS TO SHOW KIDS HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to parenting, advice on how to raise emotionally
secure children is as varied as the vast number of expert opinions
and self-help books.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of personality type, there is one piece of advice
that fits all children: unconditional love.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things every child needs is to feel loved,'' said
Will Glennon, author of ``200 Ways to Raise a Girl's Self-Esteem.''
``Often we think as parents that by providing for them, we're
showing our love, but we're just doing the job of parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Glennon, who has two children, said a parent's ultimate job is
to discover what makes each child unique, be fascinated by it and
love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each kid it's going to be different,'' he said. ``Some
kids need the words. Some kids need hugs, to be touched a lot.
Other kids need you to do something that demonstrates they are
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Parsley, a former teacher and author of ``The Choice Is
Yours: A Teenager's Guide to Self-Discovery, Relationships, Values,
and Spiritual Growth,'' said parents need to emphasize the value of
uniqueness in their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of it starts with teaching the child how to build
self-respect, to value himself and look at himself as a unique
being; to not compare himself to others, but recognize his own
unique good qualities,'' Parsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Those basic principles lead to accepting self-responsibility,
because part of valuing yourself is being responsible for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feel bad, don't blame it on someone else, but do
something constructive about it,'' she said. ``We have no choice
about what happens to us, but we do have a choice about how we
react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Small gestures of caring also can make a big difference, Parsley
and Glennon agree. And not just for our own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love your children, you can't help but love other
children,'' said Glennon. ``One of the mistakes people make is they
build their world on a model of scarcity, where they think there
are not enough things to go around so they horde. But the more love
you give, the more compassion you show, the more kindness you have,
the more there is in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When we asked Tarrant County residents how they make their
children feel loved, we were met with some age-old methods and some
creative new ideas. Here's a sampling of what they said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Randle, executive director of HOPE Farm, a nonprofit
ministry to inner-city boys ages 4 to 18: ``Children spell love
this way: TIME. It's hard to tell someone you love them if you
don't spend time with them. Another thing you can do to develop a
child is to speak and model the truth. When you are faced with
situations where not telling the truth is an option, always tell
the truth. Be a promise-keeper. That develops trust in children.
The last and most important thing is to give the children a
biblical foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bob Roberts, pastor of NorthWood Church, Keller: ``I do
not put ceilings on my children. If they have an idea that they can
do something, I try to affirm them and challenge them to explore
it. Expose them to different places and ideas and play with them;
let them know I'd rather be with them than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Burks, father of two boys, ages 13 and 14, and field
service supervisor for the Tarrant County Juvenile Probation
Department: ``Involve them in athletics or the fine arts. Listen to
them. Acknowledge the things they do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Emerson, assistant dean for continuing education and work
force development at Tarrant County College: ``Teach children their
history and plan vacations around those things so that they can
associate places with things they've read about. Talk to them about
discrimination; it should never be a surprise. Introduce them to
individuals of color who are accomplished and have made
contributions to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Earla Golden, principal of Oakmont Elementary School: ``Greet
children with a smile. Show interest in what they are doing. Treat
every child with value and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Minnies, director of marketing for the Festival
Marketplace mall in Arlington and mother of two children: ``Eat
together or go to a movie. Get to know their friends. Ask them what
was fun about their day.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Camarillo, father of one son, small-business owner in
Arlington, chairman of technology for the Arlington Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce: ``Give them access to the Internet in a
controlled environment. Take them to work and show them how it
really is. Involve them in church activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Gordon, Fort Worth mother, grandmother and administrative
secretary, University of Texas at Arlington: ``Tell them you
appreciate them when they help. Give a lot of hugs and kisses. Tell
them `I love you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Tan, Arlington business owner and mother of four children;
executive producer of Kids on Stage for a Better World, a group of
children who promote moral values in a nonreligious manner:
``Compliment them on their accomplishments. Give them extra time to
play on the computer after they finish their chores. Allow them to
solve their own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Sampson, father of three and owner of an Allstate
Insurance franchise in Arlington, vice president of
operations/administrations for the Greater Dallas Chapter of 100
Black Men, a national mentoring organization: ``Entrust your
vehicle with a teen-ager. Give them an opportunity to help someone
else. Ask them about their day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lisa Elliott, a psychologist at Cook Children's Medical
Center specialty clinic in Denton: ``Put love notes in their lunch
boxes every day. Schedule 10 to 20 minutes of one-on-one individual
time with them. Provide a special treat after school. Sing their
special song at bedtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hochberger, Fort Worth pediatrician: ``Concentrate on
their strengths and not their weaknesses and tell them how good
they are, how strong they are. Emphasize attitude over aptitude;
character principles like integrity, concern for others, honesty
and courage, curiosity and leadership. Foster leaders and not
followers by using these principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Sims, Grapevine, mother of two teen-agers and president
of the Arts Council of NorthEast Tarrant County: ``Attend their
competitions. Listen without forming preconceived ideas. Cook a
favorite meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Rice, coordinator of student support service at
Grapevine-Colleyville school district: ``Acknowledge their presence
with a pat or hug. Allow them to provide a service to an elderly
person. Talk to them about inappropriate choices and offer an
alternative. Follow through with consequences when rules are
broken.''

NOT EVEN THE BIG BAD WOLF COULD BLOW THIS HOUSE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started, as so many school projects do, with an enthusiastic
child and a parent who wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Stivison, 9, wanted to plan a house that was stormproof.
Her father, Ralph Stivison, who has a self-named architectural
practice, envisioned the big concept, ``a storm-resistant dwelling
primarily for the Texas-Oklahoma-Kansas tornado alley, but which
would also be appropriate for hurricane-prone regions of the Gulf
and Atlantic coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph and Erica became so engrossed in their project, they were
invited to present their ideas to Erica's third-grade class at West
University Elementary School in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Her classmates volunteered suggestions. Ralph steered them
through the practical-thinking chores, their imaginations firing
off ideas both wild and reasonable. Ralph and Erica incorporated
the collective plan into a model _ earth-sheltered to counter the
uplift forces of winds and placed high on a grade to be above
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   The house, with a long, light-filled atrium and rooms that open
off the center light well, was a hit with the class. The kids liked
the idea of playing on the roof, peeking through light wells down
into rooms. They also approved of the energy savings that earth
sheltering provides. ``The insulation value of the earth makes
heating and air-conditioning costs go way down,'' Ralph says.
</P>
<P>
   Through the eyes of adolescents, a house evolved that provides
shelter from the worst storms and the most frightening utility
bills. .MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on

LAREDO SPELLING WHIZ GOES OUT IN BEE'S FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ricardo Cigarroa, 13, failed by one letter
Wednesday to make the second round of the 72nd National Spelling
Bee here.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa, who just completed the seventh grade at United Middle
School in Laredo, Texas, failed to correctly spell basmati, an
Asian long-grain rice. He used the letter ``z'' rather than ``s.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most contestants unfamiliar with a particular word,
Cigarroa asked the contest judge, or pronouncer, to define it.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa started spelling: B-A, then a pause, then Z-M-A-T-I.
</P>
<P>
   When the bell that signaled his error rang throughout the hushed
Grand Hyatt Hotel ballroom packed with 248 other contestants and
their relatives, Cigarroa knew he had been eliminated from the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed disappointed when he left the stage where the
contestants were sitting, but he soon emerged from a backstage room
with a smile. He said he was looking forward to touring the
Smithsonian Institution's National Air &AMP; Space Museum later
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He had been through a rough few days for Cigarroa. Sponsored by
the Laredo Morning News, Cigarroa caught a cold shortly after he
and his family arrived in Washington last Saturday. So he missed
touring the Washington, D.C., area with the other contestants and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa said that the night before the contest, which is run by
Scripps Howard newspapers, he hardly slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept rolling around and looking at the clock,'' he said. At
one point he got up to study some of the words that are provided in
a 3,400-word handbook. But the contest words are not limited to the
handbook. The spellers can be given any word from the Webster's
Third New International Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa will take home $50 and a commemorative watch. He
defeated 50 other students in the Laredo Spelling Bee championship
in April to earn a place at the national contest.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarroa said he sometimes studies spelling for ``a couple of
hours a day.'' His mother, Melissa Cigarroa, said much of his study
time in the past few weeks went to studying for seventh-grade final
exams.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to continue teaching himself Latin and someday wants to
become a physician like his father, who also named Ricardo.
</P>
<P>
   Young Cigarroa said he plans to keep entering spelling contests
and hopes to be back here next year. The National Spelling Bee is
open to students under 16 who have not finished the eighth grade.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Audiences inside the collection of theaters and concert
halls along the south bank of the Thames that make up the world's
largest cultural complex are regularly transported to the realm of
the sublime.
</P>
<P>
   Outside they're brought hurtling back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   It is a grim plunge from the heights of a triumphant last
movement or a final soliloquy to the shadowy forlorn spaces of the
South Bank Center, constructed when concrete was the building
material of choice and the word Brutalist was not a put-down but
the name of an architectural style.
</P>
<P>
   The complax is a drab, dank, gray maze of elevated catwalks,
windowless walls, pillars covered with graffiti and drafty basement
passageways that can cancel out a lingering moment of musical
rapture faster than you can say Elgar.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few Londoners to express satisfaction with the
center's most reviled building, the Hayward Gallery, were the
producers of the 1970s BBC television series ``Dr. Who.'' They were
able to use it, unaltered, for the setting of a prisoner-of-war
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a collection of boxes that people run away from, ``
said Elliott Bernerd, the latest person to take on the eyesore as
chairman of the South Bank Center. ``Last night, there were 3,000
people to hear Evgeny Kissin, and they were on their feet giving
him 12 standing ovations,'' he said. ``You would have thought it
was Mick Jagger. But the moment it ended, they all scattered like
ants.''
</P>
<P>
   The complex, occupying one of the most privileged pieces of real
estate on earth _ the shoreline of the Thames at a bend that looks
across at the Houses of Parliament to the west and St. Paul's
Cathedral to the east _ has been a growing visual irritant since it
was assembled 30 years ago, when progressive British architects
disdained grace and championed guts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, British architect Terry Farrell produced a new
rendering of the site that mellowed its brusque impact, but the
private investment backing his plan dried up during a depression in
property values in the early 1990s. Last year Richard Rogers, the
creator of the Pompidou Center in Paris and a noted lecturer on
urban London who is a member of the House of Lords and friend of
Prime Minister Tony Blair, failed to gain sufficient financing for
his plan to sheathe the offending complex in undulating glass.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by the ability of this blot on the London landscape to
escape all attempts at face lifts, Rowan Moore, the architecture
critic of The Evening Standard, wrote in May: ``The South Bank Arts
Center resembles one of those riddling monsters you get in medieval
myths, who ask gallant knights deceptively simple questions and
then chomp them into powder when they give the wrong answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernerd, 53, the man atop the latest white charger to ride in,
is a London-based international property developer, a highly
successful self-made man with a reputation for getting things done
in ways not always apt to please the sensitivities of esthetes. His
appointment in March 1998 by Culture Secretary Chris Smith brought
widespread grumbling in the creative community. But this time it is
the resistant concrete bunker of South Bank, not Bernerd, that is
likely to be chomped into powder.
</P>
<P>
   He announced early on that he would not hesitate to bulldoze the
offending buildings if necessary. He conducted some cold-eyed
budgetary analyses to make the center less dependent on the promise
of massive government arts grants and then put together a coalition
of 23 representatives from the worlds of politics, planning,
conservation and the local community to develop a master plan.
</P>
<P>
   They held a competition for master planner, narrowed the choice
down to a short-list of four architects including Zaha Hadid, Rem
Koolhaas and Sir Michael Hopkins and then unanimously settled on
Rick Mather, an architect with experience in designing buildings
for a number of British museums and universities. His $35 million
Neptune Hall has just opened to popular praise at the National
Maritime Museum in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Mather, a 61-year-old Oregonian with a laconic Pacific Coast
manner unaffected by the 36 years he has spent living and working
in London, is now charged with coming up with the final plan to
recreate the complex, estimated to cost at least $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The South Bank Center has five buildings, the Jubilee Gardens
public green and a parking lot in its 27 acres of river frontage.
The centerpiece is the Royal Festival Hall, built during the 1951
Festival of Britain. It is as open, inviting and appreciated as the
later buildings are off-putting, forbidding and shunned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 the National Film Theater arrived, followed a decade
later by the Hayward Gallery, the center's showcase for
contemporary art, and the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room, spaces for chamber music and smaller musical events than
those staged in the Royal Festival Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In that same year, 1967, the overworked cement mixer produced
elevated walkways designed to ease pedestrian passage into the
buildings from the street below. They ended up turning what had
once been a lively thoroughfare of small storefronts into a dreary
service road and incarcerating the complex in a lumpen girdle of
stone. Probably the most hated single feature of the complex, they
are being partially demolished this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 the Royal National Theater was built next door, and
though it is not officially part of the South Bank Center, it is a
natural extension of the complex and indistinguishable in the
public mind from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A central premise of any plan that Mather will be recommending
is to take back the cheerless walk along the river from the muggers
and muttering solitary types who now lurk in its shadows and turn
it into a promenade with cafes, shops and public spaces that will
take advantage of the stirring view across the water of illuminated
grand hotels, ornate government ministries and church steeples.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needs to feel part of the city again, to be busy and full
of life all day,'' said Mather. This objective will be aided by two
independent ventures now beginning construction, a millennium
celebration ferris wheel, said to be the world's largest, at one
end of the center's land and a new pedestrian bridge crossing the
Thames to replace a current gangway approach alongside the
Hungerford railroad bridge that is ankle deep in puddles whenever
it rains. Which in London is to say almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of approaching South Bank buildings is no happier
than the one of departing, leaving visitors with the impression
that they are going in furtively by a service entrance or a side
door. Mather plans to restore a grand marquee that once gave a
sense of occasion to entering the Royal Festival Hall and to open
up other entranceways to the river.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are already under way to strip away partitions and other
additions of the last 40 years that have cluttered its interior
expanses. The hall's modernist style, Mather said, was particularly
popular in the immediate postwar period in Northern Europe, where a
premium is put on light and space.
</P>
<P>
   It was Britain's first public postwar modern building and is the
only one in the complex officially covered by a preservation
listing. A study to warm up its sound, long considered too dry and
harsh, is to be completed this summer by Larry Kierkegaard, an
American acoustics specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Mather is working from four options, ranging from simple
refurbishment to outright demolition and reconstruction of three
buildings. In all the plans, cinema becomes a far greater presence
than now, with new quarters planned for the National Film Center,
the Museum of the Moving Image and the British Film Institute. A
film school may be created, and a multiplex commercial movie
theater will go in nearby. A circular Imax building has just opened
in an adjacent plaza.
</P>
<P>
   So what's different this time from the past visionary projects
backed by big names and fed by public yearning? One answer is that
the end proposal intends to recommend gradual, sequential
development rather than a massive one-shot project of the kind of
monumentality that has sunk past ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Another came from Bernerd one recent morning as he mounted
explanatory charts and diagrams for a visitor on an easel in his
office. ``This time,'' he said with convincing concentration,
``it's going to happen.''

   NEW YORK _ Plans for ``Copland 2000,'' a worldwide celebration
of Aaron Copland's music and contributions to American culture,
were announced this week. Copland, who was born in Brooklyn, would
have turned 100 on Nov. 14, 2000. He died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration of his centenary, which was announced at a joint
news conference at City Hall on Tuesday by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and Linda Golding, president of the music publishing firm Boosey &AMP;
Hawkes, will involve more than 200 festivals, concerts and related
events over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is being organized by Boosey &AMP; Hawkes, Copland's longtime
publisher. The events in New York City include ``Completely
Copland,'' a three-week festival to be presented this fall by the
New York Philharmonic in which virtually all of Copland's works are
to be performed. Philharmonic music director Kurt Masur took part
in the announcement, speaking of Copland's connection with the
orchestra and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Other local events include a survey of Copland's music for film
by the Museum of Modern Art, concerts featuring Copland's music by
the New York Pops, presentations of Copland's stage works by the
Kaye Playhouse and a four-day series called ``Celluloid Copland''
by the Eos Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way for events and concerts in Minnesota,
Connecticut and other states as well as Argentina, Austria,
Belgium, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Britain and other
countries. There will be educational outreach programs, reissued
recordings and publications, and a nationwide tour by the Soldier's
Chorus and Concert Band of the U.S. Army Field Band featuring
Copland's music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copland helped to build the reputation of New York City,''
said Giuliani. ``His music captured a quality of being grateful to
be an American. He closed the ceremony by proclaiming Tuesday to be
Aaron Copland Day in New York City.

NEW MARKUP LANGUAGE WILL EASE WEB USE

<P>
   The latest browsers understand it, undergraduates are signing up
for classes to learn it, and _ ultimate cyberspace compliment _
start-ups are forming around it.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet phenomenon of the moment is XML, or Extensible
Markup Language, a new language that may one day power the second
generation of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has two main problems _ it's slow and it's hard to
find the one piece of information you need when you search,'' said
Tim Bray, chief technical officer at Textuality, in Vancouver,
British Columbia, and one of the architects of the new language.
``XML is designed to fix both these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the lingua franca of the web is HTML, or Hypertext
Markup Language, the most popular publishing language ever but one
that has its limitations, Bray said. ``HTML is easy to learn and
use, but it was never intended for many of the complicated jobs it
is being asked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies with the kinds of tags used to mark HTML text.
HTML uses tags like (less than symbol)p(greater than symbol) to
show that a paragraph follows, or (less than symbol)H1(greater than
symbol) to indicate a headline. But HTML tags do not mark the
meaning or semantic content of the text. For example, they can mark
text to say, ``This is displayed in bold,'' but they are not
capable of saying, ``This is the price of an item'' on an
e-commerce site or ``This is a date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about ordering a book on the Web right now,'' Bray said.
``If you want to know which of the books on the subject is the most
recent, or cheapest, it's a full Internet roundup each time while
you ask for a new page and an overburdened server sends it to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   XML is designed to remedy this problem by specifying not what
the information looks like but what the information is. It uses
tags or markers just as HTML does, but while HTML marks the text to
say ``This is in color'' or ``This is in boldface,'' XML marks the
text to say ``This is a price'' or ``This is a date.'' An
XML-enabled browser can sort and manipulate this data right at the
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   XML was intended to replace HTML, but in the near future it is
most likely to be used in tandem with it. The new language has many
practical advantages. For example, if the the user asked a travel
site for flight times between San Francisco and Chicago, the
browser could receive not only the schedule but a small program
that could select the flights by cost, time of day or even seat
selection. The browser could do the work that previously had to be
done by the server.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiply that by the entire Net and you have servers and
networks that are far less loaded and run more quickly,'' Bray
said.
</P>
<P>
   XML came to life in 1996 when the World Wide Web Consortium
commissioned a group of markup language experts, organized and led
by Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems, to deal with the limitations of
HTML.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was not in having tags but in having one set of
tags,'' said Dr. C.M. Sperberg-McQueen, of the University of
Illinois at Chicago and a member of the original committee.
``Businesses who use the Web needed to say, `This is an order
number. This is a part number.' They needed to identify each part
of their business documents.'' Sperberg-McQueen and his colleagues
developed the new markup language as a simplified version of a
difficult precursor, SGML, or Standard Generalized Markup Language,
completing the job in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Many groups have already begun developing their own applications
for XML. In medical applications, for example, there is an urgent
need for a single, easy-to-handle language capable of saying ``This
is a patient's name'' or ``This is a blood-sugar level'' on the Web
so that many machines can communicate quickly. ``There are very
active efforts right now in the medical community to hammer out a
tag set so the disparate computers can talk with one another more
easily,'' Bray said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, whole companies are springing up around XML. Erutech, a
Seattle start-up, will offer XML-based services for the health
insurance industry. Dave Wascha, Erutech's vice president of
marketing, said that the industry has to learn new ways to exchange
mountains of information over the Internet. ``It took a few years
of ramping up with HTML to realize the language wouldn't work
efficiently to exchange data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   XML is most likely to spread quickest among businesses and
organizations, not individual users, some experts predict. ``I
don't believe in XML for the average person,'' said Michael
Macrone, an independent Web developer in San Francisco. ``The
promise of a cross-platform, universal technology is always a false
one for the ordinary person, because too many factors like the
version of the browser or the speed of the modem must be
controlled.'' Many people have old browsers or slow modems, for
example, and are not interested in upgrading. ``The public thinks
of their computers like their TV's or refrigerators _ they don't
want to install a new freezer each year,'' Macrone said. ``XML will
be fine for superusers, but the average person is not going to
download the required software or put up with the flawed
performance and errors messages that always ensue with any new
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosak is very much aware of positions like Macrone's.
``Certainly, once you put a product out there, it's difficult to
replace it with the next generation,'' he said. If old browsers do
linger, Bosak predicts XML will live on the server and be
translated to HTML for users. Companies will continue to develop
middleware _ a layer of servers that knows XML and translates it to
HTML for the browsers. ``This model works, but severely limits what
we intended,'' Bosak said.
</P>
<P>
   Bray said he looks forward to a second generation of the Web
powered by XML. ``We are locking up a high proportion of our
intellectual capital in short-lived, inaccessible, proprietary
formats,'' he said. ``I can't open some of my old Microsoft Word
files. I can't go through my own writing for the last few years to
extract all the information on one topic.'' XML deals with this
problem. ``XML files will be fully documented and stable,'' Bray
said. ``They can be read and reused in 2028, and we won't have to
pay a tax to any software vendors for the right to use them.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few thunderstorms will develop ahead of a cold front moving
through New England, but most sections will only notice a couple of
showers. It will be very warm and humid in the Middle Atlantic
region with partial sunshine. Widely separated thundershowers are
likely as the cold front approaches late in the day. Less humid air
will push eastward from the Ohio Valley into the western
Appalachians, but clouds will persist over the northern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies and rather cool weather is expected over the Great
Lakes as high pressure builds across this area. Drier air will
circulate into the lower Ohio and middle Mississippi Valleys under
a mixture of sun and clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The South will be sultry with sunshine mixing with tall cumulus
clouds. The humidity will be uncomfortable and a few thunderstorms
are possible. Florida will notice several large thunderstorms as
sea breezes from the Atlantic and Gulf converge.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of hot and humid air streaming northward into the
Plains will encounter a disturbance in the jet stream over eastern
Nebraska. A cluster of intense thunderstorms may form in the
eastern Dakotas this morning. Another batch of storms will initiate
over eastern Kansas Thursday afternoon and grow into Oklahoma and
Arkansas by evening.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool air will make inroads to the Southwest. More showers
will dampen sections of California and a veil of clouds with some
rain will moisten the area from western Montana to central Nevada.
The deserts will stay warm and sunny, but much cooler air will
arrive Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Cape Cod Fog
</P>
<P>
   Dense fog shrouded Nantucket and Cape Cod early Wednesday. The
fog formed when warm, moist air from the south was blown or over
cool offshore waters. Fogs that form near bodies of water are
typically thicker, because of the large availability of moisture
for the myriad of tiny water drops that compose warm fogs. Fogs
that form near water also last longer because sunlight has more
difficulty penetrating thicjer fogs' outer edges. Moreover, water
under the fog does not warm fast, limiting currents of rising and
subsequently sinking air that might help to dissipate fog. &QL;

THE DUVEL MADE ME DO IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good Catholic boy that I am, I'd never advise anyone to consort
with the devil. On occasion, I've suggested that a few individuals
could pay him a visit _ that guy in the white Trans Am who cut me
off this morning comes to mind _ but I'd never recommend going over
to the dark side. Until now. And don't blame me for this sudden
conversion: It's all the Belgians' fault.
</P>
<P>
   You see, from this tiny, picture-pretty postcard of a country
comes a stunning variety of hearty brews that rival the wines of
the Belgians' French neighbors in complexity and style. Indeed,
many of Belgium's more substantial offerings come in sturdy
winelike bottles, capped with a cork and a wire cage.
</P>
<P>
   Duvel, Flemish for ``devil,'' is one such masterful brew. It
defies easy categorization: A top-fermented ale, it's pale like a
lager, probably thanks to the imported pale barley grown just north
of France's Champagne region. But the huge bouquet and enormous
head immediately put to rest any sense that this will be a treacly
batch of suds. The spicy Bohemian hops create a generous but
surprisingly subtle palate, whereas the long, yeasty finish gives a
final note of clarity with no cloying sweet aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Duvel is often served as an aperitif, but don't let
that limit your enjoyment of this fine beverage: I've found that it
works equally well as an accompaniment to spicy meats and heavy
cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Brewed since 1871 at Moortgat Brewery near Malines, Duvel is
unfiltered and unpasteurized, with a fine layer of yeast at the
bottom, but otherwise surprisingly clear. Try to pour gently, so
that the goo remains undisturbed. (If you see ``Duvel'' lettered in
green on the label, you've come across the inferior pasteurized
version _ always ask for Duvel in red).
</P>
<P>
   ``But Beer Nut,'' you cry, ``whither the name, Duvel?''
Supposedly, one of the brewers tasted the as-yet unnamed brew and
remarked, ``This is a devil of a beer.'' Sounds apocryphal: The
name probably has more to do with the devilishly difficult brewing
process _ two to three months of fermentation and maturation at
both ale (warm) and lager (cold) temps, then a final dose of yeast
in each bottle.
</P>
<P>
   So if you'll excuse me, I'm off to confession now. ``Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned. I cavorted with the devil three times in
the past week.''

STILL HOPING FOR DAD'S LOVE, EVEN IF YOU STRIKE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Remember this, Gil tells himself, knowing that he will not do
it again. Remember how it looks, with one inning to go, three outs,
to the win. Remember the people standing with their fingers hooked
through the metal fence, remember the milky blue of the stadium
paint and the similar color of the sky. . . . Remember your dry
mouth and constricted breath, the thump in your heart. Remember the
eerie silence. Remember the ache of being close.''
</P>
<P>
   So reads an important passage in Scott Lasser's affecting first
novel, ``Battle Creek,'' and while xou might doubt that a
middle-aged baseball manager would really talk to himself this way
(``Remember your dry mouth and constricted breath'') the passage
works in its context. You share Gil's breathless anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Gil is Gil Davison, manager of the Koch &AMP; Sons Dodgers, a
Detroit area amateur baseball team sponsored by a funeral home.
Beloved to fans for always getting to the finals of the national
elimination tournament at Battle Creek and for always losing, Gil's
teams are nevertheless of the highest quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other team has placed so many players in pro ball or has
had so many go all the way to the bigs,'' the narrative reports.
``Koch alumni have played in the World Series, are making big bucks
in Anaheim, Baltimore and Osaka. Last year one of the Battle Creek
papers called the team a dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Gil is determined to take his team all the way this
year, which he thinks may be his last. He will raise the bar of
competition even higher, harden his heart toward the mediocre
players on his roster. He will make his mind rule his heart when it
comes to yanking gutsy but tiring pitchers. He will face down all
obstacles that stand in the way of winning.
</P>
<P>
   These obstacles turn out to be legion. Ben Mercer, Gil's star
pitcher, has hurt his ankle climbing a fire escape in pursuit of a
woman he lusts after. The ankle interferes with his delivery, which
hurts his arm and forces him to fall back on illegally doctoring
the ball. Vince Paklos, Gil's old friend and coach, suffers from
severe emphysema, won't quit smoking and is literally counting the
days until his death. Luke James, Gil's young prodigy of a hitting
star, is having trouble adjusting to life after prison, where he
has done time for murdering a rival for his girlfriend's love.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the psychological barriers that Gil must
surmount. His 98-year-old father, who has always disapproved of
baseball, lies dying in a nearby hospital. Gil wants the suffering
to be over but also longs for recognition of his worth. At the same
time, Gil is torn by guilt over having driven his sons too hard.
One of them is dead of an accident for which Gil feels responsible.
The other is a lawyer in Chicago with little interest in baseball.
Have these stresses made Gil an object of Vince Lombardi's remark:
``Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing''? That is the
novel's epigraph.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may make ``Battle Creek'' sound like a cross
between a soap opera and a boys' sports adventure by John R. Tunis.
Yet the narrative is skillfully understated and elliptical. We get
to know the characters in their employment as stock brokers, United
Parcel Service deliverers and car manufacturing executives for whom
playing baseball is a release into a higher, more joyous calling.
Yet the games they play are described obliquely, with only the
relevant action set before the reader. Lasser, a Treasury bill
trader for Lehman Brothers who has published short stories in
literary reviews, sticks to the essentials of his story with little
wasted motion.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Battle Creek'' has a flaw, it is a slightly mechanical
emphasis on the theme of father love and its absence. As if Luke
James didn't have enough problems being an ex-convict haunted by
former inmates who have it in for him, he also suffers from Gil's
longing for paternal affection. ``Down the way the boy with droopy
pants got into his father's Cutlass. As they drove by, the boy
waved. James could see that the boy was drinking a Faygo red pop.
His father must have bought it for him. It occurred to James then _
in a startling, world-expandong way _ that other fathers loved
their sons whether they got hi4s or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But if such passages seem overly obvious, they contribute to the
novel's cumulative emotional power. The story's major developments
are stunning surprises.YIMU MMQ!Q5Y9QU11e!M  &QC; 5MQAI%

NEW JAGUAR LEAPS FORWARD  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, JUNE 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This was one of those perfect moments. I was soaring
along a back road in eastern Arizona, the shadows of tall pines
flashing across the car's hood and flickering on the brawny
shoulders of the Jaguar mascot leaping out in front.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving the new Jaguar S-Type sedan, quiet, refined and
substantial. Getting into the turns, the brakes prove to be strong,
the steering responsive, and handling incredible. The V-8 comes on
in a silky rush.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps best of all, I'm hot on the heels of a Jaguar XK-SS,
one of the most fabulous vintage sports cars. It's part of a
contingent of nine valuable, 1950s C- and D-type race cars and
XK-SS roadsters (derived from the D-types) taking part in an
Arizona car rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguar factory lent us a pair of new S-Type sedans, a
standard V-6 model and a sports-handling-tweaked V-8, for me and
the editor of ``British Car'' magazine to share as we tagged along
with the million-dollar hot rods.
</P>
<P>
   Among European car fanciers, particularly the Anglophilic ones,
the arrival of the 2000 Jaguar S-Type was a hotly anticipated event
ranking right up there with the release of ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar, flush with cash and access to a top-notch parts bin
after its acquisition by Ford, wanted to design a sedan to evoke
the style and heritage of its famous, sporting Mark II and S-type
sedans of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The British firm wanted to create a midsize car to compete with
the likes of BMW 5-series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. And Jaguar
wanted to build a four-door car that would excite enthusiasts while
providing a calm luxury environment for friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   In most ways, the new S-Type delivers. The front aspect of the
body design is instantly recognizable as an update of the '60s
sedans. From the side, the size and proportions seem just about
right. The rear treatment is less successful, the trunk seeming too
high and the styling too generic.
</P>
<P>
   One clinker: The ovoid grille is made of chrome-plated plastic
that looks and feels chintzy.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type is built on a platform developed with Lincoln for its
new LS sedan. Oddly, the Lincoln will be available with stick
shift, while the Jaguar won't, in opposition to Jag's sporting
heritage. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   The lower end of the engines _ block, crankshaft, rods and
pistons _ comes directly from Ford Duratec design, the better to
reduce development cost, but the heads, fuel induction and other
bits are Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much discussion as to whether the S-Type would
turn out to be more Jaguar or Lincoln. I find its British accent to
be strong enough, and I had no trouble thinking of it as pure
Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type's V-6 version has plenty of pull for all practical
purposes. Actually, it seems more akin to the old Mark II in sound
and performance than does the V-8.
</P>
<P>
   This test car was the standard setup, with 16-inch rims and
highway tires. Otherwise, it boasted just about every luxury-car
feature this side of Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   With the V-6 engine, stick shift would be very beneficial,
wringing out maximum power and control. Off the line, the V-6
accelerates quite leisurely until it gets up on the cam, and a
manual tranny with clutch would help a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed automatic can be downshifted and upshifted
manually in Jaguar's familiar ``J'' automatic-shifter pattern. As
automatics go, this is a superb unit, with upshifts that are nearly
imperceptible and a readiness to downshift at the drop of a
throttle.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 Jag is loaded with enough power to exceed the needs of
stick shift, though off-the-line torque is still rather tame with
this small-displacement engine. Passing power, and the power to
accelerate out of turns and up grades, is solid and impressive. The
engine roars swiftly up to its 6,800 rpm redline with an aggressive
snarl.
</P>
<P>
   With its nearly perfect 50-50 weight bias and well-engineered
geometry, the suspension is supple and allows the sedan to be
tossed into turns like a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 test car was loaded with all the options, including
17-inch wheels with performance tires, a GPS navigation system,
even a voice-recognition system for the climate and stereo
controls. There was also CATS, Jaguar's clever acronym for Computer
Active Technology Suspension, which adjusts the suspension
according to how hard the driver is pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, all this exotic gear popped the price up into exotic
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The interior in either version is gorgeous and comfortable.
After driving about 500 miles over two days, I felt relaxed and
refreshed.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin is hip deep in leather, maple trim and wool carpeting,
nicely designed in traditional British fashion, and loaded with
nooks and cubbies. The dashboard is well-organized and
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Although the BMW 5-series cars, especially the spectacular 540i,
and Mercedes' E-Class are the obvious targets, the Lexus GS300 and
GS400 are also in Jaguar's sights. These are all high-end sports
sedans that combine luxury with power and finesse, and the S-Type
easily joins their ranks. &QL;

   More than 20 years ago Stevie Wonder produced a hit album called
``Talking Book.'' It hardly talked, but it did keep a mean beat.
Now, Audible Inc., an online distributor of audio content in Wayne,
N.J., has turne$ the tables by producing a portable audio player
that doesn't keep a beat so well but is, for all practical
purposes, a talking book.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped like a large thumb and studded with recessed control
buttons, the Audible Mobile Player-Plus stores audio content on its
16 megabytes of internal flash memory, the high-tech equivalent of
books on tape. But the Mobile Player-Plus, which weighs 3.5 ounces
and is small enough to slip into a pocket, uses no tape.
</P>
<P>
   And much like the Diamond Rio audio player, it receives its
recorded material, mostly books and newspapers, by way of a
personal computer. Unlike the Rio player, notes Jonathan Korzen, a
company spokesman, the Mobile Player-Plus does not use the MP3
format to store its material, but uses its own much-compressed
format that, unlike MP3, protects downloaded material from
unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mobile player, which is sold only directly from
Audible's Web site (www.audible.com) for $299, is not made to be a
music player. It is intended for mobile professionals who spend a
lot of time traveling and feel they don't get enough time to read
as much as they want to or need to, Korzen said. The Mobile player
can also load more than seven hours of audio material and can even
be played through conventional cassette players and FM radio
receivers.

   More Than Just a Fashion Statement
</P>
<P>
   Now you see it, now no one else does.
</P>
<P>
   That is the killer application that lies just beneath the
filters of the new FT15 Exclusive View flat-panel computer monitor.
At first, the 14.5-inch LCD display by Sceptre Technologies in City
of Industry, Calif., looks very much like a slew of other
flat-panel monitors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something that gives this monitor high geek appeal.
Unless users are wearing a pair of special polarized eyeglasses,
the Exclusive View screen appears blank no matter what is typed or
however a mouse is clicked. With the glasses, users can work,
browse and play in relative privacy and security.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,199 monitor is being aimed at groups for which ``it is
vital to keep trade secrets and other valuable information
secure,'' according to a company description. Primary users may be
found in government offices, law offices and banks, or among
hurried corporate travelers, said Li Ding, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The new monitors can be ordered only from the company's site at
www.sceptre.com and as complete packages or as an optional package
added to a standard flat screen made by the company.
</P>
<P>
   If someone else happens to have polarized glasses, however, the
screen will give up its secrets. But Ms. Ding said that was not
very likely.

   `Going Out Shopping' Takes On a New Meaning
</P>
<P>
   Tired of trudging around the Web trying to find the best price
on something? Power shopping just got easier, and you don't even
have to be in front of your computer anymore. If you have a Palm
VII, you might just be able to save money and mouse clicks from
wherever you are with Pocket Shopper, the new My Simon application
for 3Com's latest edition of its popular personal digital
assistant. My Simon is an e-commerce hub that specializes in online
comparison shopping with a constantly updated database of 10
million products from 1,300 merchants. The Pocket Shopper program
can be downloaded from www.mysimon.com or www.palm.net.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII, released last month, allows users to easily
connect to the Internet through wireless communications technology.
By firing up their Palm VIIs and remotely tapping into the online
database, users can have the Pocket Shopper instantly compare costs
and product availability on things like consumer electronics,
books, compact disks and golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Although not as extensive as its parent My Simon's list, the
Pocket Shopper patrols more than 15 product categories containing 5
million items from 500 different stores, with more added each
month. Future plans for the program include allowing users to
receive more detailed information about stores and merchandise, as
well as the ability to actually purchase the things found via the
Palm VII.

   Fish That Won't Take the Bait
</P>
<P>
   Engineers in Japan appear to be getting into the robot business
these days: First, Sony announced the arrival of Aibo, the robotic
dog. Now Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is developing robotic fish.
</P>
<P>
   You might expect a robotic dog to fetch your slippers and
perform tricks. But the problem with robotic fish is they just
don't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mitsubishi has developed robotic fish that may have
several applications. One of the company's creations, swimming
around in a museum's fish tank in Yokohama, is a glassy-eyed sea
bream, about two feet long, that moves by wiggling its tail fin and
two pectoral fins. Battery-powered motors hidden within the fins
are remotely controlled by a desktop computer. The battery is
recharged automatically by a coil inside the fish that draws power
from an electromagnetic field that permeates the fish tank,
according to a report by New Scientist Magazine. Mitsubishi is
hoping to use the same technology to propel underwater vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's success with the sea bream has also led it to
consider building more robotic fish for exhibits, possibly replicas
of rare species like the coelacanth, an ancient fish with jointed
bones that was once thought to be extinct.

   A Printer With Pink Accents Lends a Barbie Touch
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that little girls would accessorize their Barbie
dolls with Barbie clothes, Barbie shoes or, if their parents
couldn't say no, Barbie's Dreamhouse. Now 7-year-olds with parents
who can't say no will have the chance to accessorize their
computers with Barbie peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, which introduced the very popular Barbie digital camera
last year, and Apollo Consumer Products will soon be selling a $79
Barbie color printer in ``mist gray'' with ``glitter pink
accents.'' It also comes with Barbie stickers and the Barbie Magic
Hair Styler CD-ROM, one of Mattel's most popular pieces of
software. ``Every little girl that walks into the store and sees it
on a shelf will fall in love with it,'' said Mohan Garde, the
general manager for Apollo, a subsidiary of Hewlett Packard. His
own 7-year-old daughter, Garde said, keeps asking when he is going
to bring the printer home.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo (www.myapollo.com) was created in January to create and
market stylish, low-priced printers. The Barbie printer, Garde
said, is just one example of what he calls ``the next step in PCs
and printers as they transition from the technology market to the
appliance market,'' where color and style become major selling
points.
</P>
<P>
   Is a GI Joe printer next, maybe in camouflage colors or fatigue
gray? ``We don't want to play our hand yet,'' Garde said. But
creating something for the market for boys ages 7 to 12, he said,
is in the works.

   Dog in the Windows
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Sony has found an untapped market for robotic
dogs. Within 20 minutes of opening online sales on Tuesday, the
company sold out its 3,000 units of Aibo, a programmable pup, on
the Japanese market. Sales of the robot in the United States
weren't quite as brisk _ about 1,000 of 2,000 robots on the market
were sold by the end of the day. But Tod Freeman, a spokesman for
Sony, said that demand was high. ``For the first two and a half
hours, our server was so overloaded it was inaccessible,'' Freeman
said. Aibo, which is selling for $2,500, can be purchased only
online.

   Next, the Juggling Gene
</P>
<P>
   You sent an e-mail note to Koko the gorilla two weeks ago, but
she has been ``too busy'' to respond? She may have a good excuse.
Scientists believe they have located the part of the brain
responsible for the kind of multitasking called branching.
Branching involves temporarily shifting focus from one task to
others, then returning to the main task, a crucial skill in the era
of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue of Nature, scientists from the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes in Bethesda, Md.,
reported that branching activated the region of the brain called
the fronto-polar prefrontal cortex, which also controls complex
problem solving. Sadly for the other primates, the multitasking
part of the brain is well developed only in humans.

BEWARE OF LIBRARIANS BEARING HERMIT CRABS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release June 10)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know how it happened, really.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, I was a library volunteer at my son's elementary
school, helping move books into the gymnasium so the media center's
walls could be repainted, and the next, I was the HERMIT CRAB
SITTER for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   These things always start out with some offhand comment.
</P>
<P>
   As I siphoned water out of the fish aquarium so it could be
moved to the arts center, I remarked to the librarian that my son
wanted an aquarium, but I told him that having three dogs, three
cats and a cockatiel was more than enough animals for one
household.
</P>
<P>
   Being a skilled communicator, she hardly blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, fish,'' she said, pretending to be my ally. ``They
can be hard to care for.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, by nature, librarians are not manipulative schemers.
</P>
<P>
   The ones I know tend to be orderly, friendly, a bit daffy along
the lines of Mrs. Frizzle (who drives the Magic School Bus.) And
some are overly attached to the Dewey Decimal System.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when pressed, they can be downright Machiavellian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish can indeed be a problem. But you know what's no problem
at ALL, what would be GREAT for your son to have in his room _ why,
I bet he would just love one _ is a hermit crab. Quiet, clean, they
only need to be fed about once a week. It's the ideal pet,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   I kept siphoning and nodding, still thinking we were just
whiling away the afternoon with some idle chatter. ``Sure, hermit
crabs, that's a thought. I'll have to look into it,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's good sometimes to try out a pet, you know,
before you actually buy it. Keep one for a few days, or even
months, while you see how it fits in to your family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I looked up, getting my first inkling that this conversation was
going somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take these hermit crabs right here,'' she said, pointing to
another aquarium in the opposite corner of the media center.
``These little guys are so popular with the children.''
</P>
<P>
   I blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they really need a home for the summer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the cage, which appeared to be full of completely
harmless sea shells and a piece of driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's their pellets of food. You just fill it up right here,
and put water in this. That's all there is to it,'' she said. ``If
they die, don't worry about it. Can I help you carry it to your
car?''
</P>
<P>
   And, so, the aquarium is sitting on a shelf in my son's room,
out of direct sunlight. I fill the water dish each evening, and try
to keep my 2-year-old away from the timid creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There are three of the little guys, tucked into their separate
shells, and after careful observation, my son and I have gotten to
know which one likes to scoot around in the evening, which one
climbs the most, and which one likes to curl up and sleep in a
favorite corner most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, we're going on vacation for a week. So I
called a friend who has a son about Adam's age, just to see how
things were going.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' I said, about midway through the conversation.
``Have you ever though about a hermit crab as a pet? It's always a
good idea to kind of have a trial run, you know, before buying one
...''

AIR DROPS OF RELIEF SUPPLIES FORCE NATO TO REDUCE OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia will be
temporarily suspended over parts of Kosovo beginning Thursday to
permit daily air drops of humanitarian relief to besieged refugees,
military officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first major reduction in bombing in Kosovo during the 71-day
allied air campaign comes as NATO war planes have halted bombing of
the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to avoid disrupting diplomatic
efforts by European envoys meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic there.
</P>
<P>
   Two Russian-built Antonov-26 cargo planes chartered by the
International Rescue Committee and flown by crews from the former
Soviet republic of Moldova will make daily humanitarian flights
over Kosovo to drop enough pre-packaged humanitarian meals to feed
about 8,000 refugees each day.
</P>
<P>
   The two planes will be over Kosovo for about two hours each day,
as part of the four-hour round trip from nearby Pescara, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, the Pentagon's head of
strategic planning, said Wednesday that the U.S.-led air campaign
will coordinate with the pilots of the supply planes.
</P>
<P>
   The relief pilots are advising NATO's Combined Air Operations
Center ``what time they'll be flying, where they're going to be
flying (and) what altitudes they'll be at,'' Wald said. The
humanitarian flights are being incorporated into NATO's daily ``air
tasking order''_ the minute-to-minute schedule of allied
combat-related flights that details the time and location of every
allied aircraft staging bombing runs and support missions.
</P>
<P>
   This will enable the allies' Airborne Warning and Control System
aircraft (AWACS) to track the relief flights and direct combat
operations away from the humanitarian operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American Army four-star general
commanding the forces of the 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, said NATO war planes will allow civilian aircraft to
drop food supplies to ethnic Albanian Muslim refugees clustered in
various parts of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to fly into the airspace at a time when we are
going to be sure we don't do anything to put them in jeopardy,''
Clark said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Smith, the International Rescue Committee's vice
president for overseas programs, said the supply planes will use
10-mile wide flight corridors over Kosovo each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO will allow us to use a corridor over Kosovo and they have
said that they will stay out of that corridor for the time that we
are in it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots will vary their use of the designated corridors. Because
Kosovo is only about 100 miles wide, setting aside 10-mile wide
flight corridors will force NATO to temporarily suspend combat
operations over wide swathes of the province.
</P>
<P>
   To tighten coordination, NATO is allocating the two humanitarian
flights a radio monitoring frequency to listen in on certain NATO
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said pilots of the civilian aircraft spied Yugoslav
anti-aircraft fire Wednesday when they dropped leaflets to alert
Kosovo refuges that airdrops would begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The air crews ``reported they did see some AAA (anti-aircraft
artillery) fired in their vicinity,'' Wald said. ``Whether it was
at them or not, we're not sure. But we assume it may have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Wald said the pilots were ``brave to take the risk'' to deliver
relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has resisted assigning slow-moving, low-flying
C-130 Hercules cargo planes to air dropping food to Kosovo refugees
because of the risk of Serbian anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes have carried out an average of 850 individual
flights or sorties over Yugoslavia during each 24-hour period. The
armada of 720 American aircraft and 325 allied aircraft has
conducted more than 31,000 sorties since the bombing campaign began
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The cutback in NATO combat operations over Kosovo gets underway
as an envoy from the 15-nation European Union, Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari, accompanied Russia's Balkan envoy, former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, to meet with Milosevic. The envoys
met with Milosevic for two hours on Wednesday.

   The United States and Russia have been at odds over the
structure of the planned post-war international security force
destined to enter Kosovo to provide security and encourage more
than 1.4 million displaced Kosovars to return to their homes in the
wake of a 13-month crackdown by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists that the multi-national force have
NATO troops ``at the core'' with a unified command structure
supervising all military operations across Kosovo, including
operations by cooperating Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has suggested a divided force for Kosovo, with Russian
troops patrolling Serb-dominated areas adjacent to Serbia and NATO
troops patrolling southern Kosovo. Russia has long standing ethnic
and religious ties with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the European and
Russian diplomats had reached ``sufficient agreement'' on the
composition and structure of the post-war security force to present
a united front to Milosevic.

   President Clinton, addressing graduating cadets at the U.S. Air
Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., announced that the United
States will provide up to 7,000 of the 47,868 soldiers being
mustered by 30 nation to serve in the security force.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 percent U.S. share is substantially less than then 50
percent U.S. share of the 60,000-strong allied force that went into
Bosnia in 1995 to enforce a U.S.-brokered peace agreement ending
ethnic fighting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear choice before the Serbian leader,'' Clinton
declared. ``He can cut his losses now and accept the basic
requirements of a just peace, or he can continue to force military
failure and economic ruin on his people. In the end, the outcome
will be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on
Thursday to review allied military operations, including the
possibility of pouring allied forces into Yugoslavia for a ground
war.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen told reporters that the
nation's top six military officers will review all facets of the
military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm that there will be a full range of discussions, questions
about whether or not there would be any kind of a ground option for
a non-permissive environment,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have ``a consensus for a strong air operation,''
Cohen said, adding: ``There is not a consensus for a ground
operation.''

TAXPAYER GROUP SUES CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A taxpayer group is suing Gov. Gray Davis
to stop secret negotiations over the fate of Proposition 187, the
1994 ballot initiative designed to cut off government services to
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Davis caused a panic among supporters of both sides of the
Proposition 187 debate by sending a lawsuit on the ballot measure
to the 9th Circuit Mediation Office in San Francisco. The federal
court-run office works in secret to settle civil and criminal
lawsuits, but has never handled a ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which did not take a
position on the measure, sued Tuesday arguing that Davis' decision
to jettison the normal legal process runs against nearly 200 years
of law.
</P>
<P>
   The association contends that the U.S. system of judicial review
requires the public courts to decide the fate of Proposition 187,
which was approved by nearly 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants Davis to cancel the secret negotiations, which
are set to begin within a month, and move the debate over
Proposition 187 back into the open courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that this is a public process,'' said Kris
Vosburgh, executive director of the association. ``This was put on
the ballot by the people, it was voted on by the people, and it
should be decided in public, by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also is distressed about just who will be involved in
secret discussions over the initiative, which has not been
implemented because of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit pits opponents to Proposition 187, namely the
League of United Latin American Citizens, against the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is continuing a defense of the initiative that started
under former Gov. Pete Wilson, arguing that he must respect the
will of voters who approved the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis, a Democrat, also worked strenuously against
Proposition 187 when it was on the ballot. And Davis said two weeks
ago he would not implement at least one portion of the measure _ a
provision that requires the state to remove illegal immigrant
children from the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' decision to send Proposition 187 to mediation opens up
the possibility of even more lawsuits down the road. The Pacific
Legal Foundation, which opposes the measure, has already complained
that no supporter of Proposition 187 would be at the mediation
conference.
</P>
<P>
   If it was dissatisfied after the mediation, then the Pacific
Legal Foundation could continue its lawsuit. The whole process
would be back in the public courts again, probably headed to the
U.S. Supreme Court for a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned that all the participants in the
governor's mediation process are opponents to the measure,'' said
Sharon Browne, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Davis said mediation was chosen because
litigation over Proposition 187 appeared to be on an endless path.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been debated, discussed, deliberated to death for the
last five years,'' spokesman Michael Bustamante said. ``It is time
to end this, to resolve this once and for all.''

   ULTIMATE WATER BLASTER
</P>
<P>
   After last summer's awesome Torpedo, what can possibly make a
splash as the coolest water toy of 1999? Wild Planet's Paddle
Pumper will be a front-runner _ if you can find one. Many stores
already are sold out. The Pumper is a durable water blaster that
shoots a stream of water more than 20 feet and also can be used as
a paddle. Its great pump design makes it easy for small hands to
use. The Paddle Pumper comes packaged with an inflatable seat
called the Bumper Jumper and sells for under $20.
</P>
<P>
   Rites of Summer
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day weekend has started off summer. Time to hit the
lake, water park or pool. To carry all your stuff, grab a bag. This
season's bags come in a variety of fun styles, from homespun
macrame to shiny patent. Anything goes. Just don't forget the
sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Fashions
</P>
<P>
   Comfy terry cloth spins itself into fashion for another summer,
turning up in tank tops, shirts, dresses, headbands and even
sandals. A rainbow of colors spans from baby blue to sunshine
yellow. Airwalk's new Eva features a terry cloth-like texture in
the foot bed and straps for major comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Blown away
</P>
<P>
   Summer is bubble season. Blowers abound to create everything
from mammoth to teeny bubbles and every size in between. To create
your own bubble solution, follow this recipe from Camp Earth,
guaranteed to deliver the best bubbles ever. In a jug, gently mix:
1 cup Dawn liquid dish soap, 1 cup light Karo syrup, 4 to 5 cups
distilled water. Allow to sit for seven days at room temperature
before using.

   An endearing new book for teen-agers and their parents, ``Always
Accept Me for Who I Am'' (Three Rivers Press, $8) talks honestly
about support, communication, trust, acceptance, love and family.
</P>
<P>
   With viewpoints from 147 teen-agers, the book is compiled by
author J.S. Salt, author of ``Always Kiss Me Goodnight.'' It allows
youths, ages 13 to 18, to speak their minds and let their parents
know what's really important to them. Here are some of viewpoints
from the book:
</P>
<P>
   Support: ``Be open to new ideas ... If you're wrong, admit.'' _
Max, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Communication: ``Always listen to me, no matter how busy you
are. Having an open ear tells me you have an open heart.'' _
Jessica, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Trust and acceptance: ``Stop telling me what not to do and I
won't have to rebel. If you deprive me of my freedom, you will be
the one locked in the dungeon!'' _ Yvonne, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Love and family: ``Everyone has goodness inside of them. It just
takes another person to spark it. Sort of like a chain reaction. So
let me into your world and show you that I can do it.''_ Sean, 17.

ADVICE ABOUT FRIENDS, STEALING

<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I just stared middle school. In elementary, I
was a straight-A student. I played soccer and other sports. Now
that I am in middle school, I have lost some of my interest in
sports and my grades have fallen. My friends don't participate in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   My parents think I should still play sports and keep up my
grades. I have interests in other things, like guys, parties,
shopping and school activities. I make B's and C's. I'm passing all
my classes except one. I just want to do other things now that I
have other friends. How do I tell my p: It sounds like your
priorities have changed. When you are in elementary school, you
have the same friends and activities that you developed with your
family. When you change schools and meet new friends, your
interests change _ but your goals in life should not.
</P>
<P>
   If sports is important to you bch person is designed
differently, with different interests. You can play sports and do
your homework and get together on weekends to shop or have parties.
Success in sports and grades can open many opportunities for the
future. Don't drop the ball and forfeit the game.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I run around with a group of guys that I have
known since elementary school. We live in the same neighborhood and
go to the samchool. Last weekend, we went to a party and had a few
drinks. After we left the party, my friend decided to stop at a
store. When he came out, he told us he had stolen some stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted him to go back and return the stolen items. The other
guys in the car thought we should all go in and steal stuff. I have
known these people for years. I never thought they'd steal
anything. I didn't take anything, and they gave me a real hard
time. How do I remain friends with them but let them know that
someday they're gonna get caught? _ Stealing.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Stealing: Good choice. Your friends might have gotten away
with it this time, but next time they run the risk of getting
caught. The small items stolen hardly add up to the value of
getting caught. You set a good example for your old friends in
showing that you have values and don't intend to join them. If your
friends continue to steal, find new friends. Don't go down the
river with 'em.

   SUPER SMASH BROS. (Nintendo for Nintendo 64, all ages)
</P>
<P>
   Description: Super Smash Bros. is a fun, action-packed game in
which your favorite Nintendo characters duke it out with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   High points: The creativity and the originality of the music,
levels and moves are good role models for Nintendo 64 game-makers.
Instead of one hero, there are 12. Eight are original Nintendo
characters: Mario, Donkey Kong, Yoshi, Kerby, Fox, Link, Samus and
Pikachu. The four other characters are bonus round prizes, such as
Jiggly Puff from Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   Low points: After a while, you get sick of doing the same old
thing over, over and over! Even though the moves of the eight
original characters are included in the instructions, when in
action, they're difficult to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: For an overall rating, I give this a B. It was really
fun at first, but after a while, it got boring.

   For Ricardo Khan, the road to a Tony Award began with a matinee
performance of ``Hello, Dolly!'' in 1967. Khan, then a gawky
16-year-old theater buff, still remembers the awe he felt as the
curtain went up in the St. James Theater to reveal Cab Calloway and
Pearl Bailey in roles that had been radically recast by the
producer, David Merrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't inspired because it was on Broadway,'' Khan said,
``but because it was an all-black cast. It was a cast,'' he said
with a pause, ``that looked like  &UR; me. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, using a $225,000 federal jobs grant, Khan
established the Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick, N.J.,
and began making theater by, for and about black Americans. It is a
mission that, Khan admits, has had its share of financial pitfalls
and has had him spending more than a few afternoons sweeping
floors, tiling bathrooms and ``wondering why I got into this.''
</P>
<P>
   But any doubts were swept away this past season.
</P>
<P>
   On April 26, the company celebrated its Broadway debut when ``It
Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' a joint production with two other
nonprofit theaters, was picked up by a consortium of commercial
producers and reopened at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   A week later Crossroads learned that it had won one of theater's
highest honors: the Tony for outstanding regional theater. On top
of that, ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' received four Tony
nominations, including one for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   The Crossroads story is one of individual and institutional
persistence. Inspired by the black theater scene of the 1960s, the
company survived cutbacks in federal financing by forging
relationships with New Jersey businesses and New Brunswick
officials who used the arts as a cornerstone for urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its success has been bittersweet: the theater's growth
and prominence on a national stage coincides with a period of
crisis for many other black theaters, a point brought home during
the highly publicized debate in 1997 between playwright August
Wilson and artistic director Robert Brustein on issues of race and
cultural power.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Crossroads does not mean that black theater is in
the full bloom of health, though there are promising signs.
Crossroads is the first company devoted to works by black Americans
to win the Tony for regional theater since the award's creation in
1976. And it is one of only two black theater companies that belong
to the League of Resident Theaters, an association of 70 leading
nonprofit theaters; the Freedom Theater in Philadelphia, joined the
league this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are about 50 full-time black theater
companies, said Woodie King Jr., who founded the New York-based New
Federal Theater, one of the country's oldest black troupes. He said
that major black companies include the New Federal, the Freedom
Theater, the National Black Theater in Harlem, the St. Louis Black
Repertory, the ETA Creative Arts Foundation in Chicago, Jomandi in
Atlanta, the Ensemble Theater Company in Houston, and the Penumbra
Theater in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But as King points out, today's ranks bear little resemblance to
those that emerged in the wake of the civil rights movement. ``In
the late 1960s,'' he said, ``there were 45 black theaters in New
York alone.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the vibrant scene Khan leaped into when he founded
Crossroads. ``The Negro Ensemble Company was strong, the New
Federal was strong, the National Black Theater was strong,'' Khan
said. ``These were role models.'' The son of a Trinidadian doctor
and an American nurse, Khan attended Rutgers University in New
Brunswick, studying law but falling in love with theater. After
graduating, Khan and Lee Richardson, a classmate, set up a 60-seat
theater in an abandoned warehouse on an access road at the city's
edge.
</P>
<P>
   They used seed money from an unlikely source, the Comprehensive
Employment and Training Act, a federal jobs program. Not that there
wasn't ample labor involved. At first, Khan acted, directed and
cleaned the floors, a regimen that finally dulled his passion for
being onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided the acting could be done a lot better by someone not
thinking about whether the bathroom was leaking or why there
weren't people in the seats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Khan became an astute player as a director and producer,
raising money and connecting with local government leaders, talents
that served his company well when federal funds dried up in the
1980s. Richardson left the company in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   While many black theaters, including the acclaimed Negro
Ensemble, failed or lost steam, Crossroads grew into an institution
with a budget of more than $3 million. It has reduced its debt to
$600,000 from $1.7 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The company resides in a handsome 320-seat theater in the heart
of New Brunswick built in 1991 for $4 million by a partnership of
local government and private benefactors. About 65 percent of the
company's audience is African-American, Khan said, a substantial
increase since the theater's early days. The artistic roster is
also integrated; for example, works by the playwrights Romulus
Linney, who is white, and Migdalia Cruz, who is Puerto Rican, were
presented in the theater's new play series in March.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers prepare food and greet audience members nightly.
Kente cloth and African artifacts decorate the walls and music
fills the lobby. High-profile fans include Bill Cosby and Gen.
Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being outside a major media center has been to their benefit
because they haven't had to fight for attention,'' King said. ``And
being in a city where Johnson &AMP; Johnson is based doesn't hurt
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossroads gets support from Johnson &AMP; Johnson and other
pharmaceutical companies in New Jersey. Schering-Plough Corp. in
Madison, sponsored the theater's annual new play festival this
year. Other major corporate supporters include the AT&AMP;T Foundation
and Absolut Vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, the theater has grown artistically, too,
attracting young talents like George C. Wolfe, who developed ``The
Colored Museum'' at Crossroads in 1986. Three years later, Wolfe
returned to work on ``Spunk.''

   Title: ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Jake Lloyd, Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Liam
Neeson, Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Why go see it?: This is probably the most anticipated movie
ever. Sadly though, the movie would only be ``OK'' except for the
fact that it is a ``Star Wars'' movie. The plot wasn't all that
great, but the special effects were phenomenal. The light saber
battles were awesome and I seriously recommend you see this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for rating: PG for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1 - 10 score: 8.
</P>
<P>
   STAR FACT
</P>
<P>
   On opening day, the film grossed $28.5 million at 2,970 U.S.
theaters, a single-day record. That knocked to second place the
$26.1 million set by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in 1997.

 UNDATED: on ``Spunk.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I required a lot as an artist,'' Wolfe said, ``and
they provided it.''
</P>
<P>
   Productions in recent years have included new plays by Wilson
(``Jitney'') and Ruby Dee (``The Disappearance'').
</P>
<P>
   The company's breakthrough production came in 1989, when it
presented the world premiere of ``Sheila's Day,'' performed by a
collaboration of South African and American actresses. The play,
about the parallel journeys of a black woman in South Africa and a
black woman in the American South, traveled to Washington, the
Brooklyn Academy of Music and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheila's Day'' piqued the interest of many theater
professionals, said Chris Jones, chairman of the regional theater
committee for the Tony Awards. ``That's when people began noticing
and talking about Crossroads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His committee was also impressed by the company's ``specificity
of mission,'' he said, as well as its programs, like internships
that enroll students from traditionally black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   While the overt political meaning of ``Sheila's Day'' earned the
theater some acclaim, it was nothing compared with the publicity
generated by a fervent debate over its general role in black
theater.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1996 during a national theater conference in
Princeton, N.J., where Wilson pointed out in a keynote address that
Crossroads was then the only black theater company in the League of
Resident Theaters. This, Wilson said, reflected a lack of support
for professional African-American theaters, and he argued that what
African-American artists needed most was not roles in plays
produced by predominantly white theater companies, but theater
companies and stages of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things Wilson said are things people wanted to say for
 &UR; so &LR;  long,'' Khan said. ``And people roared with enthusiasm because
he said it. They might not agree with all of it, but at least he
said it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some believed that Wilson's message smacked of separatism.
The most prominent critic was Brustein of the American Repertory
Theater in Boston. The debate culminated in a sold-out discussion
between the men at Town Hall in Manhattan, an event that many felt
clarified little.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Khan is typically sanguine: ``It was wild, it was
glorious. But it's not like we'd been thrust into the middle of
something. We were already in it. It's just someone pointed a light
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   For black theater artists, Crossroads' status as a national
player was established long before the Brustein-Wilson debate.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Taylor, the creator of ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,''
said that without Crossroads, the show could have easily died two
years ago. After three years of sporadic touring of high schools,
small town auditoriums and regional theaters, ``Blues'' had lost
its main financial backer, the Denver Theater Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on the telephone and started calling,'' Taylor said. One
of the people he called was Khan, whom he had never met, but knew
by reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick said, `I love this show,''' Taylor recalled, adding that
Khan hadn't actually seen it yet. ``He said, `If you can get it to
the East Coast, I think we can get it to New York.'''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the artistic directors of the Alabama Shakespeare
Festival and the San Diego Repertory Company, Khan helped arrange a
tour, with a three-week run at the New Victory Theater in Manhattan
in March. The New Victory sold out.
</P>
<P>
   One important factor leading to the Broadway run was Khan's long
friendship with Eric Krebs, a commercial producer who lives near
Crossroads and has been a longtime supporter. Krebs assembled a
group of other investors to move the show from the New Victory to
the Beaumont, where sales have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Khan said he had no intention or time to rest on his
laurels. He has a three-year plan to eliminate the theater's debt,
a mission he hopes the regional theater Tony will help. Khan would
also like to build an endowment for the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, too, Crossroads is looking to expand. Nurturing
new theater about African-American life continues to be the goal;
what that means, however, is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our existence is not defined anymore by what it is to be black
in America, but to be black in the world,'' Khan said. ``You spend
a lot of time on black and white and it starts to restrict you.
Black people are redefining who we are. Theater can do that, too.''

 &HT;    SHADOW OF BIG GOVERNMENT STILL HOVERS, AUTHOR SAYS
 &HT;    430&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's now famous declaration that the
``era of big government is over'' is part of myth fostered by
presidents and lawmakers to hide the true size of the federal
bureaucracy, according to a new book.
</P>
<P>
   Critiquing the six-year effort to downsize government, author
Paul C. Light of the Brookings Institution writes that the
president gave only part of the picture when he announced three
years ago that the federal work force, at 1.9 million civilians,
was the smallest since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   That claim is part of a ``head count charade'' in the ``politics
of smallness,'' which is aimed at giving the illusion of a leaner
government, Light writes. He points to evidence that many agencies
have replaced permanent workers with contractors, largely because
they are not included in the official count.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the emphasis on payroll reduction has produced
``random cuts'' that make government less efficient, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The True Size of Government,'' Light says that the
reduced civilian work force Clinton touted _ now at a level of 1.84
million _ was only a small portion of employees who depend on Uncle
Sam for their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Adding up what he terms the ``shadow of government,'' the author
calculates the actual total at nearly 17 million fulltime workers.
That includes 5.6 million hired through federal contracts, 4.6
million in state or local jobs that are federally mandated, 2.4
million paid through federal grants, plus 1.5 million uniformed
military and 850,000 postal service workers.
</P>
<P>
   Light argues that the six-year push to downsize, overseen by
Vice President Al Gore, has produced some efficiencies, especially
in purchasing. Moreover, he said it is logical for the government
to hire private contractors to do some work, such as in the space
program and in weapons manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But over all, the pressure to hide the true reach of government
has led to a ``staggering'' lack of information that distorts
efforts to make reforms, according to the author, a longtime
authority on the federal bureaucracy. ``The state of the federal
work force in 1999 is anyone's guess, which is precisely not how to
run a government that works better, let alone one that costs
less.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that both parties contribute to obscuring the truth.
``The fact is that the illusion of smallness benefits both branches
and both parties,'' he writes. ``Democrats and Republicans alike
understand the conceit. They know the true size of government is
not to be found in head counts, but they also appear to believe
that the American public just cannot be trusted with the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the effort has borne fruit, especially for
Clinton, who blunted traditional Republican attacks on waste in
federal spending by reducing the federal payroll, even though
almost all of the reductions came from the military.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Clinton claim of having the smallest government in
three decades was partly an illusion, says Light, who points out
that only the Defense Department was bigger in 1960. Non-defense
civilian workers have increased by 53 percent since 1960, he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the president successfully employed his
small-government theme, Light says. He cited campaign remarks
Clinton made in 1996 in Atlanta when he referred to ``how bad big
old federal government was, but it's our administration working
with our allies in Congress (that) has cut the size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton had made bureaucracy lovable again by attacking it,
disparaging it, and ultimately, cutting it,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will almost certainly adopt the same theme in the 2000
presidential campaign, Light predicted, adding that Republicans
will probably counter that with promises to make even more cutbacks
in the federal payroll.

AT AUCTION OF ELVIS MEMORABILIA, EVERYTHING BUT THE BLUE SUEDE
SHOES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For sale: One pair of used Army fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   Former owner: Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Also available: Ivory-colored wool cape with depiction of
American eagle and rhinestones, vintage yellow Cadillac station
wagon with wood-grain side panels, music publishing contract for
``Heartbreak Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   These and 2,000 more of the king's most treasured possessions _
among them clothes, furniture and letters from Marilyn Monroe,
Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and President John F. Kennedy _ are to
go on the auction block in October in Las Vegas, Nev., in a sale of
memorabilia from the archives of Elvis' Graceland compound. None of
the items have been displayed at Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, to be held over three or four days at the MGM Grand
by Guernsey's, the Manhattan auction house, is to raise money for
housing in Memphis for homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   Any additional money is to be used to expand exhibition space at
Graceland, officials there said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the keepers of Graceland have turned cape-phobic,
they said. Rather, with a large number of holdings, they say, it is
time to groom their portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were certain priceless things that you can't line up in
endless hallways and frame,'' said Jack Soden, president and chief
executive of Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believe they're going to sit in a dark room for another
50 or 100 years and we can share them with the world so a homeless
family that was sleeping under a bridge can be part of a village,
we should do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of small homes to be called Presley Place will be
provided for families until they find permanent housing. The
building cost is projected at $1.2 million to $1.5 million, and it
is to be operated by the Metropolitan Interfaith Association in
Memphis, which will also provide counseling and job training for up
to a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Presley lived with his parents for several years
in a federally sponsored Memphis housing project.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the items being auctioned are documents like record,
movie and performance contracts and letters. There will also be
such memorabilia as the saddle used on Rising Sun, one of Presley's
horses; personal 16-millimeter copies of some of his movies, and
artwork for his album covers.
</P>
<P>
   The items were selected by more than a dozen people from
Guernsey's and Graceland and others knowledgeable about popular
culture and Presley.
</P>
<P>
   The lots will be available for preview at the MGM Grand
beginning on Sept. 28. The expected auction dates are Oct. 8 to 10,
with a possible extension to Oct. 11. Buyers can bid online at
icollector.com or watch the auction live on the Internet at
Earthcam.com, said Ron Berkowitz, a spokesman for the auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are important documents, the likes of which have never
been offered before,'' said Arlan Ettinger, Guernsey's owner.
</P>
<P>
   The auction house sold Mark McGwire's 70th home run baseball in
January for a shade over $3 million. Last year it auctioned over
600 items from the Kennedy White House.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas was chosen for the auction because of Elvis'
identification with the city, Ettinger said. No minimum or upset
price has been set for the items, he said, adding that he expected
lot prices to range from ``extremely affordable'' to six figures.
The auction house says it is expecting buyers from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guralnick, the author of an acclaimed two-volume Presley
biography, said the intense interest reflected the singer's
longtime loyalty to his fans as well as enthusiasm for his music
and what Presley represents historically and culturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents the triumph of American vernacular culture,''
Guralnick said.

   NEW YORK _ When the stressed-out Manhattan mother in ``Infancy''
started reciting the alphabet, the multiplication tables and the
boroughs of New York to her infant son, all I could think of was
Diane Keaton's showing flash cards to her toddler in ``Baby Boom''
_ and of lots of competitive 1990s parents in real life. But this
play is set in Central Park in the 1920s, and the idea seemed to be
to calm the baby rather than prepare him early for the SATs.
</P>
<P>
   When Capt. Lemuel Gulliver landed on a remote island in
``Youth'' and learned that no one there was older than 29 because
citizens are put out to sea to die on their 30th birthdays, images
of Michael York and Jenny Agutter, young and doomed in the
futuristic science-fiction film ``Logan's Run,'' came to mind. That
70s movie had exactly the same premise (except that the leaders in
``Logan's Run'' had the populace convinced they'd be reincarnated).
</P>
<P>
   Odd associations like that are, unfortunately, the most
interesting aspects of the Willow Cabin Theater Company's
production of ``Thornton Wilder's `The Ages of Man.' '' These four
one-act plays are far from Wilder's best work and, for the most
part, neither the cast nor the director, Edward Berkeley, can make
them sparkle, but there are bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   John Bolger stands out as one of two man-size but
carriage-confined babies in ``Infancy,'' which includes a comic
suicide attempt on his part, and as Gulliver in ``Youth.''
``Infancy'' itself, the best of the four, is built on the theory
that babies understand adults and are trying so hard to learn that
they cry in frustration and grow suspicious of their caretakers
(``I think they don't want us to walk and to get good and get
better. They want us to stop.'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Youth,'' the 46-year-old protagonist marvels at the
shortcomings of an exclusively 20-something society (``To be young
and yet _ oh, ye immortal gods! _ to be without adventure of mind
or generosity of spirit!''). The other plays, ``Childhood,'' about
siblings who love to play games about funerals and orphans, and
``The Rivers Under the Earth,'' about a family at their beach house
reflecting on veiled memories and the past, have flashes of smart
Wilder observations (``I guess growing up is one long walk among
perils _ among yawning abysses,'' ``No one told me when I was a
bride that children are half crazy'') and whet the appetite for
something sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ages of Man'' continues at the Blue Heron Arts Center
through June 13.
</P>
<P>

   EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. _ Stuart Pimm stepped from a
helicopter in the middle of a saw-grass prairie, took off his heavy
white helmet and as the chopper pulled away began to sift the air
for the call of a sparrow, his educated ear sorting the feathery
whistles and clicks rising in the dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one there,'' he said, pointing, concentrating, raising
his clipboard to his ear. ``And a second there.'' The ecologist
paused, head down, eyes closed. ``Yes and a third in this
direction. A long way off.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparrows are hard to hear these days and even tougher to
spot. Because of human interference with the flow of water into the
Everglades, the object of Pimm's survey, the Cape Sable seaside
sparrow, is near extinction, along with other species, including
the American crocodile, the woodstork and the snail kite.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the plight of the sparrow reflects the failing
health of the Everglades ecosystem, a vast wetland wilderness
splintered by canals and dikes and threatened by urban development.
As Congress, in July, takes up a $7.8 billion engineering plan to
restore the swamplands to health, some environmentalists and
wildlife officials say the sparrow is the test of whether the plan
can succeed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that the breeding habits of the sparrow, a small
olive-drab bird that lives only in the national park, make it
vulnerable to even small disruptions to the Everglades' plumbing
system. The controversy surrounding the sparrow also reflects how
politically complicated and interconnected the problems in the
Everglades are, and how difficult any solution will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been described as the Everglades version of the canary in
the coal mine,'' said Steve Forsythe, the Fish and Wildlife
Service's supervisor in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Sable seaside sparrow lives only in the Everglades in
the freshwater marl prairie on both sides of the Shark River
Slough, the ecosystem's critical artery. Its breeding cycle, like
that of many wetland birds, depends on the annual dry season, when
the shallow sheet of water that historically flowed south from Lake
Okeechobee through the wetlands retreats into the major sloughs.
</P>
<P>
   As the prairie dries, the sparrows build nests just four inches
above the ground between mid-March and mid-June. They need only 40
days to hatch eggs and fledge the young, but so few birds survive,
scientists say, they must breed twice each season to increase their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bird's breeding habits have been severely disrupted by
the South Florida flood control system built since the 1940s,
combined with the Tamiami Trail, a highway across the northern
border of the national park.
</P>
<P>
   In the rainy season, dikes built along the edge of the
Everglades to keep Miami dry shift most of the water west, above
the Tamiami Trail. To relieve flooding there, state authorities
release water through gates in the highway miles west of the slough
where it once naturally flowed, flooding the sparrow's nests.
</P>
<P>
   During the dry seasons, when water is soaked up by irrigation
and urban use, the park drys out so much that the bird's habitat on
the east side of Shark River Slough burns up, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1990s the sparrow's population had dropped sharply,
to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The worst toll took place west of the slough, where flooding
reduced the population by 90 percent in the last 10 years,
scientists say. On the east side, the population has fallen nearly
60 percent since 1981, mostly because of fires. Only a third of the
population, near the Ingraham Highway, has remained viable.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build a nest four inches above the ground, and you
don't have a snorkel, you are in deep trouble,'' said Pimm, a
professor at the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The problems occurred despite a plan Congress approved in 1989
to expand the park and improve its erratic flow of water, a plan
that many environmentalists consider the linchpin of the overall
program to save the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been bogged down for 10 years in fights between
federal agencies, the Miccosukee Indian tribe, state water
authorities and homeowners near the park. That is not a good omen
for the larger project going to Congress now, which is intended to
restore the historic flow of water into the Everglades while
supplying South Florida's cities and farms with enough water for
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 plan, known as the Modified Water Deliveries Project,
was to add 107,000 acres to the park and to relieve flooding and
improve wildlife habitats by sending more water into the Shark
River Slough, where it belonged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acquiring the additional acreage, a major
obstacle is a neighborhood of about 450 houses between the slough
and the dike that protects Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The area's homesteaders, many of them Cuban immigrants, bought
their land legally and have learned to put up with a fair amount of
seasonal flooding. But the shift of water back to the slough would
flood them out.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 act directed the Corps of Engineers to build a
protective dike around the area, which covers 8.5 square miles. In
1992, the corps drew plans to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But the Parks Service objected, saying a better option would be
to buy out the homeowners and create a buffer zone between the
newly expanded park and Miami. Parks officials feared the
homeowners would eventually demand full flood protection and the
area would become a heavily developed suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, environmental groups have gained some protection for
the sparrow by threatening lawsuits under the Endangered Species
Act. State water managers have responded by keeping the excess
water above the Tamiami Trail, north of the bird's breeding
grounds, on lands controlled by the Miccosukee Indians. In
February, the Fish and Wildlife Service ruled that the sparrow was
in danger of extinction, legally forcing water managers to continue
keeping the breeding grounds dry.
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukees complain that the government is killing the
wildlife on their land to save the sparrow. Floods in the last
three years have drowned more than 85 percent of the white tail
deer on islands in the reservation, a lawyer for the tribe, Dexter
Lehtinen, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukee accuse Pimm and others of exaggerating the
sparrow's situation, and the Department of the Interior of using
the sparrow's endangered status to gain legal leverage over the
Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management
District.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The sparrow situation is a phony crisis,'' Lehtinen said.
``It's an abuse of the Endangered Species Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November after six years of studies and debate, the state
water authority agreed to buy out the homesteaders, voting to spend
$120 million. But many of the homeowners have refused to sell, and
some have sued the water authority. They have have won sympathy in
Dade County, where Cuban-Americans dominate the government, by
comparing the federal government's tactics to those of Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The county commission recently blocked the buyout, pending
resolution of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukees have jumped in on the side of the homeowners,
after deciding that building a dike around the settlement would be
the quickest way to resolve the dispute and get the floodwaters off
their lands.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners reject any notion that they are responsible for
the decline of the sparrow or the other endangered animals in the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no connection between our living in our homes and the
health of the Cape Sable sparrow,'' said Madeleine Fortin, a
resident. ``They just use us as a whipping boy. When the Cape Sable
sparrow is flooded, we are flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's program to add 107,000 acres has also
gone slowly. Most of the land, which is prone to flooding, is in
five-acre parcels that was sold to unsuspecting investors by
unscrupulous speculators in the 1950s and '60s. So far only half
the land has been acquired, and there are more than 1,000 private
owners who must still negotiate deals.
</P>
<P>
   For naturalists, the delays have been excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over the Shark River Slough in a helicopter recently,
Pimm and Sonny Bass, a Park Service ecologist, pointed out scarred
sections of earth where fires had burned what used to be wetlands.
Wading bird populations are less than 10 percent of what they were
50 years ago, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The sparrow, naturalists acknowledge, is not the most beautiful,
nor the most fascinating endangered species in the region. ``It is
sort of the rodent of the bird world,'' Bass joked.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most mornings in April and May, while the mist lays over the
swamps and the dawn lights up the cumulus clouds rolling over the
Florida Peninsula from the Gulf of Mexico, Pimm and Bass hopscotch
across the Everglades, counting sparrow calls. For each male bird's
song recorded, they count approximately 16 other birds. The data is
plotted on a map divided into square-kilometer sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a barometer of sorts,'' Bass said, as he jotted notes on
yet another spot with no sparrows. ``If the system's maintained,
then you maintain the sparrow.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pimm said the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is one of the few
levers that ecologists have to force government agencies to
preserve the wilderness. Naturalists used the spotted owl to save
old-growth forests in the Northwest, he said. The snail darter
became the standard-bearer for the entire ecosystem of the Little
Tennessee River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue about the species,'' he said. ``It's an
issue about the ecosystem on which it depends.''

TALKS BETWEEN CHINA AND NORTH KOREA SET TO START 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ North Korea's No. 2 political leader was to arrive in
Beijing on Thursday for the first high-level meeting between the
two communist allies in eight years, talks that will be closely
watched by the United States and China's Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the
Supreme People's Assembly, is bringing a large entourage of
political, trade and military officials and may also visit Shanghai
and Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Months in the planning, the talks are intended to demonstrate
that the alliance between North Korea and China remains strong.
They come just as the United States has made its own offers of
cooperation in an effort to moderate North Korea's military and
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, in the early 1950s, China sent troops to
help North Korea beat back the advancing Americans, and China has
remained determined ever since to preserve the communist government
there as a buffer on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance has been a tortured one. Even though Kim Il
Sung, the North Korean leader at the time, visited Beijing in 1991,
the relationship was deeply strained the next year when China bowed
to practical reality and recognized North Korea's archenemy, South
Korea, with its dynamic economy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, China has been concerned about North Korea's
disastrous economic policies, which have forced China to provide
large amounts of aid and could cause a social collapse, and about
the North's missile tests, which have undermined China's regional
security goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea is a troublesome ally,'' said Bates Gill, a
military expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``But
the Chinese see propping up the regime as their only real option.''
</P>
<P>
   In the talks this week, North Korea is expected to ask for
renewed commitments on the food, energy and other aid that has
helped the government of Kim Jong Il (the son of Kim Il Sung)
survive a famine and severe slowdown of its industries. The
country's rigidly controlled, closed economy has never recovered
from the demise of the Soviet Union and the subsidies and barter
arrangements that Moscow provided.
</P>
<P>
   China, in turn, is expected to press its secretive ally to
moderate its behavior in areas that have threatened China's own
strategic interests, appealing to North Korea not to repeat its
tests of a new long-range missile. The surprise launching over
Japan last fall set off alarm bells throughout East Asia and
strengthened Japan's support for developing antimissile defenses
with the United States _ a development seen by China as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   China is also expected to urge North Korea not to develop
nuclear weapons, according to a Western diplomat, who said China
wants to avoid any increase of tension on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   China has long maintained scientific and technical exchanges
with North Korea, but many Western experts say there is no evidence
that advanced weapon technology has been handed over directly in
recent years. North Korean sales of missiles to countries like Iran
have been a major concern of the United States, and the extent of
Chinese influence over such sales is disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials say they will urge North Korea to begin
opening up its economy so it can resume development and reduce its
desperate need for outside aid. But China is unlikely to pose any
ultimatums that could lead to a serious break in relations or
endanger the Communist government, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   China publicly endorses cooperation between the two Koreas and
``four party'' international talks _ including Japan and the United
States _ on a long-term peace settlement. At the same time, China
wants to avoid a total collapse in North Korea, or other scenarios
in which South Korea essentially absorbs the North: That would
bring an American ally, and possibly American troops, right to
China's border.
</P>
<P>
   ``China doesn't want U.S. forces north of the 38th parallel,''
said Douglas Paal, an Asia expert in Washington who served on the
National Security Council during the Reagan and Bush
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a former U.S. secretary of defense, William Perry,
visited North Korea, offering economic and diplomatic benefits if
the country would agree to abandon its missile and nuclear-weapons
programs. There has been no official reply.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas have also discussed resuming talks on the
reunification of families, officials in South Korea say.

TREAT THE BOSS'S PC LIKE YOUR OWN _ AND GET CAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The personal computer is an indispensable tool in the workplace.
But don't be fooled: It may be personal, but it's not private.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Thiemann thought it was. We now find out his resignation
in November as dean of Harvard Divinity School was prompted by
university techies' discovery of pornography on the Harvard-issued
PC in his Harvard-owned home.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight employees of the St. Louis-based Edward Jones &AMP; Co.
brokerage thought their PCs were private _ before they were
disciplined last month for sending e-mail that contained either
pornography or dirty jokes. Another 19 employees at Edward Jones _
ranked the 11th best company in America to work for earlier this
year by Fortune magazine _ were dismissed on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with 17,000 employees worldwide, has been inundated
with requests from other businesses for information on its
electronic usage policies and what types of programs were used to
uncover the offending employees.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians focus on protecting privacy rights on the
Internet _ ensuring, for example, that no one steals your credit
card number when you shop at amazon.com _ the real advance in
cyber-surveillance is in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are spying eyes everywhere, but by far the person most
likely to be spying on you is your boss,'' says Lewis Maltby,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's workplace rights
office.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven percent of businesses surveyed by the American
Management Association said they review employee e-mail, up from 20
percent in the 1998 survey. What employees may find especially
discomfiting is this: The majority of e-mail ``screens'' are done
without any provocation by the worker, such as a complaint to
management. They are totally random.
</P>
<P>
   And bosses are perfectly free to check up on employees' on-line
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule with respect to the the computer that sits in
front of you at work is there are no rules,'' says L. Camille
Hebert, author of ``Employee Privacy Law'' and associate dean of
the Ohio State University College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Maltby is blunter: ``Employers can do whatever they want. The
only statute that is even remotely applicable is the wiretapping
laws, and that only applies to the spoken word. So your boss might
have some trouble listening to your telephone calls at work, but an
employer can freely read your e-mail, when the same message would
been a violation if it was a telephone conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   And surveillance doesn't stop with e-mail. There are many
computer programs that will monitor which Internet sites are being
visited, and how long an employee stays there.
</P>
<P>
   For example, SurfWatch Software can either block access to sites
or simply monitor what sites are being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are looking at this type of solution more and more
for three reasons,'' says Theresa Marcroft, director of marketing
for the California company.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is productivity. If I am spending half my day buying books
or planning a vacation, the boss is not getting the productivity he
would like, he would expect, or he is paying for. Second, there is
liability, with huge color monitors that show pictures of nudes,
white supremacists, or antiabortionists. That can create a hostile
workplace environment. And thirdly, companies look at this to
optimize their networks. If rich videos are being downloaded, the
network is not as fast for people trying to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the worker who comes to work after having been to
the doctor's and been told she has breast cancer? Or the employee
who is coming to grips with being a survivor of incest? In both
cases, it is probable that they would do some research on the
Internet, and just as probable that they would not want anyone _
especially supervisors _ to know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Policies on computer, Internet, and e-mail usage vary widely
from company to company. Some prohibit any personal use, others are
quite liberal. In most cases, the company's written policies
indicate whether employees can be monitored. But the American
Management Association survey found than in about 15 percent of the
cases, employees were not informed that their computer, Internet,
or e-mail use could be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, I would say that an employee is foolish
or naive who allows information to be stored in his or her computer
that he or she does not want the employer to be aware of,'' says
Craig M. Cornish, a Colorado lawyer and cochairman of the privacy
committee of the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 21.4 percent of companies review stored
computer files of employees, and as with e-mail, more than half of
those reviews were conducted randomly, rather than on preselected
employees.
</P>
<P>
   What an employer finds on one's PC can lead to considerable
public embarrassment. In the case of Thiemann, discovery of the
pornographic images on his Harvard-owned computer resulted in not
only the loss of his deanship, but also great personal and
professional discomfort for the Lutheran minister who is married
and the father of two girls.
</P>
<P>
   His case is unusual for several reasons: his high profile in the
community, his outspokenness on matters of morality, and the fact
that the computer in question was in a Harvard-owned house. Would
Thiemann's punishment have been any less severe if the offending
material were discovered on a bookshelf in his home instead of on
his disk drive?
</P>
<P>
   While not speaking specifically about the case, Thiemann's
lawyer, Charles Ogletree, believes there is a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about a common-sense approach to what a
reasonable expectation of privacy might be, it would be much
different if it was in a library, but common sense and technology
seem to clash. That is not to say the outcome in the present case
is justified or reasonable,'' said Ogletree, a professor at Harvard
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Another complication in the Thiemann case is that he requested
more disk space for his computer and asked the computer department
to transfer some files to the new disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Harvard says it did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factual premise that Dean Thiemann's resignation was the
product of an intrustion on his privacy initiated by university
staff members is incorrect,'' said Harvard spokesman Joseph Wrinn.
``In both policy and practice Harvard is deeply respectful of the
privacy interests of its faculty and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrinn would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the technician performing the work saw
graphic images on the screen when they began working, or if files
were opened, something that would not ordinarily be necessary when
transferring them. If it was the former, that could have raised
harassment issues for the technician or technicians who did the
work. If it was the latter (regardless of one's views of
pornography), it raises the question of whether Thiemann's
expectation of privacy was violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing to say `transfer these files' and quite
another to say `feel free to look at anything I've done for the
last 12 years,' '' says Ohio State's Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the issue, Harvard University's
computer-use policy prohibits obscene material.
</P>
<P>
   While court cases involving employee privacy in cyberspace have
been view and far between, Hebert does not hold out much hope for
relief there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess,'' she says, ``is the way courts will ultimately go
is they will find employees have relatively little right to privacy
in employer-owned machines.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't look to Washington for relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is sitting on their hands,'' says Maltby. ``Everyone
agrees that privacy laws are badly outdated and need to be updated,
even the business community agrees with that, but the current
Congress could not be less interested.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you accept the reality that a workplace PC does, in fact,
belong to the employer, it's hard to deny the logic that follows:
If a company owns the machine, it has a right to examine its own
property, including what information is being stored there and what
Web sites are being visited. Still, many employees have a hard time
believing that, day to day, what they do on their PCs is anyone's
business but their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is popular now for an employer to monitor and censor the
content of information that people can put in a computer because of
sexual harassment in the workplace,'' says Cornish. ``It is just a
New York minute from there to say, `We want to censor you with
respect to violent content.' Then, eventually, it becomes
political. It is classic `Big Brother.' ''

FEDERAL CYBERCRIME UNIT HUNTS FOR HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (dal) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raids by FBI agents last week against several suspected computer
hackers are part of a new government cybercrime unit's crackdown
against illegal tampering with computer networks and Web sites, a
federal prosecutor said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The raids prompted a counteroffensive in which disparate hacker
groups took responsibility for bringing down additional corporate
and government sites, including the FBI's public information site.
</P>
<P>
   The events escalated a longstanding game of tit-for-tat between
adolescent pranksters using personal computers and a newly
galvanized federal police force stung by recent attacks on some of
the government's high-level Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Coggins, the U.S. attorney in Dallas who is overseeing
the effort, said on Tuesday that federal prosecutors had issued 16
warrants in 12 jurisdictions after a yearlong investigation, but
had not yet charged anyone with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is part of the government's new, Dallas-based
cybercrime task force, which includes the FBI, the Secret Service,
the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Defense Department, Coggins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most far-reaching investigation of its
kind,'' he said. ``It's an investigation with national and
international implications.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coggins declined to elaborate or to say whether the targets
of the investigation were considered to be part of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Don K. Clark, a special FBI agent in Houston, said the
activities under investigation included stealing and misusing
credit card numbers and computer passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those who were raided by the bureau's agents last
Wednesday said one connection between some of the targets was that
they knew one another from various discussion groups in an Internet
chat forum called Internet Relay Chat. The participants said that
the talk sometimes revolved around hacking techniques but that they
were not involved in any general hacking conspiracy with other
members of the discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never defaced any Web pages or taken out any major
sites,'' said Paul Maidman, 18, of Waldwick, N.J., one of those who
were raided.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to proprietary computer systems, Maidman said: ``I got
into other servers. I'd look around, read some e-mail, and that
would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maidman said he was awakened last Wednesday morning by five or
six armed FBI agents surrounding a living room couch where he
slept. He said the agents confiscated a computer, some diskettes,
CD-ROM's and other computer paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Two Internet service providers have also received requests for
documentation in connection with the case. The requests, parts of
which have been posted on the Internet, seek information about
dozens of hackers, hacker groups and software used by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   John Vranesevich, who operates the Anti-Online Web site, which
chronicles hacker activity, said the information requested from
Internet service providers involved software tools, computer files
and aliases pertaining to hacker activities.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich said several of the aliases actually represented
software programs called ``bots,'' which are posted in chat rooms
as automated monitors but may have been mistaken by FBI agents for
human participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that has to do with hackers they're going after,'' he
said. ``I'm not going to call this a witch hunt, but it's an
uninformed investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hacker groups continued their attacks on corporate
and government computers, in some cases making sites inaccessible
and, in others, taking over sites with their own messages, some of
them profane. The FBI site, taken down last week, remained
inaccessible on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One hacker group, which calls itself F0rpaxe, says it is based
in Portugal and takes responsibility for ``massive attacks'' on
various Web sites, sent a statement to Anti-Online saying, ``If the
FBI doesn't stop we won't, and we can start destroying.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Defense supercomputer gets major overhaul
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON,Ohio _ A supercomputer center at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base is getting even more super under a $17 million upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade is being made to the Aeronautical Systems Center's
Major Shared Resource Center, one of four supercomputer centers in
the Defense Department. Military and university scientists around
the nation run massive problems on MSRC's computers over high-speed
data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians were installing a Compaq Alphaserver ES40 system in
the the main computer room Tuesday when MSRC managers gave
reporters a tour of the center.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq system will triple the center's computing power and
bring its peak performance to the equivalent of 2.4 million Pentium
II computers networked together, according to an Air Force
statement.
</P>
<P>
   All that computing power is packed into a cluster of nondescript
black cabinets. John Blair, MSRC deputy director, was almost
apologetic for the lack of flashy bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get something new in it gets less
sexy-looking,'' he said. But he added the new system has four times
the power, one tenth the cost and half the maintenance of the Cray
C90 system it's replacing.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade also includes improvements in the center's memory,
storage and networking capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said scientists use the center's vast powers to simulate
the performance of things as small as molecules and as big as
battlefields. One scientist has been using it to simulate
techniques for making the B-1B bomber less visible to radar, Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-based simulation is becoming such a basic tool in the
acquisition business that the Air Force Materiel Command, based at
Wright-Pat, is moving to what it calls simulation based
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said this means a new weapon or aircraft will be evaluated
in computer simulations from the time it's first conceived through
design, production and later upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third major upgrade the center has undergone since
it opened in 1996. Nichols Research Corp., based in Huntsville,
Ala., set up and supports the center under a contract worth $157.9
million over eight years

SEATTLE STUDENT FALTERS IN 1ST ROUND OF NATIONAL SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lena Barouh, 13, an eighth-grader at Washington
Middle School in Seattle, failed Wednesday to make it into the
second round of the 72nd National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   A contest judge threw her a killer word: ``erubescent,'' an
adjective meaning blushing or reddening.
</P>
<P>
   She spelled it A-R-E-O-B-E-S-C-E-N-T.
</P>
<P>
   But Barouh, who was sponsored by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
will still receive $50 and a commemorative watch for her efforts.
She became eligible for the national contest after winning a
regional spelling bee in April.
</P>
<P>
   She was among 249 contestants whose week-long trip to the
nation's capital was financed by their sponsoring newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Barouh _ who writes poems, sings and plays the violin _ has said
she wants to pursue a career in music. Her mother, Ellen Mohl
Barouh, is a real estate agent, and her father, Aaron Barouh,
manages a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The National Spelling Bee's champion, who will be determined
Thursday, will receive $10,000 and a choice of encyclopedias and
other prizes.

AN ON-LINE LOUVRE OF THE ART OF WEB DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where do you go when you're suffering brain cramps? You could
stare at a wall, but you feel like you need something a little bit
more, well, artistic. The Museum of Web Art is the perfect
antidote, an on-line gallery that is the visual equivalent of
ambient music. Its displays are easy on the eyeballs yet
entertaining. There's even an exhibition of wallpaper. Yes,
wallpaper. Not the stuff you hang in parlors, but the stuff that
decorates your computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of a California graphic artist named Amy Stone,
the museum (http://www.mowa.org) is a showcase for Web design
elements, used mainly in commercial art. The wallpaper gallery
features stripes, swirls, and slithery snakes. Another gallery,
devoted to things that work, features different designs for
click-on buttons; another section features page counters.
</P>
<P>
   Strange stuff for a museum, that. But Stone, and her partner
Mark Kaproff, set out to create a site that is both utilitarian and
artistic. ``I got on line about two years ago, and as a designer, I
was looking to find good examples of Web elements,'' Stone says.
``I had to surf constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   She started to collect examples and launched the museum in
January. Originally, the ``collection'' featured graphic design
works, but now some of the exhibitions straddle the line between
fine and commercial art. In ``Millennium Diary,'' for instance, one
artist designs a new page for each day of the year leading up to
2000; poetry and multimedia images mark the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed to emulate a physical museum, with arrows
pointing to a visitors' center, various galleries, and the main
entrance. It's quirky, yet fascinating. Web art is an emerging
form, and nobody has really defined it beyond saying that it can
exist only in cyberspace. But like Stone, other designers are
looking for resources; the site showcases work by more than 50
artists and receives about a million hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a friendly collection of things that can be
useful, whether that be the design or the technology that drives
it,'' Stone says. ``Whenever there's a new technology, you're going
to have more things that are mediocre than excellent. That's why
you have to have institutions that call attention to what is
excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  An eye for an eye? Is it a publicity stunt or a political
statement? Last week, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore (``Roger
and Me'') set up a Web cam outside literary agent Lucianne
Goldberg's New York apartment. Goldberg set off the scandal we're
all trying to forget by urging Linda Tripp to tape a certain former
White House intern. ``Lucianne, it seems, does not respect the
privacy rights of others,'' Moore writes on the site,
www.iseelucy.com. ``She believes in keeping an eye on persons who
are a threat to the country. So do we.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no state secrets revealed: All you learn is that
Goldberg keeps the place cool in the summer and that she's staging
a low-tech retaliation by hawking the National Enquirer in her
windows. ``It's an unfunny stunt,'' says Goldberg, who claims she
is selling ad space in her windows for $2,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has said that he set up the camera to make a statement
about the invasion of privacy _ and to promote his television show,
``The Awful Truth,'' which debuted last month on Bravo. Moore's
leftist ``guerrilla video'' style was effective when he was taking
on General Motors, but here the line blurs between plain old
publicity and in-your-face politics. No doubt, this will happen
again; campaign 2000 is not far away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  There used to be a guy in this office who referred to
himself as ``The Encyclopedia of Useless Information.'' With
minimal prompting, he could tell you how to harvest echinacea or
give an impromptu lesson in the physics of flight. Alas, our human
resource is now pursuing a doctorate in something useful, so we're
stuck when we need answers to such pressing questions as ``Why is a
rabbit lucky?'' But now we've found the answer on line at an
entirely useless site, www.uselessknowledge.com.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in November by Web designer Joe Edelman, the site
offers a wealth of information that could come in handy when you're
caught in awkward situations. For instance, if you're ever stuck in
an elevator, you can break the tension by informing your fellow
riders, ``Most lipstick contains fish scales.'' We found that one
in the random factoid section; the site also includes a database of
useless quotations, vocabulary words, and inexplicable phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman, who lives near Philadelphia, says he is a trivia nut
whose son once called him a ``Master of Useless Knowledge.''
Apparently, he's not alone. The site gets 240,000 user sessions a
month, and its newsletter has a subscription base of 34,000, says
Edelman, who also seems to be a master of statistics. With its
5,000 factoids and 2,000 quotations, the site offers a great way to
justify time spent doing something totally useless.

   The critics are also right about 3Com Corp.'s new Palm VII
pocket data device. It's too expensive and offers a limited set of
features. But 3Com will sell heaps of them, regardless of the
critics.
</P>
<P>
   I won't shell out the necessary $600 _ 37 times the cost of my
two trips to the planet Naboo. I've a reputation for stinginess to
maintain, and I'd just as soon wait for the inevitable price drop.
Besides, the Palm VII is presently for sale only in the New York
area. Still, it's the first palm-sized machine that's actually
tempted me to spend some money.
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers know that I'm not a fan of personal digital
assistants. They have some value as electronic address books,
letting you store hundreds of phone numbers and a list of
appointments. But for this you don't need the pricey, heavy boxes
from 3Com or its rivals. The $99 credit-card-sized Franklin Rex is
quite good enough. Larger PDAs can also double as electronic
note-takers, but what's wrong with a pencil and paper?
</P>
<P>
   But the Palm VII transcends the limits of its predecessors by
adding a smidgen of interactivity. 3Com has crammed a radio
transceiver into a package almost exactly the same size as the
original Palm devices. With the cute plastic antenna extended, my
test unit worked perfectly, even inside the steel-and-concrete
walls of The Boston Globe. It snatched Internet data right out of
the air, and let me fire off brief messages to anybody with an
e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII uses a wireless data service that's available in
Boston and 259 other US cities. Users get access to a heap of
valuable on-line services _ news headlines from USA Today and the
Wall Street Journal, for instance. There's a nice applet from the
E-Trade on-line brokerage service that'll let you quickly check the
performance of your stock portfolio. The MapQuest driving
directions service, which can display the best route between point
A and point B, will delight newspaper photographers and others who
live on the road. And ``Star Wars'' buffs can use the Moviefone
applet to plan next weekend's viewings of ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also assigns you an address on Palm.net, 3Com's own
e-mail service, so you can send and receive messages. Writing on
any of the Palm PDAs is a tiresome business. You must either use a
special stylus to peck at the image of a keyboard, or you must
master Graffiti, a special writing method that enables the device
to recognize the human scrawl. I've never understood why anyone
would bother with all this just to jot down a phone number. But add
the ability to e-mail your notes, and it all makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's the unseemly price tag to consider _ and not just
for the device itself. You'll pay $10 a month for basic Palm.net
service, which limits you to a measly 50 kilobytes of data per
month. Extra kilobytes cost 30 cents each. A single downloaded
article from USA Today burns up one kilobyte, so heavy users will
burn through a small fortune in transmission costs. An ``extended''
service offering 150 kilobytes for $24.99 isn't much better.
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of specialized programs that run on Palm
devices, but with a mere 2 megabytes of memory, the Palm VII won't
let you run too many of them. In this era of cheap memory chips, I
wonder why 3Com didn't squeeze in a few more.
</P>
<P>
   And why won't the Palm.net system let me check the contents of
my other e-mailboxes? There's a feature to gladden the heart of any
traveler. But it's not to be found here. You'll only get mail sent
to the Palm.net address. Maybe you can set up your office e-mail
system to forward your messages. If not, the Palm VII offers no
help.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Palm VII is too expensive, too limited _ and too
cool. Its ability to send and receive data from almost anywhere
makes it the first such device that I'd consider a serious business
tool. The Palm VII's faults are like that floppy-eared alien in the
``Star Wars'' movie _ annoying, but not annoying enough to keep the
customers away.

`STAR WARS': ANIMATION MAY IMPRESS, BUT HUMANITY INSPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A close friend of mine saw the new movie, ``Star Wars Episode 1:
The Phantom Menace.'' She wasn't very impressed. ``It's a pretty
movie,'' she said, ``but it's not very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   I left the theater last weekend with much the same reaction. Too
much effort, I thought, went into the computer graphics and the
merchandising. Not enough forethought went into the plot or
character development.
</P>
<P>
   But, the problem with ``The Phantom Menace'' isn't just the lack
of high drama. Much of the movie's weakness lies with the computer
graphics themselves, and the reliance upon them to the exclusion of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it's hard not to be impressed by the
computerized prowess that director George Lucas has brought. There
are animated armies of 'droids and reptilian creatures, playing out
an exquisitely choreographed battle. There is a major character
that is completely computer-drawn.
</P>
<P>
   And the animation covers the spectrum of what is possible with
today's technology. The animated robots are rendered with
incredible detail and move with deft precision. The animated Jar
Jar Binks walks around, jumps, and drops things as if he is truly
under the influence of gravity. But most convincing is the way
these characters share the screen and interact with the
flesh-and-blood human actors. Lucas has certainly bought the
world's best animation with his millions.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, alas, with this computer-generated tour-de-force is
that it ultimately lacks meaning and emotional depth. Animated
characters can't act. They can only follow choreographed motions.
You can look at the screen and marvel at the eye candy, but
subconsciously your heart discounts the difficulties or deaths that
befall animated creatures. They don't feel real, because they don't
act as if they are alive.
</P>
<P>
   The first Star Wars movie was successful, in part, because
moviegoers could identify with the main characters and with the
battle. True, no one in the audience had ever been on a space
station the size of a small moon. But people could relate to the
idea of soldiers in uniform, battleships at sea, and atomic
weapons. The Imperial storm troopers were human beings wearing
white body armor, and despite their face masks, you could read
their emotions in their body language. The destruction of the Death
Star, although necessary, was still a tragedy because of all the
people that the ship carried. The movie was psychologically
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace,'' by contrast, feels like a Saturday
morning cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' now in theaters, does a much better job
integrating computer graphics with live action. That's because the
moviemakers used computer graphics to augment the storytelling and
the action, rather than replace it.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``The Matrix'' takes place inside a massive
computer. The twist is that the computer is running a simulation of
the world in which we live, Earth circa 1999. The movie's
underlying theme is that people who understand the world's true
simulated nature can manipulate reality to suit their needs.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy for the creators of ``The Matrix'' to
have used the simulated nature of their world to justify the
creation of computer-generated bad guys. Instead, the movie had
villains that were human _ and thus all the more terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Storm troopers, psychopaths, and invincible demons make for
successful movies because we understand the dangers that they
present. 'Droid armies, on the other hand, are so alien that they
can't get the adrenalin going. And without fear, there is no
excitement.

 CPT- COMPUTERS-BOMBAY-COLUMN-TEX 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  DEAR DR.
BOMBAY: I think you should speak out against violent computer
games. My 13-year-old son is so absorbed in Doom I am afraid he may
suffer psychological harm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Concerned Mother
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CON: If you're really that worried, take away his computer
privileges or do a better job of overseeing what software he buys.
As I seem to recall, it's your job to help build his character, and
relinquishing that kind of power to the big shiny box on his desk
is no way to do that. Or are you afraid of not being a ``cool
mom''?
</P>
<P>
   And just because somebody plays Doom doesn't mean he's going to
go ballistic. First-person shooters can be fun if you're mature
enough to know they're about as much like real life as ``The Jerry
Springer Show.'' If you teach your kid that _ and get him to come
up for air once in a while _ he'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I've got a Pentium 133 with about 400 megabytes
of available disk space, yet the thing is running a bit on the slow
side when you go from one program to another. I scan and defrag the
disk regularly and flush out all the temp files from the Internet
every day. I've also noticed that America Online 4.0 seems a lot
slower compared to 3.0.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slowpoke
</P>
<P>
   DEAR 'POKE: Available disk space doesn't have all that much to
do with how fast things run. You'll get the biggest bang for your
buck if you cram as much RAM as you can into the box.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the olden days, programs were a lot leaner and meaner.
Now, decreased speed is the penalty you pay for all that ease of
use and friendly graphics and singing icons. Microsoft Word seems
to get slower in each incarnation because they keep adding stuff to
it. The same is true of AOL. They're memory hogs.
</P>
<P>
   When Windows needs more memory than you have, it uses free hard
disk space to simulate RAM, but writing and reading all that data
to and from the disk is painfully slower than doing it to a chip.
And another thing: You say ``Pentium 133'' as if it's something to
be proud of. That's pretty marginal these days. See if you can
upgrade the processor.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have an HP Vectra on which I have DOS and
Windows 3.11. I can't afford to do away with the DOS because I have
a 13-year-old database program with an enormous amount of records
that I don't want to redo in some newer program. Since you say that
Windows and Linux could be on one hard disk, could I do the same
with DOS and Windows?
</P>
<P>
   _Split Personality
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SPLIT: Forget what Microsoft tells you about Windows being
its own operating system. Windows is just a tarted-up DOS, and
there's really no reason to subdivide your drive to accommodate
both. Linux and Windows/DOS are radically different systems,
however, and they can't coexist in the same disk partition.
</P>
<P>
   You can get to DOS easily enough by clicking the MS-DOS Prompt
icon in the main program group. Assuming you have DOS 6 or so,
adding special commands into Config.sys and Autoexec.bat will allow
you to boot into either Windows or DOS, but that means you have to
get out the DOS manual. What, did you think I was going to do all
your work for you? They don't pay me enough for that. Go read the
manual.

TO MEET ABOUT GROUND INVASION
 &HT;    900&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-TEAM-0603.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States would contribute 7,000 troops to
a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, President Clinton said
Wednesday, raising by 75 percent the number of American soldiers
who would participate in such a mission.
</P>
<P>
   While moving forward with plans for peace, Clinton was also
preparing for a Thursday meeting with his top generals to discuss
the far riskier option of mounting a ground invasion of the
embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear, though, whether an invasion of Kosovo sometime
later this summer was under serious consideration or whether the
option was being raised simply to increase the pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic at a moment when both war and
diplomacy are intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Milosevic met for more than two hours to discuss a
peace plan proffered by Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Victor
Chernomyrdin, and Finland's president, Martti Ahtisaari. Ahtisaari
is the first Western leader to meet directly with Milosevic since
NATO launched air strikes against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
government on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is a long way from announcing what sorts of
troops would be sent for a NATO peacekeeping force -- which would
total 47,868 troops from 30 NATO members and partner countries --
or which specific units might be part of any force that would be
deployed if peace can be brokered in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The boost in troop strength Clinton announced Wednesday,
however, reflected the increasingly difficult security environment
NATO planners envision in Kosovo since they prepared for a
peacekeeping force of just 28,000 troops before the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to discussions concerning the peacekeeping force,
the option of invading Kosovo will be on the table when Clinton
meets Thursday with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top
military council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that there will be a full range of discussions,
questions about whether or not there would be any kind of a ground
option for a non-permissive environment,'' said Defense Secretary
William Cohen, who will open Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, as we have indicated on many occasions before, there is a
consensus for a strong air operation in the NATO countries,'' Cohen
said. ``There is not a consensus for a ground operation in a
non-permissive environment. So we intend to focus on the
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is sending this week an additional 68 warplanes
and refueling tankers to further step up NATO's around-the-clock
air war against Serb military targets in Yugoslavia. The new
aircraft, part of a larger build-up announced last month, will
bring to 769 the number of U.S. planes involved in NATO attacks
that wound up their 10th inconclusive week on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have planes flying at all hours from every direction,
from bases in Italy, Germany, Hungary, Turkey, the United States
and from carriers at sea,'' Clinton said during commencement
remarks Wednesday at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs,
Colo. ``If we have the patience and determination to match the
courage and skill of our men and women in uniform, we will achieve
our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   With continued bombing as a backdrop, Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari
struggled with the difficult business of diplomacy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Finland is not a NATO member but is one of a group of countries
that cooperates with the alliance through its post-Cold War
``Partnership for Peace,'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari carried a peace proposal to Milosevic
calling for an end to a Serb military campaign targeting ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serb forces from the province
and the acceptance of an international security force to safeguard
the return of an estimated 1.5 million refugees forced to flee
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The envoys were scheduled to meet again on Thursday with
Milosevic. He has said he would accept a lightly armed United
Nations peacekeeping mission, but has so far rejected the U.S. and
NATO position that any peacekeeping force must have NATO at its
core.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it was
``a significant step forward,'' that Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari
were able to agree on enough of the elements of a peace plan to
present a united front to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to be reading from the same script. I
think that that is important,'' Albright told reporters at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question that remains to be answered is how Milosevic
will react,'' Albright said. ``The ball is in his court . . . we're
just going to have to see how he reacts to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism over the diplomatic track was tempered, though, by
continuing differences between NATO and Russia -- Yugoslavia's
closest ally -- over the composition and conduct of a Kosovo
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies have insisted that such a
force could include troops from Russia and other non-NATO countries
but it would be led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a NATO command and control structure, it will
have robust NATO rules of engagement, and NATO certainly will be,
if you like, the central tent pole around which the force will be
built,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, however, told reporters that Russia was not
contemplating placing its troops under NATO control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be two separate presences in Kosovo -- a NATO
presence and a Russian presence,'' Chernomyrdin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Shea rejected that formulation, however, suggesting that it
could lead to a partitioning of Kosovo into Serb areas, monitored
by Russian troops, and non-Serb areas overseen by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a single force, not a number of different
forces,'' Shea said. ``We are not going to do anything which could
increase the chances of some sort of partition, whether virtual or
real.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Without saying so specifically, U.S. and NATO officials also
alluded to the possibility that fighting could break out between
NATO and Russian forces under the formulation Chernomyrdin
described.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be unity of command for this to be really
effective, in order for it not to slip down a slippery slope into
partition, ineffectiveness or worse,'' Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott told reporters in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background of diplomatic efforts, NATO pilots
reported their greatest success to date against fielded
Serb-dominated Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under attack by the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, Serb troops
and police have been forced to mass near the Albanian border in
recent days to counterattack. As they have done so, Serb tanks,
artillery and military vehicles have been targeted by withering
aerial bombardments.
</P>
<P>
   In the area near Mount Pastrik, along Kosovo's southwestern
border with Albania, NATO planes flew nearly 150 bombing runs on
Tuesday alone, striking 15 armored vehicles, 40 artillery or mortar
pieces, four other military vehicles and a surface-to-air missile
site.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Mount Pastrik has become a shooting gallery for
NATO pilots, who have set up what's called a ``hog pen'' -- a sort
of aerial holding zone -- for A-10 ``Warthog'' attack jets along
the Albanian-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO air commanders spot or otherwise learn where Serb forces
are located in the field, A-10s, built to destroy tanks, scream out
of the hog pen for a strike, often within minutes of a sighting,
Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, an alliance spokesman, told reporters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current Serbian counter-offensive against the (KLA) around
Mount Pastrik
</P>
<P>
   offers NATO the best opportunity so far in the air campaign to
hit Serb forces hard,'' said Jertz. ``Because these forces have had
to come out of their camouflaged positions, they have become more
visible.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO pilots have flown some 32,000 sorties against Serb military
targets to counter a campaign of repression targeting ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has described the repression as anti-terrorist
activities -- Belgrade regards the KLA as a terrorist organization
-- that got out of hand.

WINDOWS 98 SE CLEARS THINGS UP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In late 1996, Microsoft upgraded Windows 95 with a new version
that included, among other features, a new file system that gave
users more space on a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that tantalizing option, Windows 95 OSR2 was not
available to most PC users.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it was only sold with a new machine or, in some
cases, a new hard drive. Microsoft argued that most of its new
features were only applicable to newer machines. Thus, if you
wanted a better Windows, you also had to buy a better computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows faithful were not amused. I suspect OSR2 became one
of the most-pirated operating systems of all times, as folks with
older machines discovered their neighbors brought home a new
computer _ complete with a Windows 95 install CD. ``Hey, Bill,
wanna come over for a beer? And say, bring your Win95 disk with ya.
How 'bout it?''
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft has updated Windows 98, and clearly has learned
from its past mistake. Windows 98 SE (Second Edition) will not only
replace the current boxes of Windows 98 now on store shelves, but
users of existing Windows 98 systems will be able to order a $20
upgrade CD via Microsoft's Web site in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MODEM-SHARING MADE EASY
</P>
<P>
   I've been using Windows 98 SE for several weeks. While it's
certainly not as compelling an upgrade as Windows 98 was from
Windows 95, it's definitely worth considering, particularly if you
currently have or plan to add a home network.
</P>
<P>
   The installation process is virtually identical to that for the
original Windows 98. In fact, I had to check to make sure I wasn't
reinstalling my old version.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you update an operating system, you run the risk of
breaking something else on the computer. Sure enough, installing
Windows 98 SE on my PC gave me problems with my Turtle Beach
Montego II sound card _ some games invoked the Blue Screen of Death
when I tried to run them. Reinstalling the sound card's drivers
fixed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   (Obligatory safety warning: Whenever you upgrade your operating
system, back up your key data files and make sure you have all the
latest drivers for your hardware at the ready.)
</P>
<P>
   If the FAT32 file system was the big deal with Windows 95 OSR2,
then Internet connection sharing is the main attraction for Windows
98 SE. If you have PCs connected via a network, this lets one
computer act as the conduit to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those who promote home networks as the next wave in consumer
computing tout modem-sharing as the ``killer app'' for linking PCs
around the house. While I think higher-speed connections such as
cable modems will make modem-sharing obsolete, it's nice to have
this feature built into the Windows operating system while waiting
for the future to get here.
</P>
<P>
   When you install the modem-sharing feature, a simple wizard pops
up that asks a few questions about your computer and how you want
other machines to use its modem. At the end, you're asked to put a
blank disk in your floppy drive, and the wizard places a program on
the disk that's used to configure other PCs on the network.
</P>
<P>
   The sharing feature works well enough in most cases. However, if
you have an unusual setup in which your Internet provider has given
you a fixed numeric address (most dial-up connections assign a
random address upon log-on), you may run into problems. This is
because Windows changes the address of your machine so that the
others on the network know how to talk to it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAKING PEACE WITH USB PORTS
</P>
<P>
   Among the other features in Windows 98 SE is better support for
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, devices. Windows 95 OSR2 had support
for USB, but it was lousy. The original Windows 98's USB support
improved dramatically, but still choked occasionally. So far, I've
found the USB support in the SE version to be rock-solid.
</P>
<P>
   The new OS also comes with Internet Explorer 5, which I believe
currently to be the best Web browser available (See
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/03/26/compute.html). If
you've been holding off getting IE5 because of the amount of time
it would take to download the browser via the Net, getting it along
with this operating system upgrade is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   There are other benefits _ a new version of NetMeeting,
Microsoft's Internet phone program; support for IEEE 1394, also
known as FireWire and iLink, a high-speed connection found on some
new computers; and, of course, numerous bug fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fixes, by the way, already have been posted to the
Windows Update area of Microsoft's Web site. A Windows 98 Service
Pack will be posted soon that rounds all these up, and adds a few
more that are part of the Second Edition.
</P>
<P>
   One new feature that Microsoft has not touted but I think is
excellent is that some error messages are linked to help files. I
discovered this when my modem tried to connect and got no dial
tone. In previous versions of Windows, there's a cryptic message
that says ``No dial tone.'' With Windows 98 SE, however, I got a
button that took me to a modem trouble shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Is this new version of Windows 98 a must-have? Certainly, if you
still have Windows 95 or, heaven forbid, Windows 3.1, and have been
holding off making the move to 98, then yes, this OS is for you.
Ditto if you have a home network and don't have multiple phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you've already upgraded to Internet Explorer 5; have
kept up with the various patches Microsoft's released for Windows
98; don't have any USB problems; don't have a FireWire port on your
computer; and you don't have an in-home network and have no plans
for one, then probably not. Just grab the Windows 98 Service Pack
when it comes out and get on with life.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States would contribute 7,000 troops to
a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, President Clinton said
Wednesday, raising by 75 percent the number of American soldiers
who would participate in such a mission.
</P>
<P>
   While moving forward with plans for peace, Clinton was also
preparing for a Thursday meeting with his top generals to discuss
the far riskier option of mounting a ground invasion of the
embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear, though, whether an invasion of Kosovo sometime
later this summer was under serious consideration or whether the
option was being raised simply to increase the pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic at a moment when both war and
diplomacy are intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Milosevic met for more than two hours to discuss a
peace plan proffered by Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Victor
Chernomyrdin, and Finland's president, Martti Ahtisaari. Ahtisaari
is the first Western leader to meet directly with Milosevic since
NATO launched air strikes against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
government on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is a long way from announcing what sorts of
troops would be sent for a NATO peacekeeping force -- which would
total 47,868 troops from 30 NATO members and partner countries --
or which specific units might be part of any force that would be
deployed if peace can be brokered in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The boost in troop strength Clinton announced Wednesday,
however, reflected the increasingly difficult security environment
NATO planners envision in Kosovo since they prepared for a
peacekeeping force of just 28,000 troops before the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to discussions concerning the peacekeeping force,
the option of invading Kosovo will be on the table when Clinton
meets Thursday with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top
military council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that there will be a full range of discussions,
questions about whether or not there would be any kind of a ground
option for a non-permissive environment,'' said Defense Secretary
William Cohen, who will open Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, as we have indicated on many occasions before, there is a
consensus for a strong air operation in the NATO countries,'' Cohen
said. ``There is not a consensus for a ground operation in a
non-permissive environment. So we intend to focus on the
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is sending this week an additional 68 warplanes
and refueling tankers to further step up NATO's around-the-clock
air war against Serb military targets in Yugoslavia. The new
aircraft, part of a larger build-up announced last month, will
bring to 769 the number of U.S. planes involved in NATO attacks
that wound up their 10th inconclusive week on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have planes flying at all hours from every direction,
from bases in Italy, Germany, Hungary, Turkey, the United States
and from carriers at sea,'' Clinton said during commencement
remarks Wednesday at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs,
Colo. ``If we have the patience and determination to match the
courage and skill of our men and women in uniform, we will achieve
our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   With continued bombing as a backdrop, Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari
struggled with the difficult business of diplomacy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Finland is not a NATO member but is one of a group of countries
that cooperates with the alliance through its post-Cold War
``Partnership for Peace,'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari carried a peace proposal to Milosevic
calling for an end to a Serb military campaign targeting ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, a withdrawal of Serb forces from the province
and the acceptance of an international security force to safeguard
the return of an estimated 1.5 million refugees forced to flee
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The envoys were scheduled to meet again on Thursday with
Milosevic. He has said he would accept a lightly armed United
Nations peacekeeping mission, but has so far rejected the U.S. and
NATO position that any peacekeeping force must have NATO at its
core.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it was
``a significant step forward,'' that Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari
were able to agree on enough of the elements of a peace plan to
present a united front to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to be reading from the same script. I
think that that is important,'' Albright told reporters at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question that remains to be answered is how Milosevic
will react,'' Albright said. ``The ball is in his court . . . we're
just going to have to see how he reacts to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism over the diplomatic track was tempered, though, by
continuing differences between NATO and Russia -- Yugoslavia's
closest ally -- over the composition and conduct of a Kosovo
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies have insisted that such a
force could include troops from Russia and other non-NATO countries
but it would be led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a NATO command and control structure, it will
have robust NATO rules of engagement, and NATO certainly will be,
if you like, the central tent pole around which the force will be
built,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, however, told reporters that Russia was not
contemplating placing its troops under NATO control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be two separate presences in Kosovo -- a NATO
presence and a Russian presence,'' Chernomyrdin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Shea rejected that formulation, however, suggesting that it
could lead to a partitioning of Kosovo into Serb areas, monitored
by Russian troops, and non-Serb areas overseen by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a single force, not a number of different
forces,'' Shea said. ``We are not going to do anything which could
increase the chances of some sort of partition, whether virtual or
real.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Without saying so specifically, U.S. and NATO officials also
alluded to the possibility that fighting could break out between
NATO and Russian forces under the formulation Chernomyrdin
described.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be unity of command for this to be really
effective, in order for it not to slip down a slippery slope into
partition, ineffectiveness or worse,'' Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott told reporters in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background of diplomatic efforts, NATO pilots
reported their greatest success to date against fielded
Serb-dominated Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under attack by the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, Serb troops
and police have been forced to mass near the Albanian border in
recent days to counterattack. As they have done so, Serb tanks,
artillery and military vehicles have been targeted by withering
aerial bombardments.
</P>
<P>
   In the area near Mount Pastrik, along Kosovo's southwestern
border with Albania, NATO planes flew nearly 150 bombing runs on
Tuesday alone, striking 15 armored vehicles, 40 artillery or mortar
pieces, four other military vehicles and a surface-to-air missile
site.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Mount Pastrik has become a shooting gallery for
NATO pilots, who have set up what's called a ``hog pen'' -- a sort
of aerial holding zone -- for A-10 ``Warthog'' attack jets along
the Albanian-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO air commanders spot or otherwise learn where Serb forces
are located in the field, A-10s, built to destroy tanks, scream out
of the hog pen for a strike, often within minutes of a sighting,
Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, an alliance spokesman, told reporters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current Serbian counter-offensive against the (KLA) around
Mount Pastrik
</P>
<P>
   offers NATO the best opportunity so far in the air campaign to
hit Serb forces hard,'' said Jertz. ``Because these forces have had
to come out of their camouflaged positions, they have become more
visible.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO pilots have flown some 32,000 sorties against Serb military
targets to counter a campaign of repression targeting ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has described the repression as anti-terrorist
activities -- Belgrade regards the KLA as a terrorist organization
-- that got out of hand.

AOL CONNECTION LETS USERS BROWSE WITH REGULAR INTERNET SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a computer that has Netscape Communicator set up as
the browser for my Internet service provider. However, I have AOL
now, but I still want to use Netscape with it. How do I go about
changing from AOL's browser to Communicator?
</P>
<P>
   A: In most cases, this is much easier to do than most people
realize.
</P>
<P>
   When you connect to America Online, you are using the same kind
of connection you'd use with any other Internet provider. That
means you can use other software for accessing the Internet when
you log on to AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Simply launch Netscape Communicator _ or Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, if you prefer _ and use it. That's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   There is one caveat, however. If you previously were using
another Internet provider, it's possible that you were required to
configure Communicator to go through a firewall _ a piece of
security software designed to keep hackers out of your provider's
system. If Communicator is set up to look for certain firewall
settings for your previous provider, then it won't work with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   To undo those settings, go to Edit, then Preferences, then
Advanced, then Proxies. Click on ``Direct connection to the
Internet.'' That will turn off the firewall settings.
</P>
<P>
   The settings will still be in place, in case you want to go back
to your old provider. Just recheck the item there that enables the
proxy connection.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am curious and confused. Is it a good idea to dump the
contents of the Windows temporary folder? It can get quite large
and I am not sure how often and at what intervals that Windows will
dump it automatically. I am a neat nut and I don't like unneeded
stuff on my hard drive _ but I don't want to do something that
might present a problem either. I seem to have enough without
provoking any more.
</P>
<P>
   A: Unlike the Recycle Bin, which is actually a folder with an
adjustable limit as to the number of items it can hold, the Windows
temporary folder (usually windowstemp) doesn't get ``dumped.'' This
is something you have to do yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary folder is a kind of staging area where programs
place temporary files. For example, if you install new software,
the components of that program are often compressed, and must be
expanded before they can be installed. When you run the install
routine, the components are placed into this temporary folder
before they are moved or copied into their permanent folder.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all programs clean up after themselves like they
should, leaving digital detritus in the temporary folder. It's a
good idea to check in there about once a month and delete its
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful, though, not to delete any temporary files that are
currently in use. But how can you tell what's being used?
</P>
<P>
   Right-click in the folder, choose View, then Details. Click on
the Modified bar that appears at the top of the list, and the files
will sort themselves by date and time. If you see any files that
were created in the past hour or so don't delete them. If you want
to be extra safe, don't delete anything created that day, unless it
happens to be the leftovers of a software installation.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else can go.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My computer's modem will sometimes connect in the middle of
the night. This bothers my sleeping wife. How can I turn off the
modem sound?
</P>
<P>
   A: Go to the Windows Control Panel, and click on Modems. Choose
your modem from the list that appears, then click Properties.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a panel that includes a volume slider. Move it all
the way to the left, to the Off position.
</P>
<P>
   On some computers, the modem sound is controlled in the same way
that other sounds are _ via the speaker icon found in the system
tray. If the previous strategy doesn't work, double-click on the
speaker icon and look for a modem volume control there.

`PC DADS GUIDE' WRITTEN FOR PARENTS IN DIGITAL AGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: This story duplicates material in the DIGITAL-LA column for
use May 29). 
By DAVID BLOOM  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   LOS ANGELES _
Worried more than ever in the wake of various school shootings
about what your children are doing on the computer? Two Intel
senior managers have recently come out with a book that may provide
some useful suggestions, ``The PC Dads Guide to Becoming a
Computer-Smart Parent'' (DTP Trade Paperbacks; $13.95)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, the entire 311-page book can be encapsulated by one
piece of sage advice on Page 118: ``You have time to spend together
with your child. Avoid the temptation to use the computer as an
electronic baby sitter. Instead, make it a partnership affair,
something you both share and enjoy. We call this
shoulder-to-shoulder learning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the book includes much else, with chapters on topics such as
``Raising a Computer-Smart Daughter'' and ``Boys, Game Addiction
and Violent Software,'' and appendixes with suggestions for
child-friendly Web sites, nonviolent popular games (such as the
sainted SimCity and many high-adrenaline racing titles) and more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tips for digital parenting: Put the computer in the
areas where you live, rather than tucked away in a bedroom or other
back area; create a software ``diet'' that balances various needs _
and rotate the offerings; create and post rules on usage; keep an
open mind to the inevitable changes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It also has suggestions for managing how much time children
spend on games, suggesting tricks like using poker chips as chits
to track how much time children spend on educational programs and
uses. For every half-hour of such usage, they get a chip they can
cash in for an equal amount of time playing games.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put into practice some of what you've learned
from the book, go to their Web site,
atwww.intel.com/intel/educate/pcdads/index.htm &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   History lessons
</P>
<P>
   Here's a big idea: Little books illuminating complicated
subjects. Doubleday has now published four books under the rubric
``The Big Idea,'' each focusing on one thorny technical topic by
way of one particularly intriguing historical figure.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Strathern authored all four books, two of which have just
come out. One focuses on Albert Einstein and his theories of
relativity; the other on cryptography and artificial intelligence
pioneer Alan Turing and the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect great depth in 100 pages (with large type, even),
but they are brisk reads that give a quick rundown of both a large
figure in 20th-century thought, and the ideas they helped shape.
</P>
<P>
   The books also come with brief annotated bibliographies for
further reading, key points and sayings, and a chronology of their
subjects' lives and times.
</P>
<P>
   The other two books in the series, by the way, are about
physicist Stephen Hawking and black holes, and Isaac Newton and
gravity. Nothing like thinking big.

   JEZZIN, Lebanon _ If all goes as planned, members of the
Israeli-backed militia that has long occupied this pretty
mountaintop town will head south in the next few days, completing
their withdrawal from an enclave that has served for 14 years, in
proxy, as Israel's deepest penetration into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal is seen by many in Lebanon and Israel as a
test-run for the full-scale withdrawal from southern Lebanon that
has been promised by Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak. But
whether that proves to be the case may depend on whether the
withdrawal brings peace and security, or a new wave of killings.
</P>
<P>
   Among those waiting to see what happens next is Youssef, a
10-year veteran with the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, who has
decided stay behind when his fellow soldiers leave. Youssef said he
has grown weary after years in which being on Israel's payroll has
meant seeing dozens of friends and relatives killed by Hezbollah
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The persistence of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in fighting the
Israeli occupiers has made service here a worsening nightmare for
Israelis and their Lebanese allies alike. But under Lebanese law,
Youssef is a traitor who could face a death sentence, and to
Hezbollah, he is an enemy, a potential target for a settling of
scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be hiding in the bushes, waiting to see who comes to
Jezzin,'' said Youssef, 27, Wednesday at the entrance to the town,
which the militiamen had sealed off from reporters as they made
final preparations to leave. Their commander, Gen. Antoine Lahd,
has declared that the mounting toll of casualties being inflicted
by Hezbollah had made further occupation untenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's the Lebanese government, I think that will be OK,''
said Youssef, who would give only his first name. ``But if it's
Hezbollah, that would be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army, mostly Christians, has been
a vital partner for Israel and 1,500 Israeli soldiers in
maintaining the nine-mile-wide strip that Israel has occupied since
1985 as a ``security zone'' against attack from guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Israeli forces in Jezzin, which lies in a
35-square-mile mountain salient that extends well north of the
occupied zone. But the withdrawal by the Lebanese militia _ armed,
paid and supplied by Israel, down to their dark green Israeli-style
uniforms _ is the first significant boundary change in southern
Lebanon in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   And because Israel has said any withdrawal by its own forces
must be preceded by security guarantees from Lebanon and from
Syria, the main power broker here, the withdrawal under way in
Jezzin is being described by many people in Israel, including those
close to Barak, as a kind of litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Defense Minister Moshe Arens said on the Israel radio
the other day: ``If the Lebanese enter Jezzin and prevent Hezbollah
from taking over the area, it's a good sign for the future. But if
Hezbollah seizes the enclave, it's a sign that the Syrians let this
happen, and that will tell us something of their intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, has
promised that his forces would not enter Jezzin once the Lebanese
militia leaves. But Hezbollah fighters have continued to harass the
militiamen even as they have pulled back from outlying villages,
and the guerrillas set off a roadside bomb in the center of Jezzin
on Tuesday that killed two South Lebanon Army fighters.
</P>
<P>
   That attack had clearly sharpened the anxiety among fighters who
stood guard Wednesday afternoon at the entrance to the town,
beneath a white religious statue labeled Our Lady of the Crossing
and a banner that identified Jezzin as ``The Bride of the
Waterfall.'' Approaching cars that were deemed to be suspicious
were greeted with warning shots that echoed loudly across a
plunging ravine.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 157 SLA militiamen have been killed while holding the
town and surrounding villages since Israel invaded in 1982. During
that time, more than half the fighters stationed here have
surrendered to the Lebanese government, and the population of the
town has dwindled to 5,000, from about 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, wary of being seen as restraining
Hezbollah, which it regards as a legitimate resistance force, has
so far refused to say whether it intends to send its own forces to
Jezzin after the withdrawal. Nor has Lebanon said whether it
intends to grant any amnesty to soldiers like Youssef, who a local
priest said was among more than 200 militiamen who have made it
known that they intend to stay after their colleagues depart.
</P>
<P>
   That withdrawal could take place as early as tonight, one
militia commander said, with the militiamen climbing into their
tanks and armored personnel carriers and traveling south to Kafr
Hunah, a town at the edge of the occupation zone that is expected
to become the militia's new base.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of members of the militia, including Lahd, have been
tried and sentenced to death in absentia on charges of treason. But
several prominent residents of Jezzin said Wednesday that they
thought it important that the Lebanese government now adopt a more
forgiving stand, particularly toward young militiamen, who they
said had been essentially conscripted into service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a clear mechanism on how to deal with these
people,'' said Edmond Rizik, a former member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He and other suggested that punishing militiamen too harshly
might leave them with the conviction that they had no other option
but to continue their fight. The Rev. Adel Alam, a priest at a
Maronite Christian monastery in nearby Machmouch, said the
monastery would open its doors to militiamen and their families to
provide temporary sanctuary from reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   Lahd has said that the militia was withdrawing because his
troops in Jezzin ``could no longer endure more slow deaths.'' He
has promised that the pullout will be completed by mid-June; the
local commander, a major who would not give his name, said the
withdrawal, which began Sunday, was already ``halfway through.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the militiamen interviewed at the entrance to Jezzin
appeared downcast. Those who said they were planning to join in the
withdrawal said they had already sent their wives and children
south, to Marjayoun, in the Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   All said it would be wrong for the Lebanese government to charge
any of them with treason; with a long history of internecine
warfare, they said, Lebanon should have learned to be more
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is calling us collaborators, but we're like any
Lebanese,'' said the militia commander, who was juggling both an
assault rifle and a mobile phone. ``We're the people.''

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The school Melba Martinez's daughter attends
doesn't go on field trips anymore. Alirio Lopez no longer returns
to the village where he was born to visit his parents on weekends.
Elber Espino leaves his new car at home and switches to his wife's
old compact anytime he has to drive out to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Colombia's elite has lived in constant fear of being
kidnapped by guerrilla groups that are fighting the government of
this South American nation of 40 million people. But now a new kind
of mass and indiscriminate abduction is spreading that terror among
ordinary citizens who cannot afford the protection of bodyguards
and armored cars.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is known as ``miraculous fishing.'' A band of
guerrillas appears out of nowhere, sets up a roadblock on a main
highway, stops every car or bus that happens along, takes away all
the passengers who seem likely to have a healthy bank account, a
good job or a prominent name, and holds them captive until a hefty
ransom is paid.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``miraculous fishing,'' or ``pesca milagrosa'' in
Spanish, takes its name from a popular Colombian children's game
that is traditionally played at birthday parties and on holidays.
For generations here, excited youngsters have been reaching into
barrels with a hook or their bare hands to pull out gifts whose
identity is not known in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terrible that something so frightening should be given
the name of something so pure and beautiful,'' said Luz Marlene
Sierra Mayorga, a 38-year-old engineer here. ``It is one more sign
that we Colombians have lost our innocence and joy in life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new and alarming variation on the practice of mass
kidnappings of civilians, at least 30 guerrillas from the National
Liberation Army invaded a church service in an upper-class
neighborhood in Cali last Sunday and abducted more than 140
worshipers. About 60 people are still being held in the rugged
Andean mountains outside the city, where the government has
deployed more than 3,000 soldiers and police officers to locate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Precise statistics on the number of victims of fishing
expeditions are hard to come by, in part because many families and
businesses prefer to deal directly with kidnappers and not report
abductions to the police. But a report issued by the government's
anti-kidnapping office in May calculated that at least 4,925 people
have been abducted since January 1996, with the largest total
coming in 1998, after the advent of ``miraculous fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The government report estimated that two-thirds of the
kidnappings were carried out by left-wing guerrilla groups,
principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
and the National Liberation Army, or ELN Ordinary criminal gangs
accounted for 20 percent of the abductions and right-wing
paramilitary groups for one percent, while the source of the rest
is listed as ``undetermined.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking of a propeller-driven passenger plane on a short
run from Bucaramanga to Bogota on April 12 heightened kidnapping
fears. The guerrillas that carried out the operation have not
demanded a monetary ransom for 25 passengers they continue to hold
at a jungle base, calling instead for the government to cede it
control of a safe haven zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the plane hijacking, people thought that they were at
least safe in the air,'' said Manuel Sanabria, a 46-year-old
advertising executive here. ``But now we know that is not true,
that you are in danger any time you travel anywhere in this
country, whether it is on the road or in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sierra, interviewed at a anti-kidnapping rally here early in
May, knows from bitter personal experience just how injurious an
abduction can be to a family. Her father was kidnapped and killed
by ordinary criminals 15 years ago, and her older brother Alvaro,
also an engineer, was among 41 passengers on the hijacked Avianca
Airlines prop flight; he was later freed.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Juan Carlos Mejia, a 38-year-old dentist, has
begun refusing to fly on any airplane that is not a jet. ``The
flight that the ELN fished was one of those prop planes, but it is
almost impossible for guerrillas to take over a big jet and make it
land at some little strip out in the jungle,'' he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez, whose 7-year-old daughter no longer goes on field
trips, said: ``Really, you have to think twice before you go
anywhere these days. It makes life a lot more tense. It's like
living under siege, surrounded by an unknown, invisible enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the week before Easter, a traditional vacation time
throughout Latin America, travel within Colombia was down 40
percent over last year, according to Camilo Gonzalez Pozo, director
of Citizen Mandate for Peace, a civic group. With increasing
regularity, the five million residents of this Andean capital are
canceling trips to towns that are barely a two-hour drive away,
while traffic on highways to the Caribbean coast has also dropped
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   A list of victims compiled by the Free Country Foundation, a
civic group dedicated to combat kidnapping, includes doctors,
accountants, surveyors, farmers, lawyers, pilots, engineers,
students and teachers. The oldest person kidnapped was 77, while
the youngest was just one day old.
</P>
<P>
   Even a 19-member mariachi orchestra, Grupo Garibaldi, was taken
captive at a roadblock in Santander Province last fall and held for
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon appears to have taken root as a result of the
successes that guerrilla groups, especially the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, have enjoyed in the field in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   By most estimates, insurgent groups now either control or
operate openly in more than one-third of Colombia's territory,
giving them the capacity to strike almost at will and to evade the
Colombian army, but simultaneously increasing their need for money
to pay for their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mounting public disgust with and clamor against the
abductions, guerrilla leaders have made it clear that they do not
intend to abandon the practice. A government study released here on
May 10 estimates that the country's three main guerrilla groups
have obtained more than $1.2 billion in kidnapping ransoms in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as it continues, the war must be financed,'' a FARC
commander who uses the pseudonym Raul Reyes said in an interview
with a television station here in May. After all, he continued,
``the state levies taxes on companies in the countryside, the
cities and even on international enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's anti-kidnapping czar, Jorge Alfredo Escobar,
did not respond to repeated calls to his office and cellular
telephones requesting an interview to discuss the phenomenon. But
in an interview here in early May, the minister of defense, Rodrigo
Lloreda Caicedo, said that President Andres Pastrana recognizes
that ``miracle fishing has become a fad,'' is ``very depressed
about this,'' and is intent on ``taking back the roads of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, Lloreda resigned, saying he opposed Pastrana's
decision to grant the FARC indefinite control of a
Switzerland-sized territory in order to induce them to engage in
peace talks. In remarks to reporters, Lloreda suggested the
guerrillas were taking advantage of their uncontested control of
the region to build up weapons caches, engage in drug trafficking
and house their kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Country Foundation has published tips to avoid
kidnapping: ``Do not carry identification or emblems of the site or
company where you work. Arrange with your traveling companions and
fellow employees to adopt an identity that is `lower profile,'
since you quite possibly will be taken prisoner if your captors
realized that you hold a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miraculous fishing is intended not just to raise money, but to
generate fear and create an atmosphere of war, and that is what it
is doing,'' said Santos, the head of the organization. ``More and
more, people throughout the country are feeling that the
perpetrators of this have put all of us in jail.''

   TONY-AWARDS (New York) _ When did Broadway become the provinces?
The suspicion has been hovering for several decades, now that the
once-sophisticated mecca of American theater is really just a mall
in Squaresville: a forum for automated theme park shows, with doses
of high culture provided by visitors from more adventurous places.
All the same, when the Tony Award nominations were announced last
month, they seemed to offer especially disheartening confirmation
of the idea, giving off what Lorenz Hart once described as ``the
faint aroma of performing seals.'' It's not that there won't be
things to celebrate at the Gershwin Theater Sunday night, when the
awards are handed out. (The live telecast will begin at 8 p.m. on

   END-OF-AFFAIR-FILM (London) _ The remake of Graham Greene's
``End of the Affair'' by the screenwriter and director Neil Jordan
has recently finished its six-week shoot in various spots around
England, including London, where streets were turned back into
those of wartime and its aftermath. The movie, which is tentatively
scheduled for release at the end of the year, stars Ralph Fiennes
as Maurice Bendrix, the jealous novelist who falls passionately in
love with a married woman and whose tortured narration describes
the sad unraveling of the affair. Julianne Moore plays Bendrix's
lover, Sarah Miles, a woman who makes a devil's bargain with God
himself. And Stephen Rea, the melancholy staple of Jordan films,

   COWARD-THEATER (New York) _ His name notwithstanding, he missed
being born on Christmas by more than a week. His name
notwithstanding, he was a brave man, brave enough to fire off
epigrams for the West End in London in the wake of Oscar Wilde. The
world has not forgotten Noel Coward (eventually Sir Noel),
playwright of ``Hay Fever'' and ``Private Lives,''
composer-lyricist of ``Mad About the Boy'' and ``Mad Dogs and
Englishmen,'' unmatched interpreter of his own mischief. Sheridan
Morley, the London theater critic for The Spectator and Playbill,
summed up Coward's genius in the title of his biography, the first:
``A Talent to Amuse.'' Coward died in 1973. Were he alive, he would
be celebrating his 100th birthday on Dec. 16. One of many

the former Graham dancer David Brown. On Tuesday, when the company
long known as Elisa Monte Dance opens a two-week season at the
Joyce Theater, the marquee for the first time will read Monte/Brown
Dance. The dancers will perform three new works by Brown along with
two by Ms. Monte. The couple shares credit for a sixth new piece,

   SANFRAN-MUSIC (Berkeley, Calif.) _ They probably didn't plan it
that way, but San Francisco's leading classical-music organizations
will come into an interesting collision this week. At the War
Memorial Opera House, the San Francisco Opera will stir up pagan
ecstasy with several complete cycles of Richard Wagner's ``Ring of
the Nibelung,'' beginning on Wednesday. Meanwhile, beginning on
Thursday across the street at Davies Symphony Hall, and in a couple
of other spots around town (including a Roman Catholic church),
Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony will celebrate
the life and times of Igor Stravinsky, who loved to bill himself as
Wagner's Antichrist, and for whom the ``Ring,'' with its ``miasmic
vapors'' and its labyrinth of leitmotifs, amounted to nothing more
than ``a sort of vast musical city directory.'' By Richard
Taruskin. (Moved). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   WAGNER-RING (Undated) _ Once again, the Wagnerites are
descending on San Francisco for the four-day spiritual adventure
that is the ``Ring of the Nibelung,'' offered in four overlapping
cycles, beginning on Wednesday. The production, unveiled in 1985,
last saw service in 1990. Of the original principals, the Wotan of
James Morris remains. Along with the new cast of other gods,
giants, dwarves and assorted demigods _ among them, the redoubtable
Jane Eaglen as Brunnhilde _ the current edition also introduces a
new director, Andrei Serban. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   STRAVINSKY-MUSIC (Undated) _ Recordings of Igor Stravinsky
conducting his own music date from as early as 1928, when he was 46
and had few doubts about his own significance. The composer
continued to record his works until 1966, five years before his
death. He was especially active in the studio during the 1950s and
early 60s, when Columbia invited him to record virtually his
complete operatic, orchestral, choral and larger chamber works
under optimal conditions as a lasting legacy. The strengths and
weaknesses of Stravinsky's conducting, and consequently, the value
of these recordings as guides, have been variously debated. To me,
in terms of archival importance, this discography, especially the
Columbia recordings now reissued by Sony Classical, is the greatest
landmark in the history of recorded music from the classical
tradition. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).

   TV-SOPRANOS (Undated) _ The absurdist view of history, the
version that probably makes the most sense in the age of Monicagate
and the Washington follies, suggests that it's people's little
quirks and kinks that make big things happen. Modern wars and coups
are really the products of mood swings and temper tantrums. ``The
Sopranos,'' the groundbreaking HBO series that begins reruns of its

view. Ruffled pride, paranoia and childish score settling, rather

PAKISTAN FREES JOURNALIST AND DROPS SEDITION CHARGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Pakistani government dropped sedition
charges Wednesday against a journalist who has been highly critical
of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and it released him after almost a
month of detention and interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the United States, the European Union, human
rights groups and the World Bank had all strongly protested the
government's detention of the journalist, Najam Sethi, as the most
outrageous example of its attempt to repress the country's press.
Sethi is editor of The Friday Times, an English-language weekly in
Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials had said they suspected Sethi of working for
an Indian intelligence agency after he gave a speech in New Delhi
on April 30 that painted a bleak picture of Pakistan's political
and economic condition. Pakistan's chief envoy to India had
described the speech as ``contemptible treachery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sethi said in an interview Wednesday after his release that
he believed he was detained, not because of the speech, but because
the prime minister was angered by a string of Sethi's critical
editorials, as well as Sethi's decision to give an interview to the
BBC, which was investigating corruption charges against Sharif and
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Days before his arrest, Sethi said, a senior official close to
Sharif telephoned him and accused him of conspiring with the BBC to
overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, the Punjab state police dragged Sethi from his bedroom
in the middle of the night, beat him, blindfolded him and turned
him over to the army intelligence service for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They interrogated me about everything I've done for the last
30 years,'' Sethi said. ``But they did not mistreat me. And at the
end of the day, I believe that they informed the prime minister
that no charges of treason could be leveled against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago, he said, the government moved him from the
custody of the army's intelligence service to police detention.
Rather than pressing charges against him in military courts, a
sedition case was filed against him in a special anti-terrorism
court. Sethi was charged with opposing the creation of the state of
Pakistan and anti-national activities.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the government withdrew those charges during a
Supreme Court hearing on a bail application for Sethi.

INDONESIA'S QUIET CANDIDATE IS GAINING MOMENTUM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Though it was clearly the last thing he
intended, it was Suharto who launched the candidacy of his most
likely successor as Indonesia's next elected leader _ his longtime
nemesis, Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   Swatting away a political irritant three years ago, he
engineered the ouster of Mrs. Megawati as the increasingly popular
leader of one of the country's two normally subservient opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
   In a stroke, he created a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Indonesia's first free parliamentary election since
1955, to be held on Monday, Mrs. Megawati's party is riding a wave
of popular momentum and she is the leading figure to head a new
coalition government that is to be formed before the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Her extraordinary popularity is a puzzle to outsiders. A passive
figure who sometimes seems not very interested in her political
work, Mrs. Megawati, 52, is more symbol than leader.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their grievances after three decades of autocratic rule
by Suharto, who resigned as president a year ago _ corruption,
injustice, poverty _ many Indonesians now imagine that they have
found a savior and a kindred spirit in this fellow victim.
</P>
<P>
   Indulging in something of a historical fantasy, many see in her
the incarnation of what they now imagine were better times under
her father _ Indonesia's charismatic founding president, Sukarno _
who also fell victim to Suharto when he was deposed in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sukarno passed away a long time ago, but we believe his spirit
is still here with Mega,'' said a hairdresser named Bambang, using
Mrs. Megawati's nickname. ``And she suffered so much when Suharto
was president.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Megawati seems to have taken little part in her own rising
stardom, and that may be one of the secrets of her success. She
hovered on the edges of the protests that forced Suharto's
resignation and remained in the background of the reform movement
that pushed his unelected replacement, President B.J. Habibie, to
liberalize the government.
</P>
<P>
   She has made few public statements and offered little hint of
any policy positions she might hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only when Suharto made Megawati the gift of having her
dumped that she became a symbol of dissent,'' said Jack Bresnan, an
expert on Indonesia at Columbia University who is visiting Jakarta.
``She had never uttered a word of opposition, of dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   She still says little, mostly avoiding reporters and dropping in
only briefly at campaign rallies.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech she urged her supporters to guard against
cheating by the governing party. ``Stay there and watch the
counting,'' she said, ``because our experience in the past showed
that thousands of our supporters came to vote, but when the results
came in, in some places we got nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Statements like that leave little for analysts to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no basis on which one could form definite opinions of
how she might be as a national leader,'' said a senior foreign
diplomat. ``She has constantly frustrated everyone who has tried to
form a coalition or sound her out about her policy intent.''
</P>
<P>
   At critical moments in the last year, when violence erupted on
the streets, she refused pleas to intervene by using her calming
influence on the crowds. On at least one occasion her aides said
she could not be disturbed because she was taking a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Some Indonesian political commentators wrote her off, saying she
had failed to seize her historic moment at the time of Suharto's
resignation. They were wrong. The less she did, the higher her
stock rose.
</P>
<P>
   What seems, to the political elite, to be a maddening passivity
only seems to inspire her admirers, many of whom come from
Indonesia's huge majority of poor people. Among Indonesia's
Javanese majority, modesty and restraint are highly prized and
energetic activity is sometimes seen as a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Mega,'' said Syahril Ramdani, an unemployed bank
messenger. ``She is calm and quiet, and she is persistent in her
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gofur, who sells sweet bottled tea, said: ``Certainly,
absolutely I love Megawati, because she fights for the little
people. She deserves to be president because of her ancestry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Megawati's statements and actions do offer some clues as to
her beliefs. She is not a political novice, having acted as a
student booster for her father and later, served in Parliament for
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her party, the Indonesia Democratic Party of Struggle, is
nationalist, secular and essentially conservative. In a recent
platform it emphasized the rule of law and the revival of
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In her years in opposition, Mrs. Megawati firmly rejected the
option of protest rallies in what her advisers said was an attempt
to avoid violence. When she was ousted as her party's leader, she
took her complaints to the courts rather than into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   She has cultivated good relations with the politically powerful
military and has supported its mission to combat separatist
movements and maintain Indonesia's unity. She has opposed
retribution against Suharto, calling instead for reconciliation and
noting that he declined to put her father on trial after seizing
power from him.
</P>
<P>
   But for all her symbolism and the hopes for change that she
embodies, it is not clear that her party or her leadership would be
very different from that of the incumbent party, Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golkar, PDI, where's the difference?'' said Ann Marie Murphy,
a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Columbia University, using the
initials for Mrs. Megawati's party. ``They are both conservative.
They both have ties with the military. They both have a lot of
gangsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Lev, an expert on Indonesia at the University of
Washington, said of Mrs. Megawati: ``She is part of the old elite
and will be as accommodating to friends from that elite as anyone
can imagine. So, many of the army people are perfectly happy with
Megawati. They know perfectly well that when push comes to shove,
she will be delighted to have their help.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said there was no way to know how she and her advisers
would respond to the pressures and temptations of power. The hopes
of her fervent supporters could easily, and quickly, be crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Mega because she is a woman and she can be a mother to
our country,'' said Nana Sumarna, who owns a garage.
</P>
<P>
   Hari Tjan, a political scientist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, had a rejoinder to that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they are looking for an affectionate, warm mother,
a safe and secure place,'' he said. ``But you know, a mother can be
influenced by naughty sons and naughty uncles and naughty nephews.
You never know.''

MCCAIN (Sun City, Ariz.) - Sen. John McCain announces his plan to
bolster and preserve Social Security if electived president during
a meeting with residents of Sun City. He also encounters a problem
that could hamper his presidential bid: a lack of pizazz in his
campaign style. One Sun City resident, for example, said he likes
McCain `'but he doesn't have any charisma.'' By BILL MULLER. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MCVIDEO (Washington) - Sen. John McCain unveiled his official
presidential campaign video , a feel-good biography that aims to
yank at Amercia's heart strings by employing dramatic,
black-and-white footage of McCain twice eluding death during the
Vietnam War. The eight-minute video is long on personality themes
and comparatively short on issues. It was produced by Stevens Reed
Curcio, McCain's Virginia-based media firm, and unveiled at a
reception on Wednesday night. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - I shuddered immediately. It was staring
at me with cool, beady eyes that were the murky color of an
eight-ball. It didn't flinch, flutter or turn away. From its perch
at the top of one of the columns on my front porch, its gaze was
hard and direct, steady and unwavering. I had seen that same look
before, some 11 years ago, and it haunts me still. By LAURI NOTARO.
Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (PHOENIX) - This was one of those perfect moments. I
was soaring along a back road in eastern Arizona, the shadows of
tall pines flashing across the car's hood and flickering on the
brawny shoulders of the Jaguar mascot leaping out in front. I was
driving the new Jaguar S-Type sedan, quiet, refined and
substantial. Getting into the turns, the brakes prove to be strong,
the steering responsive, and handling incredible. The V-8 comes on
in a silky rush. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L`` category.
Embargoed for Saturday, June 5. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WILSON-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ We're numb, desensitized, tuned out. The
daily numbers from Kosovo _ this many sorties flown, that many
civilians killed _ carry the same emotional weight as the baseball
scores or the stock market, maybe less. We've talked more about
``Star Wars'' in recent weeks than our destructive attacks in the
Balkans. Our bombs are killing and maiming innocent people we are
seeking to protect, and we write it off like a deductible expense
in the business of war. By STEVE WILSON. Column will move in the
``K'' category. &QL;

BUSH TO SIGN $500 MILLION TAX RELIEF BILL  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush will visit Houston on
Thursday to sign into law a bill that will deliver more than $500
million in promised tax relief to consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The young men's section of the downtown Foley's department store
will be the backdrop for the 4 p.m. CST bill-signing ceremony,
which will give Texans a three-day reprieve each August from the
8.25 percent sales tax on clothes and shoes. The bill mandates a
permanent exemption from sales taxes on Internet connections and
nonprescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The tax breaks were embodied in Senate Bill 441 by Sen. Rodney
Ellis, D-Houston, who will accompany Bush at the bill-signing. The
legislation was a hard-fought compromise approved the day before
the 76th legislative session ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's, a regional retail store, was among the Texas businesses
whose representatives registered in favor of Ellis' bill at Senate
hearings. Merchants across the state expect to reap substantial
profits as a result of the bill, though Ellis said everyday
taxpayers should be the main beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan will provide tax relief to all Texans, but
particularly those most in need. It could mean a free pair of shoes
for a child. That's a real tax cut Texas families can feel and
understand,'' Ellis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the bill is a key component to the $2.6 billion in
overall tax relief he promised during his 1998 re-election
campaign. He wound up getting just $1.85 billion of that from the
just-ended session.
</P>
<P>
   Tax experts are still deciphering the implications of the
40-page bill. But what's undisputed is that the first sales tax
holiday will be Aug. 6-8; the Internet tax break takes hold in
October, and savings on over-the-counter drugs won't be felt until
spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas merchants are already bracing for the commotion
likely to surround the three-day sales tax holiday on clothes and
shoes. After hearing how cash registers sang when other states
enacted similar laws, they're eager for the holiday to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a quick learning curve,'' said Texas Retailers
Association president Mickey Moore, whose group represents 1,500
companies, including giants such as Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from the experience we've seen in New York and Florida,
this is going to be a huge selling period _ particularly since
we've compressed it into three days,'' he said. Florida's lasted a
week, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers will promote very heavily for this and will reduce
prices on a good number of items,'' Moore predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer has $100 to spend on clothing, and that's all,
the merchant will sell $100 worth of merchandise, not $92.50 or
whatever it would be if you had to take the tax out. So in round
numbers, it's an immediate 8 percent increase in sales for the
retailer,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some answers about the various tax breaks:
</P>
<P>
   Q: When is the ``sales tax holiday''and what items are included
and excluded?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bill states that the exemptions on ``clothes and
footwear'' will apply from 12:01 a.m. on the first Friday in August
until 12 midnight the following Sunday. This year that means Aug.
6-8.
</P>
<P>
   For an item to be exempt under the legislation, it must sell for
less than $100. Retailers are likely to lower prices on some items
to below $100 in order to qualify them for exemption. Not included
in the tax exemption are athletic shoes and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Also not exempt are accessories such as jewelry, handbags and
umbrellas. Although lawmakers initially sought to limit the
exemptions to children's clothing and shoes, they were unable to
come up with a workable way of doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't define children's clothing. That was too big a
burden on the retailer to deal with,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Won't the state sales tax breaks lower revenues for cities
and other taxing entities?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. And if they insist, local taxing jurisdictions can
repeal the tax breaks, but only their share. The tax bill allows
the governing body of a taxing authority, by a majority vote, to
repeal any of the sales tax exemptions beginning in fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The state sales tax rate is 6.25 percent, and local taxing
entities can add up to 2 percent more, making the maximum sales tax
8.25 percent. If a city, transit authority or other taxing entity
opts out, they can only collect up to 2 percent sales tax. Because
of the confusion such a move might cause, some lawmakers and
private groups are discouraging repeals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is meant by ``nonprescription medicines,'' and when does
that exemption take effect?
</P>
<P>
   A: Beginning April 1, 2000 _ the effective date was delayed to
postpone the fiscal impact _ the sales tax exemption on
over-the-counter drugs will take effect.
</P>
<P>
   It will apply to any drug or medicine ``that is labeled with a
national drug code issued by the federal Food and Drug
Administration.'' Herbal and folk remedies not sanctioned by the
FDA are not included.
</P>
<P>
   A buyer should look for a National Drug Code, or NDC, number on
the label to be sure it qualifies. Also exempted were blood glucose
monitoring test strips, which are used by diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, an exemption on diapers was considered but not
included in the final legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will the Internet exemption work?
</P>
<P>
   A: After Oct. 1, the exemption applies to Internet access
service, in an amount not to exceed the first $25 of a monthly
charge. In other words if you are paying $25 a month for use of the
Internet, you would save $2 a month.
</P>
<P>
   It applies regardless of whether the billing cycle used by the
Internet service provider is monthly or annual; or whether the
service is bundled with another service; and regardless whether the
provider charges a lump sum amount or separately bills the
purchaser for each Internet user on the account.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were some of the business tax breaks approved?
</P>
<P>
   A: After Jan. 1, small businesses _ those with gross annual
receipts of less than $150,000 _ will no longer be liable for any
franchise taxes. Savings will vary from business to business, but a
corporation that made $150,000 profit all within Texas and had no
deductible expenses would save $6,750, according the comptroller's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations of any size may apply for tax credits for research
and development or job creation; for providing day care services
for children of employees; and for underwriting before-school and
after-school programs for kids ages 5-13.
</P>
<P>
   Tax credits also will apply to capital investments in
``strategic investment areas'' if the outlays are to provide
agricultural processing, data processing, warehousing,
manufacturing, central administrative offices and distribution.

MIDLAND, TEXAS, STUDENT BREEZES THROUGH DAY ONE OF SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stacey Moore, 14, of Midland, Texas, breezed
through the first day of the 72nd National Spelling Bee Wednesday
by quickly and confidently disposing of words in the contest's
initial three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The first word she encountered was a doozy: ``cricetid.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many contestants, Stacey didn't ask that the word be
repeated or defined or used in a sentence. She just spelled it. The
word refers to a family of small rodents that includes muskrats and
gerbils.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a repeat performance during the second round with the
word ``monetary,'' which has to do with a country's currency or
coinage.
</P>
<P>
   During the third round, she did ask the pronouncer, one of the
contest judges, to repeat the word ``interminable,'' which means
endless, before she spelled it.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey, who completed the eighth grade last week at Alamo Junior
High School, will compete again Thursday. She is sponsored by the
Midland Reporter-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just surprised to make it to the second day,'' Stacey said
after the contest, which is run by the Scripps Howard newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Pam Moore, an executive secretary in Midland, said
she gets nervous when Stacey ``just blurts words out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stacey said the longer she thinks about a word, ``the easier
it is to mess up.''
</P>
<P>
   She has competed in spelling bees since she was in the third
grade. ``I love it and have been doing it ever since,'' said
Stacey, who brought her stuffed monkey, Kizzy, with her to
Washington for good luck. Stacey has had Kizzy since she was a
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Her love of spelling at times conflicts with her other love,
tennis. Stacey will miss a tennis competition this weekend because
she and her family will be traveling back to Texas from Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   She said she will play tennis this summer before taking part in
a school spelling team when she enters Lee Freshman School later
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The spelling bee began with 249 spellers. By the end of the day,
TK were left. Round four will begin Thursday and subsequent rounds
will be held until only one contestant survives. That speller will
receive $10,000, a choice of encyclopedias and other prizes. Other
winners will receive commemorative watches and cash prizes based on
their ranking in the contest.

TALKS BETWEEN CHINA AND NORTH KOREA SET TO START 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ North Korea's No. 2 political leader was to arrive in
Beijing on Thursday for the first high-level meeting between the
two communist allies in eight years, talks that will be closely
watched by the United States and China's Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the
Supreme People's Assembly, is bringing a large entourage of
political, trade and military officials and may also visit Shanghai
and Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Months in the planning, the talks are intended to demonstrate
that the alliance between North Korea and China remains strong.
They come just as the United States has made its own offers of
cooperation in an effort to moderate North Korea's military and
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, in the early 1950s, China sent troops to
help North Korea beat back the advancing Americans, and China has
remained determined ever since to preserve the communist government
there as a buffer on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance has been a tortured one. Even though Kim Il
Sung, the North Korean leader at the time, visited Beijing in 1991,
the relationship was deeply strained the next year when China bowed
to practical reality and recognized North Korea's archenemy, South
Korea, with its dynamic economy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, China has been concerned about North Korea's
disastrous economic policies, which have forced China to provide
large amounts of aid and could cause a social collapse, and about
the North's missile tests, which have undermined China's regional
security goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea is a troublesome ally,'' said Bates Gill, a
military expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``But
the Chinese see propping up the regime as their only real option.''
</P>
<P>
   In the talks this week, North Korea is expected to ask for
renewed commitments on the food, energy and other aid that has
helped the government of Kim Jong Il (the son of Kim Il Sung)
survive a famine and severe slowdown of its industries. The
country's rigidly controlled, closed economy has never recovered
from the demise of the Soviet Union and the subsidies and barter
arrangements that Moscow provided.
</P>
<P>
   China, in turn, is expected to press its secretive ally to
moderate its behavior in areas that have threatened China's own
strategic interests, appealing to North Korea not to repeat its
tests of a new long-range missile.

LITTLE PUBLIC OUTRAGE OVER BRUTAL, EXPENSIVE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - We're numb, desensitized, tuned out. The daily numbers
from Kosovo _ this many sorties flown, that many civilians killed _
carry the same emotional weight as the baseball scores or the stock
market, maybe less. We've talked more about ``Star Wars'' in recent
weeks than our destructive attacks in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Our bombs are killing and maiming innocent people we are seeking
to protect, and we write it off like a deductible expense in the
business of war.
</P>
<P>
   Our leaders say we are trying to degrade the Yugoslav military,
undercut Slobodan Milosevic's popular support and force him to the
peace table. In fact, we've struck dozens of civilian targets,
sharply increased animosity toward America and failed to harm
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Our aims were well-intended, but our approach has been foolishly
conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching the attack, we gave the Serbs an ultimatum with
no room for negotiation, no space for diplomacy. Their refusal to
accept it was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   By relying entirely on air power in mountainous terrain, we
could not stop Serb paramilitary units from completing their grim
tasks. By using cluster bombs, which cause higher casualties, we
are looked on as indifferent to civilian life. By pledging not to
use ground troops, President Clinton gave the Serbs incentive to
accelerate their brutal expulsion of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Our multibillion-dollar bungling in the Balkans reminds me of
last December when our planes bombed Iraq after Saddam Hussein
refused to let weapons inspectors do their jobs. Net impact? Saddam
kept firm control of his country, and instead of some weapons
inspections, we have none.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategy against Serbia has been so misguided that a
strong ally, ex-President Jimmy Carter, felt moved to deliver a
scathing critique last week.
</P>
<P>
   Our bombs have hurt the oppressed, not the oppressor, he said.
With control of the news media, Milosevic manages to be seen as a
hero defending his homeland against foreign aggression.
</P>
<P>
   As a man long committed to freedom and human rights, Carter
appreciates our goals. But he noted that we have diminished the
United Nations by going around it, and the United States has
systematically ignored human suffering in conflicts across Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the best way to make peace with abusive leaders is
to provide both the threat of consequences and the promise of a
reward. For a small fraction of the cost of this war, we could have
offered to help Yugoslavia economically. Instead, we are paying
billions to destroy the country and will pay billions more to
rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   We're now left with three options:
</P>
<P>
   Continue to flatten Yugoslavia and kill more civilians; work
more closely with Russia to find a diplomatic solution; or commit
ground forces, some of whom are almost certain to die.
</P>
<P>
   Carter favors diplomacy, concluding:
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for the world's only superpower, the ends don't always
justify the means.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 weeks we've been told there can't be a pause in
the bombing because Milosevic can't be trusted. But what exactly
could he do to us? A pause could give him a chance to save face and
put political pressure on him to settle. There are growing
indications this week that he may finally be interested in talking
peace. If clearing the skies for a few days could help, we should
do it.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kissinger, who has a solid grasp of the difference between
realism and idealism in foreign policy, once said the ``most
fundamental problem of politics . . . is not the control of
wickedness but the limitation of righteousness.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to countries convinced of their moral
superiority, as we are today. He knew that a nation has to balance
what it sees as just with what is possible. Moral convictions, no
matter how well-founded, give no assurance of military success.
</P>
<P>
   Our bombing campaign misjudged Milosevic, miscalculated the
reaction of the Serbian people, claimed the lives of scores of
innocents and cost a fortune. Yet there's been remarkably little
public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   I wish the war could turn stock prices down. More people might
take it seriously. &QL;

CAUSEY AFFECTS REVOLUTION'S STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY _ Revolution player/coach Walter Zenga knew what he
was doing when he removed himself from last Saturday's road game
against the MetroStars in the 90th minute in favor of backup
goalkeeper Jeff Causey.
</P>
<P>
   Causey, the former University of Virginia All-American, was
perfect the rest of the way, holding the fort to preserve a 3-3
regulation tie, then blanking the MetroStars in the shootout, 1-0,
enabling New England to end a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by the Revolution to replace the injured Zenga two
seasons ago, Causey has experienced the best of both geographic
worlds since entering the league. As a rookie in 1996, Causey was
keeper for the MLS champion D.C. United, so he was close to his
hometown of Gainesville, Va. After being waived by D.C. and signed
by New England, Causey now finds himself in his wife's native state
(she's originally from Groton).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the couple met during Causey's first semester at
Virginia, where Jeff would go on to post an NCAA tournament-record
three shutouts in as many national championship games and Heather,
an All-American as well, would star in lacrosse and field hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were battling for a while to see who would win more
national championships,'' he said. ``She won two, I won three.''
</P>
<P>
   Causey said the physical part of Saturday's game was secondary
to being mentally prepared for the five shooters in the extra
session. He wound up stopping two balls, seeing two others miss the
net, and forcing the other shooter to run out of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to get myself into the right frame of mind, get
aggressive and do what I had to do, either get a piece of the ball
or force the shots to go wide.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this season Causey has gone the extra
mile for Zenga and his teammates. On May 8 against Miami, he
replaced an injured Zenga in the second half, then backstopped the
Revolution to another shootout win, allowing just two goals on six
extra shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine out of 11,'' smiled Causey. ``That's a good average right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Causey has to be prepared to spell Zenga at a moment's notice.
Against the MetroStars, he was told with six minutes to play that
he would soon enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a psychological thing that works both ways,'' he said.
``I'm going in cold and I don't even know what I'm going to able to
do, but I think it also changed their style. In a shootout, you
just hope their first one doesn't go in. You want to get off to a
good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when it comes to a shootout, I tell my team that I'll
save at least three and that I hope they can get three and the
earlier the better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case last weekend, but the way Causey came
through, the other two goals weren't needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of learning as much as I can from Walter and
taking that as far as I can,'' he said. ``I think I'm a more
confident and in-control player than when I first turned pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Causey said the win was ``something we needed to pick us up with
a huge game coming up against Chicago,'' a reference to Saturday's
matchup at Foxboro Stadium against the defending MLS champion
Chicago Fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting pretty low and frustrated because we've been
in all the games we've lost right to the very end. Our defense has
been playing strong and now our offense seems to be ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Striker Giovanni Savarese, who scored twice and assisted on
another goal against the MetroStars, was named MLS Player of the
Week. He now has four goals on the season and 45 all-time, third
best in MLS history &UR; . &LR;

JOCKEY ANTLEY IS RIDING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMONT, N.Y. _ His eyes are lit with intensity, his voice firm
with certainty, and his spirit strong with life.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, for a reborn man, for a man back from the depths, what
Chris Antley did in Baltimore nearly three weeks ago still tickles
the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   No, not winning the Preakness Stakes aboard Charismatic. Not at
all, because the best jockeys are paid to give their best effort,
doing their utmost to win the biggest races. Antley was doing his
job and he did it very well aboard Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   It is what Antley did after the Preakness that still lingers in
the mind. The jockey did not tarry before the TV cameras and give
interview after interview, nor did he rush to the interview room to
tell the print media what it meant to him to be one ride from the
Triple Crown. Indeed, confidence oozed at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   That's because ``Charismatic's Preakness effort was kind of
breathtaking,'' said Antley. ``When I pulled him up after the race,
he raised his head up, cocked one ear, and he had no stress on his
face. He wasn't even blowing. And that's enough to send chills up
your spine, for a horse having been through so much to look that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, jockeys cancel any mounts they have later on
the card after winning a classic race. Instead, even in the
exultation of the moment and the rush he had that the Belmont
Stakes on Saturday might be even better, Antley rushed back to the
jockeys' quarters at Pimlico, changed his silks, rushed off to the
paddock, and was given a leg up on another horse.
</P>
<P>
   Antley, minutes after winning the Preakness, was back on the
track and riding in a mere allowance race. ``A few months ago,'' he
would say, ``if someone told me I could be riding a horse at
Pimlico on Preakness Day, any horse in any race Preakness Day, I
would have thought I was the luckiest man in the world.'' It was
only then, after riding a soon-forgotten horse in a forgettable
race, that Antley took his plaudits for winning the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind, Antley said Wednesday, ``I've already won the
Triple Crown.'' Just by being back on the race track. ``I mean, you
think about a gift,'' he said. ``Charismatic is a gift. I have a
very serene feeling. I am very content, yet I am very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, a colt nobody wanted, is ridden by Antley, a jockey
everybody doubted. That either could be a mere mile and a half from
winning the Triple Crown would be astounding; that the two of them
together are so close to racing immortality would be a figment, a
fantasy, a fantastic improbablity . . . except that it is real.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's owner and trainer virtually wanted to give away
the colt. There were no takers. And when jockeys politicked and
switched and _ well, jockeyed _ for their mounts in the races
leading to the Kentucky Derby, all the top jockeys begged off.
Lafitt Pincay, one of California's best, had ridden Charismatic
seven times, but when Charismatic headed east for the Triple Crown
campaign, Pincay chose to stay home, opting instead to ride a more
promising horse at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCarron, another of California's best, also had ridden
Charismatic but McCarron had another commitments. Mike Smith, one
of New York's best jockeys, also saw promise elsewhere. All of
which left Chris Antley.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Kentucky Derby,'' Antley recalled, he returned to
California, entered the jockeys' room ``and one of the first
persons I saw was Lafitt and he gave me congratulations after the
Derby. Then, after the Preakness, I came in and saw Lafitt and I
said to him, `Lafitt, you were on him most of the time . . .' And
Lafitt looked me straight in the eye, I mean he had that spark in
his eyes, and he told me, `Congratulations.' He said, `Keep it up,'
and `One more.' As a younger rider, to see a Lafitt Pincay give you
that kind of support, it gives you chills.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Antley said, ``It gives you chills.'' From most jockeys,
such words would not be believable but they are so much so with
Antley. Chris Antley has been humbled and he is humble. There is a
wide-eyed innocence now to Antley that, once again, would not be
credible from others in this hard, hard world of horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   The tale has been well-told. Too many controlled substances and
too much weight had driven Antley from the winner's circle, then
from the limelight, and finally from the race track itself. He had
burst upon racing 14 years ago at Monmouth Park in New Jersey, the
hottest of hot apprentices, took the next step up and across the
Hudson River to New York's tracks _ one day winning a total of nine
races at Aqueduct in the afternoon and the Meadowlands in New
Jersey at night _ and was among America's top jockeys. But 18
months ago it seemed over.
</P>
<P>
   His weight ballooned to 148 pounds, more than 30 above his
riding weight. Even his father suggested he find another line of
work and, as far as racing was concerned, Antley's career was done.
But Antley, scraping bottom, was convinced he again could find the
top.
</P>
<P>
   But last November, after running 25 miles day after day at his
home in South Carolina, even Antley himself fell prey to doubts.
The last 10 pounds, the absolutely critical last 10 pounds, just
would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for trainers working their horses now
based on what my legs went through,'' said Antley. ``I had to
change my training schedule because my legs kept breaking down. My
worst time was from Thanksgiving to last Christmas and when I broke
down then, I couldn't walk. I felt for sure then I was going to put
the weight back on.''
</P>
<P>
   The constant pounding of the road work broke down both his knees
(``I have no cartilage in my right knee'') and Antley was forced
from the roads to the gym. ``I had to use exercise equipment to try
and continue to burn myself off. I didn't have a whole lot of fat.
I was about 9 or 10 percent body fat at 125, so I had to go into
the muscle and into myself'' to shed more pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Antley never melted down his core, because the core of
Antley just would not disappear. As he ran those 25 miles, as he
worked in the gym, as he willed footstep after footstep, he thought
mostly ``of putting one foot in front of the other'' but also of
the paramount goal, returning to the track. And when he finally
returned to Santa Anita early this year, ``when I entered the
jocks' room I got the same chill I got from winning the Derby''
which he did with Strike The Gold in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And now that he is back, this serene man is also the hungriest
of jockeys, putting forth a top effort race after race, a trait
seldom seen in veteran riders. When asked to delve into his soul to
explain how he conquered his body, Antley said, ``I'm like
Charismatic, I guess, a $65,000 claimer. I had a lot of growing up
to do, a lot of learning to do, a lot of figuring out what was most
important to me in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is such an innocence to this new Antley. For
instance, when it was mentioned that Belmont fans just might boo
him _ new Antley or no new Antley _ if he does not win Saturday,
the jockey said he didn't think that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas then leaned over and whispered to Antley,
``These are New York fans; they'll boo.' '' Antley slowly shook his
head and said, ``No, they won't boo.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly, a transformation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The post position draw of a 1 1/2-mile race is about as
important as counting the number of worms burrowing through the
dirt on the far turn. For the record, Charismatic drew post
position four, the filly Silverbulletday drew position three, and
Menifee drew outside in position 10. Bob Baffert, Silverbulletday's
trainer, half-joked that the only liability for post three is that
``Charismatic is just outside me and he's bumped my horses in both
the Derby and the Preakness and I hope he doesn't do it a third
time.'' . . . Of more interest, the morning line listed Charismatic
as the 2-to-1 favorite, Menifee the second choice at 7-2, and
Silverbulletday a somewhat-surprising third choice as 4-1 . . .
Lukas, who chastised the media in Louisville Monday and Tuesday,
had only one zinger Wednesday: ``I've grown more tolerable of you
guys.'' Meanwhile, Bob Lewis, Charismatic's owner, tried to douse
the latest flareups between training foes Baffert and Lukas.
Baffert had said last week that his filly was ``the best 3-year-old
in the country'' but Lewis said Baffert had been misquoted, that he
meant she was ``the best 3-year-old filly in the country.'' Lewis
also squelched talk of a possible $100,000 mano-a-mano bet with
Baffert over who would win the Belmont, Silverbulletday or
Charismatic. Lewis had proposed the bet last week after Baffert's
``best horse in the country'' comment.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hsing-Hsing looked as cute as ever Wednesday,
perched against the back wall of his feeding room at the National
Zoo, munching on bamboo shoots. But the giant panda, the survivor
of two that China gave the United States in 1972, is suffering from
kidney failure, and zoo officials said at a news conference
Wednesday afternoon that they could not predict how much longer he
would live.
</P>
<P>
   ``His condition is irreversible but stabilizable,'' said Dr.
Lucy Spelman, a staff veterinarian at the zoo, who described
Hsing-Hsing's weakened condition as inevitable for a carnivore of
his advanced age. Giant pandas in the wild live about 20 years, and
Hsing-Hsing is 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it's a debilitating illness,'' Dr. Spelman added.
``He'll get better, then he'll get worse. All we're doing is buying
time. But we really don't know how long he might live. There are no
models. He is the oldest panda being treated for this condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsing-Hsing's female denmate, Ling-Ling, died of heart failure
at the age of 23 in 1992. At the time, she was the oldest giant
panda in captivity. The National Museum of Natural History, here in
Washington, obtained her skull and skin for its research
collection, and tissue samples were kept at the zoo's veterinary
hospital for study.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials said Hsing-Hsing's death would leave 17 giant
pandas outside China, just 5 of them in North America _ 2 in San
Diego and 3 in Mexico City. Zoologists estimate that 1,000 giant
pandas live in the wild in China, the only country where they exist
outside captivity, and that 100 others are in Chinese zoos.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are among the rarest of animals, replacing
Hsing-Hsing (pronounced SHING-shing) would be difficult under any
circumstances. But National Zoo officials said the effort could be
made more difficult by the especially prickly relations between
China and the United States since NATO's accidental bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and the finding of a
Congressional committee that Beijing had for years made a concerted
effort to steal American nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Shu Ning, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
said that he was ``very sad'' to hear of Hsing-Hsing's illness but
that he was not aware of ``any plans for the time being'' of
China's offering the United States another pair of pandas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to us is have the result of the
investigation of the bombing of our embassy in Yugoslavia,'' he
said. ``Then we'll see what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials said they became aware of Hsing-Hsing's condition
last month, when they noticed a decrease in activity, a loss of
appetite and a drop in weight from his usual 250 pounds or so. An
examination on May 15 found that he had severe kidney dysfunction,
a potentially fatal condition that zoo veterinarians began treating
with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Stevens, the zoo's mammal curator, said more aggressive
treatments, including dialysis, which would have required daily
anesthesia, were not considered prudent because of Hsing-Hsing's
age. A kidney transplant was also ruled out, because no giant-panda
kidneys are available.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing delighted visitors to the zoo
for decades, their lives there were not without troubles, some of
which reflected the severe difficulty of mating pandas in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   From 1983 to 1989, Ling-Ling bore five cubs, all of which died
at birth or shortly thereafter. On six other occasions, she
experienced hormonal changes that resembled those of pregnancy but
produced no offspring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hsing-Hsing has suffered from medical problems over
the years, including an eye infection in 1993 and testicular cancer
four years later that was successfully treated with surgery. More
recently, zoo officials said, he has developed arthritis, which is
common for a mammal of his age.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevens, the mammal curator, said zoo officials were
heartened in the last few days to see Hsing-Hsing's appetite
return. But they continue to list his medical condition as serious.

PANEL RECOMMENDS LIFTING BAN ON `THE PILL' IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a major step toward ending Japan's ban on the birth
control pill, the nation's top medical advisory council suddenly
reversed itself Wednesday and recommended allowing the pill to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the sole industrialized country that bans the pill, a
policy that has been the subject of debate for decades. Some
feminists argue that the ban reflects male domination of Japanese
society and politics.
</P>
<P>
   After the recommendation Wednesday by the advisory council to
Health and Welfare Minister Sohei Miyashita, Miyashita could add
his approval in a few weeks. If he approves, the pill could be
available by autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widespread use of the pill around the world,
Japanese officials have said for years that additional research was
necessary before they could proclaim that the pill was safe for
Japanese women to use. Some officials have also warned that
permitting the pill would encourage promiscuity and reduce reliance
on condoms, leading to the spread of AIDS and sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the government said it needed to delay adoption so
that it could better educate the public about such diseases. Then
last year, there was an environmental scare that the pill, through
human waste, might release certain chemicals into water that would
disrupt the human endocrine system.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of the pill say officials have been worried about
Japan's declining birth rate and the possibility that the pill
could quicken that decline. The health ministry does have strict
standards on introducing foreign medicines, and some products take
years to wind their way through all the regulatory hoops. Even
Tylenol is still not sold here.
</P>
<P>
   But the case for the pill received recent support from another
drug, Viagra. The blue pills, which treat impotence in men, sailed
through the predominantly male ministry and went on sale last
month, six months after the application. In contrast, the
birth-control pill has been under review for at least nine years.
The speedy Viagra approval provoked an uproar from women's groups,
which said the government was discriminating against women. When
the advisory council recommended approval of the pill, it also said
that packaging should include instructions on preventing the spread
of sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier version of instructions, some health officials had
recommended that women on the pill visit a doctor every three
months or so for checkups. Women's groups opposed that.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an approval, however, it may be an uphill battle to
persuade ordinary women to use the pill. The drug has suffered from
years of bad publicity over its side effects, leaving many women
reluctant to use it. Many women have images of the thalidomide
poisonings of the 1950s and '60s, in which women who took the
sedative to prevent morning sickness gave birth to babies with
severe defects. Other women fear that they could become sterile.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the high-dose pill has been sold here legally for
years, not for contraception, but mainly for women with menstrual
disorders. But many women persuade their doctors to prescribe it as
a contraceptive.

 lLINUX  Open-source operating system has turned into a challenge,
if not exactly a threat, to Windows NT in the server market. Could
it now start to make inroads against Win 98 on end users' PCs? At
least two groups now make slick graphical user interfaces for Linux
(KDE and Gnome). Caldera Systems, one of the companies that sells
Linux, has just released a new version that comes with a GUI,
WordPerfect and other apps, and an installer that's supposed to
eliminate most of the hassles that used to be involved in setting
it up. Red Hat and others are moving in the same direction. Is this
just for geeks at home, or could it eventually reach the masses? By

that went on through much of Tuesday night and only ended
mid-afternoon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said ``common approach'' was a
bit of an overstatement. But, the official said, the unity of
purpose was now sufficient to justify a visit to Belgrade late
Wednesday by Chernomyrdin and the Finnish president, Martti
Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that Russia had agreed for the first
time that all Yugoslav forces _ army, police and paramilitary _
should withdraw from Kosovo and that the withdrawal be
substantially under way before any pause in NATO bombing. Perhaps a
few hundred Yugoslav soldiers could return, but only after the
deployment of a 50,000-strong international peacekeeping force,
which would include 7,000 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The West and Russia remain apart, however, on the composition
and the command structure of the peacekeeping forces. Russia is
holding out for a United Nations-controlled force; the West insists
that the force be effectively commanded by NATO. One possible
compromise would give a Russian contingent in Kosovo considerable
independence in day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the top diplomatic adviser to Gerhard Shroeder,
the German chancellor, said diplomacy would now follow two main
tracks over the coming week: an attempt to secure Milosevic's
agreement to the terms reached by the West and Russia and an effort
to pass a United Nations Security Council resolution that reflects
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained far from clear that Milosevic would agree to
terms that appear closer to NATO demands than to the vague
statement by the Group of Seven richest nations and Russia on May 6
that the Yugoslav government has formally accepted. That gap will
be the subject of Ahtisaari's discussions in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made reasonable progress, particularly on the scope and the
timing of the Serbian withdrawal,'' said one U.S. official. ``The
Russians have understood that, for us, all means all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bonn talks were unexpectedly difficult and marked by
brinksmanship that saw Russia threatening to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that Chernomyrdin argued for a pause in
the 71-day-old NATO bombing as a gesture of goodwill, but was
finally swayed by Western arguments that such a break would not
make Milosevic more pliant or more ready to negotiate in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Russia agreed that the Serbian leader must start a
verifiable and substantial withdrawal of his forces before a halt
in the NATO bombardment could be declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the moment there is a realistic chance that the war
will end,'' Chernomyrdin said. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary
of state, who has been shuttling between Washington, Moscow,
Helsinki, Bonn and Brussels, said, ``Increasingly the international
community is speaking with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Russia and the West have shifted their area of
agreement from broad principles that were vague on crucial issues
to the outline of a concrete program to which Milosevic must now
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The principles adopted on May 6 did not stipulate that all
Yugoslav forces must withdraw and alluded only to the deployment of
``effective international civil and security presences'' in Kosovo,
rather than to a NATO-led peacekeeping force on which the Clinton
administration has insisted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was on the question of the make-up of the peacekeeping force
that differences with Russia proved most difficult, American
officials said. ``The Russians are still pushing for a United
Nations-controlled operation, but after Bosnia we learned the
lessons of watered-down command structures,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, between 1992 and 1995, a so-called ``dual-key''
system under which both NATO commanders and senior U.N. officials
had to approve any military action proved unwieldy, ineffective and
sometimes disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Belgrade, Chernomyrdin said that, under a
compromise reached in Bonn for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
``NATO will command NATO forces, Russia the Russian forces.
Relations between the two contingents will be governed by separate
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steiner said this statement should not be taken at face
value. ``Obviously, each politician has his constituency that has
to be satisfied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   European and American officials said that a command structure
similar to the one now governing relations between Russian and
Western forces in Bosnia is being considered. This system involves
a NATO chain of command, although it gives the Russian contingent
there considerable latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a Russian proposal that it take charge of a zone
in the northern part of Kosovo while NATO countries control the
southern part of the province had been rejected because it might
appear to lay the basis for partition.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said it was now crucial to involve the United Nations.
``If what we have now is the basis for a solution, then we must get
it legalized in the Security Council as quickly as possible,''
Steiner said. ``That in turn will give us the political leverage we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   If a Security Council resolution could now be passed calling for
a complete Serbian withdrawal and the deployment of a large
international force with a central NATO presence, as well as the
return of all ethnic Albanian refugees, then the pressure on
Milosevic would clearly increase still further.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that with such a resolution, a full and
formal agreement from Belgrade might not be necessary. ``All we
would need is the absence of a rejection from Milosevic and the
withdrawal of his troops from Kosovo,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear whether China, whose relations with the
United States were soured by the bombing last month of its Belgrade
embassy by NATO, would agree to the resolution and whether wording
could be found that would circumvent Russian objections about the
nature of the peackeeping force.

<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, said, ``We have
some good news, but I do not want to overrate it. We have to remain
skeptical until the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the West have come a long way since the first days of
the NATO bombing, when anger in Moscow was at fever pitch and
rumors were circulating that Russian missiles had been redirected
at European targets.
</P>
<P>
   However the diplomacy now progresses, immense difficulties
appear to remain, not the least being how to convince the divided
Albanian leadership and the Kosovo Liberation Army that any accord
with Milosevic is even remotely credible. The Serbs must also be
convinced that the rebel army can be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the West would apparently be committing itself to a
massive deployment of forces and huge investment of resources in a
state headed by a man indicted on charges of war crimes last week
by the international criminal tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari was expected to report on the results of his talks
with Milosevic to a summit meeting of European leaders in Cologne
on Thursday and Friday. The Finnish president is the highest-level
Western representative to meet with the Yugoslav leader since the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Chirac, the French president, said Wednesday that the
rapprochement between Russia and the West ``undoubtedly opens the
door to a significant chance for a political settlement. In this
situation, I cannot really see how the Serbian authorities could
refuse the solution demanded of them by the whole international
community.''

 &HT;    Bad execution causes CEO failures, Forbes says
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What do the following ex-corporate chief executives
have in common: Ronald Allen of Delta Air Lines, Robert Stempel of
General Motors, Robert Allen of AT&AMP;T and John Akers of IBM?
</P>
<P>
   According to Fortune (June 21), they failed in their jobs at the
top of some of the nation's biggest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men all had what it takes to get to the top. One
weakness brought them down,'' says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness? ``It's bad execution. As simple as that _ not
getting things done, being indecisive, not delivering on
commitments,'' Fortune says.
</P>
<P>
   In today's competitive global economy, chief executives who fail
to master the art of execution ``cannot effectively navigate their
company through ... changes and are being pushed out faster than
ever,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   In stocks, women beat men
</P>
<P>
   Men may be more active in the stock market, but women make more
money at it, Forbes (June 14) says in its 1999 investment guide.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of brokerage accounts by the University of
California at Davis found that single men traded 67 percent more
than single women, but the women's risk-adjusted annual returns
were 2.3 percent higher. Married men traded 45 percent more, but
married women had 1.4 percent better returns.
</P>
<P>
   Men, it seems, are impatient for quick profits, prompting them
to gamble. Women are more cautious, more long-term oriented and
more willing to match their own research with expert opinion,
Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   Downloaded any books?
</P>
<P>
   A book is portable. But a library? In the Internet age, even a
library is portable, Business Week (June 7) points out in unveiling
its industrial-design award winners for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Three different hand-held digital readers won honors in this
year's competition for the best-designed new consumer products. Two
of them are for books and one for an ``electronic newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Information Age devices generally dominated the year's
breakthrough products, ranging from laptop computers to a laser
copier that can sub as a scanner. At a more practical level were
low-cost snowshoes and a disposable Polaroid camera.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine co-sponsors the competition with the Industrial
Designers Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   If traffic is bad now...
</P>
<P>
   The Futurist (June/July) taps Atlanta to be one of 10 ``future
supercities.'' Denver is the other U.S. city on the list.
</P>
<P>
   A supercity has ``a sustainable capability'' to meet its
residents' physical and social needs and a dynamic economy that
attracts and nurtures investment.
</P>
<P>
   Others are Madrid, Spain; Istanbul, Turkey; Bangkok, Thailand;
Vancouver, British Columbia; Wuhan and Shanghai, China; Bangalore,
India; and Cancun-Tulum, Mexico.

 &HT;    U.K. approves Coke-Cadbury deal
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola's $1.1 billion deal to buy Cadbury
Schweppes' brands in 106 nations won approval Wednesday in the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The approval gives Coca-Cola an important regulatory win,
following opposition in other countries that forced it to scale
back the brand buyout in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.K. is a key market,'' said Manny Goldman, global
beverage analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``It's good news. I think they
would like good news in Australia and Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts predict another defeat when Australian
antitrust regulators announce their decision, possibly within the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have asked for reconsideration in Mexico, where
regulators initially rejected the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Greece, a much smaller market, is expected to
approve the deal shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Coca-Cola will buy such Cadbury brands as Dr
Pepper, Canada Dry, Crush and Schweppes. But regulators in some
countries object to the deal as anti-competitive.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, Coca-Cola revised the deal, eliminating 20 European
nations from the agreement, which has never included the United
States, France or South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Cadbury's annual sales volume in the United Kingdom represents
about 60 million cases of the 470 million cases covered by the deal
globally, said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage
Digest. Australia represents about 50 million cases, he said, while
Mexico accounts for 90 million cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted the British government has approved the
transaction,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Randal Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said the deal is expected to close in most nations in
July. Other nations will follow in stages after that.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares fell 50 cents Wednesday to close at $68.62
1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    New union upheld at Northwest
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal labor board has upheld a tiny union's
successful bid to represent jet mechanics at Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board ruled that the Aircraft Mechanics
Fraternal Association's upset election by Northwest mechanics last
fall will stand, despite claims of rule violations by the losing
International Association of Machinists union.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling clears AMFA to renegotiate the mechanics' contract,
which has been in effect since 1996. The union is in the process of
establishing locals and electing officers.
</P>
<P>
   AMFA ousted the powerful Machinists as the mechanics' legal
bargaining agent in November by a vote of 5,160 to 3,905.
</P>
<P>
   But the Machinists appealed, claiming AMFA had violated ballot
secrecy rules and that Northwest had meddled in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling this week, the mediation board concluded ballot
secrecy was compromised through an Internet site that encouraged
AMFA supporters to submit signed copies of their ballots. The site
wasn't run by AMFA, but the board said union officials knew it
existed.
</P>
<P>
   The board found the violation wasn't serious enough to void the
election. As a penalty, it said rival unions can mount new
organizing drives to challenge AMFA after six months, rather than
the customary two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists union said it intends to keep about $400,000 in
dues collected while the election was being contested, citing the
costs of grievances and arbitrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest election came only months after mechanics had
soundly rejected a tentative new contract negotiated by the
Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge win for AMFA, which had been on the fringes of the
airline labor scene for years without much to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   The union claims it can represent highly skilled and in-demand
mechanics better than umbrella unions such as the Machinists, which
also represents about 17,000 other Northwest workers.

SOUTH AFRICA VOTES FOR PRESIDENT TO REPLACE MANDELA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEDOM PARK, South Africa _ Wrapped in blankets against the
cold, South Africans began lining up even before the sun came up
Wednesday, many of them giddy with the excitement of voting for
only the second time in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lines outside voting booths sometimes stretched for nearly a
mile. Though the polls were supposed to close by 9 p.m., many
remained open late into the night to accommodate those who had
stood for hours but had not yet had a chance to mark their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   While some had predicted that South Africa's second
post-apartheid elections would be marked by voter apathy, it was
not evident Wednesday. At the polling stations _ some in schools
and community halls, others in simple tents set up near squatter
camps _ there was a mood of pride and celebration.
</P>
<P>
   First in line outside the voting station here was Beauty Hlela,
42, a mother of five who lives in a shack just yards away. Ms.
Hlela waited for three hours before the polls opened. She accepted
her ballot papers with trembling hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this country today,'' she said, after
voting. ``I wanted to vote for such a long time. That's why I came
early.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of black support, President Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress is virtually assured a victory. The only
real question is by how much. With the 80-year-old Mandela set to
retire, his deputy, Thabo Mbeki, 56 is expected to replace him, on
June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who spent 27 years in jail for his belief that all
South Africans were entitled to vote, cast his ballot early
Wednesday morning near his Johannesburg home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very wonderful occasion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By evening the most report of serious violence had come from the
volatile Richmond area of the KwaZulu-Natal province, where two
people were killed just hours before polling stations opened.
</P>
<P>
   The area has been plagued by political violence in recent years
caused by a turf war between the ANC and a new party, the United
Democratic Movement, started by a former ANC official, Bantu
Holomisa.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, peace reigned as voters waited patiently, sometimes
building fires to warm themselves. In many areas, enterprising
merchants set up stands and sold tea, coffee, fruit and bread to
the voters and a carnival-like atmosphere prevailed. Fears that a
flood of unregistered citizens might arrive at polling stations,
demanding to vote, did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   In the affluent northern suburbs of Johannesburg, some voters
were still in line late in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the vibe is much better this time,'' said Martie
Ramsey. There were bomb scares last time and a certain fear was in
the air. But this is very nice, very calm.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said that 1994 was a bit more special. ``Last time it
was a real worldly occasion,'' said Michel Stefansky, who runs a
computer business and waited three hours to vote. ``This time it's
just a schlep.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's polling operation is far more sophisticated than in
1994, when anyone with an identification document could vote. This
year, the country produced a registration list and demanded that
its citizens get new bar-coded identification documents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were glitches. Some voting stations opened late,
others did not have voting materials on time and officials reported
problems with their bar-code scanning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day, officials said they were unable to reach
dozens of polling stations in the rural area of Eastern Cape
because phones and two-way radios were not working. Some of the
nonworking phones were in public schools that were being used as
polling stations. Unbeknownst to election officials, the schools
had not paid their phone bills and service had been cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The country's election commission began counting votes after 9
p.m. but significant results were not expected until Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   There has been little suspense about which party would win the
elections. The African National Congress has always been out front
in the polls. But its campaign has focused on getting at least
two-thirds of the country's parliamentary seats, a few percentage
points more than the 62.5 percent it won in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Such a gain would give it the power to change some aspects of
the constitution, although Mbeki has said in recent weeks that the
party has no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, political analysts say that that goal, as much as
anything else, would provide the party with a psychological boost
and a moral authority as it goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   The country's opposition parties have seized on this goal in
hopes of mobilizing voters against the ANC, saying that it has too
much power and a strong opposition is needed. But they appear to
have made few inroads into ANC support.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign season, which ended in a barrage of nasty insults
between the parties, has served to highlight South Africa's
continuing racial divisions. Polls indicate that the ANC has
managed to attract very few nonblack voters.
</P>
<P>
   Two white-led parties, the liberal Democratic Party and the New
National Party, which ruled during apartheid, have been locked in a
fierce battle over the rest of the population: whites, mixed race
and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   As many voters went to the polls they expressed concern over the
two issues that dominate conversation here: rising crime and a
jobless rate estimated as high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such problems, many black voters said that the ANC had
earned another five years in office. Many say that Mandela, though
beloved, was perhaps too old for the job. They are counting on
Mbeki to have a harder edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to give the ANC another chance,'' said Tommy
Mpolokng, a 44-year-old dispatcher in a carpet factory. ``We need
someone who is maybe tougher than Mr. Mandela.''
</P>
<P>
   But whites, mixed-race and Indian voters often said they felt
the ANC did not have their interests at heart. At a last-minute
rally for Tony Leon, the Democratic Party leader, Margaret Jones,
59, said she liked Leon's ``Fight Back'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ANC doesn't care about us,'' said Mrs. Jones, who lives in
the mixed-race neighborhood of Eldorado Park near Johannesburg.
``You never see them doing anything here. We have nothing for the
youth here. They do not pay any attention to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ANC is expected to sweep the national vote, it
could lose in the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town
and nearby farming and fishing towns.
</P>
<P>
   The province was the only one that the New National Party held
on to in the 1994 elections. Parts of it are relatively wealthy, it
is the country's prime tourist destination, and it produces most of
the fruit and wine the country exports. One of the National Party's
strongest campaign points was its claim that the province was
better-governed over the last five years than any other in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As he cast his vote at 7 a.m. Wednesday in the Pinelands section
of Cape Town, Ebrahim Rasool, the ANC's leader in the province,
said the outcome would be ``a test of logistics.'' The race was so
close, he predicted, that it would depend on which party was best
at reminding its members to vote or driving them to the polls.

of the collective unconscious of the '90s. One Tiananmen story that

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Helen McLaughlin was 73 when she died from what her
relatives call a mixup in prescription drugs. In death, she joined
a group that is causing increasing anxiety among health care
experts and federal regulators: the tens of thousands of Americans
who are killed each year not by illness, but by medication intended
to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Mrs. McLaughlin, a widow who lived with her two
daughters in Elizabeth, N.J., walked into the pharmacy department
of the local ShopRite supermarket to fill a prescription for
chlorpromazine, an anti-psychotic medication. She walked out,
according to her son Charles and a lawyer who is suing ShopRite on
behalf of her family, with a drug that has a nearly identical name,
chlorpropamide, which is used by diabetics to lower their blood
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly serious mistake, the family said. Mrs.
McLaughlin suffered from diabetes, and was already taking
medication for it. She took the new drug in addition to her regular
pills for three weeks when she was admitted to Elizabeth General
Medical Center with dangerously low blood sugar. That, McLaughlin
said, unleashed a cascade of health problems for his mother,
including stomach ulcers and a drug-resistant bacterial infection.
She died on May 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ShopRite officials, citing the lawsuit, declined comment. But
Charles McLaughlin, who works as an ultrasound technician at
Montefiore Medical Center, said he finds it difficult to comprehend
that his mother died from a medication she didn't need, or ask for.
``I work in a hospital,'' he said. ``I know that errors occur. But
on the other hand there has to be some sort of failsafe system to
prevent things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no failsafe system, a fact that is becoming
increasingly apparent to officials at the Food and Drug
Administration, as well as independent drug safety experts. They
say Helen McLaughlin's death highlights a pervasive and dangerous
problem: with more medications on pharmacy shelves than ever
before, and more prescriptions being written, the nation's health
care system is overwhelmed, creating a growing risk that patients
will be killed or hurt by adverse reactions or mistakes.
Regulators, even after approving a new drug, cannot always predict
all potential side effects, or toxic interactions. Many pharmacists
are overworked, and filling more prescriptions with less help. And
with as many as a dozen medications available for any one ailment,
doctors are having a hard time keeping abreast of FDA warnings
about possible risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many new drugs available. And keeping
current with the information that goes with each drug has become
almost impossible,'' said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, undersecretary for
health at the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Washington. ``The
system is just not designed to help the practitioner.''
</P>
<P>
   The true scope of the problem is unknown, in part because
hospitals and doctors are not required to report it.
</P>
<P>
   But recent studies lead scientists to think that prescription
drugs are killing and injuring far more people than previously
believed, and experts estimate two-thirds of the deaths and
injuries could be prevented. Last year, a study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association estimated that 106,000 hospital
patients die and 2.2 million are injured each year by adverse
reactions to prescription drugs, not including cases where errors
are involved. The estimate was the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, in 1995, Dr. Lucian Leape, a health policy
analyst at the Harvard School of Public Health, found that 6.5
percent of patients at two teaching hospitals in Boston had been
injured by their medicines, and one third of these cases involved
mistakes like those that killed Helen McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials are convinced the danger is growing. In a recently
released 150-page report, they called for pharmacists, doctors,
hospitals and drug companies to work together to create ``a new
framework'' for cutting down on the risks from the drugs the agency
approves. On Tuesday, meanwhile, the FDA put a new rule into
effect: requiring the manufacturers of some especially risky drugs
to distribute explicit warning pamphlets to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being harmed and some of the harm is preventable,''
said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research. ``All of these things are raising alarm
bells in people's minds that there is a potential for even more
serious problems. And the problem is pretty serious right now.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESSURES So Many Drugs, So Little Time
</P>
<P>
   That medications pose a public health threat is, in a sense,
testimony as much to medicine's success as its failure. As Leape
put it, ``Adverse drug events are a disease of medical progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical manufacturers are discovering new ways to treat
more diseases and conditions, from impotence to diabetes. The FDA,
long criticized as moving too slowly on drug applications, is now
approving products at a record-setting pace. And patients are
living longer with illnesses that could not be treated before.
</P>
<P>
   More prescriptions are being written, not only because there are
more drugs but because the population is aging; the elderly take
more than one third of all drugs that are prescribed. In 1992,
according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, 2.03
billion prescriptions were dispensed in retail pharmacies; by last
year, the figure was up to 2.78 billion. By the year 2005, the
association estimates, it will be 4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies, pressed like other health care providers by the cost
controls of managed care, are struggling to fill the higher volume
of prescriptions in less time, and with less help. ``I worked
12-hour days, and if you get to the bathroom once a day, you're
fortunate,'' said Adle Joseph, a pharmacist in Leesburg, Va., who
spent 35 years with the Rite Aid chain before retiring last year to
join a slower-paced, independent store. ``The conditions are just
not conducive to good safety.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, for instance, an investigation turned up
numerous prescription errors and lax safety procedures at Rite Aid
stores last year; documents provided by the state Board of Pharmacy
show that pharmacists complained that ``long work hours and
inadequate staffing'' contributed to their mistakes. The company
said only a few of the errors posed any danger to patients; it
settled the administrative charges with a $50,000 payment and
promised to make sure its procedures follow state law.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, too, are overloaded. Two decades ago, physicians
familiarized themselves with a relatively small pharmacopeia and
prescribed the same drugs again and again. Today, the choice of
medicines rests not only with doctors, but also with managed care
companies, which buy drugs in bulk to reduce costs and list them on
formularies that can change each month.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Providence,
R.I., Dr. Jeannette Chirico-Post, the hospital's chief of staff,
says she is concerned about how complicated prescribing drugs has
become. ``We have more drugs at our fingertips,'' she said, ``and
the potential for drug-drug interaction is far greater than we saw
10 or 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And while computer technology is available to help physicians
avoid mistakes and screen for dangerous combinations of drugs, few
hospitals and even fewer private doctors have it. Those that do say
the systems can produce so many false alarms they are nearly
impossible to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using medications in ways that we never used them
before,'' said Michael Cohen, president of the Institute for Safe
Medication Practices, a nonprofit organization investigates
prescription drug errors. He said the mistake in Mrs. McLaughlin's
case could have been avoided with clearer labeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies aren't keeping up with the times and
labeling their products as safely as they need to,'' he said. ``We
haven't developed the technology to prevent patient harm or we are
not incorporating it, because we say it's too expensive. We are not
investing the resources that we need to protect patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Sanchez lost his life for lack of such safeguards. He was
born healthy on Oct. 15, 1996, in a community hospital in a Denver
suburb. His mother had a history of syphilis; a neonatologist
prescribed a long-acting form of penicillin to keep the baby from
becoming infected. But a series of mistakes, uncovered by Cohen's
institute, which examined the death at the hospital's request, took
the newborn's life.
</P>
<P>
   A pharmacist misread the doctor's handwriting and delivered 10
times the proper dose, leading the nurses to confuse the medicine
with a newer generation of drugs that are administered differently.
Miguel's medication, a milky white suspension, was supposed to be
injected in the thigh muscle; typically, only clear liquids are
given in the veins. But the baby's nurses worried that such a huge
injection into a muscle would hurt the tiny infant. To complicate
matters, some new opaque suspension drugs had been approved by the
government for intravenous use. The nurses checked two medical
texts to see if the drug could be given intravenously, and found no
warnings against it. So they injected Miguel's penicillin into a
vein in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   The baby had a heart attack and died an hour later. ``It was
devastating,'' said Pat McCadden, the risk manager at Centura St.
Anthony North Hospital in Westminster, Colo., where Miguel spent
his brief life. ``Everybody had a hard time believing this could
happen, because these were very knowledgeable, experienced
nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ERRORS: Medication Threat Often Lies in Use
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of ways that people can be killed or injured
by their medicine. Outright mistakes, as occurred with Mrs.
McLaughlin and Miguel, are one; some experts say these medication
errors account for a third to one half of all cases. Known side
effects, including dangerous interactions between drugs, are
another. Unforeseen side effects, which do not turn up in testing
but become apparent after a drug comes into widespread use, are a
third.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, these are known as ``adverse drug events,'' and in
recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has been troubled
by a string of them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Posicor, a high blood pressure medicine, was withdrawn from
the market last year, but not because the drug was harmful on its
own. Rather, Posicor became lethal in combination with a long list
of other drugs, so many that the FDA felt that doctors and
consumers could not keep abreast of the risks. FDA officials said
that 24 people taking Posicor in the 11 months it was on the market
had died, and that two or three of those deaths were directly tied
to Posicor, although a spokeswoman for Roche Laboratories of
Nutley, N.J., the drug's maker, has said ``no causal link'' was
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   _ The diabetes drug Rezulin, approved two years ago, can cause
liver damage, which prompted the FDA to issue repeated warnings to
doctors to closely monitor patients taking it. But an agency
investigation found that doctors were not listening; only 2.7
percent of patients taking Rezulin for three months were being
monitored according to the agency's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in March, the FDA and Rezulin's manufacturer,
Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains,
N.J., agreed that 43 people had suffered acute liver failure that
was possibly due to the drug; of these, 28 died. A panel of
independent scientific experts has recommended that the drug be
prescribed only to patients who do not respond to other therapy.

 WASHINGTON: other therapy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ The best-selling arthritis drug Celebrex, which was approved
by the FDA in January and has already been prescribed to more than
2 million people, is repeatedly being confused by doctors and
pharmacists with two other drugs: Cerebyx, an anti-seizure
medication, and Celexa, an antidepressant. The FDA has already
received 41 reports of the wrong prescription being filled; in one,
an 81-year-old woman wound up taking two antidepressants for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any serious injuries, thank goodness,'' said
Dr. Jerry Phillips, the FDA official who keeps tabs on medication
errors, referring to Celebrex. He is trying to persuade Monsanto
Co., which manufactures the drug, to change Celebrex's name, a
difficult task given that the company has spent tens of millions of
dollars advertising and promoting the medication.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Phillips said, the FDA is planning to install
computer software that will analyze proposed drug names to avoid
such confusion in the future. But at least one expert, Leape of
Harvard, said the agency should have taken that step years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA has essentially focused on the safety of the product,
whereas the major threat has to do with safety of use and misuse,''
Leape said. ``Their point of view has been that it is safe and
effective when used as directed, and the directions are on the
label, so read it. We have come to them repeatedly and said, `That
is not enough.' People make mistakes, even when it is all there.'''
</P>
<P>
   THE DRUG STORES: Pharmacists Tell Tales of Overwork
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one in health care is as acutely aware of the
potential harm of prescription drugs than pharmacists. Yet
pharmacists say little attention is paid to the difficulties they
face in today's complex health care environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Leesburg Pharmacy in Leesburg, Va., is a case in point. On a
warm and sunny afternoon recently, half a dozen patients were lined
up behind the counter waiting for their prescriptions to be filled;
others milled about the store. A series of bins with prescription
slips and medications formed a queue along the green formica
countertop. All told, 49 prescriptions were in one stage or another
of preparation. ``And this is a slow day,'' said chief pharmacist
Greg Chase,
</P>
<P>
   Leesburg is an independent pharmacy and, like pharmacies around
the nation, its profits are being squeezed by lowered
reimbursements from managed care companies. So it makes up the
difference in volume. The store fills about 300 prescriptions per
day, a 50 percent increase from three years ago, according to its
owner, Bruce Roberts. He said that leaves little time for
pharmacists to talk to patients about how to take their medication,
something experts say is essential if drugs are to be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medications have become much more complex, and the
interactions among these complex drugs is greater than it was in
years gone by,'' Roberts said. ``With managed care and pharmacists
being stretched to the limit, there is just no way that you can
provide the service that we really need to be able to educate the
populace as to the dangers of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roberts is trying. He has set up a private consultation
counter for patients who have questions. He has purchased a robot,
at a cost of $175,000, that can dispense the 200 most commonly
prescribed medications, a system that not only frees up pharmacists
to do more counseling but can also cut down on mistakes. And he has
diversified, selling gifts and offering lactation consulting and
other services so that he can afford the salaries of his three
full-time pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   That is a relief to Chase; he came to Leesburg Pharmacy two
years ago from a chain drug store, CVS, where three pharmacists
filled 600 prescriptions per day and often worked 12 hours straight
to do it. ``You've gone four to five hours without even a chance to
go to the restroom,'' he said, echoing the complaints of his
colleague, Joseph, who previously worked at the Rite Aid chain.
``Your mind is fried.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at CVS Pharmacy, which owns 4,100 drug stores in the
United States, and Rite Aid Corp., which owns 3,800 stores, said
they have no evidence that more mistakes are being made. But they
are concerned about workplace pressures, and are taking a number of
steps, including greater use of robots, to ease the burden. As
members of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the
companies are also sponsoring research by a University of
Cincinnati psychology professor who is examining ways to reduce
pharmacy errors.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Tony Grasha, said in an interview that mistakes
occur when psychosocial factors, such as stress at home, combine
with a higher workload. He said his studies show errors are rare,
about 0.5 percent of all prescriptions filled, and that those that
pose a danger to patients are rarer still. But, he said, with the
number of prescriptions growing, mistakes are serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tiny fraction percentage-wise,'' he said, ``but when
you are filling 3 billion prescriptions a year and are anticipating
4 billion by the year 2005, then even a very small percentage is a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state pharmacy officials are also worried. In addition to
the action against Rite Aid in Washington state, officials in North
Carolina are trying to force drug stores to cut back on
pharmacists' hours and to require lunch and bathroom breaks in an
effort to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Board of Pharmacy has also decided that when
a pharmacist who fills more than 150 prescriptions in a day makes
an error, both the pharmacist and the store will be held liable,
and face a possible license suspension or revocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our discipline actions are going up,'' said David Work, the
board's executive director, ``and errors are a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers are an important part of the pharmacy safety net, but
they have limitations. When Chase typed in the name of a
23-year-old patient who had been prescribed an anti-psychotic
medication, his computer issued a warning that the drug could be
dangerous in combination with another prescription in the patient's
file.

 WASHINGTON: patient's file.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the system presumes that a patient goes to the same pharmacy
every time. And the computers raise so many red flags, without
distinguishing the serious from the benign, that pharmacists grow
weary of them and start to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rite Aid case in Washington, one pharmacist dispensed a
drug with instructions for the patient to take triple the proper
dose, an order that, state officials said, would have resulted in a
computer alert. The message was apparently ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like crying wolf,'' said Susan Winckler, director of
policy and legislation for the American Pharmaceutical Association,
which represents 52,000 pharmacists. ``Some pharmacists call it
`the right hand syndrome.' You just hit the return key when you see
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, said most
pharmacy computer systems need serious improvement. In a recent
study, he asked 307 hospital pharmacies to fill 10 different drug
orders that had killed patients in 1998. Some contained an
overdose. Others called for two drugs that were deadly in
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were outrageous,''he said. Only four of the 307
pharmacies detected all 10 unsafe orders.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTIONS: Easing the Burden With Technology
</P>
<P>
   Deaths and injuries from drugs are vastly underreported, experts
say, in part because doctors fear civil lawsuits or, worse,
prosecution. When Miguel Sanchez died, Adams County, Colo.,
District Attorney Bob Grant brought charges of criminally negligent
homicide against three nurses who cared for the baby. Two pleaded
guilty in exchange for two years' probation; another was acquitted
at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They failed to perceive a substantial risk that the death of a
child would occur,'' Grant said. ``That's criminal negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen disagrees; in the wake of Miguel's death, he said, he
uncovered 54 procedural shortcomings that contributed to the
mistakes that killed the boy, from a hospital pharmacist who lacked
training in how to properly dose drugs for infants to unclear
labeling on the syringe to the textbooks that lacked crucial
warnings. Had any of the 54 been corrected prior to Miguel's birth,
he said, the baby might be alive today.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCadden, the hospital's risk manager, acknowledged the
flaws and said that, under Cohen's guidance, the hospital had taken
a variety of steps: ``Any medication going to the nursery is now
checked by two pharmacists. Two nurses in the nursery will also
double-check the medication.'' The hospital also hired a pediatric
pharmacist, ordered new textbooks and conducted educational
sessions for its staff. And Ms. McCadden, along with the three
nurses, have told their story to other hospitals and at
conferences, in an effort to educate other professionals. ``We've
done a lot of talking,'' Ms. McCadden said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the health care system can be designed to minimize
mistakes and drug dangers is one that has been promoted heavily by
Leape. He said, ``Errors are symptoms of a sick system, not a sick
person. Humans make mistakes. To the extent you can redesign around
that, you can get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the FDA could require pharmaceutical
companies to standardize their drug labels for easy reading.
Medicines could come with bar codes, so that pharmacists could use
scanners to check for the correct name, the same way a grocery
store clerk scans a jar of pickles. Doctors could trade their
prescription pads in for computers.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas are beginning to catch on in some unlikely places.
Two years ago, Kizer of the VA launched a major patient safety
initiative designed, in part, to minimize prescription drug errors
at the nation's 172 veterans hospitals and clinics. Over the next
two years, the department intends to spend $40 million on
technology that will allow doctors to use computers to write their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Providence,
R.I., a stately brick building that, from the outside at least,
looks anything but high-tech, the results are already in evidence.
Here, doctors still walk around with prescription pads in their lab
coat pockets, but only out of habit. They haven't used them since
December, except to prescribe narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   A computer terminal is in every examining room. Wireless
portable units (the hospital has installed optic fiber cables in
the ceiling) are on rolling carts in the hospital corridors. When a
doctor enters a prescription into the computer, it is checked and
double-checked. The machine rejects spelling errors, or overdoses,
and scans the patient's medical record for potentially dangerous
interactions with drugs prescribed by other doctors. The computer
then sends the order electronically to the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis of a similar system at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, Leape found that medication errors were reduced
by 80 percent. But hospitals have been slow to get rid of
prescription pads; according to Cohen, 12 percent of the nation's
hospitals have the capability for computerized prescription
writing, but only 6 percent use it.
</P>
<P>
   That is in part because not all doctors are enthusiastic about
it. When Dr. Chirico-Post, the chief of staff at the Providence VA,
announced that her hospital would be among the first in the
Veterans Health Administration to switch to computers, some doctors
complained that they didn't know how to type. Others argued it
would take too much time. And even those who like the system say it
has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dawna Blake, chief of the hospital's primary-care practice,
said she welcomes the warnings the system issues when she is
writing a prescription. ``It gives you a lot of nice reminders,''
she said. But, she said, the machine does slow her down; she still
takes patient notes by hand, and then enters them into the computer
at the end of the day. ``I can't sit there and enter my notes when
the patient is in the room,'' she said. ``To me, that's a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments did not deter Dr. Chirico-Post. With a hospital
pharmacy filling more than 500,000 drug orders for inpatients each
year, and another 500,000 outpatient prescriptions, she said, the
potential for errors and dangerous interactions is too great to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of working in the operating room,'' she said,
''dispensing a drug, giving a drug to the patient, is one of the
most dangerous things we do.'' &QL;

RUSSIA AND THE WEST MOVE CLOSER ON PRINCIPLES FOR ENDING WAR IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf to correct spelling of Schroder) (See also KOSOVO-PLANE) 
(rm) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Russia and the West on Wednesday narrowed their
differences over the concrete measures required to end the war in
Kosovo, limiting the room for maneuvering by Slobodan Milosevic,
the Yugoslav president, and increasing the pressure on him to reach
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found a common approach,'' said Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, after a marathon
negotiating session in Bonn with American and European officials
that went on through much of Tuesday night and only ended
mid-afternoon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said ``common approach'' was a
bit of an overstatement. But, the official said, the unity of
purpose was now sufficient to justify a visit to Belgrade late
Wednesday by Chernomyrdin and the Finnish president, Martti
Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that Russia had agreed for the first
time that all Yugoslav forces _ army, police and paramilitary _
should withdraw from Kosovo and that the withdrawal be
substantially under way before any pause in NATO bombing. Perhaps a
few hundred Yugoslav soldiers could return, but only after the
deployment of a 50,000-strong international peacekeeping force,
which would include 7,000 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The West and Russia remain apart, however, on the composition
and the command structure of the peacekeeping forces. Russia is
holding out for a United Nations-controlled force; the West insists
that the force be effectively commanded by NATO. One possible
compromise would give a Russian contingent in Kosovo considerable
independence in day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the top diplomatic adviser to Gerhard Schroder,
the German chancellor, said diplomacy would now follow two main
tracks over the coming week: an attempt to secure Milosevic's
agreement to the terms reached by the West and Russia and an effort
to pass a United Nations Security Council resolution that reflects
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained far from clear that Milosevic would agree to
terms that appear closer to NATO demands than to the vague
statement by the Group of Seven richest nations and Russia on May 6
that the Yugoslav government has formally accepted. That gap will
be the subject of Ahtisaari's discussions in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made reasonable progress, particularly on the scope and the
timing of the Serbian withdrawal,'' said one U.S. official. ``The
Russians have understood that, for us, all means all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bonn talks were unexpectedly difficult and marked by
brinksmanship that saw Russia threatening to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that Chernomyrdin argued for a pause in
the 71-day-old NATO bombing as a gesture of goodwill, but was
finally swayed by Western arguments that such a break would not
make Milosevic more pliant or more ready to negotiate in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Russia agreed that the Serbian leader must start a
verifiable and substantial withdrawal of his forces before a halt
in the NATO bombardment could be declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at the moment there is a realistic chance that the war
will end,'' Chernomyrdin said. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary
of state, who has been shuttling between Washington, Moscow,
Helsinki, Bonn and Brussels, said, ``Increasingly the international
community is speaking with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Russia and the West have shifted their area of
agreement from broad principles that were vague on crucial issues
to the outline of a concrete program to which Milosevic must now
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The principles adopted on May 6 did not stipulate that all
Yugoslav forces must withdraw and alluded only to the deployment of
``effective international civil and security presences'' in Kosovo,
rather than to a NATO-led peacekeeping force on which the Clinton
administration has insisted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was on the question of the make-up of the peacekeeping force
that differences with Russia proved most difficult, American
officials said. ``The Russians are still pushing for a United
Nations-controlled operation, but after Bosnia we learned the
lessons of watered-down command structures,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, between 1992 and 1995, a so-called ``dual-key''
system under which both NATO commanders and senior U.N. officials
had to approve any military action proved unwieldy, ineffective and
sometimes disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Belgrade, Chernomyrdin said that, under a
compromise reached in Bonn for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
``NATO will command NATO forces, Russia the Russian forces.
Relations between the two contingents will be governed by separate
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steiner said this statement should not be taken at face
value. ``Obviously, each politician has his constituency that has
to be satisfied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   European and American officials said that a command structure
similar to the one now governing relations between Russian and
Western forces in Bosnia is being considered. This system involves
a NATO chain of command, although it gives the Russian contingent
there considerable latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a Russian proposal that it take charge of a zone
in the northern part of Kosovo while NATO countries control the
southern part of the province had been rejected because it might
appear to lay the basis for partition.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said it was now crucial to involve the United Nations.
``If what we have now is the basis for a solution, then we must get
it legalized in the Security Council as quickly as possible,''
Steiner said. ``That in turn will give us the political leverage we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   If a Security Council resolution could now be passed calling for
a complete Serbian withdrawal and the deployment of a large
international force with a central NATO presence, as well as the
return of all ethnic Albanian refugees, then the pressure on
Milosevic would clearly increase still further.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that with such a resolution, a full and
formal agreement from Belgrade might not be necessary. ``All we
would need is the absence of a rejection from Milosevic and the
withdrawal of his troops from Kosovo,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear whether China, whose relations with the
United States were soured by the bombing last month of its Belgrade
embassy by NATO, would agree to the resolution and whether wording
could be found that would circumvent Russian objections about the
nature of the peackeeping force.

</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, said, ``We have
some good news, but I do not want to overrate it. We have to remain
skeptical until the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the West have come a long way since the first days of
the NATO bombing, when anger in Moscow was at fever pitch and
rumors were circulating that Russian missiles had been redirected
at European targets.
</P>
<P>
   However the diplomacy now progresses, immense difficulties
appear to remain, not the least being how to convince the divided
Albanian leadership and the Kosovo Liberation Army that any accord
with Milosevic is even remotely credible. The Serbs must also be
convinced that the rebel army can be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the West would apparently be committing itself to a
massive deployment of forces and huge investment of resources in a
state headed by a man indicted on charges of war crimes last week
by the international criminal tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari was expected to report on the results of his talks
with Milosevic to a summit meeting of European leaders in Cologne
on Thursday and Friday. The Finnish president is the highest-level
Western representative to meet with the Yugoslav leader since the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Chirac, the French president, said Wednesday that the
rapprochement between Russia and the West ``undoubtedly opens the
door to a significant chance for a political settlement. In this
situation, I cannot really see how the Serbian authorities could
refuse the solution demanded of them by the whole international
community.''

HOUSTON LAWYER IN TOBACCO FEE FIGHT WAIVES CLAIM TO $1 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Marc Murr, a Houston lawyer whose role in the
state's tobacco case is being investigated by federal authorities,
has waived any claim to $1 million in legal fees he was awarded in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Murr also has returned $81,875 that cigarette makers already had
paid him under an award set late last year by a national
arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
   The fees were waived in a letter that Murr and his lawyer, Roy
Minton of Austin, wrote to tobacco lawyer Meyer G. Koplow of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The letter offered no explanation, and Minton declined to
discuss it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was dated May 25, five days after federal prosecutors
subpoenaed records of Texas Attorney General John Cornyn's
investigation of Murr. Cornyn's records are to be turned over to a
federal grand jury meeting June 15 in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has accused former Attorney General Dan Morales and Murr,
a longtime Morales friend, of doctoring contracts to try to
fraudulently secure $260 million in legal fees for Murr.
</P>
<P>
   Murr dropped his $260 million claim May 6, one day after Cornyn
made his allegations in a document filed in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has denied Cornyn's allegations and has insisted that
Murr played a crucial role in the tobacco case, which Texas settled
last year for $17.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawyers have said that Murr did little work on the
case, and his name didn't publicly surface until about the time the
lawsuit was settled in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Morales hasn't been subpoenaed, one of his attorneys, Sam
Millsap of San Antonio, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Millsap said the subpoena for Cornyn's records was an
``appropriate step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office, we'll have an
even-handed, unbiased review. When that is through, we're confident
there will be a determination of no wrongdoing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Millsap said Cornyn, a Republican, was trying to
politically damage Morales, a Democrat, so that the former attorney
general could never run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Minton said he wasn't surprised that federal authorities had
demanded the state's records. He said Murr hadn't been subpoenaed.

Jingsheng, the dissident forced into exile in the United States, of
the day exactly a decade ago when Beijing's rulers massacred
Chinese students and workers demonstrating for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Wei was in prison at the time for advocating freedom on
``Democracy Wall'' years before. He was allowed to watch the
official television news, and saw a man standing in front of a
tank, arresting its progress.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not the same picture that was front-paged all over
the world. The other confrontation, the one Wei was watching, took
place in front of the Military Museum, three miles from Tiananmen
Square, where much of the bloody work was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many other examples of courage,'' says Wei.
``Chinese people will never forget what happened that day.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to have dinner with Wei this week because I admire
anti-Communist dissidents. When names like Jiang and Clinton and
Brezhnev are forgotten, memories of this century's heroic
dissidents _ Andrei Sakharov, Anatoly Shcharansky and Wei Jingsheng
_ will endure.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they have done what no politician or
Kremlinologist or China-watcher dreamed of doing. By publicly
daring the most despotic systems to do their worst to silence them,
the dissidents of our time _ like the biblical Job _ awoke the
world's conscience to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wei is a stocky, intelligent man with a shock of black hair, a
quick smile and an uncompromising attitude who has some other
dissidents here wishing he had stayed in jail another 18 years. Of
their disunity, he says: ``If you can find an American leader who
unifies the people, I will go and study with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Are most Chinese angry at the United States?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communist leaders are trying to channel dissatisfaction
against Westerners, and against pro-Western Chinese. But people are
not sheep to be so easily manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Chinese reaction to being caught lifting our nuclear
technology?
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be good for the democracy movement for me to say
this, but you cannot fault the Chinese government for stealing
secrets. Many people always thought the United States was leaking
the secrets to Beijing on purpose, along with the technology being
sold, and are confused about why you now take offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The top leaders?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang Zemin, whose son is a billionaire, blows with the wind.
Li Peng is a hard-liner with limited intelligence. Zhu Rongji tries
to save the ship from sinking, but to what end _ to prolong the
life of the Communist Party? Befuddling.''
</P>
<P>
   The People's Liberation Army?
</P>
<P>
   ``The PLA is not a seamless entity. There is a faction of high
officers who benefit from corruption, and another of lower rank who
dissent from corruption. In that situation, accidents and coups can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What's with the demonstration by 15,000 Falun Gong followers
outside the leaders' compound?
</P>
<P>
   ``When regimes weaken,'' said Wei, ``popular religious movements
and superstitions become significant. There are a hundred sects
like Falun Gong, which means that people long for faith in some
ideology, a new source of guidance. The government recognizes the
danger and is anxious for ways to control their growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Is China playing the Russian card against America?
</P>
<P>
   He smiled at the allusion to a reverse Nixonian strategy: ``The
deputy prime minister, Qian Qichen, wants to draw in Russia to
bolster China against the United States, but Primakov was more
concerned about dealing with NATO. Now Primakov's gone, and we'll
have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, T-Day plus 10 years, President Clinton will issue a
statement challenging Congress to extend ``most favored nation''
trade privileges to China for another year. (Spinmeisters in the
pro-China lobby are trying to change that historic phrase to
``normal trade relations'' to make it more palatable, and many in
the media will meekly obey.)
</P>
<P>
   I think Congress should vote to suspend trade privileges for
China. Clinton will veto the bill and the Senate will sustain his
veto, giving China its annual reprieve. That minuet is a good way
of reminding Beijing how dependent it is on the American market _
just as patriots like Wei Jingsheng remind us how the spark of
democratic spirit is alive among Chinese.

NEW DRUG OPENS UP OPTIONS IN MARROW TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Using a new drug, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute have shown they can safely perform transplants for cancer
patients from genetically mismatched bone marrow donors _ a
procedure that up to now has been virtually doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Scientifically, the feat is being hailed because the researchers
proved, for the first time, that they can neutralize a tiny,
specific cadre of immune system cells in the donor marrow _ while
leaving the vast majority intact _ to prevent the marrow cells from
attacking the patient's tissues.
</P>
<P>
   This complication, known as graft-versus-host disease, is common
in mismatched transplants and can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Medically, the Dana-Farber researchers called the results ``a
glimpse into the future'' of transplantation, when the use of
donated bone marrow or other organs and tissues won't require the
patient to take lifelong regimens of punishing, toxic,
anti-rejection drugs. Because these drugs suppress the entire
immune system, they leave patients vulnerable to infections and
other cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the advance suggests that not too far in the future
cancer patients needing transplants may not have to spend the
$25,000 or more often required, and an uncertain wait, to find a
genetically compatible donor through a transplant registry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``parents, siblings and children may soon be eligible
to serve as donors for each other, regardless of how well they
match, without the complications that are so often associated with
transplantation today,'' said Dr. David G. Nathan, president of
Dana-Farber and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting and important research finding,'' said Dr.
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Disease, which funded the study. It is another step, he
added, toward the goal ``of not having to chronically
immunosuppress people'' who receive transplants.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; today &LR; 's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, the
scientists report that they used the new technique in carrying out
bone marrow transplants in 12 young patients with leukemia that had
reoccurred despite standard therapies. In the transplants, the
patients received massive doses of chemotherapy and radiation to
kill all the leukemia cells. Afterward, they received transplants
of bone marrow cells to rebuild their blood and immune systems that
were destroyed by the drastic treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The patients had been unlucky in that transplants were their
only hope, genetically matched donors were not available, and time
was running out. In the experiment, they received marrow from
donors who were only 50 percent genetically matched _ a situation
in which few medical centers will even try a transplant because the
risk of complications is so high.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people took a big risk'' on the experimental treatment,
``but it came out better than we had hoped,'' said Dr. Lee Nadler,
in whose DFCI lab much of the work was done.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Drs. Eva Guinan and John G. Gribben, the DFCI team
exploited a recently discovered ``on-off switch'' in immune cells,
enabling them to switch off only the T-cells (advance scouts in the
immune defenses) in the donor bone marrow that recognize the
recipient's tissues as ``foreign.'' That conflict between bone
marrow cells and a mismatched recipient often leads to severe
graft-versus-host disease that is a major cause of complications
and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The key step in the experimental transplants took place in a $1
million laboratory, built at DFCI with National Institutes of
Health funds. While the startup cost for the new technique is high,
the Dana-Farber researchers said that ultimately it may save money
by dramatically reducing complications.
</P>
<P>
   Before the recipients got their big blast of chemo and
radiation, the researchers removed from them the white blood cells
that signal whether a tissue is that of the patient (or ``self'')
or is a foreign tissue that may be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   After irradiating these ``antigen-presenting cells'' to erase
any leukemia cells, the researchers mixed them with all the immune
cells in the bone marrow sample taken from the donor. While
incubating for 36 hours, the T-cells in the bone marrow recognized,
and bound to, the antigen-presenting cells that carried a
distinctive marker identifying them as ``self'' _ from the
patient's point of view _ but ``foreign,'' and therefore a target
to attack _ to the donor's T-cells.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the scientists added a drug made from a
natural immune on-off switch in human T-cells discovered within the
last 10 years. Normally, the T-cells that had recognized the
recipient's tissues would have received a second ``costimulatory''
signal verifying that the tissues were foreign.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug, known as CTLA-4, blocked this second signal. The
result: the T-cells, lacking the second signal, went into a dormant
state, and from then on were unable to recognize the recipient's
``self'' markers or antigens. Put another way, the strategy made
the incoming donor bone marrow ``tolerant'' to the recipient's
biological environment.
</P>
<P>
   The CTLA-4 drug was developed by Repligen Corp. of Needham,
which sponsored the study.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 patients receiving the transplants in the experiment,
seven died of infections, organ failure, or other causes; the five
survivors have remained in complete remission from their leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the 12 developed graft-versus-host disease, and it
was mild. Without the new treatment, at least 80 percent probably
would have developed it, said Dr. Paul Martin, a transplant
specialist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get it down to this low level'' of graft-versus-host
disease ``is a spectacular result,'' said Martin.

MICHIGAN TRIAL PITS FREE-SPEECH AGAINST LAWS PROTECTING TENDER EARS
OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANDISH, Mich. _ If Timothy J. Boomer could keep his balance
better in a canoe, an obscure Michigan law against swearing in
front of women and children might not be tested now.
</P>
<P>
   But Boomer fell into a river when his rented canoe hit a rock
near here last August. What he said then will be the subject of a
criminal trial, which will pit free-speech advocates against local
prosecutors who want to limit public use of offensive language. The
trial is scheduled to start next week.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily publicized prosecution already seems to be prompting
the police in other northern Michigan cities to enforce the
statute, which carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a
$100 fine. Daniel J. Hartman, a lawyer in Petoskey said that one of
his clients had been ticketed in April in Sault Ste. Marie, nearly
300 miles north of Detroit, in connection with cursing at a
customer at his boat-repair business and police officers in front
of the customer's 2-year-old son. Another client in Petoskey, 230
miles northwest of Detroit, was warned recently by the police that
he might be ticketed, accused of swearing at the driver of a school
bus full of children, Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomer case has been featured on national television and
radio talk shows, stirring excitement in Standish, a town of 1,300
people, 125 miles northwest of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody in the United States who hasn't
heard of this case,'' said Jack L. Stoner, the town's part-time
mayor, as he smoked a cigar in his laundromat here.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Vollbach Jr., the 35-year-old, crew-cut assistant
county prosecutor who charged Boomer and who recently took a free
trip to Los Angeles to appear on a television talk show to discuss
the case, said the trial would raise broad issues of civility and
free speech in modern American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of case the U.S. Supreme Court might end up
looking at, in that there are some genuinely interesting First
Amendment issues,'' Vollbach said, crossing forearms across his
dark blue T-shirt as he rocked in a leather chair in his small,
sparsely furnished office.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union has given the case national
prominence by providing free legal advice to Boomer, making him
available to news organizations for interviews and promising to
keep appealing rulings against him to as high a court as necessary
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If successful, the state will effectively criminalize speech
which is heard every day on television and the streets _ it's
trying to legislate morality,'' said Kary L. Moss, the executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan. The
police should use disorderly conduct statutes instead, Ms. Moss
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boomer's jury trial will be the first involving the 102-year-old
law, said Vollbach and William T. Street, a longtime ACLU member
who has volunteered to represent Boomer. In allowing the trial to
proceed, District Court Judge Allen Yenior ruled in February that
though the part of the law regarding use of expletives in front of
women may not be constitutional, the law's provisions regarding use
of obscenities in front of children are justifiable because they
protect minors.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in at least two other Michigan counties have dismissed
cases involving the law after deciding that it was
unconstitutional, but those decisions have not set binding
precedents. A handful of other people accused over the years of
breaking the law here and in Sault Ste. Marie have paid small
fines, typically about $25, without contesting the misdemeanor
charge, said Vollbach and Farrell E. Elliott, the county prosecutor
in Sault Ste. Marie.
</P>
<P>
   Boomer is accused of using strong obscenities after falling into
the Rifle River while canoeing for the first time. A local
resident, Tammy Smith, was paddling by with her husband, her
5-year-old son and her 3-year-old daughter. ``I covered her ears,''
Mrs. Smith said in an interview. ``I didn't want her to repeat what
he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sheriff's deputies who happened to be nearby ticketed
Boomer. They were part of a law-enforcement crackdown prompted by
complaints from home owners farther down the river that canoe tours
were disturbing the peace.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Boomer, a 25-year-old computer programmer who
lives in Warren, north of Detroit, denied that he used the strong
obscenities the police accused him of using, but would not discuss
in detail what he had said. Boomer, who said he never saw the Smith
family, said he has an 8-year-old son, and that his parents
``didn't raise me this way, I don't walk around swearing.''
</P>
<P>
   While city leaders here agree that most residents are on the
prosecutors' side, a few are not, like Janice Syers, 47, a former
truck driver with a 28-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old son.
Mrs. Syers said that her disagreement was not based on any
tolerance for profanity. She said that she used to wash her own
children's mouths with soap after they used obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Syers said that people in the woods should be allowed
to say what they want, if no one else is nearby. ``They're making a
big case out of a little mole hill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a conservative town where the biggest employer is a
maximum-security state prison, most people seemed to share the
views of Stoner, the part-time mayor. ``I understand about free
speech, but there should be some common sense about what you say
around other people,'' the mayor said at his laundromat. ``I don't
allow dirty songs on my juke box.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoner, 68, said that people should always speak as if in
church, but later acknowledged that his own conduct did not always
meet that test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, but I kind of watch where I do it,'' he said. ``If
you're around a bunch of guys, that's different from when you're in
mixed company.''

COMMENTARY: A HISTORIAN'S VIEW, EVOKED BY A BRONZE COFFIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There was just chaos at Parkland Hospital,'' said the
historian William Manchester. ``A member of the Kennedy team called
Vernon Oneal and asked him for a coffin. And he said, `Well, I have
coffins in many different ranges.' And he was told, `Well, send
your best one.'''
</P>
<P>
   A massive, 800-pound solid bronze coffin was loaded into a
hearse and taken to the hospital. John F. Kennedy's body was placed
in the coffin and then driven to the Dallas airport.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester, the author of ``The Death of a President,'' a
detailed account of the Kennedy assassination and its immediate
aftermath, learned from news articles this week that the coffin
used to transport the president's body from Dallas to Washington
was discarded at sea in 1966. At Robert Kennedy's orders, it was
dropped from a C-130 cargo plane into the Atlantic Ocean off the
coast of Maryland and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The coffin was known to have been damaged in 1963, and the fact
that its whereabouts was a mystery for so many years helped feed
the endless procession of conspiracy theorists. It was destroyed,
presumably, to keep it from becoming a ghoulish symbol _ a museum
piece, perhaps, or a souvenir subject to the disrespectful whims of
hucksters, self-promoters and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything connected with that crime has become an icon,''
said Manchester. ``There are people who would have loved to put
that coffin in a museum. In fact, and I mentioned this in my book,
Vernon Oneal went to Washington twice to try to reclaim the coffin.
He told me he wanted to put it on exhibition, which means Bobby's
instincts were probably correct in destroying it. It was probably a
sound decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Manchester said the casket had been damaged accidentally by
Secret Service agents and other presidential aides at the airport
in Dallas. ``What they didn't know is that when a coffin is placed
in a hearse it locks into place. You have to know where the trigger
is to release the catch. Well, they couldn't do it. So they forced
the coffin out and in so doing they broke a hinge and part of the
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   A new casket was purchased in Washington and for a time the
original was kept in a crate at the National Archives. ``I had it
uncrated,'' said Manchester. ``I examined and described it. Now
it's destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Manchester is 77 and struggling through a tough time. He lives
in Middletown, Conn., and is in poor health. His wife, Julia
Marshall Manchester _ Judy _ died just over a year ago, in May
1998. They had been married for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester did not try to conceal his sorrow as we spoke by
telephone on Tuesday. ``She died on the eve of a party to celebrate
our 50th anniversary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people have studied the Kennedy assassination more intensely
than William Manchester. I asked what thoughts came to mind as he
looked back over three and a half decades to that November
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize now that the majority of the people are not always
right,'' he said. ``That was first borne upon me during the
McCarthy period. I covered the Army-McCarthy hearings for The
[Baltimore) Sun. At the height of McCarthy's popularity, only 29
percent of the American people thought anything that he was doing
was wrong. So the majority of the people were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, in the wake of that dreadful Oliver Stone movie, I read
that some 70 percent of the American people believed that Kennedy
was the victim of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I understand why they feel that way. And I think, in a
curious way, there is an esthetic principle involved. If you take
the murder of six million Jews in Europe and you put that at one
end of a scale, at the other end you can put the Nazis, the
greatest gang of criminals ever to seize control of a modern
government. So there is a rough balance. Greatest crime, greatest
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you put the murder of the president of the United
States at one end of the scale, and you put that waif Oswald on the
other end, it just doesn't balance. And you want to put something
on Oswald's side to make it balance. A conspiracy would do that
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is no evidence whatever of that.''

GREENSPAN HITS GROWING PROTECTIONIST BENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday
denounced barriers to free trade being erected by US policy makers
and warned they would do ``great harm'' to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Greenspan steered clear of any comments on the future
course of interest rates for financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   He chose instead to criticize a rising protectionist sentiment
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it is clear that all economic progress rests on
competition,'' Greenspan said in a speech to members of the
Alliance for the Commonwealth, a Massachusetts export group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we endeavor to freeze competitive progress in place, we
will almost certainly slow economic growth overall, and impart
substantial harm to those workers who would otherwise seek more
effective longer term job opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is already on record as favoring free trade _ he
delivered a similar speech in Dallas in April _ to boost
productivity worldwide and promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   But his comments came on the same day leading US steel producers
asked the federal government to impose punitive tariffs on a
high-grade product, cold-rolled flat carbon steel, from being
imported from Japan, Russia and 10 other countries to a US economy
with strong demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department has already ruled that Japan illegally
sold the industry's leading product, hot-rolled carbon steel, at
unfair prices.
</P>
<P>
   And the House of Representatives in March passed one of the most
protectionist pieces of legislation in recent memory. The bill,
which would strictly limit the amount of steel imported into the
United States, is expected to face a Senate vote this month.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan did not specifically mention the bill, Fred
Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Corp., said he belives
Greenspan wants to ``send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts a position out there that people should spend their
time thinking about it before they cast their votes,'' Breimyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the antitrade atmosphere in this country is a record
trade deficit, which widened to $19.7 billion in March. And
pressure to enact trade barriers are only expected to worsen if the
economy begins to slow.
</P>
<P>
   US exporters suffered last year as the economies of the world's
trading partners, from Moscow to Jakarta, went into a nose dive.
Exports by Massachusetts companies, after rising every year since
1990, slumped in 1998, according to the state's export index,
issued quarterly by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a surge in Massachusetts exports in the fourth quarter,
especially to China, the state exported $16.6 billion in goods last
year, 4 percent less than was exported in 1997. But the state may
be seeing ``the beginning of a recovery in exports,'' said Charles
McChesney, the alliance's director.
</P>
<P>
   US steel makers are stepping up the fight to reduce competition
from imports. In federal filings, the nation's biggest steel maker,
USX-U.S. Steel Group, and several other companies Wednesday accused
overseas producers of the metal, used in automobiles and
appliances, of ``dumping,'' or selling in the United States below
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antidumping initiatives should be reserved, in the view of
many economists, for those cases where anticompetitive behavior is
involved,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the nation's central bank explained his position on
trade in economic terms, saying, ``economic progress rests on
competition. It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels
of progress because of an incapacity to assist the victims of
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the House approved trade tariffs in March,
Representative J. Joseph Moakley, the South Boston Democrat, noted,
``Not every American is sharing in the good times. . . . While the
stock market is flirting with the 10,000 mark, ten thousand steel
workers lost their jobs last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Casting trade in terms of employment is a mistake for both
sides, Greenspan said. More important to the United States _ and
the world _ is trade's boost for standards of living, as
competition raises productivity, he said.

BATTERY ENERGIZES USC
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When USC plays at Stanford in the first game of
the super regional college baseball playoffs Friday night, the
Trojans will have a first-round pick catching _ Eric Munson _ and a
first-rounder pitching _ Barry Zito.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just proves what we already know,'' Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. ``They are great players. Zito has been just
phenomenal all season. They are both real special players.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquess is in his 23rd season as the Cardinal's head coach. He
said he's never faced a team in the playoffs with first-rounders
who are also battery mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual for a team to even have two first-rounders,'' he
said. ``And a battery... darn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson was picked No.3 by Detroit and Zito was taken ninth by
Oakland in Major League Baseball's annual draft Wednesday. It
marked the first time the Trojans had two players selected in the
regular phase of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Zito's selection was somewhat of a surprise. He was expected to
go lower in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``For (Zito) to go No.9 overall, that was just awesome,'' Munson
said. ``It's really great to see him go that high and finally
achieve his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling it: USC senior pitcher Justin Lehr, who was the fourth
Trojans player picked, by the A's in the eighth round, shut out
Virginia Commonwealth last weekend in his first career playoff
start.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr, a three-year starter at catcher for UC Santa Barbara who
transferred to USC for his senior season to concentrate on
pitching, played in the playoffs as a freshman at UCSB. He said he
has a different feeling this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, getting to Omaha isn't that far away,'' Lehr said,
referring to the site of the College World Series. ``When I was at
UCSB, we didn't think we could win the regional. It picks up your
game knowing you can go to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehr (7-2) struck out 10 and walked one against VCU and was
named to the all-regional team.
</P>
<P>
   Killer instinct: USC, which lost 11 of its first 15 games this
year, has been a different offensive team since the its series
against Washington to end the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   USC scored 37 runs in the three games and pounded Huskies ace
Jeff Heaverlo in the series finale, won by USC 17-6. Heaverlo, a
right-hander who was a preseason All-American, was charged with 11
runs in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the year, we would have been happy with eight
runs,'' Munson said. ``We were trying to get as many as we could
(against Heaverlo), we were looking for that knockout punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing man: The most important pitching performance of the
first-round regional for USC wasn't by Lehr or Zito, who beat
Pepperdine on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was by sophomore right-hander Rik Currier, who was cruising
against the Waves on Sunday before he was betrayed by his defense;
USC committed two errors in the seventh to allow Pepperdine to
score three runs and go on to win 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Currier gave up just one earned run in 61/3 innings. He pitched
well enough to win, which should be kept in mind if the Trojans'
series against the Cardinal this weekend goes three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Currier) was outstanding,'' USC head coach Mike Gillespie
said. ``It's the best performance he's given us this year. This was
the Rik Currier we thought he would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Currier slumped to 5-7 this season after going 6-1 and earning
freshman All-American honors in 1998.

HEAD OF MEDICARE PANEL SAYS SOME PAYMENTS SHOULD BE INCREASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of a federal advisory commission, an
influential Republican, said Wednesday that Congress should
increase Medicare payments for certain nursing home and hospital
services because budget cuts appeared to be harming the quality of
care for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Gail Wilensky, chairwoman of the Medicare
Payment Advisory Commission, was a breakthrough for health care
providers, who have been pleading with Congress to restore some of
the money cut by the 1997 budget law.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, Dr. Wilensky, who ran the Medicare
program under President Bush and is respected by lawmakers of both
parties for her technical knowledge of the program, said she had
not seen enough evidence to justify increases in Medicare payments.
She said then that it was too early to know whether the 1997 cuts
were adversely affecting patients.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday Dr. Wilensky said she agreed with some health
care providers that certain patients were vulnerable, particularly
those with complex medical problems who are in nursing homes and
those needing outpatient hospital services or physical therapy. She
spoke with reporters as the commission issued one of two annual
reports to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare accounted for a huge share of the law's savings, $116
billion of the $127 billion that was to be saved over five years.
The law, in turn, was a major factor that helped balance the
federal budget in 1998, for the first time in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said Wednesday that Congress seemed likely
to take Dr. Wilensky's advice. Medicare issues have traditionally
been Democratic issues, but Republicans are aware that increasing
numbers of the elderly now vote Republican, and in the last three
years, Republican lawmakers have given hundreds of speeches
insisting that they want to protect Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wilensky said she was recommending ``targeted and limited
changes'' in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, not a wholesale
revision or repeal of its Medicare provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Dr. Wilensky said, Congress should provide more
money for physical therapy, eliminating what she described as an
arbitrary limit of $1,500 a year in Medicare payments for physical
therapy for any beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, Congress and Medicare officials should
devise some way of increasing payments to nursing homes for
patients who need the most costly and extensive care. These
patients include nursing home residents who are on ventilators,
require infusion therapy, need prosthetic devices or have several
medically complex conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals say they have had difficulty discharging these
patients. Some nursing homes have refused to take such costly
patients because the homes consider Medicare payments inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dr. Wilensky said she tended to agree with hospitals
that say Medicare is paying too little for outpatient services,
which include a wide range of diagnostic tests, treatments and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   As significant as what Dr. Wilensky said is what she did not
say. She did not, at this time, endorse pleas by teaching hospitals
for more money. And she did not endorse the pleas of home health
agencies that say beneficiaries' access to home care has been
impaired by the Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wilensky said she knew that some teaching hospitals had
reported major reductions in revenue. ``We have reports of a lot of
hospitals suffering a lot of pain,'' she said, ``but it's hard to
know how much of that is due to Medicare.'' Many private insurers
have also cut back payments to hospitals.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in a report issued Wednesday, the Medicare commission
said, ``Preliminary data suggest that fewer Medicare beneficiaries
are receiving home health care than in the recent past, and the
number of visits per user has decreased.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the panel said, it is ``impossible to assess the degree to
which these changes are appropriate,'' because Medicare does not
systematically evaluate the medical condition of patients who
receive home care.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Dr. Wilensky said, it is important to remember that
the cutbacks made in 1997 followed ``10 years of explosive growth''
in Medicare spending for home health care. Spending soared to $18.1
billion in 1996, from $1.9 billion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said that 14 percent of Medicare's 10,524 home health agencies had
closed since October 1997, but that beneficiaries still appeared to
have ``appropriate access'' to home health services.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office said that high-cost patients, including
those with Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis, might have
more difficulty obtaining home health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dr. Wilensky said, savings from the Balanced Budget Act
appear to be ``much greater than expected'' in 1997. Health care
providers want a wholesale revision of the law, Dr. Wilensky said,
but ``I don't get any sense from Congress'' that lawmakers will
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she said, ``The Balanced Budget Act is something we
should not undo in haste.''

DOW SLIPS AS CONCERN ABOUT INTEREST RATES DOMINATES TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks slumped in early trading Wednesday but
rebounded somewhat after bargain hunters stepped in to scoop up
shares of Internet and other high-technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Nasdaq composite index had reversed course and
posted a solid gain, but the other main gauges were flat.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, concern about higher interest rates dominated
trading, analysts said. A report showing that sales of new homes
surged unexpectedly in April was the latest in a series of reports
suggesting that the economy continues to grow at an unsustainably
fast pace and that the Fed will most likely raise rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rate fears are the big problem,'' said Kenneth Ducey,
director of trading at BT Brokerage, a unit of Bankers Trust.
``People are very nervous'' that the Fed or the fixed-income market
may tighten credit. A key report on the nation's employment
situation is set to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said nothing bearing
on rates in a lunchtime appearance in Boston, and the markets
seemed to take that as a cue to rally.
</P>
<P>
   One exception was brokerage stocks, which continued to reel from
Merrill Lynch's announcement of a new online trading service.
Merrill finished down 4 9/16, to 70 11/16, after two analysts cut
earnings estimates for next year. Nasdaq, which is dominated by
computer and other high-technology issues, finished with a gain of
20.38 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,432.41. At its low, just after
noon, the loss was more than 47 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, ended 18.37 points
lower, or 0.2 percent, to 10,577.89, after being down nearly 132
points before the comeback. Eighteen of its 30 components lost
ground while 12, mostly cyclical issues, rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.55 point, to
1,294.81, but advancing stocks barely surpassed declining ones, 243
to 241, with 16 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent wide swings, the Chicago Board Options
Exchange's volatility index has been remarkably subdued, according
to Lawrence D. Cavanagh, an options strategist at Value Line. With
a decline of 1.69 points Wednesday, the index stands at 26.23, far
below this year's high approaching 35 in mid-January. ``Option
premiums have not jumped the way they usually do'' when the
investment tide turns, Cavanagh said. ``A lot of people are not
terribly worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell in six of the preceding eight sessions, pulling the
Dow 4.6 percent below its record 11,107.19 on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the market continues to do is unwind the real economic
fear of last year, which motivated investors to own the safest
vehicles in each asset class,'' Greg Smith, chief investment
strategist at Prudential Securities, told clients Wednesday. For
stocks, this was the large-capitalization growth stocks, which are
unlikely to ``return to the growth rates they had previously
shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, inflation fears should ease and June should prove
``pretty good for both stocks and bonds,'' Smith predicted. Some of
Wednesday's biggest gyrations were in Ameritrade, the online
broker, which closed with a gain of 5 7/8, to 85 5/8, after trading
as low as 73 and as high as 91 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, the shares were worth more than twice as much,
peaking at 188 3/8. Charles Schwab, the nation's biggest online
broker, slumped as low as 91\ Wednesday before finishing at 96 1/8,
down 3 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   After trading as low as 151{, Ebay rallied to close up 2 5/16,
to 168 13/16, while Amazon.com recovered from a low of 97 1/8 and
finished up 6 5/16, to 112 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan lost 2 5/8, to 130 7/8, the biggest drag on the Dow,
while IBM had the most positive impact, rising 1}, to 113}.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products, which tumbled on Tuesday after
announcing an earnings shortfall, recovered 1 13/16, to 53 13/16.

<P>
   ABOARD THE COMMAND PLANE WAR WIZARD, over Albania _ The War
Wizard lumbered through the night sky over Albania as its battle
staff began another long night of directing air strikes against the
Serbian military.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before, the airmen had ``sanitized'' their flight
suits, stripping off their patches so that their unit could not be
identified if the plane was shot down in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Now they were sitting in an EC-130 that was older than most of
the crew, peering at distant targets on their computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Allied strike formations, reconnaissance planes, refueling
tankers and targets in Serbia glowed before them, superimposed on a
computerized map of the Balkans. Red squares traced the Kosovo
Liberation Army penetrations into the disputed province.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, NATO does not support the rebel partisans. But as
the fighting raged along the Albanian-Kosovo border, the War Wizard
was directing NATO warplanes to blast the Serb armor and artillery
in the guerrillas' path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad Dog,'' called out a member of the plane's battle staff,
radioing back for guidance to NATO's command center in Vicenza,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy F-14's had seen Serbian armor near the Kosovo border.
It was an area so close to the KLA guerrillas that it could not be
struck without high-level approval. Mad Dog authorized the strike
and the War Wizard relayed the go-ahead to the F-14's. They blasted
a tank and an armored personnel carrier with laser guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The air war over Kosovo, however, is not always so clear cut. By
the end of its 10-hour mission, the EC-130 had also directed NATO
warplanes on a fruitless search for a dozen other Serb targets near
the border. And it was forced to issue last-minute orders to avert
an unintended air strike against targets in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long night, even for these crews that orbit high above
the war theater for as much as 16 hours at a stretch. And with the
Serbs trying to hide, thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees on the
move and strict rules of engagement to limit civilian casualties,
the crew was prepared for many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever done a mixed battle like this,'' said the
director of the battle staff, who goes by the call sign Rainman, as
he pondered the task he and his men have been handed of sorting out
civilians from partisans from opposing troops from miles above the
earth. ``The desert was a lot easier. If you want to take as many
precautions as we are about hitting third parties and avoiding
fratricide it hard to see how this could be any less painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The EC-130 flying command post is one of the lynchpins in the
allied air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times was allowed to join a combat mission to
observe its operations. Classified details about future targets,
aircraft call signs and rules of engagement were omitted at NATO's
request. But the military made no effort to limit the access of the
reporter to the crew or or censor his account.
</P>
<P>
   The mission began shortly before nightfall with an intelligence
briefing and overview about the upcoming flight at Aviano Air Base
in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen airmen _ a 12-person battle staff and a four-man flight
crew _ were zippered up in their green flight suits, with 9 mm
pistols strapped to their sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bloodchits,'' identifying the crew members as downed American
airman in several local languages and offering a handsome reward
for passage to safety, were tucked into the leg pockets of the
flight suits.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was the squadron's ``life support'' to pick up a small
bag, containing an oxygen mask, head set, ear plugs and flame
retardant gloves. These are old planes and there is reason to worry
about fire in the cabin on take-offs, landing and during mid-air
refuelings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Life support'' also handed out bulky survival vests,
containing a radio, compass, flares and global positioning system
device, which enables an airman to broadcast his position via a
navigational satellite. The vests felt as if they contained lead
weights; the airmen draped them over the back of their chairs as
soon as the EC-130 was aloft.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one squadron of EC-130 planes in the U.S. Air
Force _ the 42nd Airborne Command and Control Squadron _ and five
of their seven planes are at Aviano.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO stepping up its air war, the crew flies about four
missions a week. New orders can be given once the plane is aloft,
taking advantage of the plane's ability to refuel in mid-flight. So
a mission that is scheduled to last 10 hours can be stretched to
16.
</P>
<P>
   Hauling their gear, the crew drove in a van to the flight line.
The propeller driven EC-130 is hardly the most glamorous plane in
the Air Force. It is more like an old flying bus and was on the
verge of being phased out before the war with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the squadron's planes was involved in the ill-fated 1980
hostage rescue mission President Jimmy Carter ordered in Iran. The
plane hit a sand dune during the operation. It still flies, just a
bit off kilter, pilots said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1962, the War Wizard has logged more than 34,000 flight
hours, and it takes a vigilant flight crew and dedicated
maintenance team to keep it going day after day.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the crew pile into the crowded aircraft than a
faulty fuel indicator forced everybody off again. A swarm of
technicians descended on the plane. By 6:30 p.m., however, War
Wizard was aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Croatian cities glittered in the distance and an F-16 warplane
rocketed by overhead, as the EC-130 headed south for its night of
NATO's air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about the altitude restrictions designed to
protect the pilots against Serbian surface-to-air missiles and
anti-aircraft artillery. But NATO planes, in fact, can descend well
below 15,000 feet and the altitude, as it turns out, is not a major
barrier to killing tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the confusion on the battlefield. During the 1991
Persian Gulf War, the allies and Iraqi positions were clearly
separated. More often than not, errant bombs fell harmlessly into
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Albanian guerrillas fight at close quarters with Serb
troops while homeless civilians roam through the province.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma was underscored by the classified Air Tasking Order
issued to allied pilots by Gen. Michael Short, the top NATO air war
commander, to guide their actions in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   It said that NATO's air strikes aimed to ``shock'' the Serb
military and deal it a devastating blow. But it also explained that
concern over civilians, the possibility of refugees being used as
human shields and mixed refugee and military convoys required the
alliance to be more cautious about its bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Gulf War, everybody on the other side of the line was a
bad guy,'' said Maj. Gene Roles, the Battle Staff Operations Office
on the War Wizard flight. ``Now we have good and bad mixed in the
same area. That makes it a lot tougher for the guys dropping
bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has also made it more difficult for the battle staff of the
War Wizard to guide the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   According to standard military doctrine, a U.S. Army officer on
the ground should be picking the targets. The mission of the EC-130
would then be to decide which planes are available and coordinate
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no NATO troops on the ground in Kosovo. So the
EC-130 receives target lists from the command center in Vicenza,
information from observers in F-16s and A-10s planes and
intelligence from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of their computer screens, the battle staff
looks like they are playing the world's biggest video game.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Blue symbols on the screen show the location of allied aircraft
with call signs like ``Magic,'' ``Salt'' and ``Butcher.'' Air
traffic lanes and patrol areas are marked with code names like
``Front Street,'' ``Texaco'' and ``Soccer'' Red symbols depict
targets in Yugoslavia, including the resilient SA-6 mobile
surface-to-air missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
   A laptop computer details maps of Kosovo. Developed by the
National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the maps are used by officers
on the EC-130 to direct pilots to their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the faulty maps that were blamed for the bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade recently, these maps are so accurate
that an EC-130 was able to warn a search and rescue team about
electric power lines when they swooped in to extract the pilot of a
downed F-16.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Over the din of the plane, the crew use microphones and headsets
to squawk coordinates to each other and talk about the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody besides us is helping them out,'' said Brett, one of
the strike controllers. He said he supported NATO's mission to
return the ethnic Albanians to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But David Burns, a senior airman who was pulled out of law
school and activated by the National Guard for this duty,
disagreed: ``I am tired of being the world's policeman,'' he said.
``We have got our own problems at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, some of the people directing the attacks were
skeptical that air power alone would force the Serbs out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make it very painful for the enemy,'' said Roles, the
operations officer. ``But as well as the Air Force performed in
Desert Storm, it was the Army that rolled across the border. You
can't win wars solely through airpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fighting along the Albanian-Kosovo border gave Roles
and the battle staff a chance to try.
</P>
<P>
   As the Serbs pressed their attacks, exposing their armor and
artillery, allied warplanes swooped in. The War Wizard was
preparing to direct the strikes when it encountered one of the many
snafus that can happen in a war. One of its antennas snapped and
began lashing the side of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to stay in the fight, the crew sought a quick fix. They
flew across the Adriatic to the Italian airfield in Brindisi,
chopped off the offending antenna and took off again for Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the EC-130 was back in the fray. Two Navy F-14s radioed
that they had spied Serbian armor in a ``no drop'' zone, meaning it
was so close to the Albanian guerrillas that they could not bomb it
without permission from senior commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The EC-130 battle staff radioed Mad Dog to get permission for
the F-14s, which rolled in and blew up a tank and an armored
personnel carrier.
</P>
<P>
   But as the battle progressed, not even Mad Dog was sure about
how hard to press the fight. The Vicenza command center initially
approved an air strike against Serb units that were only 700 meters
from the Albanian guerrillas but quickly concluded the risk of
hitting of KLA fighters was too great and called off the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Another glitch arose when Mad Dog sent the EC-130 a new list of
targets. After checking its maps, the battle staff radioed Mad Dog
that allied warplanes were about to bomb Albania. Soon a message
flashed across the targeting screens on the EC-130: ``Albania
targets withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes prowled over the battlefield, as strike controllers,
intelligence officers and pilots on the EC-130 slipped through the
narrow aisle to raid their stash of sandwiches, pizza and junk
food.
</P>
<P>
   But as dawn approached, the Serbs appeared to have gone back
into hiding and the planes dumped their ordnance on secondary
targets, like border posts and antennas that would be touted in
NATO's press release the next day.
</P>
<P>
   As the War Wizard headed home, the crew looked forward to the 6
a.m. case of beer they would down after the last briefing. They had
been working the night bombing shift so long that daylight seemed
to be a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some kind of a bright fiery object in the sky,''
Capt. Manuel A. Candelaria, the chipper pilot, quipped as the sun
rose over the Adriatic.

   A picture caption that moved Tuesday about a fire in Florida
left an incorrect impression about the location. The smoke
billowing on the horizon, over a higway in the foreground, was from
a fire near Venice, in west-central Florida on the Gulf of Mexico,
not in the Okefenokee Swamp, which is partly in northern Florida.

 (For release Sunday, June 6)  
 UNLIKE McCARTHY, REP. COX REFUSES TO EXPLOIT CHINESE SPY REPORT  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out of the consternation and confusion over the
House report on Chinese spying in the United States, one undisputed
fact emerges: Rep. Christopher Cox is not Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a thoughtful California conservative, has made no attempt
to exploit for domestic political gain his committee's revelations
that China purloined American technology data to boost the
effectiveness of its own nuclear weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he achieved the unthinkable in today's highly charged
partisan atmosphere when, with the indispensable cooperation of
Rep. Norman Dicks of Washington, the committee's ranking Democrat,
he won bipartisan support for the panel's report on its shocking
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's explanation for that amazing feat: ``Our report was
unanimous because we stuck to the facts. Things about which we
disagreed we simply left on the cutting-room floor because there
was so much that was incontrovertible fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican lawmakers have demanded the resignation of
Attorney General Janet Reno and National Security Adviser Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger, for supposedly failing to realize the gravity of
China's spying and to notify President Clinton of what was
happening. Some Democrats, including Clinton, have adopted a
share-the-blame policy, asserting, quite validly, that Chinese
spying flourished during the presidencies of Republicans Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, although apparently neither was informed.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the outrage expressed by political figures has been
relatively mild. Many lawmakers and some administration officials
have said they want to fire whoever mishandled information about
the Chinese espionage. But no one of any repute has questioned the
patriotism of government leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That undoubtedly is disappointing to those Republicans who hope
to parlay the Cox report findings into votes next year. A half
century ago, when the Cold War dominated world politics,
Republicans scored at the ballot box by accusing the Truman
administration and the Democratic Party of permitting communist
infiltration of the government and allowing the Soviet Union to
steal atomic secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The attack began when a young California congressman named
Richard Nixon began quizzing a respected State Department official
named Alger Hiss before the House Un-American Activities Committee.
Hiss denied that he ever had been a member of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet during the intensive interrogation, Nixon noted
inconsistencies and evasions in Hiss's testimony. Later that year,
Hiss was indicted for perjury and eventually was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of communists-in-government exploded with nuclear
force on the night of Feb. 9, 1950, when McCarthy, an obscure
first-term Republican senator from Wisconsin, declared in a speech:
``I have here in my hand a list of 205 _ a list of names that were
made known to the secretary of state as being members of the
Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping
policy in the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   His charge was pure fiction. He had no names and no numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But he hit the publicity jackpot and overnight became the
nation's premier communist hunter _ although he never sent any
communists to jail.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, an uncouth man given to brawling and heavy drinking,
exploited for all it was worth the public's concern over the
aggression of the communists, who had been America's allies in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter who got tarnished or hurt.
</P>
<P>
   To McCarthy, President Harry Truman, Gen. George C. Marshall,
two-time Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson, Secretary
of State Dean Acheson and other executive branch officials were
either traitors or what he called ``fellow travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   With his flair for hyperbole, McCarthy labeled America's
leaders, along with Moscow's spies, part of a conspiracy so immense
as to dwarf any previous such venture in history.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of the Hiss case, the fall of China to the
communists in 1949 and the 1952 conviction of Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg for passing atomic secrets to the Soviets further fueled
McCarthy's flaming assault on supposed security risks in
government.
</P>
<P>
   So did Truman's failure to move decisively against spies within
the government, and McCarthy's campaign had a strong following
across the land.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wisconsin firebrand's reign was short-lived. The 1952
election of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower as president put a Republican
administration, headed by the most admired military leader of World
War, in charge of ending subversion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, McCarthy made the mistake of launching an investigation
of supposed security risks in the Army. The probe led to televised
hearings that demonstrated to the American people that McCarthy was
an unprincipled, undisciplined bully.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the Senate voted to censure him for bad
conduct, and by 1957 he had drunk himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Cox is cut from far different cloth. The New York
Times described him as ``something of a Renaissance man ... who
speaks Russian, savors Ayn Rand and seeks out the latest
translation of Omar Khayyam.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Dicks have established an admirable mode of conduct for
congressional investigators. We can only hope their intensely
partisan colleagues will follow their example.

 &HT;    Refugees expose general's soft side
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DIX, N.J. _ Imagine a refugee camp, and you probably see a
crowded, dusty place, full of desperation and hunger and surrounded
by razor wire and armed guards. Imagine the Army general in charge
of such a camp, and you see a serious tough guy, a career Army man
who takes no guff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, forget those images. Fort Dix is no prison but instead a
true refuge for 4,000 Kosovars forced to leave their homeland in
Central Europe. And Brig. Gen. Mitchell Zais of Atlanta's Fort
McPherson is a soldier with a heart who calls the refugees
``guests'' and welcomes them with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Dix, a training center for the Army Reserve located between
Philadelphia and New York City, has been a temporary home since May
5 for refugees who will eventually go to cities around the United
States. There is no razor wire, or even a fence, but no one has
tried to escape. The refugees play soccer and chess and make new
friends. They have clean beds, an abundance of food, even a little
American money.
</P>
<P>
   They are not exactly happy: Most came here with only the clothes
on their backs, driven from their homes by Serbian troops bent on
cleansing Kosovo of ethnic Albanians such as themselves. But at
least they have hope, thanks to Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   Under Zais, chief of staff of the U.S. Army Reserve Command,
about 400 reservists, National Guardsmen and career soldiers are
running the ``hotel,'' or the accommodations for the refugees. But
the Army is not running the show: The U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services is in charge of Operation Provide Refuge and is
responsible for getting the refugees out of camps in the Balkans,
processing them at Fort Dix and then finding apartments and jobs
for them in other cities. But it is the responsibility of Zais and
his soldiers to ensure their stay at Fort Dix is a pleasant and
safe one.
</P>
<P>
   Lavinia Limon, director of the Office of Refugee Settlement for
HHS and in charge of Operation Provide Refuge, seemed glad to have
Zais commanding the Army's end of things. He's so, well,
un-Armylike, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates mornings and he hates acronyms,'' she said. ``I
always ask, `Then why are you in this profession?'''
</P>
<P>
   Zais, a tall, graceful man who speaks English, not Army, has
cried often for the plight of his ``guests.'' With a doctorate in
psychology and a master's degree in military arts, he understands
where the refugees are coming from, psychologically and
historically.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we brought 400 soldiers here for this mission, we told
them not to think of chain-link fences and dusty refugee camps, and
not to think of illegal migrants,'' Zais said. ``These people are
here at the invitation of the president, and by extension the
American people. We should welcome them as we would have wanted our
great-grandparents welcomed at Ellis Island. In my mind's eye, I
keep seeing my grandmother coming down the gangplank from the
Ukraine. It's very moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Zais, the son of a four-star general, was born at Fort Bragg,
N.C., and grew up on Army bases around the country. At 52, he is
one of 11 generals from his West Point class of 800. He has been in
Atlanta for about a year with his wife, Susan, and two children,
Ashley, 12, and Bradley, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Zais was a rifle platoon leader during the Vietnam War. He has
served as a social aide to the White House, and he served in Panama
in the 1990s, when 10,000 Cubans were transferred to camps there
from the American base in Guantanamo, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, April 30, Zais was headed home from his office at
Fort McPherson to spend the weekend with his family. His son's
birthday was May 1, his wife's May 2. But instead of celebrating
their birthdays, he boarded a plane just after midnight, headed for
Fort Dix. He was told he had four days to prepare the camp for the
first flight of hundreds of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic is perhaps too strong a word, but close,'' he said. The
United States is relocating about 20,000 of the hundreds of
thousands of refugees now living in camps in Albania and Macedonia
along the border of Kosovo. Some 4,000 of those have arrived at
Fort Dix to be processed and sent on to cities across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers at Fort Dix went to work that weekend transforming
barracks into housing, hanging Welcome To America signs in the
gymnasium where the refugees would be processed, and transforming a
broken-down dining hall into a medical center.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the real work: Facing the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have lost all of their worldly possessions, their
language, their culture,'' Zais said. ``Some have lost family
members. They come here with those who have survived, with a bag of
clothes, and their faith. We try to build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Robert Hagan, a reservist from Oregon, said the assignment
tests the nerves of a soldier in ways no combat could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here two weeks and I feel like it has been a year,''
he said. ``It's emotionally exhausting. You can't imagine this
happening to human beings. Someone back home said, `Well, you're a
soldier. You can handle it.' I said, `B.S., I'm a human being
first.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a steamy afternoon this week, Zais gave a tour of the camp to
the heads of charitable organizations leading the effort to find
more permanent housing for the refugees. They stopped by the area
where refugees, for whom an apartment or a house has been found in
an American city, prepare to leave. They have new, donated luggage
full of clothes. They each clutch a plastic bag containing a snack
for the bus trip to the airport. Many cry _ for their new friends
at the camp whom they might not see again, for Kosovo, which every
day seems further away, and for the future, which is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is scary for them,'' Zais said as he looked at the
refugees sitting in chairs in a large, featureless room, waiting
for their names to be called so they could board the bus. ``Here,
everything is easy, like summer camp. But when you go out, you have
to find a job, you have to learn English, your kids have to go to
school, and you are alone.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple approached Zais and spoke to him through his
interpretor, 2nd Lt. Adem Arslani, an American reservist originally
from Albania. They asked him what it's like in Seattle, where they
are headed. They were worried because it seemed so far away. Zais,
who went to graduate school at the University of Washington, told
them it is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two directions, you can see mountains covered in snow,''
Zais said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the climate good?'' refugee Shaqir Syla asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it rarely snows,'' Zais said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, because this is difficult for us,'' Syla said. His
wife squeezed a tissue in her fist as her eyes filled with tears.
``Thank you for providing a safe place for us. We especially thank
the American soldiers. They were just incredible to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nation of immigrants and refugees,'' Zais said. ``All
of our parents and grandparents came from somewhere else. Welcome
to America, and I know you will love Seattle. You will get used to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zais does not think most of the refugees will stay in the United
States if it becomes safe to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people, a tie to the land is a very strong force _
they will want to go back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zais says he understands how tensions in Kosovo boiled into the
current conflict and says it is a story being repeated around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of different ethnic backgrounds want
self-determination,'' he said. ``A lot of these borders were put up
with no regard to religion or enthicities, in Africa, in the
Balkans, in the Middle East. Now those countries are fragmenting.
At the same time, they are growing more economically
interdependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an opinion on NATO's bombing campaign against the
Serbs, Zais hesitated, but then said NATO likely will be forced to
send in ground troops, something the alliance is resisting.
``Bombing just strengthens people's resolve to resist,'' he said.
``It's a test of wills. I'm not optimistic this will remain a clean
and casualty-free campaign for NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Zais stood by a path that takes the departing refugees to the
bus. Lining the other side of the path, behind a makeshift fence,
were refugees who will stay, for now, at Fort Dix. They watched as
friends, some new, some old, walked uncertainly toward the bus.
Many cried, some sobbed and reached across the wooden slats of the
fence for a last touch, handshake or hug. As the refugees boarded
the bus, soldiers said goodbye as well; one looked up at the tinted
windows of the bus and located a friend. He reached up and placed
his palm on the glass, then he pantomimed that he would write
letters by scribbling with his finger in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Zais stood with his arms crossed, at first pointing out
portraits of poignant moments to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that girl there who is saying goodbye to that boy,''
he said. ``And over there, the one with the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he stopped. No tears fell on his cheeks, but he sniffed
occasionally and did not speak again.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his office, Zais said he often is overcome with
emotion at the camp. He wishes his children could have come to see
the faces of the refugees, so that they could understand more fully
the situation. But they are in school, and Friday, Zais finishes
his assignment here and returns to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to have a heart of stone not to be touched by
this,'' he said. ``But I feel good about this assignment, I really
do. You have such a sense of accomplishment. They have time to do
some healing here, and then they are ready to face a new challenge.
We are here to get them to face the future, and not the past.

COMMUNIST PARTY PAPER IN CHINA MAKES RARE MENTION OF '89 PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Communist Party's flagship newspaper made a rare
reference Wednesday to the 1989 democracy movement in Tiananmen
Square, calling the violent crushing of those demonstrations
essential to the protection of national stability and economic
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial in People's Daily, ``Unswervingly Maintaining
Social Stability,'' cited the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade last month as evidence that ``hostile forces in the West
have never abandoned their scheme to ruin China.''
</P>
<P>
   History has demonstrated, the editorial added, that the ``firm
and resolute suppression of the political turmoil in Beijing'' in
1989 protected ``national independence, dignity, security and
stability and ensured the sustained, healthy development of
economic reforms and opening to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China must steadfastly avoid letting a disturbance created by
outside forces spark internal chaos,'' said the editorial, the
latest installment in a campaign mounted after the embassy bombing,
to paint Western human rights concerns as a plot to undermine
China's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the English-language version of the editorial distributed
by the official New China News Agency omitted the direct references
to the demonstrations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, life goes on as normal here and elsewhere in
China. But there are many signs of official nervousness as the June
4 anniversary of the crackdown on the student-led demonstrations
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 democracy advocates around the country have been
detained, at least temporarily, by the police in the last month,
and 28 remained in custody Wednesday, according to the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, a small
watchdog group in Hong Kong. The detainees included seven people in
the southern city of Hangzhou who had planned to commemorate the
1989 demonstrations and were held Wednesday, the information center
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, in luxury hotels and some private compounds housing
foreigners, CNN service on cable television has been temporarily
cut off, apparently because the channel is transmitting numerous
programs on the legacy of the demonstrations and their suppression.
But almost no Chinese have access to CNN, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In another action that largely affects foreign visitors, Hong
Kong and foreign newspapers delivered to hotels here and in
Shanghai have been arriving with articles about China cut out by
government censors. But journalists and diplomats with
subscriptions received complete nonexcised copies, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   One popular Chinese-language Internet chatroom, at www.sohu.com,
announced that it was shutting down for 10 days, ostensibly to
``improve the system,'' but possibly under pressure to avoid
discussions about the 1989 crackdown in which army troops killed
hundreds of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Tiananmen Square itself, where hundreds of thousands of students
and others chanted and camped, has been closed at least through the
month, officially for renovations in preparation for the
50th-anniversary celebrations in October of the Communist victory.
</P>
<P>
   But extra police officers are in the streets, and hundreds of
people involved with the 1989 movement have in recent weeks
received visits or calls to warn them not to speak with foreign
journalists or to engage in disruptive activities.

BUSINESSMAN REMEMBERS HIS DECISION OF CONSCIENCE AT TIANANMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAN ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ten years later, the Tiananmen Square massacre is
firmly entrenched as one of the seminal events of modern history.
Indeed, Time magazine recently noted the incident's most powerful
image, that anonymous man standing bravely before a tank, was a
contender for its ``Man of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, stories of the idealism, courage and portentous
(for the world's future) defeat of China's fledgling democracy
movement in June 1989 have been told and retold so many times they
have become part of the collective unconscious of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   One Tiananmen story that has not been told, however, is that of
a British Hong Kong businessman and fourth-generation China Hand
named Robin Dale, who found himself in a strange moral dilemma
during China's days of destiny, and exonerated himself with a
unique act of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dale was the ultimate Hong Kong player, the closest
confidant of the highest-ranking Beijing official in the colony,
and a middle-man between Beijing and the flood of American and
European companies that were desperately trying to get a foot in
the door of China.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the massacre, Dale composed a song and
produced a video supporting the Tiananmen martyrs that played
continually on Hong Kong TV for nearly a month, and was beamed into
China to become the foremost symbol of Hong Kong's support for the
students.
</P>
<P>
   How this strange defection took place _ and the personal
sacrifice that resulted from it _ is one of the great footnotes to
the Tiananmen saga and a chronicle of show business, international
intrigue and personal redemption worthy of a James Clavell novel.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about it today, the 50-year-old Dale _ now a Seattle
resident _ smiles and says that what happened was mostly a case of
his being unable to resist the ``family legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a family that has loved and cared about China for
four generations,'' he says. ``In the end, I couldn't deny that
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, the scion of a dynasty of English missionaries
in Asia: his great-grandfather was the first Presbyterian
missionary in Singapore, his grandfather was a missionary in
eastern China, and his father was a medical missionary in Taiwan
for almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was born in London but he went to China before his first
birthday and grew up mostly on Taiwan, learning to speak fluent
Mandarin as a child _ an ability that is extremely rare in a
Westerner and would later be his greatest asset in doing business
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sons of missionaries, he rebelled against his
background. He was a gang member, he was expelled from the Taipei
American School, and his high school girlfriend was Betty Ting Pei,
the actress-to-be in whose shower superstar Bruce Lee would later
die under mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He played bass and sang in a high school rock band, and, while
visiting a friend in Michigan in the summer of 1966, he got a job
as a roadie, then became a founding member of one of the top
Midwest rock groups of the late '60s _ the Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of about five years, I lived the rock-and-roll
life. We recorded for Capitol Records. We hung out with Ted Nugent,
Iggy Pop, MC5 _ all the big Midwest groups. I used to let Alice
Cooper rehearse in my basement in Ann Arbor because he had no place
else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band fell apart in the early '70s, he ``knocked around
Hollywood for two years,'' then returned to Taiwan, where he opened
a disco in the Hilton Hotel _ the island's first _ and ``dabbled''
in the Taiwan television, movie and recording industries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'70s, the economy of East Asia was booming, and China
began to slowly open its doors. With his fluent Mandarin and
knowledge of how things are done in Asia, he found himself in an
extraordinary position to take advantage of this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he started an import-export company that quickly became
a force in Pacific Rim trade. The company thrived and expanded on
Taiwan for the next seven years. In 1984, he moved his base of
operations to Hong Kong, ``because I always knew my destiny was
China.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'80s, he had a penthouse office suite in the Bank of
China building and a mansion on the Peak _ Hong Kong's two most
prestigious addresses. More importantly, he had become a close
personal friend of Xu Jiatun, the highest-ranking Chinese official
in the colony and its ``governor in waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship with Xu made Dale the Western businessman
best-connected with the Beijing inner circle, and a powerful broker
in the transformation of China. In 1987-88, he took a succession of
executives of America's top corporations to Beijing, and he took Xu
to the States to meet U.S. politicians and the CEOs of Sears, Kmart
and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, he also ``sorted out'' his relationship with
God. His rock years had shown him the emptiness of the pursuit of
fame and fortune. He came to understand his father and appreciate
his life of ``service to mankind.'' He married a Chinese woman, had
three children, and lived with a certain confidence that his
efforts were ``benefiting the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pro-democracy movement grew in China through the decade,
Dale took no part in it. ``I didn't even know any dissidents. And I
thought the students were naive in their demands, and downright
suicidal when they started rudely confronting the leaders. You just
don't do that in a culture that reveres age.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was astounded in the spring of 1989 as their non-violent
presence in Tiananmen Square seemed to double every other day and
eventually grew to more than a million strong. ``I remember calling
my wife to the television and saying, `What we're seeing here is
absolutely unprecedented in the history of China _ in the history
of the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   As these demonstrations were working to a peak in the first week
of June, Dale was in the final stages of negotiating for the
construction of a joint-venture shopping mall in Tientsin that, if
built, would have been the largest shopping mall in the world _ and
put his company on track to be a billion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he himself had no dissident connections, he knew at
once that he was vulnerable on the pro-democracy issue because his
friend Xu had caught Tiananmen fever and was publicly voicing
support for the students while praising capitalism as ``a great
creation of human civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So the smart thing for me to do at this point would be to just
sit back and say nothing, distance myself from Mr. Xu, then wait
for the smoke to clear and gradually reform my connections with
(Beijing).'' But something inside him _ ``probably that missionary
heritage'' _ just wouldn't let him do the smart thing.
</P>
<P>
   As Tiananmen ran red with blood in the early hours of June 4,
1989, he watched the horror on CNN while numbly mumbling to
himself, ``The people who ordered this (the massacre) are the
people I do business with every day ... the people to whom I am
bringing the leaders of the corporations of America ... the people
I serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He stewed about it for hours, then, ``in a burst of
inspiration,'' he closed himself off in his study and composed a
song, ``China, We Hear You Call.'' Somewhat in the style of the
1985 ``We Are the World'' appeal for Live Aid, it was a rousing,
unashamedly emotional cry of support for the Beijing students.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he talked a Hong Kong TV station into lending him
its footage of the demonstrations, then gathered some 30 young
people (representing 20 nationalities and all races) as
singer-actors and shot a music video, intercutting the Tiananmen
footage with the young people singing his song.
</P>
<P>
   The ``China, We Hear You Call'' video was played constantly over
the ATV station for the next three weeks, and became the symbol of
Hong Kong's support for the Tiananmen victims, as well as for the
colony's fear of its own post-'97 future under a government that
would so callously and methodically kill its own children.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that video is still a legend in Hong Kong. ``It gives me
goose bumps just to think about it,'' a noted Hong Kong filmmaker
told me in 1997, shortly after the handover. ``It was a pure
expression _ maybe the last pure expression _ to come out of a Hong
Kong that was suddenly terrified of offending the bully at the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   It not only burned Dale's bridges with Beijing and destroyed his
business, it so infuriated the Communist leaders that he instantly
moved to the top of their enemies list. By the end of summer, a
U.S. government official warned him that he and his family might be
in ``physical danger'' and strongly advised him to leave Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1989, he pulled up stakes and left Asia, settled
briefly near his brother in Texas, then found his way to Seattle,
where he was hired to reorganize the stateside office of family
friend Doris Brougham, a longtime Taiwan missionary.
</P>
<P>
   From Seattle, he continued to act as a link to his friend Xu,
who also fled Hong Kong to live in protective custody in
California. As the most senior Chinese official ever to defect,
Xu's support is often sought on China issues. For instance, it was
Dale who got him behind President Clinton's controversial extension
of China's most-favored-nation trade status in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the years after Tiananmen were hard ones for Dale. Even
though his application for permanent-resident status was sponsored
by several top officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations, it
somehow became mired in red tape, and his fortune dwindled as the
delay stretched into years before he could legally work here.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finally able to work, he found himself handicapped
by being ``a fish out of water.'' ``I knew how to do business in
Asia, but I had no (business experience) on this side of the
Pacific. I was in the strange position of being qualified to be a
CEO of a major corporation in Asia or a clerk in a 7-Eleven store
here _ and nothing in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he managed to rebuild his life. He started a
successful business selling Asian beauty and health products; and
he returned to music, performing and recording in a lush symphonic
pop style that he found suited his ``die-hard romantic
sensibility.'' As the memories of Tiananmen have receded, he's even
made several brief trips back to China.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains pessimistic about China's future. ``The
leadership there is so ruthless and corrupt and belligerent _ and
its power concentrated in so few key families _ that it's hard to
even imagine. You almost have to have experienced it from the
inside to fully appreciate how desperately it will hang onto its
power _ no matter how capitalistic China becomes on the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   And he remains sad about America's ``lost opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, the U.S. still had an ability to influence what
China would become. But that's slipped away. America is so enmeshed
in China now, it just can't draw a hard line and take all the
business with it. It's too late. China is in the driver's seat now
and America is not.''
</P>
<P>
   As the capitalistic transformation of China has continued past
the blip
</P>
<P>
   of Tiananmen, people invariably ask Dale if he ever regrets that
burst of idealism 10 years ago that cost him so much.
</P>
<P>
   And he always answers, ``No, not once. In retrospect, it may
seem a rash and foolish act, but I'm still glad I did it. My kids
are proud of me ... and I sleep well at night.''

CONDUCTING STRAVINSKY: HIS OWN READING VS. OTHERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recordings of Igor Stravinsky conducting his own music date from
as early as 1928, when he was 46 and had few doubts about his own
significance. The composer continued to record his works until
1966, five years before his death.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially active in the studio during the 1950s and
early '60s, when Columbia invited him to record virtually his
complete operatic, orchestral, choral and larger chamber works
under optimal conditions as a lasting legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths and weaknesses of Stravinsky's conducting, and
consequently, the value of these recordings as guides, have been
variously debated. To me, in terms of archival importance, this
discography, especially the Columbia recordings now reissued by
Sony Classical, is the greatest landmark in the history of recorded
music from the classical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it. A composer who would make many critics' lists,
including mine, of the top five of all time has left us a recorded
document of his own thoughts about his entire output. Imagine if we
had records of Bach, Mozart or Beethoven performing their works:
not just some of them, all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Without being slavish about it, musicians can henceforth turn to
Stravinsky's recordings for rare insights and inspiration. Perhaps
there is no such thing as a definitive performance. Still, whatever
their flaws, Stravinsky's have awesome authority and are impossible
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Or so one would think. A new recording on the Philips label (289
446 715-2) offers Valery Gergiev conducting the Kirov Orchestra in
``The Firebird,'' Stravinsky's breakthrough ballet score from 1910.
In its sweep, conception of color, sense of organic drama and,
especially, spacious tempos, Gergiev's performance is notably
different from Stravinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this enthralling recording conveys its own sense of
authority. Gergiev is the artistic director of the Kirov Opera and
Ballet in St. Petersburg, called the Maryinsky Theater, where
Stravinsky's father, Fyodor, was a leading bass who created roles
in operas by Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The music of ``The Firebird'' is steeped in Rimsky-Korsakov's
operas, especially ``The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh''
from 1907 and ``The Golden Cockerel'' from 1909, which, like ``The
Firebird,'' are fairy tales for adults, replete with a phoenix,
enchanted cities, captive princesses and infernal spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, the Russian repertory of opera and ballet is
Gergiev's daily bread, though he has shown more affinity for
singers and the inner workings of opera than for dancers and the
staging of ballets. In his recording of ``The Firebird'' he stakes
a claim to the score as a Russian work, intent on showing us where
it came from.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point he includes Scriabin's ``Prometheus: The
Poem of Fire,'' another mystical Russian work that was most likely
on Stravinsky's mind when he composed ``The Firebird.''
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev's recording is not the only recent one to provoke
thoughts about defensibly different approaches to Stravinsky's
music. RCA Victor has just issued a three-disk Stravinsky set (for
the price of two) from Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco
Symphony that includes ``The Firebird'' (09026-68898-2). And Sony
Classical, in its Masterworks Heritage series, recently released
``Stravinsky Conducts Stravinsky: The Mono Years, 1952-55,'' which
includes several works the composer would later re-record in
stereo, notably, the Neo-Classical Symphony in C. Still, Gergiev's
``Firebird'' is the most provocative performance of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The composer left several recordings of the work, but the best
overall was made in 1961 with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra
(currently available in Sony Classical's Igor Stravinsky Edition:
``Ballets, Vol. I,'' a three-disk set). As a point of comparison, a
1997 recording with Robert Craft conducting the Philharmonia
Orchestra is also revealing.
</P>
<P>
   This Musicmasters disk (01612-67177-2) is part of an invaluable
10-volume series of releases of Stravinsky's works conducted by
Craft, the composer's intimate friend and professional associate,
who assisted Stravinsky in his own recording sessions during the
Columbia project by preparing the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``The Firebird,'' adapted from Russian folklore by
the ballet's original choreographer, Michel Fokine, tells of a
Czarevich who wanders into the garden of the magician Kashchei in
pursuit of an enchanted Firebird, which he captures, then releases
in return for one of her feathers. That feather later enables the
Czarevich to summon the Firebird for help when he is captured by
the monsters who guard Kashchei's castle.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction to the work sets the tone for the story, and
highlights the differences between the recordings in question. The
low strings play a slow, soft motif in steady eighth notes, which
descends four notes (outlining the famously eerie interval of a
tritone) and ascends back, sometimes taking an extra upward turn.
It could be the Russian Impressionistic equivalent of a Baroque
ground bass.
</P>
<P>
   For all the regularity, it's unsettling. After four measures, a
two-note, chantlike figure in low trombones, marked even softer, is
played, then answered by a restless motif for two bassoons. All the
while, the mesmerizing ground bass continues.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky was careful to put precise metronome markings in his
scores to indicate the tempos he desired. The introduction to ``The
Firebird'' indicates that the eighth note is equal to 108 on the
metronome (or 108 beats per minute). Stravinsky's recorded
performance is just under that, and the character of the playing is
restrained, almost cool. Still, the sense of ominous inexorability
is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Craft's performance is actually more faithful to the score. It
is played at the exact metronome marking, and the dynamic level of
the trombone motif is, as requested in the score, even softer than
the pianissimo line for cellos and basses.

CLINTON PLANS TO COMMIT 7,000 PEACEKEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite continued denials that NATO is preparing
for a ground war, top US military chiefs are preparing to meet with
Clinton on Thursday to discuss ``whether there should be or could
be a ground option'' among other strategies, Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton announced that 7,000 US troops would
be a part of any military peacekeeping mission in the future in
Kosovo. In addition, the prime minister of Macedonia indicated for
the first time that his country would consider allowing NATO to
launch a ground war from Macedonian soil, a suggestion that added
to suspicions that a ground invasion is being prepared in case
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic rejects the peace process
underway in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be following the debate and discussion. And when the
proposal comes, we will have to put the proposal to the Macedonian
Parliament,'' said Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski.
Although it would be illegal under current law to launch a war from
his country, he said the issue would be reconsidered if NATO wanted
to invade Yugoslavia on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart Wednesday downplayed the
issue of ground troops, saying Thursday's meeting would focus on
the success so far of the air campaign. Other administration
officials again applauded the NATO effort and interpreted
Milosevic's willingness to talk to outside envoys as a sign that 10
weeks of airstrikes have started to wear him out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, urged a Colorado Springs audience not to ``grow
weary of this campaign because Mr. Milosevic did not capitulate
when the first bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have the patience and determination to match the courage
and skill of the men and women in uniform, we will achieve our
goals,'' Clinton said at the commencement speech at the Air Force
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cohen raised the specter of a ground war. Although
``there is no other planning'' underway, Cohen said Thursday's
meeting with Clinton will surely include ``a full range of
discussions, questions about whether or not there would be any kind
of a ground option for a nonpermissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, military planning continued for a mission in a
permissive environment _ one in which Milosevic would permit
peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo to protect ethnic Albanian
refugees returning home.
</P>
<P>
   If a peace agreement is reached, NATO would send 50,000 troops
into the region, with 7,000 from the United States. Pentagon
officials Wednesday outlined the rapid action that would take place
in the event of a deal. Armed Marines would move immediately into
Kosovo, followed by Army tanks and combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   Some Marines, most likely from the 26th Marine Expeditionary
Unit in the Adriatic, ``could be there in a day,'' Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said. A permanent peacekeeping force
would move in later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what right now we see as the type of force that will
be self-contained and be able to provide the engineering
capability, the patrolling capability, the internal force
protection security capability that's necessary,'' Bacon said.

 UNDATED: and basses.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gergiev conducts the passage at a strikingly slower tempo (about
92 per eighth note). The sounds could be welling up from the center
of the earth. Yet he gives noticeable attention to a telling detail
in the score: two of the string basses are asked to play their
ground motif plucked, or pizzicato, lending a subtle rhythmic nudge
to each note. When the trombones enter, they are almost indistinct,
like some primordial moan. Though not quite what is indicated in
the score, the effect is riveting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what makes the Stravinsky performance ultimately so special
is countless gestures and nuances that are not in the score. For
example, in the introduction, when the trombone motif enters it is,
if anything, louder than the string basses. The trombonists play
the motif with extra, nervous little accents on the offbeat notes
and clipped cutoffs at the ends of phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's almost balletic way of handling this passage makes
sense, given his background as a child of the Maryinsky Theater. In
body and manner, Stravinsky walked and moved like a dancer, with
vigorous sudden gestures, even in old age, when his body grew
frail. He conducted this way, too, emphasizing biting rhythmic
detail and steady tempos.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling passage comes with the ruminative music of ``The
Firebird's Supplication,'' when the phoenix pleads to be set free.
Her song is conveyed first by a solo oboe and English horn, then by
the soaring violins and finally by the entire opulent orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying this spiraling, sensual melody is an undulant,
rocking figure in triplets (marked 112 to the eighth note). The
composer must have decided that this was too fast, for his
performance is four metronome notches under that (96). Craft is
almost faithful (108), and the music sounds a bit pressed.
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev is much slower (about 84). Though the performance is
more expansive and impassioned than what Stravinsky may have
conceived, it has irresistible charisma. If this represents
unabashed interpretive freedom, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   The general pattern of contrasts between Stravinsky and Gergiev
continues throughout the work. Where the composer is exacting and
unsentimental, Gergiev is expansive, organic and vividly dramatic.
The Firebird's lullaby is beguilingly played: a slowish tempo, yes,
but one that allows for somber expressivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Awakening Scene,'' when the spell that has been holding
princesses and warriors captive in Kashchei's castle is broken by
the Firebird, Gergiev turns the passage into something totally
coloristic, dramatic and evocative. There seem to be no pitches,
almost no rhythm, just an unearthly emerging growl.
</P>
<P>
   People who love this work and think they know it well may be
astonished by Gergiev's powerfully instinctive performance. Yet the
composer's performance is, by definition, incomparable.
Stravinsky's cooler, more Apollonian approach captures the music's
fancy in a movingly understated way.
</P>
<P>
   You feel that as a composer of 79 revisiting an early score, he
is making a statement about the place of this music in the context
of his life's work, calling attention to the Russian heritage he
came from and the French Impressionists he stole from, and
signaling the future.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas worked with Stravinsky and has been a devoted and
persuasive conductor of his works. His performances of
``Persephone'' and ``The Rite of Spring'' are technically brilliant
and stylistically informed. In ``The Firebird'' he is mostly
faithful to Stravinsky's metronome markings, departing from them
when only when his own ideas compel him to.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his account somehow combines a clearheaded energy, a sheer
excitement in amassing sound and color, and a playfulness about the
music's magical elements into something distinctively American.
There's a bit of Benny Goodman in the way the clarinetist plays the
slinky, teasing melody in the ``Dance of the Firebird,'' a
wonderful and perfectly legitimate touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stravinsky Conducts Stravinsky: The Mono Years'' is offered by
Sony Classical as a chance to hear the composer conducting several
major works when he was younger and less enfeebled than he became
during the 1960s sessions. But he was not that much younger (early
'60s). The 1952 recording of the Symphony in C, for example, is a
bit tauter, shapelier and more organic than that from 1962 with the
CBC Symphony Orchestra. But the later version, a drier, tarter
performance, seems more boldly modern. The tempos are remarkably
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like all musicians, Stravinsky reserved the right to
change his mind. The conductor Sir Colin Davis relates a story
about performing Stravinsky's ``Oedipus Rex'' for an audience
including the composer. After the concert, Stravinsky asked Sir
Colin, ``Young man, why did you take Jocasta's aria so slow?'' Sir
Colin answered that he was following the metronome mark. The
composer replied, ``My boy, the metronome mark is just a
beginning.''

<P>
   BERLIN _ Russia and the West on Wednesday narrowed their
differences over the concrete measures required to end the war in
Kosovo, limiting the room for maneuvering by Slobodan Milosevic,
the Yugoslav president, and increasing the pressure on him to reach
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found a common approach,'' said Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, after a marathon
negotiating session in Bonn with American and European officials
that went on through much of Tuesday night and only ended
mid-afternoon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said ``common approach'' was a
bit of an overstatement. But, the official said, the unity of
purpose was now sufficient to justify a visit to Belgrade late
Wednesday by Chernomyrdin and the Finnish president, Martti
Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that Russia had agreed for the first
time that all Yugoslav forces _ army, police and paramilitary _
should withdraw from Kosovo and that the withdrawal be
substantially under way before any pause in NATO bombing. Perhaps a
few hundred Yugoslav soldiers could return, but only after the
deployment of a 50,000-strong international peacekeeping force,
which would include 7,000 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The West and Russia remain apart, however, on the composition
and the command structure of the peacekeeping forces. Russia is
holding out for a United Nations-controlled force; the West insists
that the force be effectively commanded by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the top diplomatic adviser to Gerhard Shroeder,
the German chancellor, said diplomacy would now follow two main
tracks over the coming week: an attempt to secure Milosevic's
agreement to the terms reached by the West and Russia and an effort
to pass a United Nations Security Council resolution that reflects
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The plan that was presented to Milosevic ``preserved and
elaborated'' NATO's demands in their entirety, the State Department
spokesman, James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained far from clear that Milosevic would agree to
terms that appear closer to NATO demands than to the vague
statement by the Group of Seven richest nations and Russia on May 6
that the Yugoslav government has formally accepted. That gap will
be the subject of Ahtisaari's discussions in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   How Milosevic would accept the plan presented to him was the
``$64,000 question,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made reasonable progress, particularly on the scope and the
timing of the Serbian withdrawal,'' said one U.S. official. ``The
Russians have understood that, for us, all means all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bonn talks were unexpectedly difficult and marked by
brinksmanship that saw Russia threatening to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that Chernomyrdin argued for a pause in
the 71-day-old NATO bombing as a gesture of goodwill, but was
finally swayed by Western arguments that such a break would not
make Milosevic more pliant or more ready to negotiate in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Russia agreed that the Serbian leader must start a
verifiable and substantial withdrawal of his forces before a halt
in the NATO bombardment could be declared.
</P>
<P>
   The plan specifies that Milosevic has to withdraw all his forces
from Kosovo, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also specifies how many days Milosevic has to show that
he is complying with a ``rapid and precise'' timetable of
withdrawal of his 40,000 troops for NATO to stop the air strikes, a
senior administration official said. The official declined to
specify the precise number of days.
</P>
<P>
   Once the withdrawal of Serbian forces had begun in a
``verifiable and demonstrable way'' NATO would be willing to stop
the bombing but reserved the right to resume, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyridin said Wednesday, ``I think at the moment there is a
realistic chance that the war will end.'' Strobe Talbott, the
deputy secretary of state, who has been shuttling between
Washington, Moscow, Helsinki, Bonn and Brussels, said,
``Increasingly the international community is speaking with one
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Russia and the West have shifted their area of
agreement from broad principles that were vague on crucial issues
to the outline of a concrete program to which Milosevic must now
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The principles adopted on May 6 did not stipulate that all
Yugoslav forces must withdraw and alluded only to the deployment of
``effective international civil and security presences'' in Kosovo,
rather than to a NATO-led peacekeeping force on which the Clinton
administration has insisted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was on the question of the make-up of the peacekeeping force
that differences with Russia proved most difficult, American
officials said. ``The Russians are still pushing for a United
Nations-controlled operation, but after Bosnia we learned the
lessons of watered-down command structures,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, between 1992 and 1995, a so-called ``dual-key''
system under which both NATO commanders and senior U.N. officials
had to approve any military action proved unwieldy, ineffective and
sometimes disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Belgrade, Chernomyrdin said that, under a
compromise reached in Bonn for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
``NATO will command NATO forces, Russia the Russian forces.
Relations between the two contingents will be governed by separate
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steiner said this statement should not be taken at face
value. ``Obviously, each politician has his constituency that has
to be satisfied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   European and American officials said that a command structure
similar to the one now governing relations between Russian and
Western forces in Bosnia is being considered. This system involves
a NATO chain of command, although it gives the Russian contingent
there considerable latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a Russian proposal that it take charge of a zone
in the northern part of Kosovo while NATO countries control the
southern part of the province had been rejected because it might
appear to lay the basis for partition.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said it was now crucial to involve the United Nations.
``If what we have now is the basis for a solution, then we must get
it legalized in the Security Council as quickly as possible,''
Steiner said. ``That in turn will give us the political leverage we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   If a Security Council resolution could now be passed calling for
a complete Serbian withdrawal and the deployment of a large
international force with a central NATO presence, as well as the
return of all ethnic Albanian refugees, then the pressure on
Milosevic would clearly increase still further.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that with such a resolution, a full and
formal agreement from Belgrade might not be necessary. ``All we
would need is the absence of a rejection from Milosevic and the
withdrawal of his troops from Kosovo,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear whether China, whose relations with the
United States were soured by the bombing last month of its Belgrade
embassy by NATO, would agree to the resolution and whether wording
could be found that would circumvent Russian objections about the
nature of the peackeeping force.

</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, said, ``We have
some good news, but I do not want to overrate it. We have to remain
skeptical until the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the West have come a long way since the first days of
the NATO bombing, when anger in Moscow was at fever pitch and
rumors were circulating that Russian missiles had been redirected
at European targets.
</P>
<P>
   However the diplomacy now progresses, immense difficulties
appear to remain, not the least being how to convince the divided
Albanian leadership and the Kosovo Liberation Army that any accord
with Milosevic is even remotely credible. The Serbs must also be
convinced that the rebel army can be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the West would apparently be committing itself to a
massive deployment of forces and huge investment of resources in a
state headed by a man indicted on charges of war crimes last week
by the international criminal tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari was expected to report on the results of his talks
with Milosevic to a summit meeting of European leaders in Cologne
on Thursday and Friday. The Finnish president is the highest-level
Western representative to meet with the Yugoslav leader since the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Chirac, the French president, said Wednesday that the
rapprochement between Russia and the West ``undoubtedly opens the
door to a significant chance for a political settlement. In this
situation, I cannot really see how the Serbian authorities could
refuse the solution demanded of them by the whole international
community.''

USE OF UNUSUAL THERAPIES FOR BREAST CANCER MAY SIGNAL DEPRESSION,
STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women with breast cancer who seek alternative therapies like
herbs or acupuncture in addition to standard treatment may be
unusually worried and depressed and in need of extra help in coping
with their fears about the disease, a study says.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that doctors should ask patients whether
they are using alternative treatments, and patients who say yes
should also be questioned about anxiety and depression, said Dr.
Jane Weeks and Dr. Harold Burstein, cancer specialists at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. They said that although
some distress was natural when a person was given a diagnosis of
cancer, patients who seem exceptionally troubled should be offered
psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The study, being published Thursday in The New England Journal
of Medicine, included 480 women with early-stage breast cancer, 28
percent of whom began using alternative therapies for the first
time after their cancer surgery. The researchers found that women
who began the alternative treatments, compared with women who did
not, reported a lower quality of life, more depression, more fear
of recurrence of cancer and less sexual satisfaction. They may have
turned to alternative therapy for help in coping with their stress,
the researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it will spark a dialogue and spur doctors to identify
patients who might be more vulnerable and benefit from earlier
interventions,'' Burstein said in a telephone interview. ``These
are things patients and doctors have historically been somewhat
reluctant to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The 480 women in the study were treated from 1993 to 1995 in
Massachusetts hospitals. Three months and 12 months after surgery,
they filled out surveys that included questions about their
emotional states before and after cancer was diagnosed and their
use of alternative therapies like herbs, megavitamins, massage,
homeopathy, special diets, relaxation techniques, self-help groups,
spiritual healing and hypnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The women used those treatments in addition to standard therapy,
and not as a substitute for it. But three months after surgery,
those who had tried the alternative methods for the first time were
more depressed and fearful than those who had not. A year after
surgery, all felt better, but those who had used alternative
therapy still reported less sexual satisfaction and more fear of
recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The results came as a surprise, contradicting earlier
perceptions of patients who use alternative therapy, said Dr.
Jimmie Holland, chairwoman of the department of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences at the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
in New York. Dr. Holland wrote an editorial that accompanied the
journal article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not expecting this,'' Dr. Holland said in a telephone
interview, explaining that a previous study had found that patients
who used alternative medicine were better adjusted than those who
did not, sought more control and hoped to add to their treatment.
``But in this group it looks like these were the more vulnerable
women who were having more problems in coping.''
</P>
<P>
   In her editorial, Dr. Holland wrote that the women in the study
``were not psychologically strong'' and that they ``turned to
alternative medicine to alleviate their distress.'' Dr. Holland
said cancer centers were not doing their job if patients felt they
must ``get their psyches treated in the alternative world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be treating the whole person,'' she said. ``The
problem in health care today is that visits are so short that
patients often don't tell a doctor or nurse how distressed they
are, and doctors have no time to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Dr. Holland said, doctors should notice when patients
feel exceptionally troubled about their condition, and refer them
to a psychologist, social worker or chaplain. But patients rarely
bring up the subject, because they fear it will be seen as a waste
of time or will result in their being labeled neurotic or unstable.
Doctors should bring it up and ask patients how they are faring
emotionally, Dr. Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our busy oncology clinics should be able to ask, `Are you
distressed? How much, on a scale of one to 10?''' she said,
asserting that this works very accurately with pain and that it
should work with distress, too.
</P>
<P>
   Burstein said that he and Dr. Weeks hoped patients would not be
offended by their conclusions, which he said applied to the women
taken as a group but not necessarily to each individual patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very concerned that some might feel this is
pejorative or that we think it somehow dysfunctional,'' he said.
``But it's not a diagnosis. It's an entree for doctors to start
talking to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Holland said: ``I think some patients are going to be
furious. They'll say, `How could you say such a thing about me? I'm
fine. I'm not distressed.' And that may be true. This is one
study.''
</P>
<P>
   Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, a
patients' group, called the conclusions ``almost patronizing,'' and
said they might lead women using alternative therapy to hide it, to
avoid being viewed as depressed or anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing to me that scientists would automatically
assume based on this small study that they know how to intervene
with these women,'' Ms. Visco said. ``The only conclusion they
should jump to is that the distress comes from the fact that we
don't know how to cure breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Burstein said the findings had led him to discuss emotional
issues more often with patients. ``Sometimes you find out they have
had a tougher time than it appears from their being in the clinic
well dressed and put together,'' he said. ``But others say it
doesn't describe them at all, and they're very comfortable with
what they're taking and doing.''

IAPA URGES FULL INVESTIGATIONS IN UNSOLVED CASES OF SLAIN
JOURNALISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW DOWNIE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A leading press organization called on the Mexican
government Wednesday to more thoroughly investigate the unsolved
killings of journalists and to clear up inconsistencies in the
slaying of a Texas newspaper reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of the Inter American Press Association met with
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and other high-level officials.
They asked Zedillo to step up the investigations. Twenty-six
Mexican journalists have been killed since November of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Between 95 percent and 97 percent of all journalist murder cases
in Latin America go unsolved, according to the IAPA. The
association, which has a membership of more than 1,300 newspapers
and magazines, is dedicated to defending freedom of expression
throughout the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, Jorge Fascetto, told reporters that
suspects arrested for killing journalists usually turn out to be
the trigger men, not the people who actually planned or ordered the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The IAPA delegation visited Mexico as part of a four-nation tour
that also includes stops in Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala, the
Latin American countries where violence against journalists is most
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 journalists have been killed in the region in the
past decade, Fascetto said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the situation has deteriorated over the last two
years to the point that the country now ranks second only behind
Colombia in the number of journalists slain. Seven journalists were
murdered in Mexico in the last 20 months, IAPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems are very serious,'' Fascetto said after the
delegation's 50-minute meeting with Zedillo. ``We are very
concerned about them. They are the most serious crimes against
freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, in meetings with Zedillo and Mexico's Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, also raised concerns about the
investigation into the murder last December of Texas reporter
Philip True.
</P>
<P>
   True, 50, the Mexico City bureau chief for the San Antonio
Express-News, was found dead several days after heading alone into
the mountains of central Mexico to take a vacation and research a
story about the region's Huichol Indians.
</P>
<P>
   True, an experienced hiker, was walking through rugged terrain
along the border between Jalisco and Nayarit states when he
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   True's wife raised an alarm after he failed to call home as
scheduled. Mexican soldiers and police as well as True's colleagues
and relatives launched air and ground searches and found his body
at the bottom of a ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Two Huichol men, Miguel Hernandez and Juan Chivarra, were later
arrested and jailed on charges of strangling the reporter.
Investigators said the men attacked True while they all hiked
together near the village of San Miguel Huastita early in the
morning of Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the men were angry because True had entered
Huichol territory and was taking pictures of people without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and Chivarra have given authorities at least four
versions of True's killing, and in three of them they admitted
slaying the reporter. Both men are jailed in Jalisco state awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
   As in many Mexican court cases, the investigation into True's
death was riddled with contradictions and inconsistencies. Most
worrying for IAPA officials are two separate and conflicting
autopsies performed on True by Mexican state and federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The first examination, performed by Jalisco state medical
examiners, concluded that True had been strangled to death. A team
of federal medical examiners ruled in the second autopsy that he
died of injuries to his head.
</P>
<P>
   Both autopsies reported that True, known to friends as a light
social drinker, had large quantities of alcohol in his system at
the time of death.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few days before the Huichol men were charged with True's
murder, a high-ranking official in the Jalisco state prosecutors'
office told Mexican reporters that the correspondent had frozen to
death after falling down drunk and failing to return to his camp
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there are questions remaining,'' Robert Rivard, the
Express-News' editor and an IAPA board member, said after
Wednesday's meeting with Zedillo. ``We don't know why there are
different autopsies, for example. (However), I think there is
overwhelming circumstantial evidence that these two (Hernandez and
Chivarra) are guilty.``
</P>
<P>
   The IAPA delegation was scheduled to meet with the Jalisco
governor, Alberto Cardenas, later Thursday to inquire about the
status of the True investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rivard and other IAPA board members have already called on
Madrazo, the Mexican attorney general, to form a special unit
dedicated to investigating the murder of journalists. Madrazo has
promised to consider the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo and Zedillo both lent a sympathetic ear to pleas for
better treatment of journalists, Rivard said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle Vice President and Managing Editor Tony
Pederson, who will become president of the IAPA next year, said he
was optimistic that the meeting would help cement the relationship
between the IAPA and the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Zedillo received us very well,'' Pederson said.

COMMUNITY BANKS IN MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprise merger that forges a new Northeast banking
competitor out of two community institutions, Peoples Heritage
Financial Group Inc. of Portland, Maine, said Wednesday that it
would acquire the smaller Banknorth Group Inc. of Burlington, Vt.,
in a stock-for-stock deal valued at $712 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which boosts Peoples Heritage's size by one-third,
creates a full commercial bank with $17 billion in assets _ just $4
billion less than Citizens Financial Group Inc., the
Providence-based company that will soon be New England's
second-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The combination also increases Peoples Heritage's attractiveness
to other banks that may seek to expand into New England as the
financial services industry consolidates further. Wall Street has
long viewed Peoples Heritage as a takeover target, especially as
larger national banks seek to acquire sophisticated smaller banks.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, the transaction removes Peoples Heritage,
the region's largest community bank, as a major bidder for branches
and deposits that will be divested when New England's two biggest
banks, Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston Corp., combine later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Heritage, an aggressive institution that has made four
acquisitions in the past two years, previously had said that it
wanted to buy a significant number of the 290 branches that
Fleet/BankBoston will shed to win antitrust approval of their
proposed merger. The combination will create the nation's
eighth-largest bank with $165 billion in assets _ 10 times the size
of Peoples Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   But Peoples Heritage preferred to buy a ready-made bank with a
full array of operations, rather than cast-off deposits and
branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we now have a diminished capacity to look at the
Fleet-BankBoston branches,'' said William J. Ryan, Peoples
Heritage's chairman and chief executive. He said that, at most, the
bank might bid on a few Massachusetts branches.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie H. Hunsicker, a banking analyst at Friedman, Billings,
Ramsay, &AMP; Co., said the company had moved to buy Banknorth, whose
chief executive is retiring, because it knew it could get squeezed
out of bidding for the assets by large, out-of-region banks.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Heritage ``is trying to become the premier community
bank in New England,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Heritage, a holding company that before Wednesday's deal
was New England's fifth-largest bank, has 221 branches, $12.6
billion in assets, and is the leading lender and deposit
institution in Maine and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The company comprises Peoples Heritage in Maine, Bank of New
Hampshire, Family Bank in north central Massachusetts, and SIS
Bancorp, which includes Glastonbury Bank &AMP; Trust in Connecticut, a
savings and loan in Springfield, and insurance operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the bank had reached its goal of bulking up to the $15
billion to $20 billion asset range, though he did not rule out
further acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Banknorth owns eight community banks with 101 branches
throughout Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, an
investment management firm overseeing $4 billion, and a mortgage
lending unit. The company, which has grown rapidly through
acquisitions, has total assets of $4.4 billion. Its flagship bank
in this state, First Massachusetts Bank, based in Worcester, has
two dozen branches scattered throughout the central and western
parts of the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Banknorth, Peoples Heritage gains a stronger
presence in northern New England, with toeholds in Vermont _ where
it becomes the number two bank _ and in upstate New York, where it
is still only a minor player. The company also gains a bigger
presence in New Hampshire, where it dominates, and an entrance into
the Worcester area.
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned Citizens, by contrast, is focused on southern
New England, mainly Providence, Boston, and southern Connecticut.
But it will find new competition from Peoples Heritage in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Heritage will still be only the fourth-largest bank in
Massachusetts, behind Fleet/BankBoston, Citizens, and UST Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to retain its customers, who favor the individualized
approach characteristic of community banks, Peoples Heritage will
not consolidate its branches under one name. But it will change its
holding company name to Banknorth Corp. _ a name reflecting a
broader geography ``that might make us more attractive to a
potential acquirer someday,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most community banks, Peoples Heritage is more than a
deposit-taker, and has a major lending portfolio. With the
Banknorth acquisition, it will have $10 billion in commercial,
consumer, and real estate loans, and home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which lost a quarter of its value in the
past 12 months, has long been deemed attractive and undervalued by
analysts. But Wall Street punished Peoples Heritage Wednesday,
sending its shares down 1 3/16 to end the day at 16 13/16 on
Nasdaq. Industry observers said the slide occurred because shares
in acquiring companies usually fall and because the Banknorth
acquisition would slash earnings by 4 cents per share in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Banknorth rose 2 5/8 to close at 29 3/8 on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Heritage declined to detail how it would boost revenues
or cut 30 percent of Banknorth's costs, but said the deal would
produce a one-time charge of $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think Peoples Heritage overpaid for Banknorth, for
which it will swap 1.825 of its own shares for each Banknorth
share. When the deal was first announced Wednesday, that ratio
valued Banknorth at $32.85 a share _ equivalent to $780 million, a
23 percent premium to Banknorth's closing price on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The slide in Peoples Heritage shares Wednesday pushed the value
of the acquisition down to $30.68 a share by the end of the day.
Still, the decline doesn't make it cheap or easy for either bank to
opt out of the deal, which is scheduled to close later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies signed poison-pill agreements allowing them to
purchase 19.9 percent of each other's stock, a move designed to
thwart hostile bids. The two banks also opted for an unusually
large board of 21 members, six from Banknorth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised Peoples Heritage didn't negotiate the price
down a little bit,'' said Bruce W. Harting, a banking analyst at
Lehman Brothers. ``Ultimately, investors who stay with the company
are betting that it will be taken over.''

   BEIJING _ China and Russia repeated Wednesday their demand that
NATO airstrikes be halted before political talks begin to resolve
the crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, spent the day meeting
with China's top leaders, discussing their shared opposition to the
NATO bombing campaign and their mutual desire to foster a
``strategic partnership'' aimed at offsetting the global dominance
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A joint communique issued Wednesday afternoon by Ivanov and
China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, said: ``NATO's immediate
halting of military operations is a precondition of a political
settlement of the Kosovo issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov told reporters that plans are being laid for a state
visit to China later this year by President Boris Yeltsin,
following up the visit to Russia and an ailing Yeltsin last year by
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said that increased political, economic and military
cooperation between Russia and China ``will contribute to stability
and the interests of the international community'' by helping to
create a more ``multipolar world.''
</P>
<P>
   While Russia has advanced military hardware to sell to China,
the scope for economic cooperation appears to be limited: total
trade between the countries last year was only $5.5 billion, a
small fraction of China's trade with Japan or the United States.

BUSINESSMAN REMEMBERS HIS DECISION OF CONSCIENCE AT TIANANMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAN ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ten years later, the Tiananmen Square massacre is
firmly entrenched as one of the seminal events of modern history.
Indeed, Time magazine recently noted the incident's most powerful
image, that anonymous man standing bravely before a tank, was a
contender for its ``Man of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, stories of the idealism, courage and portentous
(for the world's future) defeat of China's fledgling democracy
movement in June 1989 have been told and retold so many times they
have become part of the collective unconscious of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   One Tiananmen story that has not been told, however, is that of
a British Hong Kong businessman and fourth-generation China Hand
named Robin Dale, who found himself in a strange moral dilemma
during China's days of destiny, and exonerated himself with a
unique act of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dale was the ultimate Hong Kong player, the closest
confidant of the highest-ranking Beijing official in the colony,
and a middle-man between Beijing and the flood of American and
European companies that were desperately trying to get a foot in
the door of China.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the massacre, Dale composed a song and
produced a video supporting the Tiananmen martyrs that played
continually on Hong Kong TV for nearly a month, and was beamed into
China to become the foremost symbol of Hong Kong's support for the
students.
</P>
<P>
   How this strange defection took place _ and the personal
sacrifice that resulted from it _ is one of the great footnotes to
the Tiananmen saga and a chronicle of show business, international
intrigue and personal redemption worthy of a James Clavell novel.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about it today, the 50-year-old Dale _ now a Seattle
resident _ smiles and says that what happened was mostly a case of
his being unable to resist the ``family legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a family that has loved and cared about China for
four generations,'' he says. ``In the end, I couldn't deny that
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, the scion of a dynasty of English missionaries
in Asia: his great-grandfather was the first Presbyterian
missionary in Singapore, his grandfather was a missionary in
eastern China, and his father was a medical missionary in Taiwan
for almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was born in London but he went to China before his first
birthday and grew up mostly on Taiwan, learning to speak fluent
Mandarin as a child _ an ability that is extremely rare in a
Westerner and would later be his greatest asset in doing business
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sons of missionaries, he rebelled against his
background. He was a gang member, he was expelled from the Taipei
American School, and his high school girlfriend was Betty Ting Pei,
the actress-to-be in whose shower superstar Bruce Lee would later
die under mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He played bass and sang in a high school rock band, and, while
visiting a friend in Michigan in the summer of 1966, he got a job
as a roadie, then became a founding member of one of the top
Midwest rock groups of the late '60s _ the Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of about five years, I lived the rock-and-roll
life. We recorded for Capitol Records. We hung out with Ted Nugent,
Iggy Pop, MC5 _ all the big Midwest groups. I used to let Alice
Cooper rehearse in my basement in Ann Arbor because he had no place
else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band fell apart in the early '70s, he ``knocked around
Hollywood for two years,'' then returned to Taiwan, where he opened
a disco in the Hilton Hotel _ the island's first _ and ``dabbled''
in the Taiwan television, movie and recording industries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'70s, the economy of East Asia was booming, and China
began to slowly open its doors. With his fluent Mandarin and
knowledge of how things are done in Asia, he found himself in an
extraordinary position to take advantage of this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he started an import-export company that quickly became
a force in Pacific Rim trade. The company thrived and expanded on
Taiwan for the next seven years. In 1984, he moved his base of
operations to Hong Kong, ``because I always knew my destiny was
China.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'80s, he had a penthouse office suite in the Bank of
China building and a mansion on the Peak _ Hong Kong's two most
prestigious addresses. More importantly, he had become a close
personal friend of Xu Jiatun, the highest-ranking Chinese official
in the colony and its ``governor in waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship with Xu made Dale the Western businessman
best-connected with the Beijing inner circle, and a powerful broker
in the transformation of China. In 1987-88, he took a succession of
executives of America's top corporations to Beijing, and he took Xu
to the States to meet U.S. politicians and the CEOs of Sears, Kmart
and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, he also ``sorted out'' his relationship with
God. His rock years had shown him the emptiness of the pursuit of
fame and fortune. He came to understand his father and appreciate
his life of ``service to mankind.'' He married a Chinese woman, had
three children, and lived with a certain confidence that his
efforts were ``benefiting the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pro-democracy movement grew in China through the decade,
Dale took no part in it. ``I didn't even know any dissidents. And I
thought the students were naive in their demands, and downright
suicidal when they started rudely confronting the leaders. You just
don't do that in a culture that reveres age.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was astounded in the spring of 1989 as their non-violent
presence in Tiananmen Square seemed to double every other day and
eventually grew to more than a million strong. ``I remember calling
my wife to the television and saying, `What we're seeing here is
absolutely unprecedented in the history of China _ in the history
of the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   As these demonstrations were working to a peak in the first week
of June, Dale was in the final stages of negotiating for the
construction of a joint-venture shopping mall in Tientsin that, if
built, would have been the largest shopping mall in the world _ and
put his company on track to be a billion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he himself had no dissident connections, he knew at
once that he was vulnerable on the pro-democracy issue because his
friend Xu had caught Tiananmen fever and was publicly voicing
support for the students while praising capitalism as ``a great
creation of human civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So the smart thing for me to do at this point would be to just
sit back and say nothing, distance myself from Mr. Xu, then wait
for the smoke to clear and gradually reform my connections with
(Beijing).'' But something inside him _ ``probably that missionary
heritage'' _ just wouldn't let him do the smart thing.
</P>
<P>
   As Tiananmen ran red with blood in the early hours of June 4,
1989, he watched the horror on CNN while numbly mumbling to
himself, ``The people who ordered this (the massacre) are the
people I do business with every day ... the people to whom I am
bringing the leaders of the corporations of America ... the people
I serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He stewed about it for hours, then, ``in a burst of
inspiration,'' he closed himself off in his study and composed a
song, ``China, We Hear You Call.'' Somewhat in the style of the
1985 ``We Are the World'' appeal for Live Aid, it was a rousing,
unashamedly emotional cry of support for the Beijing students.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he talked a Hong Kong TV station into lending him
its footage of the demonstrations, then gathered some 30 young
people (representing 20 nationalities and all races) as
singer-actors and shot a music video, intercutting the Tiananmen
footage with the young people singing his song.
</P>
<P>
   The ``China, We Hear You Call'' video was played constantly over
the ATV station for the next three weeks, and became the symbol of
Hong Kong's support for the Tiananmen victims, as well as for the
colony's fear of its own post-'97 future under a government that
would so callously and methodically kill its own children.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that video is still a legend in Hong Kong. ``It gives me
goose bumps just to think about it,'' a noted Hong Kong filmmaker
told me in 1997, shortly after the handover. ``It was a pure
expression _ maybe the last pure expression _ to come out of a Hong
Kong that was suddenly terrified of offending the bully at the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   It not only burned Dale's bridges with Beijing and destroyed his
business, it so infuriated the Communist leaders that he instantly
moved to the top of their enemies list. By the end of summer, a
U.S. government official warned him that he and his family might be
in ``physical danger'' and strongly advised him to leave Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1989, he pulled up stakes and left Asia, settled
briefly near his brother in Texas, then found his way to Seattle,
where he was hired to reorganize the stateside office of family
friend Doris Brougham, a longtime Taiwan missionary.
</P>
<P>
   From Seattle, he continued to act as a link to his friend Xu,
who also fled Hong Kong to live in protective custody in
California. As the most senior Chinese official ever to defect,
Xu's support is often sought on China issues. For instance, it was
Dale who got him behind President Clinton's controversial extension
of China's most-favored-nation trade status in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the years after Tiananmen were hard ones for Dale. Even
though his application for permanent-resident status was sponsored
by several top officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations, it
somehow became mired in red tape, and his fortune dwindled as the
delay stretched into years before he could legally work here.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finally able to work, he found himself handicapped
by being ``a fish out of water.'' ``I knew how to do business in
Asia, but I had no (business experience) on this side of the
Pacific. I was in the strange position of being qualified to be a
CEO of a major corporation in Asia or a clerk in a 7-Eleven store
here _ and nothing in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he managed to rebuild his life. He started a
successful business selling Asian beauty and health products; and
he returned to music, performing and recording in a lush symphonic
pop style that he found suited his ``die-hard romantic
sensibility.'' As the memories of Tiananmen have receded, he's even
made several brief trips back to China.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains pessimistic about China's future. ``The
leadership there is so ruthless and corrupt and belligerent _ and
its power concentrated in so few key families _ that it's hard to
even imagine. You almost have to have experienced it from the
inside to fully appreciate how desperately it will hang onto its
power _ no matter how capitalistic China becomes on the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   And he remains sad about America's ``lost opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, the U.S. still had an ability to influence what
China would become. But that's slipped away. America is so enmeshed
in China now, it just can't draw a hard line and take all the
business with it. It's too late. China is in the driver's seat now
and America is not.''
</P>
<P>
   As the capitalistic transformation of China has continued past
the blip
</P>
<P>
   of Tiananmen, people invariably ask Dale if he ever regrets that
burst of idealism 10 years ago that cost him so much.
</P>
<P>
   And he always answers, ``No, not once. In retrospect, it may
seem a rash and foolish act, but I'm still glad I did it. My kids
are proud of me ... and I sleep well at night.''

SEATTLE STUDENT FALTERS IN 1ST ROUND OF NATIONAL SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lena Barouh, 13, an eighth-grader at Washington
Middle School in Seattle, failed Wednesday to make it into the
second round of the 72nd National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   A contest judge threw her a killer word: ``erubescent,'' an
adjective meaning blushing or reddening.
</P>
<P>
   She spelled it A-R-E-O-B-E-S-C-E-N-T.
</P>
<P>
   Later she explained the mistake by saying that either the
pronouncer, one of the judges, ``didn't pronounce the word right or
I didn't hear it right.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and her father both said they were proud of her
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who got here is a good speller,'' she said. ``We
wouldn't have gotten here if we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Barouh, who was sponsored by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
will still receive $50 and a commemorative watch for her efforts.
She became eligible for the national contest after winning a
regional spelling bee in April.
</P>
<P>
   She was among 249 contestants whose week-long trip to the
nation's capital was financed by their sponsoring newspapers.
Barouh and 144 other spellers were eliminated during Wednesday's
three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Barouh _ who writes poems, sings and plays the violin _ said she
wants to pursue a career in music. Her mother, Ellen Mohl Barouh,
is a real estate agent, and her father, Aaron Barouh, manages a
shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The National Spelling Bee's champion, who will be determined
Thursday, will receive $10,000 and a choice of encyclopedias and
other prizes.

TOUGH TO DISLIKE THE APPEALING HONESTY OF ACTRESS CAMRYN MANHEIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Camryn Manheim is one of my new favorite people. And
not because of what she says about reporters. OK, maybe a little
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the press,'' Manheim says on page 258 of her
autobiography, which cracked The New York Times best-seller list
last week. ``Niney-nine percent of the reporters I've met have been
really cool people that I'd like to hang out with.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to dislike someone who speaks the truth so
eloquently, so forthrightly.
</P>
<P>
   But for all her appealing honesty, Manheim also can be
confrontational, cynical and antagonistic. Don't take my word for
it. She says so on page 53: ``My behavior can, at times, be
confrontational, cynical, antagonistic.'' This, after already
admitting (on page 46) that she's blunt, nosy, demanding,
intimidating and aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   No biggie. Manheim is a rarity among actors in that she's always
happy to express an opinion. Where most TV stars are loath to weigh
in on anything other than the easy stuff _ motherhood, the
importance of flossing and getting a good time slot _ Manheim is a
walking, talking editorial page. Just don't ask her to ``weigh
in,'' or you'll get an earful of opinion laced with a favorite word
that rhymes with duck.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim's book is titled ``Wake Up, I'm Fat!'' Based on a
cathartic and therapeutic one-woman stage show she created four
years ago, it is a well-written, poignant, profane and enormously
effective treatise on self-acceptance by a woman who has every
right to be bitter and despondent. Though aimed at large people who
have suffered discrimination and low self-esteem all their lives,
it ought to be read by anyone who has ever had an unkind thought
about fat people, or has been party to a joke about fat people, or
has found a reason not to associate with fat people.
</P>
<P>
   As Manheim concludes in her last chapter, ``I have lived my life
in a culture that hates fat people. ... It's a miracle that I laugh
every day and walk through my life with pride and confidence,
because our culture is unrelenting when it comes to large people. I
don't understand it and I doubt I ever will. We hurt nobody. We're
just fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The pride and confidence Manheim speaks of have been abetted by
the Golden Globe and the Emmy she won last year for playing Ellenor
Frutt on ABC's ``The Practice'' (which also won the Emmy as best
drama). But don't assume that a chewy role and some glittering
trophies make her ineligible to address the difficulties faced by
those who carry more weight than society says they should.
</P>
<P>
   We all remember the line at the end of her Emmy acceptance
speech: ``This is for all the fat girls!'' But the words that may
actually resonate longer are: ``I have always felt like such a
misfit, and to get this award from my peers is such a huge
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance. We all crave it. From our parents, our friends, our
co-workers. Rare is the person who willfully courts derision and
scorn. But fat people get double doses of each. Every day.
Unsolicited. From the media. From well-meaning (and incredibly
insensitive) relatives. Even from complete strangers. At 38,
Manheim has so many stories that ``Wake Up, I'm Fat!'' _ at 289
pages _ is merely a trailer for the full-length feature of her
life, which was a skinny girl's life until she was 11 and living in
Southern California, where people go grocery shopping in bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   She was in Seattle last week to share some of these stories,
doing the obligatory author interviews and a reading at the
University of Washington. And before she could utter a word at the
reading, Manheim was basking in the acceptance of 200 or so wildly
enthusiastic fans who gave her a standing ovation and filled Kane
Hall with shouts and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Manheim's message of ``fat acceptance'' has found wide
acceptance. This gives her more confidence, more conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel my mighty force,'' she said after the reading,
``and that's what I try to infuse my friends with. ... I invite
controversy. I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   True to her words, Manheim inscribes ``Raise hell!'' inside most
of the books she autographs. There are exceptions, though. For
Jacob, a ``nice Jewish boy'' who gave up his place in line to a
woman on crutches, Manheim wrote: ``Jacob, see page 117. Love,
Camryn.''
</P>
<P>
   Page 117 is where readers will find Manheim's official boyfriend
application form. It's part of a chapter in which she tells about
``Doug,'' a capital-L loser she met through an ad in the personals
when she was living in New York, and whose picture should accompany
the dictionary definition of ``cockroach.'' (The night of his date
with Manheim, Doug had a ``backup'' date with another woman later
in the evening, just in case.)
</P>
<P>
   Tall, friendly and confident, the former Debra Manheim _ she
changed to Camryn after being Debi for two decades and hating it _
is even more out there than Frutt, the outspoken defense lawyer she
has played for three seasons on ``The Practice,'' whose growing
acceptance seems to mirror Manheim's story of personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   She already had emerged from years of self-loathing when she met
with the show's creator, David E. Kelley, in January 1996. Her
one-woman show was a hit, her appearance in the ``The Road to
Wellville'' had led to other film work, and she had long ago
stopped taking amphetamines to lose weight, convinced that being a
size 22 was better than being dead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she considers her ``audition'' to be one of those
defining moments in life, mainly because she seized it and didn't
let go. As Manheim describes it, the meeting wasn't going well and
Kelley seemed more inclined to take a nap than chat. As she got up
to leave, she spied a cribbage board and asked Kelley _ she calls
him Mr. Michelle Pfeiffer _ if he played. He said he played against
the computer, implying that she'd be toast if she tried to take him
on. She suggested they play anyway. If she won, she'd get the part.
If he won, she'd disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley declined, but Manheim got the part. Kelley has since said
he created the role of Frutt specifically with Manheim in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when asked to give counsel to young people, whether it's
about acting or gaining self-esteem, Manheim's answer centers on
seizing the moment and flouting convention, provided no one else
gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best advice,'' she says, ``is to break the rules, ... raise
a little hell and get what you want. It's the only way you'll ever
get the brass ring.''
</P>
<P>
   On Manheim, the ring fits nicely, but she's not finished yet.
She's waiting for the day when her worth as an actor isn't linked
to her weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they don't mention that Tom Cruise is 5-foot-8 in
reviews is because it doesn't matter,'' says the 5-foot-10 Manheim.
``I hope that someday my weight will be regarded as equally
irrelevant.''

ANC SCORES BIG IN SOUTH AFRICA ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA _ South Africa swept a new generation of post-apartheid
leaders into power Wednesday in an election that solidified Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress in the closing days of his
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Results early Thursday confirmed the outcome that was widely
expected: Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's carefully groomed deputy
president, will succeed his boss on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   The mood around the country was decidedly less emotional than it
was five years ago, when the majority of South Africans cast
ballots for the first time in their lives _ and many whites,
fearful of black vengeance, added locks to their doors and canned
beans to their cupboards. This time, simple enthusiasm and goodwill
reigned, and voting proceeded with few irregularities or hints of
factional violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel absolutely wonderful. It is an exciting day,'' said
Mandela, the legendary campaigner against apartheid who rose from
decades of imprisonment to become elected president five years ago.
``The feeling is not as intense as in 1994, because then I
exercised my right to vote for the first time. Now I feel
comparatively relaxed. I feel proud. I voted for South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mbeki's ascension was never in doubt, two questions
were harder to answer early Thursday: Would the ANC gain a lock on
both parliament and the nine provincial governments? Which minor
party would emerge as the official opposition party?
</P>
<P>
   The road to Wednesday's election was bumpy. The head of the
Independent Electoral Commission, Judge Johan Kriegler, resigned in
a dispute with Mbeki over government encroachment in the process.
Later, two opposition parties appealed to the Constitutional Court,
South Africa's highest tribunal, to annul new identification
requirements for voters.
</P>
<P>
   But when the day for casting ballots arrived, remarkably few
problems arose. Despite months of apparent voter apathy and in
spite of chilly, blustery winter weather on election day, long
lines formed outside polling stations hours before they opened, and
many of the 14,000 locations stayed open past the official closing
time to accommodate thousands of voters who still had not cast
their ballots. More than 18 million South Africans had registered
ahead of the election.
</P>
<P>
   The government deployed more than 100,000 police and military
personnel throughout the country to minimize disruptions.
Opposition leaders made scattered allegations of fraud, but
election officials Thursday night reported no major irregularities
or incidents of violence, unlike the street fighting and bombings
orchestrated five years ago by both right-wing groups and rival
factions of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between 1994 and now is that we have the chance
to vote without intimidation,'' said Mike Maseko, among thousands
standing in a line outside the library in the Johannesburg township
of Vosloorus. ``There is no factional fighting this time. People
are beginning to understand what the vote is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago the masses voted for their liberation from
repressive white minority rule. Wednesday they voted their wallets.
In line after line across the townships on the industrialized
flatlands east of Johannesburg, people said the main factor
determining how they voted was jobs. Unemployment in South Africa
hovers near 40 percent, and the economy is growing at less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not feeling good today,'' said Elliott Gxabuza, who voted
in the township of Greenfields. ``I have no work, no money, no
house. I am crying for work.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a polling station in Vosloorus, Dora Siboyana
uttered her protest. ``I voted for the New National Party, because
it is led by a white man,'' said Siboyana, who is black. ``I don't
want the ANC. The black leaders have given us nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same station, Laetia Ndlamla gave the opposite view:
``The ANC is the only way to go. We suffered for 48 years under the
white government. People expect changes overnight, but that is not
possible. No one can do it better than Mandela.''
</P>
<P>
   The ANC sought a two-thirds majority in the legislature to
accelerate the pace of reforms to education, labor, and the
economy. The party shed its broad-based appeal for reconciliation,
the predominant theme of Mandela's presidency, and campaigned on a
platform of aggressive social transformation for the impoverished
black majority.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party also wanted to take control of the two
provincial governments under opposition control, thereby weakening
its rivals in Zulu stronghold of KwaZulu-Natal and the
Afrikaner-based Western Cape. Initial results indicated that the
ANC would take neither province.
</P>
<P>
   Four parties jockeyed ahead of a large pack of inconsequential
rivals. The Democratic Party, appealing to conservative whites,
hoped to knock out the New National Party, a makeover of the group
that led South Africa under apartheid for 48 years and emerged as
the leading opposition to the ANC after the last election. An
upstart, the United Democratic Movement, portrayed itself as the
only party without ties to the past, having been created in 1997.
The early numbers indicated that none of these parties enjoyed more
than regional support.

SEATTLE STUDENT FALTERS IN 1ST ROUND OF NATIONAL SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lena Barouh, 13, an eighth-grader at Washington
Middle School in Seattle, failed Wednesday to make it into the
second round of the 72nd National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   A contest judge threw her a killer word: ``erubescent,'' an
adjective meaning blushing or reddening.
</P>
<P>
   She spelled it A-R-E-O-B-E-S-C-E-N-T.
</P>
<P>
   Later she explained the mistake by saying that either the
pronouncer, one of the judges, ``didn't pronounce the word right or
I didn't hear it right.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and her father both said they were proud of her
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who got here is a good speller,'' she said. ``We
wouldn't have gotten here if we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Barouh, who was sponsored by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
will still receive $50 and a commemorative watch for her efforts.
She became eligible for the national contest after winning a
regional spelling bee in April.
</P>
<P>
   She was among 249 contestants whose week-long trip to the
nation's capital was financed by their sponsoring newspapers.
Barouh and 144 other spellers were eliminated during Wednesday's
three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Barouh _ who writes poems, sings and plays the violin _ said she
wants to pursue a career in music. Her mother, Ellen Mohl Barouh,
is a real estate agent, and her father, Aaron Barouh, manages a
shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The National Spelling Bee's champion, who will be determined
Thursday, will receive $10,000 and a choice of encyclopedias and
other prizes.

 &HT;    Investigators to explore weather's role in plane crash
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Federal investigators will focus today on
what role the weather may have played in the fatal crash of
American Airlines Flight 1420, which slid off the runway late
Tuesday night amid a fierce hailstorm, broke into pieces and caught
on fire. At least nine people, including the pilot, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators want to know what pilot Richard Buschmann was told
about the violent weather before he attempted to land the plane at
the Little Rock airport.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which had been delayed for nearly two hours in Dallas
because of severe weather, approached from the southeast. A severe
thunderstorm was headed toward the airport from the northeast about
the same time, producing a ``crosswind,'' said George Wilkin,
science and operations officer for the National Weather Service
office just across the Arkansas River from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a big crosswind,'' said Richard Klamm, 49, of
Pine Bluff, a passenger in the first-class section. ``I think the
pilot just lost control of the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 145 passengers and crew on board the Dallas to Little
Rock flight, 83 people were treated at local hospitals, mostly for
cuts and burns. Another 51 uninjured people were reunited with
friends and relatives in a theater at a nearby aerospace museum. At
least two people remained unaccounted for late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary list of 118 survivors released by American
Airlines late Wednesday gave hometowns for about one-third of those
named.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane was going so fast, when we hit the ground, we went
off the end of the runway,'' said passenger Barrett Baber, who was
returning from a trip to Germany with other members of the Ouachita
Singers from Ouachita Baptist University at Arkadelphia. ``We hit a
huge pole, and it split the plane in half. A fire started at the
front of the plane and spread back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the smoke got too thick,'' Baber said, ``there was
nothing we could do. People were screaming, `God, please save
us!'''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines Flight 1420 had approached Runway 04 Right as
a severe thunderstorm raged just before midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the twin-engine, McDonnell Douglas Super 80 touched down,
heavy rain had reduced visibility to about one mile, Wilkin said.
Four-tenths of an inch of rain fell in just three minutes, right
around the time of the accident, Wilkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an extraordinary amount of rain to have in that period
of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 minutes before the plane hit the runway, the area had
been placed under a severe thunderstorm warning, Wilkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Chicago-based pilot Richard Buschmann, who was killed
in the crash, didn't circle to avoid the violent weather, National
Transportation Safety Board member George W. Black Jr. said that
would be ``assuming he knew it was here.''
</P>
<P>
   A wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the airport around 11:56
p.m. _ roughly six minutes after the crash. Still, federal
investigators haven't blamed the crash on turbulent weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can glean from that is that there was
active weather at the time,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, investigators will examine the wreckage again and allow
reporters to see the plane's broken hull, which was sliced open
like an aluminum drink can along its left side. Investigators also
will listen to audio tapes of air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data and cockpit voice recorders arrived in
Washington on Wednesday. The instruments captured ``good data'' and
transcripts will be developed in the next several days, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have attempted
to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone told me there were 50-knot gusts at the airport, I
would be leaving town,'' Cecil Ewell said at a news conference at
Fort Worth, Texas. Ewell oversees all of American Airlines' pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said it warned the tower of the
approaching storm. Bob Baker, the airline's executive vice
president of flight operations, said that weather dispatches were
relayed to the flight crew, but specifics of those conversations
have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   William Shumann, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation
Administration, said there was no distress call from the cockpit
before the landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck a number of structures,'' Black said. The plane
rotated nearly 180 degrees before stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Snowden, a district fire chief, said the 16-year-old plane
split into two after hitting approach lights at the end of the
runway. The left side of the fuselage was ripped open.
Firefighters, who reached the scene in about six minutes, according
to Black, used foam to put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
   FAA records show the plane had been involved in one previous
incident, which was non-fatal. An engine failed in 1987 during a
safe landing in Las Vegas. Worn turbine housing caused that
failure, investigators concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Choir member Baber, seated in row 30, said the flames were
within 15 feet of him by the time he got out 30 seconds after the
landing. Some passengers getting off the plane found themselves in
waist-deep water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was panic, craziness, there were flames,'' Baber said.
``The emergency door was cracked, and people were able to get out
only one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton said he and Hillary Rodham
Clinton were saddened to learn of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We join the American people in extending our deepest
sympathies to the families of those who died or were injured,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths are the first in an U.S. commercial airline accident
since Dec. 28, 1997, when a woman was killed aboard a United
Airlines 747 that encountered severe turbulence over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. aviation officials celebrated a fatality-free
year aboard scheduled U.S. commercial flights. U.S. airlines also
had one of their safest years ever in 1997, a year after one of the
deadliest on record.

`PILONCILLO' LEAVES BITTER TASTE FOR SPELLING CONTESTANT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Andrew Shawhan, a seventh-grader from Delmar, N.Y.,
stumbled Wednesday on ``piloncillo'' in the 72nd National Spelling
Bee, but vowed to give the competition another shot next year.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the word, Andrew, 13, concentrated and asked for a
definition. The word refers to a hard candy made of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting a moment, he asked for the word's origin. The answer:
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew hesitated, then began to spell the world.
</P>
<P>
   P-I-L-O-N-C-I-L-O.
</P>
<P>
   He was one ``l'' short, and in this contest of words and nerves,
the bell sounded, indicating an incorrect answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bethlehem Central Middle School student glanced at the
pronouncer, shook his head and walked off stage to the ``comfort
room'' for the contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew didn't stay in the room long. Emerging after only a few
minutes, he was immediately surrounded by his family, including his
brother, Mark, who competed in the bee two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is luck of the draw and which words you are
given,'' said Andrew, who will take home $50 and a commemorative
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, who still faces final exams later this month, kept the
competition in perspective. ``It's not like we're getting graded up
there or anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and his older brother, who lost on the French-origin word
``brume,'' which means mist or fog, even managed to joke about the
words that they misspelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studies French and was knocked out by a Spanish word; I
study Spanish and was knocked out by a French word,'' Mark, 15,
said. ``Each of us would have easily known the other word.''
</P>
<P>
   Although promising to compete again next year, Andrew said he
was going to take some time off before studying again. ``I need a
break for awhile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew has earned a green belt in Judo and listens to music
ranging from the English composer Gustav Holst to the American
rapper group the Beastie Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's father, Peter B. Shawhan, a lawyer with the New York
Department of Transportation, said he drilled his son on spelling
for weeks before the competition but stopped once they arrived in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the best part of this is the kids having a chance to
experience the nation's capital and seeing the actual places where
so much history has taken place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's mother, Joanne Parnes Shawhan, a school librarian, said
she was glad the competition was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys learn so much from it and have done so well, but by
the end, we're all pretty tired of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the National Spelling Bee, sponsored by the E.W.
Scripps Co., will receive $10,000 in cash and other prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Following the first day of competition, 104 of 249 contestants
remained.

DAVIS AUDITIONS FOR CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite the haystack of evidence in his favor,
Baron Davis was obliged to drag the burden of proof into USC's Lyon
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first time doing this, so I was kind of nervous,''
the ex-UCLA star admitted Wednesday after nearly two hours of
on-court auditioning for the Clippers. ``I just wanted to come in
and no matter what work as hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a left turn at this concept of ``work.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a 6-foot-2 (legit) point guard with game galore, decided
to enter the workforce last month, forsaking his final two years of
college eligibility to make a living in the NBA. Wednesday was his
first official job interview for teams that will consider Davis for
employment via the NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the roles were transposed: Davis, the Gatorade
National High School Player of the Year while at Crossroads in
Santa Monica, would visit a university whose basketball staff
behaved like skinny car salesmen in a quiet showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a prospective employee expected to be worth millions, it
is incumbent upon Davis to demonstrate that he's worth the pick.
The Clippers have the fourth selection in the June 30 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big difference,'' Davis said. ``Here, you have to
showcase what you can do, so you basically have to be on top of
your game.''
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of Davis' game are what interest Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers' vice president of basketball operations. At a time when
many severely hyped point guards arrive with high-maintenance egos,
Davis hits the market having played the position since the days
when his Nikes were small enough to swing from the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a factor,'' Baylor said of Davis' status as a
card-carrying, pass-first point guard. ``He has the point-guard
mentality. There's no question that he has point-guard skills.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the only questions trailing Davis involve his improving
perimeter stroke and that left knee, the wheel he injured in the
last game of his freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee feels great ... one-hundred percent,'' said Davis,
whose post-UCLA regimen of weight lifting and skill building
appears to have put him in fighting trim. Also conspicuous by its
absence was the bulky knee brace that went along for his sophomore
ride. Davis did have to deal with the last hurrahs of a head cold
that compromised his usual on-court energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gamer,'' Baylor said. ``Being in the same city, we know
what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   And being in the same city has allowed Davis to be very aware of
what the Clippers have done. Davis publicly, at least continues to
insist he would embrace the challenge of building another winning
franchise in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love it,'' he said of playing for the Clippers. ``I
think it's a new era. The Clippers have a lot of young talent; I
think I could help in a lot of different ways. Turning it around
here would be an accomplishment I would like to be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for the record, he also wouldn't mind playing for the other
NBA team that will move into the new Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to play here in my hometown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona point guard Jason Terry will trot out his stuff for the
Clippers today, with Miami of Ohio forward Wally Szczerbiak due
Friday. Corey Maggette, the high-flying swingman who is leaving
Duke after his freshman season, is expected to visit in about two
weeks.

   Andrew, who still faces final exams later this month, kept the
competition in perspective. ``It's not like we're getting graded up
there or anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and his older brother, who lost on the French-origin word
``brume,'' which means mist or fog, even managed to joke about the
words that they misspelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studies French and was knocked out by a Spanish word; I
study Spanish and was knocked out by a French word,'' Mark, 15,
said. ``Each of us would have easily known the other word.''
</P>
<P>
   Although promising to compete again next year, Andrew said he
was going to take some time off before studying again. ``I need a
break for awhile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew has earned a green belt in Judo and listens to music
ranging from the English composer Gustav Holst to the American
rapper group the Beastie Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's father, Peter B. Shawhan, a lawyer with the New York
Department of Transportation, said he drilled his son on spelling
for weeks before the competition but stopped once they arrived in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the best part of this is the kids having a chance to
experience the nation's capital and seeing the actual places where
so much history has taken place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's mother, Joanne Parnes Shawhan, a school librarian, said
she was glad the competition was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys learn so much from it and have done so well, but by
the end, we're all pretty tired of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the National Spelling Bee, sponsored by the E.W.
Scripps Co., will receive $10,000 in cash and other prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Following the first day of competition, 104 of 249 contestants
remained.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health care experts and federal regulators are
increasingly concerned about the tens of thousands of Americans who
are killed each year not by illness, but by medication intended to
treat it.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Helen McLaughlin, a widow who lived in Elizabeth,
N.J., walked into the pharmacy department of the local ShopRite
supermarket to fill a prescription for chlorpromazine, an
anti-psychotic medication. According to her son Charles and a
lawyer who is suing ShopRite on behalf of her family, she walked
out with a drug that has a nearly identical name, chlorpropamide,
which is used by diabetics to lower their blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly serious mistake, the family said. Mrs.
McLaughlin suffered from diabetes, and was already taking
medication for it. She took the new drug in addition to her regular
pills for three weeks when she was admitted to Elizabeth General
Medical Center with dangerously low blood sugar. That, McLaughlin
said, unleashed a cascade of health problems for his mother,
including stomach ulcers and a drug-resistant bacterial infection.
She died on May 20, 1997. She was 73.
</P>
<P>
   There is no failsafe system to prevent prescription errors, a
fact that is becoming apparent to the Food and Drug Administration
and independent drug safety experts. They say Helen McLaughlin's
death highlights a pervasive and dangerous problem: with more
medications on pharmacy shelves than ever before, and more
prescriptions being written, the nation's health care system is
overwhelmed, creating a growing risk that patients will be killed
or hurt by adverse reactions or mistakes. Regulators, even after
approving a new drug, cannot always predict all potential side
effects, or toxic interactions. Many pharmacists are overworked,
and filling more prescriptions with less help. And with as many as
a dozen medications available for any one ailment, doctors are
having a hard time keeping abreast of FDA warnings about possible
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The true scope of the problem is unknown, in part because
hospitals and doctors are not required to report it.
</P>
<P>
   But recent studies lead scientists to think that prescription
drugs are killing and injuring far more people than previously
believed, and experts estimate two-thirds of the deaths and
injuries could be prevented. Last year, a study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association estimated that 106,000 hospital
patients die and 2.2 million are injured each year by adverse
reactions to prescription drugs, not including cases where errors
are involved. The estimate was the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In a recently released 150-page report, the FDA called upon
pharmacists, doctors, hospitals and drug companies to work together
to create ``a new framework'' for cutting down on the risks from
the drugs the agency approves. On June 1, the FDA implemented a new
rule requiring the manufacturers of some especially risky drugs to
distribute explicit warning pamphlets to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical manufacturers are discovering new ways to treat
more diseases and conditions, from impotence to diabetes. The FDA,
long criticized as moving too slowly on drug applications, is now
approving products at a record-setting pace. And patients are
living longer with illnesses that could once not be treated.
</P>
<P>
   More prescriptions are being written, not only because there are
more drugs but because the population is aging; the elderly take
more than one third of all drugs that are prescribed. In 1992,
according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, 2.03
billion prescriptions were dispensed in retail pharmacies; by last
year, the figure was up to 2.78 billion. By the year 2005, the
association estimates, it will be 4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies, pressed like other health care providers by the cost
controls of managed care, are struggling to fill the higher volume
of prescriptions in less time, and with less help. ``I worked
12-hour days, and if you get to the bathroom once a day, you're
fortunate,'' said Adle Joseph, a pharmacist at the Leesburg
Pharmacy in Leesburg, Va., who spent 35 years with the Rite Aid
chain before retiring last year to join a slower-paced, independent
store. ``The conditions are just not conducive to good safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, too, are overloaded. Two decades ago, physicians
familiarized themselves with a relatively small pharmacopeia and
prescribed the same drugs again and again. Today, the choice of
medicines rests not only with doctors, but also with managed care
companies, which buy drugs in bulk to reduce costs and list them on
formularies that can change each month.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Providence,
R.I., Dr. Jeannette Chirico-Post, the hospital's chief of staff,
says she is concerned about how complicated prescribing drugs has
become. ``We have more drugs at our fingertips,'' she said, ``and
the potential for drug-drug interaction is far greater than we saw
10 or 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And while computer technology is available to help physicians
avoid mistakes and screen for dangerous combinations of drugs, few
hospitals and even fewer private doctors have it. Those that do say
the systems can produce so many false alarms they are nearly
impossible to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using medications in ways that we never used them
before,'' said Michael Cohen, president of the Institute for Safe
Medication Practices, a nonprofit organization investigates
prescription drug errors. He said the mistake in Mrs. McLaughlin's
case could have been avoided with clearer labeling.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of ways that people can be killed or injured
by their medicine. Outright mistakes are one; some experts say
these medication errors account for a third to one half of all
cases. Known side effects, including dangerous interactions between
drugs, are another. Unforeseen side effects, which do not turn up
in testing but become apparent after a drug comes into widespread
use, are a third.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, these are known as ``adverse drug events,'' and in
recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has been troubled
by a string of them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Posicor, a high blood pressure medicine, was withdrawn from
the market last year, but not because the drug was harmful on its
own. Rather, Posicor became lethal in combination with a long list
of other drugs, so many that the FDA felt that doctors and
consumers could not keep abreast of the risks. FDA officials said
that 24 people taking Posicor in the 11 months it was on the market
had died, and that two or three of those deaths were directly tied
to Posicor, although a spokeswoman for Roche Laboratories of
Nutley, N.J., the drug's maker, has said ``no causal link'' was
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   _ The diabetes drug Rezulin, approved two years ago, can cause
liver damage, which prompted the FDA to issue repeated warnings to
doctors to closely monitor patients taking it. But an agency
investigation found that doctors were not listening; only 2.7
percent of patients taking Rezulin for three months were being
monitored according to the agency's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in March, the FDA and Rezulin's manufacturer,
Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains,
N.J., agreed that 43 people had suffered acute liver failure that
was possibly due to the drug; of these, 28 died. A panel of
independent scientific experts has recommended that the drug be
prescribed only to patients who do not respond to other therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one in health care is as acutely aware of the
potential harm of prescription drugs than pharmacists. Yet
pharmacists say little attention is paid to the difficulties they
face in today's complex health care environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Leesburg Pharmacy , is a case in point. On a recent
afternoon, half a dozen patients were lined up waiting for their
prescriptions to be filled; others milled about the store. Behind
the counter, 49 prescriptions were in one stage or another of
preparation. ``And this is a slow day,'' said chief pharmacist Greg
Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Leesburg is an independent pharmacy and, like pharmacies around
the nation, its profits are being squeezed by lowered
reimbursements from managed care companies. So it makes up the
difference in volume. The store fills about 300 prescriptions per
day, a 50 percent increase from three years ago, according to its
owner, Bruce Roberts. He said that leaves little time for
pharmacists to talk to patients about how to take their medication,
something experts say is essential if drugs are to be used safely.
Chase came to the Leesburg Pharmacy two years ago from a chain drug
store, CVS, where three pharmacists filled 600 prescriptions per
day and often worked 12 hours straight to do it. ``You've gone four
to five hours without even a chance to go to the restroom,'' he
said. ``Your mind is fried.''
</P>
<P>
   CVS Pharmacy, which owns 4,100 drug stores in the United States,
and Rite Aid Corp., which owns 3,800 stores, said they have no
evidence that more mistakes are being made. But they are concerned
about workplace pressures, and are taking steps to ease the burden.
As members of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the
companies are also sponsoring research by a University of
Cincinnati psychology professor who is examining ways to reduce
pharmacy errors.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Tony Grasha, said in an interview that mistakes
occur when psychosocial factors, such as stress at home, combine
with a higher workload. He said his studies show errors are rare,
about 0.5 percent of all prescriptions filled, and that those that
pose a danger to patients are rarer still. But, he said, with the
number of prescriptions growing, mistakes are serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tiny fraction percentage-wise,'' he said, ``but when
you are filling 3 billion prescriptions a year and are anticipating
4 billion by the year 2005, then even a very small percentage is a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers are an important part of the pharmacy safety net, but
they have limitations. When Chase typed in the name of a
23-year-old patient who had been prescribed an anti-psychotic
medication, his computer issued a warning that the drug could be
dangerous in combination with another prescription in the patient's
file.
</P>
<P>
   But the system presumes that a patient goes to the same pharmacy
every time. And the computers raise so many red flags, without
distinguishing the serious from the benign, that pharmacists grow
weary of them and start to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like crying wolf,'' said Susan Winckler, director of
policy and legislation for the American Pharmaceutical Association,
which represents 52,000 pharmacists. ``Some pharmacists call it
`the right hand syndrome.' You just hit the return key when you see
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lucian Leape, a health policy analyst at the Harvard School
of Public Health, believes that the health care system can be
designed to minimize mistakes and drug dangers. He said, ``Errors
are symptoms of a sick system, not a sick person. Humans make
mistakes. To the extent you can redesign around that, you can get
rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the FDA could require pharmaceutical
companies to standardize their drug labels for easy reading.
Medicines could come with bar codes, so that pharmacists could use
scanners to check for the correct name, the same way a grocery
store clerk scans a jar of pickles. Doctors could trade their
prescription pads in for computers.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas are beginning to catch on in some unlikely places.
Two years ago, the Department of Veterans Affairs launched a major
patient safety initiative designed, in part, to minimize
prescription drug errors at the nation's 172 veterans hospitals and
clinics. Over the next two years, the department intends to spend
$40 million on technology that will allow doctors to use computers
to write their prescriptions.

NINE KILLED AS JET CRASHES IN STORM IN LITTLE ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ An American Airlines jet carrying 145 people
touched down in a furious thunderstorm late Tuesday, slid off the
runway and was sliced open as it hit a lighting tower. Nine people,
including the captain, were killed in the fiery crash, and more
than 80 people were injured, some with severe burns.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified passengers on what had been an uneventful, though
delayed, flight from Dallas scrambled out of the hole in the
burning fuselage and huddled in a low-lying field a few feet from
the Arkansas River while being pelted by dime-size hail. Others
squeezed through an emergency exit, and some jumped from a wing
that was ablaze with burning jet fuel. Several of the victims were
apparently seated near the wings of the twin-engine McDonnell
Douglas Super 80, where a fast-growing fire prompted the panicked
exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came to a stop I looked over my shoulder and saw a
fireball coming down the aisle,'' said Phyllis V. Caruth, a
statistics teacher at Little Rock Central High School. ``I thought,
`Forget the purse, woman, get out of the plane.'''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said it was too soon to blame the weather
as a primary culprit, but made it clear that the landing conditions
were severe.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Black, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said the crash occurred at 11:51 p.m. A few minutes after
the crash, radar equipment picked up enormous gusts of up to 76
knots, or 87 mph, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   George R. Wilkins, operations officer at the National Weather
Service station in North Little Rock, said a line of thunderstorms
was approaching the airport from the northwest at the time the
plane was landing from the south. He said the peak gust at the
moment of landing may have been as high as 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The airport had equipment to detect windshears, but
investigators said they did not yet know whether the gusts
registered on the equipment or whether the crew had been informed
of the severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said the crew had been informed by the Dallas
dispatcher that there was bad weather in the Little Rock area, but
said it was not known whether the Little Rock tower advised the
crew of its severity. Officials of the National Transportation
Safety Board said the plane's voice and data recorders were
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of the crash, the airport lost electrical power,
Black said, although he did not know if that was caused by the
collision with the light tower or by the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The two-man crew of Flight 1420 had been on duty for 13.5 hours,
a half-hour short of the American Airlines limit for flying duty.
They had begun their day in Chicago, making stops at Salt Lake City
and Dallas, where the flight was delayed two hours because of bad
weather, before departing for Little Rock. American Airlines denied
that the crew was fatigued, but other pilots said the long day may
have pushed the crew to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   The flight captain, Richard Buschmann, who died in the crash,
had flown for American Airlines for 20 years and was the company's
chief pilot in Chicago. The co-pilot, Michael Origel, had just
finished his training in March; he suffered a broken leg in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420, scheduled to leave Dallas at 8:30 p.m., had been
delayed for more than two hours because the scheduled plane had not
arrived due to bad weather in north Texas, several passengers said.
Around 10:30 p.m., American brought over an MD-80 which had been
stationed in a hangar, and the flight left around 10:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University senior who was returning
home to Little Rock, said there was no turbulence or noticeable bad
weather until about 15 minutes before landing, when she saw
thunderclouds and lightning not far away. The descent seemed
ordinary until touchdown, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like he was trying to brake, but couldn't,'' Ms. Goss
said. ``Then all of a sudden, I said, `Oh my God, we're on the
grass,' and we had veered off the runway to the left. We were going
way too fast. Then there was this boom, and then a really loud
boom, and all the lights went out.''

   Black, the Transportation Board investigator, confirmed that the
plane had left the runway to the left, heading down an embankment
to the river, until it hit the lighting tower and several other
pieces of heavy airport equipment. The crash stopped the plane from
dropping into the water, he said, but in doing so it ripped the
plane's skin apart and caused the fire.

<P>
   In terror, passengers in the back rows managed to escape through
the rear hatch, while those in the front got out through the
torn-open fuselage. The fire was in the middle of the plane, and it
spread swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see there was flame from the middle of the plane to
the back and it was getting worse,'' said Richard M. Klamm, a
chemical salesman from Pine Bluff, Ark. ``You look at it and then
you wonder how anyone came out of it. It was like a dream: you
think you'll roll over and it'll be a dream. It wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goss said there was no warning from the crew that a crash
was imminent, and said she saw no flight attendants helping people
out of the plane. Firefighters had to use chisels to pull some
passengers through openings in the plane's side.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goss' father, Patrick J. Goss, is a partner at Wright,
Lindsey &AMP; Jennings, which is President Bill Clinton's old law firm.
Mayor Jim Dailey of Little Rock said the president had several
friends on the plane, all of whom survived.
</P>
<P>
   Area hospitals treated 83 people for injuries, mainly abrasions,
cuts and burns, while 51 people escaped without injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The nine fatalities confirmed by the county coroner were the
first in the 82-year history of Little Rock's airport, and the
first on an American commercial plane since December 1997.

ENVOYS DELIVER PEACE PLAN TO MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Russian and European envoys Wednesday night handed
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic what they described as a
peace plan and what they hope is a face-saving way to end the war
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The two envoys are expected to resume discussions with Milosevic
on Thursday, and the Serbian parliament is scheduled to debate the
peace plan, which calls for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from
Kosovo and the creation of a peacekeeping force that will include
troops from NATO nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced Wednesday that he would increase the
US commitment to the peacekeeping force from 4,000 to 7,000 troops
and added 68 US aircraft to NATO's forces.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted by Milosevic, the deal would be formally approved by
the United Nations, allowing the leaders of NATO countries to
sidestep the awkwardness of having to sign an agreement also signed
by an indicted war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Some sticking points remain: how many Serb forces will be
allowed to stay behind in Kosovo, and what will be the composition
and placement of the international peacekeeping force that is meant
to encourage the return of some 1 million ethnic Albanians who were
expelled by Serb forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians favor putting their troops in northern
Kosovo, and leaving southern Kosovo to NATO forces, US and British
officials Wednesday said that would amount to a de facto partition
of Kosovo, a prospect which NATO General Secretary Javier Solana
has ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and the European envoy,
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, met Wednesday evening with
Milosevic for just two hours, a brief encounter by Milosevic's
usual marathon standards. An aide to Ahtisaari said the meeting was
not a negotiating session, but simply an attempt to explain the
offer to Milosevic. The aide said they would meet again Thursday
with Milosevic to clarify questions raised Wednesday night by
Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin were expected to arrive in the
Yugoslav capital Wednesday morning but did not get here until late
afternoon as the Western allies and Russia tried to hammer out
their differences in Germany. Ahtisaari is scheduled to return to
Germany later Thursday to brief a summit of European Union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with Milosevic, Ahtisaari said an all-night
bargaining session between Russia and the western allies in Bonn
had been productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached a largely common position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials and those from NATO countries,
particularly the United States and Britain, remain divided on the
placement and composition of the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said, ``There will be two separate presences in
Kosovo, a NATO presence and a Russian presence.''
</P>
<P>
   But US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had held
two days of talks with Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin, contradicted
Chernomyrdin's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be unity of command for this to be really
effective, in order for it not to slip down a slippery slope into
partition, ineffectiveness or worse,'' said Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Talbott suggested the differences with Russia ``are being
narrowed.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin also said the United
States wouldn't allow any partition of Kosovo. ``The Russians said
they want to participate. We've said we welcome their
participation. The arrangements for that have not been worked out.
But imagining a partition, in which Russians would deploy in a
separate setting . . . that is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's talks seemed to indicate major Russian concessions
on what a peace deal would look like. Chernomyrdin previously
opposed several key NATO demands _ including the composition of any
peacekeeping ground troops in Kosovo and the withdrawal of Serb
troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But in the two days leading up to the trip to Belgrade,
Chernomyrdin and EU envoy Martti Ahtisaari ``significantly closed
the gaps'' between US and Russian proposals, one senior
administration official said. Rubin said the two reached a point
where they would ``not be saying different things and not be
contradicting each other'' as they presented the NATO plan to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was not NATO that made concessions, officials said.
``NATO's conditions remain NATO's conditions . . . and if you see
the details and you see the fine print, you will see it is what we
have been saying all along,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it was the position of the Russians, who apparently
agreed to some of NATO's central demands in an effort to ``present
a common front and isolate Milosevic'' at the negotiating table,
another official said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the official said, ``All of this is nice. It's helpful.
But what matters is that we're pounding them day and night. And the
longer this continues, the less options Milosevic's going to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   In war-weary Belgrade, there was a palpable sense that Wednesday
night's visit was the beginning of the end. The state-run media
seemed to be preparing people for a deal, praising the ``national
resistance'' to ``NATO aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary people are sick of the nightly bombing, power and
water outages, and the almost daily tales of civilians being killed
by NATO bombs. The government says that more than 1,500 civilians
have been killed, but has not said how many of its soldiers have
died.
</P>
<P>
   Slavica Vesic, 39, a bus driver, said he was tired of driving
his bus amid the wail of air raid sirens and frightening
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sick of the war,'' he said, adding that he was willing
to accept ``any kind of deal that would bring an end of the
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav Papic, a 52-year-old retiree, said he wanted peace, but
trusted Milosevic not to accept a bad deal. Papic, however, said he
did not want Americans in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them resolve their own problems with black people and
leave us alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people said they hoped the war would end soon, both
Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari cautioned against over-optimism.
Chernomyrdin said he did not expect this to be the last visit,
while Ahtisaari said he did not expect an agreement to be signed,
or for the bombing to end with this visit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ahtisaari fed optimism upon his arrival in Belgrade by
saying, ``This is a historic day for Yugoslavia,'' and describing
the plan he and Chernomyrdin brought as ``an offer for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the peace plan, meanwhile, are expected to be opposed
by others. The proposal reportedly would effectively disband the
Kosovo Liberation Army. While not spelled out in the proposal, the
Western allies and Russia have reportedly agreed that the KLA
should be refashioned into a political party and some of its
members made part of the police force in an autonomous Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians will also be upset to learn the peace plan
makes no mention of a referendum to decide whether Kosovo should
become independent. Central to the plan is respecting the
``territorial integrity'' of Yugoslavia by recognizing the current
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the diplomatic maneuvers, NATO showed no letup in the
bombardments it launched March 24, striking Serb military targets
across Kosovo and hitting power lines, fuel depots and TV relay
stations in and around Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav media reported strikes on the central Serbian towns of
Jagodina and Cuprija.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sounded Wednesday night in Belgrade at about 10
p.m., but for the first time in several weeks there was no routine
bombing in and around the capital. NATO, however, was expected to
continue bombing Yugoslavia until there is a formal capitulation by
Milosevic.

JUDGES AT THE HAGUE REFUSE TO ORDER HALT TO NATO BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Judges at the International Court of Justice in The
Hague, Netherlands, refused Wednesday to order NATO countries to
halt their bombing of Yugoslavia. The judges also declined to
discuss Yugoslavia's demand to be paid for war damages.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the decisions, the presiding judge said a large
majority had found that the court had no jurisdiction to consider
the Yugoslav claims. Yugoslavia had asked the court to declare the
bombing illegal and for an immediate injunction to end the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The judges at the court, the highest judicial body of the United
Nations, used veiled language to say the bombing was breaking
international law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is profoundly concerned about the use of force in
Yugoslavia,'' the acting president, Judge Christopher Weeramantry,
said. ``Under the present circumstances this raises very serious
issues of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judges did not address the legality, saying they were
addressing only whether they had jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was based on separate complaints filed by
Yugoslavia in April against each of the 10 countries involved in
the air attacks. Yugoslavia could not sue NATO, because the court
deals just with disputes between nations. In effect, Yugoslavia had
little hope of obtaining a blanket order to stop the bombing when
it sued, experts said. But because different NATO countries accept
different degrees of jurisdiction by the court, Yugoslavia had
hoped to divide NATO and embarrass at least a few member
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia has gambled wrong and it made mistakes on
technicalities,'' a legal scholar said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of 15 judges threw out Yugoslavia's request for
``provisional measures,'' or injunctions, to stop the airstrikes on
two counts.
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, Yugoslavia recognized the court's jurisdiction in
the dispute but it stipulated that it would not apply to prior
disputes. Legal experts said that in that way Yugoslavia wanted to
insure that the court could not consider charges of ethnic
cleansing or genocide for incidents before April 25.
</P>
<P>
   But that backfired. The court said it could not consider the
dispute with the NATO countries because the bombing had started
before April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the court rejected Yugoslavia's contention that NATO
countries were committing genocide in Yugoslavia. Legal scholars
said Yugoslavia was using that accusation mostly as a procedural
ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Although some countries do not recognize the court, they have
signed the Genocide Convention, and that would broaden the court's
jurisdiction. But the judges said there was no evidence that the
airstrikes were intended to commit genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Actions against a state are not actions against a group, the
court said. In presenting its case on May 10 and 11, Yugoslavia
gave a lengthy overview of damage caused to civilian installations
and said that at the time, 1,200 people had been killed and more
than 4,500 wounded. Yugoslavia included no damage caused to the
military, nor did it mention its campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The court deliberations have taken three weeks, and insiders
said they produced fierce arguments among the 15 permanent and five
ad hoc judges. The strongest dissents were by judges from China,
Russia and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement was also reflected in the vague wording that the
court used to call for an end to the violence. The court said it
was deeply concerned with the ``enormous suffering in Kosovo'' and
the ``continuing loss of life and human suffering in all parts of
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The court said that in eight of the 10 cases brought by
Yugoslavia it would continue to examine its jurisdiction and the
``legality of use of force.'' But it dropped the cases against the
United States and Spain because they had not recognized the court's
authority in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight countries are Belgium, Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal. Future deliberations
could take months or even years and will deprive Yugoslavia of any
immediate result that it had sought.

BARNES &AMP; NOBLE PLANS TO BUILD ITS OWN DISTRIBUTION NETWORK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Nev., Tenn.)   By STEPHEN LABATON and DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a likely challenge from federal antitrust
officials, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., the nation's largest retailer of
books, abandoned its plans Wednesday to acquire Ingram Book Group,
the nation's biggest book wholesaler, in a $600 million deal that
had provoked widespread complaints from other book sellers, large
and small.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday
that, although the agency had compelling policy reasons for
opposing the deal, it was also concerned that Barnes &AMP; Noble might
prevail in court if the company decided to press the matter. He
said antitrust law on so-called vertical mergers _ those between
companies and their suppliers or distributors _ does not generally
favor the government.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, executives of Barnes &AMP; Noble said they had decided
to scrap the deal and embark on a new course of expanding its
distribution networks in other ways, rather than face the
uncertainty of months or even years of legal wrangling in such a
fast-changing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any regrets. None. Zero,'' said Leonard Riggio,
the chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble. ``I mean, I guess the
emotion here is a combination of a sigh of relief and a feeling of
perhaps frustration that something that should be an open and shut
issue of business and law just gets confounded with emotion and
innuendo.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was viewed as a major coup for both Amazon.com, a
leading Internet bookseller, and the smaller bookstores that had
waged an aggressive campaign to kill the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Outlining his views about the proposed acquisition for the first
time Wednesday, Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission, appeared to sound relieved about the company's decision
to forego a court fight and scuttle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would not have been a slam dunk case,'' Pitofsky said in
an interview. ``The government and this agency haven't won a
vertical merger case in 20 or 25 years. These are not easy cases.''
</P>
<P>
   While such cases were common more than a generation ago, he
said, none had been pursued in the 1980s, and court decisions have
made it far harder for the government to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said he and the staff of the agency had concluded the
deal would have been harmful to competition for three reasons. He
said the small bookstores had made a persuasive case that it would
be dangerous for them to rely on Ingram as their wholesaler even as
Ingram was owned by a major competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the smaller bookstores need just-in-time delivery,''
Pitofsky said. ``They were concerned about their ability to get
such delivery in view of this proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the staff continued to analyze the deal, which was
proposed last November, it also began to raise concerns about its
impact on selling books through the Internet, a market which has
been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that Amazon has shown that it can take care of
itself through its own distribution network,'' Pitofsky said. ``But
what about the next competitor who wants to come along on the
Internet. Where do they find the books to compete with Amazon and
Barnes &AMP; Noble?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said there was concern that since Barnes &AMP; Noble has
its own wholesale facility that competes with Ingram, there was
also a ``horizontal component'' to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the analysis should not be taken as a sign that
the agency had reversed its general policy, which has been lenient
toward vertical mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to start an offensive against all vertical
mergers, but some of them are a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives at Barnes &AMP; Noble complained about the
decision made last Friday by the Competition Bureau of the Federal
Trade Commission to recommend that the agency oppose the deal. The
full commission, which rarely disagrees with its staff, was
expected to have voted on the deal later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FTC's staff view of the market appears to be shaped by the
loudest voices instead of the rapidly changing realities of how and
where people buy books,'' said John R. Ingram, chairman of Ingram
Book Group, who called the process a form of torture. ``The events
of the last several days have made it clear that some staff hold an
outdated view of the marketplace, making an objective analysis of
the transaction impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Barnes &AMP; Noble said that the company now
planned to use the $600 million in cash and stock that was the
purchase price for Ingram for other investments and acquisitions.
Riggio declined to elaborate, although he has said the company was
prepared to expand its New Jersey distribution center into a
network with new warehouses in Reno and Memphis, which will be
designed to serve its online bookstore, Barnesandnoble.com. Those
centers will provide adequate warehouse space for the future, he
said, noting that Barnes &AMP; Noble will continue to be an Ingram
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Barnes and Noble rose $1.25 Wednesday, to $28.625. The
company spun off Barnesandnoble.com on May 25. It hit a high of
$25.625 on May 26 and has fallen since, closing yesterday at
$17.1875.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Wednesday's developments, Ingram is left in a
more vulnerable position because its top customers _ the Borders
Group, Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble _ have been expanding their
own distribution networks. A top publishing executive said it was
Ingram that approached Barnes &AMP; Noble to strike the deal because of
projections that the wholesaler could lose millions of dollars in
sales as those shifts took place.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram said there were alliances his company might pursue
although he declined to elaborate. Asked if it would be able to
maintain its 11 distribution centers, Ingram said that ``it is too
early to tell'' and that the future depends on many of the
independent booksellers, who worked vigorously to block the union
of the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those booksellers that were out there making the case that
we were so vital to their survival, I would ask those customers
that they should consider doing business with us, especially now,''
said Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   The American Booksellers Association, a trade group representing
independent booksellers that helped galvanize public opposition to
the deal, actually did seem open Wednesday to some sort of business
rapprochement with Ingram despite existing tensions.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the deal, Avin Mark Domnitz, the
association's chief executive, said it might be willing to use
Ingram in the future as one of its wholesalers for its online
bookstore, Booksense.com, a cooperative effort of independent
booksellers that is scheduled to begin operating in September.
</P>
<P>
   Domnitz said the wholesaler once had close ties with independent
booksellers and ``you don't turn your back on family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the problem is resolved you try to reconstruct,'' he
said. ``Do wounds take time to heal? Do they heal completely
without scars or scabs? Most times they don't. But can you get past
it to a constructive relationship? Certainly we can.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Parents allowed to choose whether to evacuate kids in bomb
scares
 &HT;    By Diane Loupe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ga. _ Tired of the disruptions caused by nine recent
telephoned bomb threats at Decatur High School, the city school
superintendent is asking parents to help decide if their children
should be evacuated during threats that appear to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Ida Love informed Decatur High parents in a
letter this week that the school will not be evacuated solely on
the basis of a threatening call. However, students whose parents
have given their approval will be taken outside under supervision.
Teachers also may opt to leave, and elementary students _
temporarily housed in the building _ will be evacuated. Students
and teachers who remain inside will be in locked classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur school board Chairwoman Sara Turnipseed said the policy
strikes a balance between officials' desire to halt evacuations and
``those parents who cannot live with that risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My child is not being evacuated, and I love my child,'' said
Turnipseed.
</P>
<P>
   Turnipseed and Love emphasized that school officials will
continue to notify police immediately and search the building after
every telephoned threat and will evacuate everyone if they have
reason to believe any call is more than just a prank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the calls will continue forever if we don't do
something,'' said Turnipseed.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety
Center, a Westlake Village, Calif.-based nonprofit group, said he
would advise against creating ``two classes of citizens'' during
evacuations. School officials ought to take seriously every threat
they receive, which doesn't necessarily mean an evacuation,
Stephens said. But ``those decisions should apply to all
students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How to respond to bomb threats has become a vexing issue because
of hundreds of threats phoned into schools in the wake of the
shootings in Littleton, Colo., and Rockdale County's Heritage High
School. In one attempt to make a stand against threats, the
principal at Tapp Middle School in Cobb County invited parents to
come for a day of celebration at the school on the date when
bathroom graffiti had threatened an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In the DeKalb School System, principals call in school
detectives and ``depend on their advice on whether or not to
evacuate'' after receiving a threatening call, said school
spokesman Spencer Ragsdale. Last week, police arrested students
from Druid Hills and Columbia High schools, both of whom had used
cell phones to make bomb threats at their respective schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two Decatur High students were arrested last week for making
threats, but at least two bomb threats have come in since then. An
anonymous donor has posted a $500 reward for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of those responsible. BellSouth now has
the ability to trace every telephone call made to the school,
Turnipseed said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Coty, a Decatur High math teacher, said most of his
students said they would evacuate at the next threat. Coty says the
evacuations have ``completely annihilated'' third and fourth
periods, when most threats have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In all Decatur schools, no students will be allowed to bring
book bags or use their lockers for the rest of the school year,
which ends Wednesday. Off-campus lunch privileges enjoyed by some
seniors have been ended, and more doors are being kept locked.

 &HT;    Chemical executives sentenced
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ Two executives at a now-defunct chemical plant
here _ described as one of the nation's most dangerously polluted
sites and the worst ever in Georgia _ were sentenced Wednesday to
some of the stiffest prison terms ever imposed in a case involving
criminal violations of environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than $55 million has been spent to clean up the
LCP Chemicals-Georgia Inc. site, nearby tidal waterways still are
closed to commercial fishing and crabbing because seafood shows
dangerously high levels of mercury. Pollution was so pervasive that
toxins dissolved subsoil and migrated more than 40 feet down to
bedrock, where ``a blob of poison'' remains because the technology
does not exist to clean it up, federal authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of this corporation set the tone,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney William McAbee said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Anthony Alaimo sentenced
Christian A. Hansen Jr., 72, the former chief executive officer of
LCP Chemicals-Georgia Inc., to serve nine years in prison and pay a
$20,000 fine. He imposed a 6 1/2-year sentence on LCP's former
plant manager, Alfred Taylor, 59, of Brunswick. Federal sentencing
requires inmates to serve full terms.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kime, an attorney with the federal Environmental Protection
Agency in Washington, said sentences such as the ones imposed in
Brunswick are as rare as the endangered woodstorks that feed around
the LCP plant, which was shut down five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A six-year sentence is usually the maximum you see in these
cases,'' said Kime.
</P>
<P>
   Alaimo postponed sentencing Christian Hansen's son, Randall, 39,
of West Virginia, the plant's former chief operations officer and
treasurer. Like his father and Taylor, he was convicted on multiple
counts of polluting the environment and of knowingly endangering
plant workers. The three are appealing their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth executive, plant environmental manager Brent Hanson of
St. Simons Island, pleaded guilty to similar charges and was
sentenced recently to 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hansens and Taylor were on trial earlier this year,
workers testified they were told to wade through pools of water so
contaminated with caustic soda that it burned their skin, in order
to repair equipment that could have electrocuted them. The workers
said leaks of poisonous chlorine gas and the threat of explosions
were commonplace before the state Environmental Protection Division
ordered the plant to close in early 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Hansen, of New Jersey, is a former Exxon executive and
corporate powerhouse who founded the Hamlin Group Inc. The chemical
engineer operated plants in New York, West Virginia and other
states before acquiring the LCP plant in Brunswick in 1979. At one
time, Hansen was pulling down a $700,000 annual salary, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Described in court as a dictator with his employees, Hansen
turned ''a blind eye'' to problems that grew ever more serious at
LCP after the Hamlin Group went bankrupt in 1991, McAbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's New York plant pleaded guilty in the late 1980s to
dumping mercury and chlorine into a Syracuse lake. ''In New York,
you can see a corporate mentality developing that 'we can run our
plants however we want,''' McAbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lyons, the federal probation officer who prepared
pre-sentence reports on the three, said Christian Hansen ''bled the
Syracuse plant dry,'' then came to Brunswick and repeated his
pattern of corporate pollution. When toxic discharges at LCP got
out of hand, he designed unworkable systems to fix the problem,
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had his own people telling him a cleanup method he proposed
would not work,'' Lyons said. ''And he told them to do it anyway.''
Taylor, McAbee said, was found guilty of telling workers to dump
tank cars full of wastewater and sent workers into contaminated
water with electrical current running through it. He also
under-reported amounts of wastewater being disposed of by the
plant, McAbee said. ''Almost a million gallons a day of hazardous
waste was not reported for more than a year.'' After LCP closed,
the state exercised a one-time option given to all states: a
so-called ''silver bullet'' that allows authorities to move a toxic
site to the top of the federal Superfund list, clearing the way for
immediate cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Alaimo noted that Taylor, who stayed on as a $30-an-hour
contract worker after the closure, was lauded by environmental
authorities for his assistance in cleaning up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   In postponing sentencing for Randall Hansen, Alaimo said that if
he knew a way to depart from the stringent mandatory federal
sentencing guidelines, he would. Randall Hansen has two young
children and was described as a devoted father who is involved in
his church and community. Witnesses called him a lover of the
environment who ''picks up every match stick'' on camping trips.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, an engineer, was called in by his father in what was
styled as a last-ditch effort to save the LCP plant and what was
left of the elder Hansen's empire. ''Randall went to work out of a
sense of responsibility to his dad,'' said his wife, Elizabeth.
''The fact that they have not had the greatest relationship doesn't
mean he didn't feel responsibility.'' During Wednesday's hearing,
Alaimo noted that the Hansens and Taylor all have loving families
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most difficult days I have ever experienced
after being on the bench for nigh on 30 years,'' he commented.
</P>
<P>
   But Donnie Dixon, the U.S. Attorney for Georgia's Southern
Judicial District, said LCP left a blight on the South Georgia
environment that will last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage caused by the actions of these defendants will
adversely affect tidal creeks and marshes for at least the next 20
years,'' Dixon said.

TEXACO REJECTS CHEVRON'S MERGER PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texaco Inc. said Wednesday that its board had rejected a merger
proposal from Chevron Corp. and ended all takeover talks.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said that Chevron had offered to buy
Texaco for $70 a share, or about $37.5 billion, far below the $80 a
share that Texaco had sought and analysts believed would have been
a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron had also demanded that a Chevron executive head the new
company, while Peter I. Bijur, the 57-year-old chairman and chief
executive of Texaco, had wanted the combined board to decide who
would head the merged company, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the people said, Chevron wanted Texaco to sell its
interests in the refining and marketing alliances it had formed
with Shell Oil Co., the U.S. subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
and Saudi Refining Inc., which is a unit of Saudi Aramco.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the negotiations said that the sale would
have been complicated and would have delayed the completion of a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a low ball, cheap proposal,'' one of the people close
to the talks said of Chevron's offer.
</P>
<P>
   The people said that Bijur had initiated the discussions with
Chevron last summer when crude oil prices plunged to about $14 a
barrel. Since then crude oil prices have recovered and are in the
$16- to $17-a-barrel range.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the stock market closed Wednesday
Texaco said that its board ``found no compelling basis for the
discussions to continue and Chevron's proposal to be unacceptable
for reasons including complexity, feasibility, risk and price.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement added that ``Texaco intends to move forward
aggressively to execute its business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Texaco rose 31.25 cents, to $64.50, in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, while Chevron jumped $1.5625, to $92.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which is based in San Francisco, confirmed that it had
ended its talks with Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron's chairman and chief executive, said,
``I'm surprised that the Texaco board turned down a very
competitive offer that included a significant price premium to
Texaco shareholders and an opportunity to receive Chevron stock,
with its acknowledged strong growth prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors had doubted that the two companies would
complete the merger. One of the reasons was that Derr, who is 62,
was not willing to share power with Bijur. Chevron wanted to follow
the pattern of other mergers and emerge as the dominant company
after absorbing Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   This had occurred when British Petroleum began the oil merger
wave when it took over Amoco Corp. last August for $42.8 billion.
This was followed by an agreement by Exxon Corp. to take over Mobil
Corp. for $87 billion in December. British Petroleum had reached an
agreement to buy Arco in March for $26.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bijur said last fall that Texaco would pursue a merger if it
made sense for shareholders. But, he was preparing Texaco to go it
alone even if low crude oil prices had persisted.
</P>
<P>
   With the recovery in crude oil prices, including production
reductions by major oil producers including the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, the pressure to merge has subsided.

PILOTS, NOT TECHNOLOGY, MAKE THE FINAL DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professional pilots have millions of dollars worth of technology
at their fingertips, including radar systems that can track storm
cells 320 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But just before landing, they depend on air traffic controllers
to tell them a key detail: the wind speed near the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the mercy of the information we're given,'' said Drew
Engelke, an American Airlines pilot since 1991 and a first officer
on the MD-80 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are exploring the circumstances that led to
Tuesday's late night crash of American Airlines Flight 1420 in
Little Rock, Ark. Attention has focused on the pilots, and the
thunderstorms and high winds that buffeted the area during the
crash landing.
</P>
<P>
   Engelke declined to discuss the Little Rock crash, saying it is
under investigation. But he offered insight into the
decision-making process that pilots frequently confront when they
face bad weather, along with the limitations of their technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key points:
</P>
<P>
   Pilots usually make the ultimate call. The air traffic control
tower may delay a landing because of airplane traffic, low cloud
cover or poor visibility. Otherwise, the pilots decide whether the
conditions are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they get clearance from the tower and skies are sunny,
pilots can abruptly decide to take a lap around the airport to
check things out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they just don't like the way it looks,'' Engelke
said. ``You won't hear any argument from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial planes are not supposed to fly into severe weather.
The MD-80 that crashed Tuesday is certified to land only if
tailwinds do not exceed 10 knots or crosswinds do not top 30 knots,
according to Engelke and others.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the crash, wind gusts hit just under 30 knots at
the Little Rock airport. Five minutes before the crash and six
minutes afterward, the wind gusts were more than twice as strong.
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorm warnings don't ground flights. Engelke said
that pilots regularly fly through areas that are under storm
warnings; the key, he said, is to avoid the storm cells that can
damage planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first rule of thunderstorms is to avoid them,'' he said,
adding that pilots usually fly above or around storms. ``You find a
hole and you get through. But you don't fly into the storms.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots often circle above an airport, waiting for the weather to
clear, he said. Hail, which was falling in Little Rock at the time
of the crash, is very dangerous. Engelke he said he tries to leave
a buffer of up to 10 miles between hailstorms and his plane.
</P>
<P>
   When weather is an issue, pilots list two alternate destinations
before departing. Flight 1420, which had faced a two-hour weather
delay at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, listed Nashville and D/FW as
its alternative sites, Engelke said.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit radar can detect storm cells but not heavy winds.
Engelke said that pilots learn about wind conditions at the airport
by talking with air controllers or from an automated airport
recording that is updated hourly. The recording can also be faxed
to the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the radar systems that are commonly seen on TV news are
far more sophisticated than the planes' systems.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots decide whether they're too tired to go on. The pilots of
Flight 1420 had been working for more than 13 hours, which is near
the maximum set by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Safety experts nationwide have focused recently on pilot
fatigue, and Engelke said it is a personal call: If pilots are not
up to the job _ even for a single segment of the trip _ they are
supposed to call in sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make the assessment,'' he said. ``You have an obligation
to remove yourself if you're not physically and mentally capable of
flying that aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather advisories vary from one airport to another. Some
control towers provide little information beyond the recorded
weather data that is updated hourly, Engelke said.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the pilots can get all the details they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots can always ask for it,'' he said.

NATIONAL EVENT ATTRACTS HIKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it ``sole power.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the seventh National Trails Day expect more than a
million volunteers and recreationists Saturday to participate in
the tribute to hiking, biking and equestrian routes. They will lend
a hand in maintaining old tracks or constructing new pathways,
attend educational workshops and ceremonies or just hit the dusty
trail in honor of the annual event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible to see the amount of interest. It's very
refreshing,'' said Shirley Hearn, National Trails Day coordinator
for the Silver Spring, Md.-based American Hiking Society. The
organization was founded in 1976 to establish, maintain and protect
urban and backcountry corridors. National Trails Day became its
cause _ and the event for which the group is most known.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the largest celebration of America's outdoors, the
first Saturday in June is set aside to help raise awareness of
trail issues _ such as legislative initiatives that raise money to
ensure trails aren't overrun by development or disrepair _ and the
benefits that trails provide. In 1998, more than 3,000 programs in
50 states used National Trails Day as a springboard to promote the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe how excited the people get who organize these
events or volunteer for them,'' said Hearn. In her 10th year
working for the American Hiking Society but first year operating
with the National Trail Day, she is surprised by the amount of
interest in the event. ``It's important to me to make people aware
that without volunteers those trails are going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation during the 1997 event, some 2,500 miles of new
trails were dedicated, opened or built; 10,000 trail miles were
refurbished and 18,000 were hiked, ridden or run. That covers quite
a bit of terrain, and again this year several free Los Angeles-area
programs are slated for Saturday's National Trails Day and need the
help of concerned outdoors lovers: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ A route will be built starting at 7 a.m. from the
Corriganeville Movie Ranch in Simi Valley to the wildlife corridor
tunnel under the Ronald Reagan Freeway (118). Directions: Take the
118 west, exit at Kuehner Drive and turn left. Turn left again at
Smith Road to the dead-end parking lot. Look for sign. Tools, water
and refreshments are provided by the Rancho Simi Trail Blazers.
Ages 13 and older are requested. Information: (805) 520-1470.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work takes place from 8 a.m. to noon along the Pacific Crest
Trail; volunteers should meet at Vasquez Rocks County Natural Area
Park, 10700 W. Escondido Canyon Road in Agua Dulce. Bring a day
pack, gloves, water, sunscreen, long pants, a long-sleeve shirt and
sturdy boots; tools are provided. Directions: Take the Golden State
Freeway (5) north to the Antelope Valley Freeway (14) east, exit at
Agua Dulce Canyon Road and turn left. Turn right at Escondido
Canyon Road and drive to the park entrance, which will be on the
right.
</P>
<P>
   The day will be full of other events in Agua Dulce, as organized
by the Pacific Crest Trail Association and several Agua Dulce
community groups. A barbecue (the only thing that isn't
complimentary), complete with free puppet shows, clowns, balloons,
face painting and merchant booths, is scheduled from noon to 7 p.m.
at the parking lot at 33300 Agua Dulce Canyon Road in Central Agua
Dulce. A slide show and speakers' program is slated from 3 p.m. to
5 p.m. at the Agua Dulce Women's Club, 33201 Agua Dulce Canyon
Road, followed by a cowboy-style campfire, music and story telling
at 7 p.m. at the same locale. Information: (661) 268-1235 or (916)
349-2109.
</P>
<P>
   _ A nature walk, educational workshop and music are planned from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. along the San Gabriel River bike path. Hosted by
the Vulcan Materials Co. and designed to showcase the San Gabriel
River, it is open to all visitors. Directions: Take the Ventura
Freeway (134) east to the Foothill Freeway (210) east, exit at
Irwindale Avenue and turn left. At Foothill Boulevard, turn left
again. Park at Lario Park at the entrance to the bike path and the
river front. Food and water provided. Information: (323) 474-3203.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nature trails around Crystal Lake above Azusa will be the site
of maintenance work for all ages from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Directions:
Drive the Ventura Freeway (134) east to the Foothill Freeway (210)
east, exit Azusa Avenue-Highway 39, turn left and travel to Crystal
Lake Recreation Area campground. Meet at the visitors center. Tools
provided; bring lunch, gloves and water. Information: (626)
303-1078. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The day's motto could well be ``Volunteer if you can, but hiking
is the plan.'' If you can't help with trail maintenance, several
hikes unrelated to National Trails Day are planned that present
options for trekkers. Information: California State Parks at (818)
880-0350, the National Parks Service at (805) 370-2301 or the
Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club at (213) 387-4287. &QL;

PORTUGAL EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in the next 24 hours, Red Sox pitcher Mark Portugal is
expected to inform the team he intends to follow through on his
desire to retire, which he has expressed to teammates and club
officials.
</P>
<P>
   While offering no details, manager Jimy Williams said he
expected Portugal's situation to be resolved by Friday. Portugal,
36, the divorced father of three children who has been pitching
professionally since he was 18, told teammates he felt it was time
to quit so he could devote more time to his family. Teammates said
issues related to his divorce are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us that there are things that have been stockpiling on
him for the last two years,'' said one Red Sox player, who was
present Tuesday night when Portugal addressed his teammates in the
Sox clubhouse. ``He wants to be with his kids more, which is tough
for a ballplayer, especially in a divorce situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who last December signed a one-year contract with the
Red Sox for $2.7 million with a club option of $3.3 million (or a
$300,000 buyout) for the 2000 season, has been plagued with
injuries throughout his career. He has been on the disabled list 10
times in his career, more than any active player. In the last two
years he has had surgery on both his pitching elbow, which caused
him to miss almost all of the 1997 season, and his left knee, and
he wears a brace on his right knee, which was operated on
previously.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not miss a turn in the rotation (he was 3-3 with a
5.33 ERA in 10 starts), Portugal could not avoid more wear and tear
this spring. He was struck in his pitching elbow by a line drive in
the team's last exhibition in Denver, took another ball off the
shin in Oakland, bruised his thigh when he ran into the backstop in
Yankee Stadium, and popped his left shoulder out of its socket
Monday in Fenway Park. His frustration mounted as he won just once
in the last seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan confirmed that Portugal, who cleaned
out his locker following his last pitching appearance on Monday,
said he wants to retire. But Kerrigan would not elaborate on the
pitcher's reasons. ``That's personal stuff,'' he said. ``You don't
have to drag everything else into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's agent, Barry Meister, said he intends to fly from
Chicago to meet with the player Thursday. Asked if he thought
Portugal would retire, Meister said, ``I don't know. I'd rather not
say until I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran teammates such as Mike Stanley and Darren Lewis
expressed empathy for Portugal's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Stanley, who turns 36 June 25 and has three
children ranging in age from 9 to 4. ``I go through the same thing
every day. I certainly understand everything he's said. It's been
on my mind the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three kids at home in Florida, and there's so much you
miss. All my kids were born in September, so I miss their birthdays
every year because we're playing. How easy is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it for the last five minutes when my wife was in labor
with our first child. I missed the birth of our second child
completely, and the only reason I was there for our third child is
because it was the strike year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a nice life, and can afford to take care of our
families, but money can't buy time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, noting that Portugal has been in the major leagues for 13
seasons, said that retiring did not have to be a sad occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that,'' Lewis said. ``There's a time when he
realizes, `My kids are growing up, I've had a great career, it's
time to move on.' That doesn't have to be a sad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Congratulations, you've had a great career.' If
you survive in this game 10-plus years, you've had a marvelous
career. You've passed every test that's been thrown out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is 31 and the father of a 5-year-old son, Hargett,
was reunited with his family Tuesday night. His son had been in
kindergarten in the Bay Area. ``I've told my wife (Sheri) that we
have to seize this small window of opportunity,'' Lewis said of
their separation. ``But it's a tough situation. She becomes
basically a single parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, originally drafted by the Twins in 1980, has played
for the Twins, Astros, Giants, Reds, and Phillies before coming to
Boston. An 18-game winner in 1993, Portugal has won 105 games and
lost 86 in his big-league career.
</P>

   Portugal's three children _ Derek, 10, Jacob, 6, and Alexandra,
3 _ live in Rhode Island. At his signing in December, Portugal was
accompanied to Fenway Park by the two oldest children, both of whom
sported Sox caps. He spoke of how thrilled his kids were to go to
school and tell their classmates that their daddy pitched for the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp, another veteran signed in the offseason, is scheduled
to take Portugal's turn on the mound Sunday. After that, Williams
has other options, including restoring rookie Juan Pena to the
rotation. Pena made a rehab assignment for Triple A Pawtucket
Monday and is scheduled to make another Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal could ask the Red Sox to place him on the voluntary
retirement list. He would have to spend a minimum of 60 days on
that list before he could petition to return.

`TOBOGGAN' CARRIES STUDENT TO SECOND DAY OF SPELLING BEE

   WASHINGTON _ Natalie DeMaioribus, who just completed the seventh
grade at Holy Spirit School in San Antonio, rode ``toboggan'' to
Thursday's final rounds of the 72nd National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving to Duluth, Minnesota, so toboggan is probably a
word I'm going to need to know,'' a buoyant Natalie said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the first day of competition, Natalie appeared to
have nerves of steel. The 13-year-old confidently spelled each of
her three words without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I knew the words, so I figured why waste time,'' said
Natalie, who was sponsored by the San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted, however, that she had not been as cool as she
appeared. ``Inside, I was shaking each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Natalie spelled ``endogenus,'' meaning developing from
within, and ``bequeathed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Natalie and the 103 other remaining contestants
will go through progressively tougher rounds to determine the
winner. There were 249 students who made it to the first round of
the bee.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader who aspires to be a biologist or electrical
engineer, Natalie credited her father, Chris DeMaioribus, with
helping her reach the second day of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each night, we went over some of the words from the practice
list until I knew them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeMaioribus, a vascular surgeon, pointed out that while he
was tremendously proud of his daughter, he always believed that the
competition should not be taken too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole thing is great, but it's not something that
should take over the kid's life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides practicing her spelling, Natalie plays the piano and
violin and rides horses.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the National Spelling Bee, sponsored by the E.W.
Scripps Co., will receive $10,000 in cash and other prizes.

`INSTINCT' HARD MOVIE TO MAKE BUT DIRECTOR, STAR HAPPY WITH
RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While the rest of Hollywood is still waiting for the
smoke of ``Star Wars: Episode 1'' to clear, the ever-courageous
Disney Company is about to venture into the 1999 Hollywood summer
movie wars with not one but two big-budget movies about African
gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the studio will unveil ``Instinct,'' with Anthony
Hopkins as a primatologist who turns killer after studying a colony
of mountain gorillas in Rwanda; and June 18 is the release date for
its animated-musical version of ``Tarzan,'' with the emphasis on
the hero's upbringing by great apes.
</P>
<P>
   To get an edge on the competition, Disney has also dispatched
representatives of both films _ including ``Instinct'' director Jon
Turteltaub and co-star Cuba Gooding Jr. _ on a lengthy press tour
of major American cities: a practice that's still common for indie
films but relatively rare these days for big Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent Seattle stop, I asked Turteltaub straight-off why
he was willing to hit the road on such an exhaustive tour _ more
than 12 cities with back-to-back interviews, on top of a press
junket on each coast _ when most filmmakers in his pay bracket are
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he answered, ``early summer has become the most
important, and most cut-throat time of the year to release a major
film _ a time when careers are made and broken. So you just want to
give your film every advantage it can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``this summer is complicated by the fact that
no one quite knows what effect `Episode 1' will have on the rest of
the movie field. It looms above (the summer movie schedule) like a
dark shadow. So here I am, selling hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant, bearded man in his early 30s who is the son of a
noted television producer, Turteltaub grew up in Beverly Hills,
graduated from Wesleyan University in Connecticut, and earned a
master's degree from the USC Film School before ``falling into the
family business.''
</P>
<P>
   He's known as something of a boy wonder in the industry, having
turned out no less than four hits in a row in the '90s: ``Cool
Runnings,'' ``Three Ninjas,'' ``While You Were Sleeping'' and
``Phenomenon'' _ all for Disney, where he has a non-exclusive
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the first two films are perceived as children's movies, the
third was snubbed by the critics, and the close association with
Disney _ which is not famous for giving its filmmakers free rein _
has been, he grudgingly admits, something of a stigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenon'' did get him respect, however, and so did the
episode he directed in the 10-part HBO series ``From the Earth to
the Moon.'' So a success in this most uncertain of movie summers
could be the career boost that would move him right up onto the
A-level director's list.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Instinct' has a reasonably big budget (one report puts it at
$57 million), two Oscar-winning stars, an important (environmental)
theme and special effects,'' Turteltaub said. ``So it's far and
away the most ambitious thing I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy film, either. First, there was the problem of
adapting the best-selling source novel, ``Ishmael'' by Daniel
Quinn. ``The book takes the form of a telepathic conversation
between the hero and one of the gorillas _ obviously not a movie.''
It was so drastically altered that the credits now state that the
film was ``suggested by'' the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Then the deteriorating political situation in Central Africa
made it impossible to film there. ``We went to Uganda to scout
locations, and stayed in that same, ill-fated Abercrombie &AMP; Kent
tented camp where all those tourists were horribly massacred a few
months ago.'' Disney choose to substitute Jamaica for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Working with all those animatronic gorillas was also no picnic,
and Hopkins _ who announced ``Instinct'' might be his movie swan
song _ was reportedly less than a dream actor to work with.
Turteltaub extravagantly praised him as an actor and human being,
but admitted he was often ``impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Turteltaub claims it was a great experience and he's
happy with the results, which Disney's test results say plays well
to all demographic groups, and especially well to women _ despite
the gritty subject matter and lack of a female star.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain yet, but Turteltaub's next project will
probably be a remake of the 1996 Japanese art-house hit, ``Shall We
Dance?,'' hopefully with Tom Hanks in the lead. ``And I'm hoping to
film it in Seattle, because I need a city where people commute to
work in ferries.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooding _ who popped into the joint interview late and left
early _ proved to be likably gregarious and amazingly free of the
guarded caution that most celebrities develop when talking to the
press. When I told him I found his enthusiastic Oscar acceptance
speech refreshing, he acted out the whole scene for me.
</P>
<P>
   He plays an ambitious yuppie psychiatrist who gets his
consciousness raised while treating the Hopkins character in a
Florida prison ward. ``It's my first important lead,'' he admitted,
``the first film in which I carry the audience (point-of-view).''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old actor has been regarded as perhaps the best
serious young black actor in America since 1991's ``Boyz N the
Hood,'' and he won his Oscar for his irresistible turn as Tom
Cruise's client in Cameron Crowe's 1996 comedy, ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's the first to admit that he's never made the difficult
leap to ``the Denzel Washington status.'' ``They just don't offer
me those kinds of roles.'' And his one effort to secure a solid
lead role for himself by finding the material and producing it
himself ``went straight to cable.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on the film for both of them, were they
unhappy that it was being dropped so soon into the summer of
``Episode 1,'' and almost back-to-back with another Disney movie
about friendly gorillas being exploited by cruel humans?
</P>
<P>
   Turteltaub said, ``Who can say if that's an advantage or a
disadvantage? I'm not at all sure (``Star Wars'') is going to be
the monster everything thought it would be. And, even though it's
about Africa and gorillas, I don't see `Tarzan' as competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooding said, ``I just don't allow myself to think about
questions like that. I'd go crazy if I did. I just try to do good
work. Maybe the movie will take off, maybe it won't. But if it's
good, I have to believe that sooner or later, maybe 10 years from
now, it will find its place.''

CLINTON WARNS MILOSEVIC TO `CUT HIS LOSSES' AND ACCEPT NATO'S
TERMS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ President Clinton on Wednesday urged
Slobodan Milosevic to ``cut his losses'' by bending to allied
demands for ending the NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, Clinton warned the Yugoslav president, is the
military and economic devastation of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the 944 graduates of the Air Force Academy in
Falcon Stadium here, Clinton asserted again that the NATO air
campaign is grinding down the Serbian army and vowed that it would
prevail if the allies and their people do not grow weary of the
costly operation, now in its 10th week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, night by night, our air campaign is succeeding,''
Clinton told the newly commissioned second lieutenants in their new
blue-and-white uniforms. ``There is a clear choice before the
Serbian leader: He can cut his losses now and accept the basic
requirements of a just peace, or he can continue to face military
failure and economic ruin on his people. In the end, the outcome
will be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also formally announced a NATO plan to dispatch about
50,000 troops to the Balkans to escort more than 800,000 refugees
back to their homes in Kosovo after the conflict ends. The United
States will contribute 7,000 troops, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it had not been determined
precisely what forces the United States would contribute, but they
said the contingent would include armed troops trained for combat
as well as engineering units to clear mines, build roads and
provide shelter.
</P>
<P>
   With the snow-frosted summit of Pike's Peak as a backdrop, the
president responded to critics in the United States and Europe who
say the removal of human-rights observers from Kosovo and the
beginning of the air attacks in March touched off Milosevic's
expulsions of non-Serbs from Kosovo, the province in southern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the assaults on the Kosovars were planned for
months before the allied airstrikes began. He said that Milosevic
had driven thousands of Kosovars of Muslim descent from their homes
last fall, and that Serbian troops had massacred civilians in Rajac
in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was not a response to bombing,''
Clinton said. ``It is the 10-year method of Milosevic's madness.
Had we done nothing, the tragedy would have been permanent,
accepted and in effect condoned by the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could not be prevented, therefore, from driving the
Kosovars from their land. But he can be prevented from keeping them
out of their land. His 10-year cleansing campaign will end once and
for all.''
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, the president addresses the graduates at one of
the four military academies each year, on a rotating basis. Clinton
also spoke here in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Clinton used his address at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, N.Y., to emphasize the benefits of the expansion of
NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. He said
NATO's growth would ensure a more stable and peaceful Europe and
noted that many ethnic and border conflicts in eastern and southern
Europe had been resolved since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``That in turn,'' Clinton told the new Army officers then,
``makes it less likely that you will ever be called to fight in
another war across the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, at Wednesday's Air Force Academy commencement,
Clinton announced the planned deployment of the 7,000 Americans to
the Balkans. He also saluted two academy graduates who are flying
missions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud of them and very proud of you for following in
their tradition,'' Clinton told Wednesday's graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeated pledges of reconstruction aid for Albania,
Macedonia and other nations that have borne the tide of refugees
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States and its European allies have moral and
strategic interests in bringing peace and prosperity to the poorest
corner of Europe. He even promised help to rebuild Serbia after the
war ``if, but only if, it practices democracy, respects human
rights and has leaders who uphold the basic standards of human
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not condition that aid on the overthrow or departure of
Milosevic. But Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said,
``It's hard to see a role for someone like Milosevic in a
democratic Serbia.''

 &HT;    Awaiting the Billy Graham Crusade
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was Jesus Christ who saved him, Scott Davis
said, but it was Billy Graham who pointed him in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was only a kid then, tagging along with his grandmother,
but he remembers it like it was yesterday. ``It was a John 3:16
sermon: 'For God so loved the world that he gave his only son ...'
It's a thrilling story... and I finally began to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He was only 11, but as the choir began to sing ``Just As I Am,''
he left his family and began to walk down the aisle, alone. There
were thousands of people there that night who had come to see
Graham, but Davis never gave a thought to getting lost. ``I didn't
have a choice. There was nothing to stop me. It's a force that
every preacher tries to describe: the supernatural presence of
God's spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Davis, 43, is himself an ``itinerant evangelist,'' in the
style of Graham, whom he calls his role model. He'll travel from
his Beavercreek home to Indianapolis today to be a part of the
Billy Graham Crusade, which rolls into town for four days of
preaching, prayer and song.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple formula that has served Graham well since his
first crusade in Los Angeles 50 years ago. His old friends, music
director Cliff Barrows and soloist George Beverly Shea, will be on
hand, along with a 4,000-voice choir recruited from the community.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, crusade planners expect a capacity crowd of
54,000 each evening at the RCA Dome, and hope to fill 5,000 seats
outside with the overflow. The free event begins at 8 p.m. today,
Friday and Sunday and 7:15 p.m. Sunday (7 p.m. and 6:15 p.m.
Indianapolis time).
</P>
<P>
   For Graham, 81 years old and suffering from Parkinson's disease,
this may be among his last crusades, though plans are under way for
an October crusade in St. Louis and an evangelism conference next
summer in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday in Indianapolis, he had to be
helped to the dais. But his face was deeply tanned and he still
towered over most of his handlers, a cadre of impeccably dressed
men who whispered into cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   His answers to questions were sometimes rambling, but he also
displayed flashes of humor. Asked if he had considered retirement,
he answered that ``the Lord has to make that decision. He called me
to preach; he'll tell me when to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had a very vivid dream recently,'' he continued in his
North Carolina drawl. ``I was already in the coffin, and I shook
hands with everyone and preached at them as they walked by.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that Graham has preached in person to more
people than anyone ever has _ from a crowd that numbered 1 million
in Seoul, South Korea, to San Francisco, a city where only 4
percent of the residents regularly attend church.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's staying power may be partly due to the prudence with
which he cultivates his image.
</P>
<P>
   He has placed himself somewhere in the middle ground of the
American political scene for most of this century. A confidante to
10 U.S. presidents, he has been careful to get close _ but not too
close _ to the political heat, although he did spend a lot of time
in the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   He was a friend to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but largely
stayed away from the civil rights movement, although he did
integrate his ministry in 1957 by inviting a black pastor to
participate, and he proclaimed that there was ``no scriptural
basis'' for segregation.
</P>
<P>
   He has managed to avoid the excesses of televangelists such as
Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. Financially, he has kept squeaky
clean, having long ago set up the Billy Graham Evangelistic
Association, with a governing board that pays him a salary.
</P>
<P>
   If Graham's message hasn't changed since his first crusade, his
medium has kept up with the times, thanks to a team of media-savvy
young planners who set up shop in a crusade city months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   He has called the 1997 San Francisco crusade the most
challenging he has ever faced, but his ever-clever publicity
machine pitched the event this way on the Internet: ``50,000
sinners in one place, and you don't think you'll have fun?''
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, billboards proclaim, ``The Beginning is Near,''
and an ad placed in the personals section of the city's alternative
newspaper reads, ``Jesus will love you for free.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Graham's message remain relevant in a post-Littleton,
Colo., post-Monica culture, where kids kill each other over a pair
of $100 sneakers?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, says George Robertson, pastor at Dayton's Lawrie
Baptist Chapel, who will attend the Indianapolis crusade with
members of his congregation. Robertson is a black man who
appreciates that Graham's message is nondenominational, and not
``culturally sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appealing because of it's simple honesty. It's a pure
Bible message, and that's what we need,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Youth outreach is a major part of every crusade. Saturday's
program in Indianapolis will include music by Audio Adrenaline,
Anointed and Michael W. Smith. Athlete Deion Sanders will speak
tonight and NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon will speak Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand their language and they don't understand
mine,'' Graham says of young people. ``Contemporary music helps us
interpret each other. Young people are looking for something to
hold on to. I think we made a terrible mistake when we took God and
prayer out of school, and put sex education in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a new idea, but even Graham acknowledges his own simplicity,
in his repeated insistence, over the years, that he is a ``simple
farmer from North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectancy here in Indianapolis is high,'' he said
Tuesday. ``But I hope it's not for me. I don't carry a revival
around in my suitcase. This is God's work, not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   It's comes with what Scott Davis calls ``corporate worship'' _
when 50,000 souls come together to pray. ``It gets my blood
going,'' he says. ``I know God's going to be there.''

A HORSE STORY TO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELMONT, N.Y. _ I want so badly for the story to be true. How
much? More than I want the mockingly unrepentant Latrell (``The
American Dream'') Sprewell to go 0-for-the-rest-of-June; that's how
much.
</P>
<P>
   This is the tale: 'Tis said that following either a claiming
race at Hollywood Park just before Thanksgiving or at Santa Anita
in February _ the story works quite well either way _ trainer Mike
Mitchell actually filled out the claiming slip for a vastly
disappointing horse named Charismatic. 'Tis further alleged that a
guilt-ridden Mitchell simply could not turn it in because he didn't
want to take something away from Charismatic's kindly owner Bob
Lewis, a Nice Guy's Nice Guy in an oft rough-and-tumble business,
the specific reason being that Lewis was supposed to have more than
once obtained tickets for Mitchell for the Winternational drag race
in Pomona (had someone foisted drag racing tickets on me, I'd be
inclined to hire a hit man, but that's another matter).
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone with any racing knowledge gleaned during the
last four weeks, and in possession of even a dash of romance in his
or her soul, not want that to be true?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but boo. Bob Lewis says it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just something you people dreamed up,'' insists the cheery
multi-millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Well, dammit, it could be true, and if I'm not mistaken Mike
Mitchell has even gone on television to say it is true. Bob Lewis
is so modest and lovable he might be incapable of believing the
story, even if confronted with the written evidence. Meanwhile, the
notorious Wayne Lukas slobbers over both Bob and Beverly Lewis, and
the noted trainer has never been confused with Mr. Rogers when it
comes to formulating a viewpoint of the human race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extra special to be representing these people,'' gushes
Lukas, who will be trying to win the first Triple Crown of his
distinguished career when Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
Charismatic duels 11 rivals in the 131st running of the Belmont
Stakes Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Now if the Mitchell story really is true, the irony would be
that Bob Lewis wouldn't have been wounded at all. The horse in
question was put in that claiming race for a reason. It was
definitely a matter of ``Take my horse _ please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Mitchell knew full well that I was ready to take the
sixty-two-five ($62,500) and move on down the road,'' maintains
Lewis, who had paid $200,000 for the colt at a yearling sale and
who had become convinced that Charismatic would never justify his
monthly upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run a stable the size of ours,'' continued Lewis,
``you've got to weed them out every once in a while. At $3,000 a
month, exclusive of veterinary fees, you'd better be getting a
return on your money. You can't keep a horse around for sentimental
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, what is going on here? This jilted claimer is now a
mile and a half away from becoming the first Triple Crown winner
since Carl Yast _ oops, wrong crown _ Affirmed 21 years ago. A
two-time claimer conceivably winning the Triple Crown? Think
Harvard winning the NCAA basketball title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the people seated in this room Thursday, no one is more
surprised than Bob Lewis for Charismatic to be in this position,''
said Bob Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is somewhat less shocked, although he had easily signed
off on the claiming business a scant three months ago. After
Charismatic ran well at the Lexington Stakes, Lukas had a major
shift of opinion. ``This is a horse I misread a great deal,'' he
said. ``He is a horse that responds well. One thing I've learned
about him is that he has a bounce-back property.''
</P>
<P>
   Had someone placed the proverbial Luger at Lukas's temple on the
morning of the Derby and asked him which Triple Crown race
Charismatic might take to, the answer would have been easy. ``He
told me, `I don't know about the Derby or the Preakness, but this
could be a great Belmont horse,' '' said Lewis. ``Wayne said, `He
can go the distance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He will start that journey from the number four spot in the
starting gate, not that it makes a whole lot of difference. This
is, after all, a mile-and-a-half race. A horse could start off at
the Montauk Lighthouse and still have a shot when you're talking a
mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   What's really interesting about Charismatic's post position is
the identity of its neighbor to the immediate left. For occupying
the number three spot is none other than Silverbulletday, the filly
trained by Lukas's archrival Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the ever-cheerful Bob Lewis to deny the obvious. He
knows Bob Baffert as well as he knows Wayne Lukas. He has to know
that these two titans of the industry loathe each other. They are
the Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner of racing. ``Oh, no,'' coos
Lewis. ``That's another thing you people are making up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Two years ago Baffert was in the same spot with
Lewis-owned Silver Charm that Lukas is with Charismatic right now.
Touch Gold ruined Baffert's Triple Crown dream in the Belmont.
Baffert would almost undoubtedly sacrifice a body part if he could
be the 1999 Triple Crown spoiler with, of all things, a filly on
Saturday. And Bob Lewis has to know it. He just won't say it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all his money has anesthetized him. Take the matter of the
well-publicized $5 million bonus a Triple Crown winner would
collect from Visa. ``I don't know anything about a $5 million Visa
bonus,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   He probably doesn't. Let's see. He doesn't know how close he
came to losing out on a potential Triple Crown winner. He doesn't
know he stands to make $5 million if his horse wins the Belmont. He
doesn't know that Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert are racing's ultimate
Don't Invites. He doesn't believe the Germans would ever fire at
the Lusitania. I wonder if it's too late to weasel my way into a
spot in Bob Lewis's will.

REBEL KURDS BACK LEADER IN PEACE OFFER TO TURKEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Two days after imprisoned Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan said he wanted to end his 15-year war
against the Turkish army, his guerrilla group announced Wednesday
that it supports his call.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that raised hopes of a peaceful end to the
conflict, Ocalan's party, the Kurdistan Workers Party, said his
offer was ``mature, respectful and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our entire party organization, with supreme unity and
cohesion, is bound to and fully supportive of the efforts of our
leader,'' said the statement, which was distributed by the Kurdish
news agency DEM.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is on trial on treason charges in a case that could lead
to his execution. In the opening session of his trial on Monday, he
apologized for his role in the war, which has cost more than 30,000
lives, including those of more than 5,500 Turkish soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chairman takes the great initiative that befits a great
warrior,'' the guerrillas said in their statement. ``To apologize
shows greatness, and to apologize for huge responsibility shows his
greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the guerrillas expressed willingness to embrace
Ocalan's call for an end to hostilities, they also said they were
ready to fight on if the government did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Turkish republic and the various interlocutors in the
region and the world think this is weakness, they are badly
mistaken,'' they asserted. ``We have made every preparation and are
ready to fight on in the same way we have fought for 15 years. But
we say that 15 years of war is more than enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's statements at his trial were evidently as surprising to
his followers as to his longtime enemies. At first his party made
no official comment. Backers of his cause in Europe have been
divided, some expressing solidarity and others warning that he
might have been speaking under the influence of drugs or pressure
from his jailers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's statement suggested that even from his position as a
prisoner, Ocalan might retain enough authority to order an end to
the conflict in southeastern Turkey. But it has not stopped yet.
Guerrillas reportedly killed two soldiers on Tuesday night, and a
commando carried out a suicide attack on an army checkpoint,
although no one else was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain how or even whether the Turkish
authorities will respond to Ocalan's peace offer. For years they
have vowed never to negotiate or compromise with Kurdish
guerrillas, saying they are terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony on Monday, Ocalan said he was willing to call
on his forces to lay down their weapons. But he said Kurds would
not be satisfied unless the government granted them greater
cultural and linguistic rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the past the Turkish authorities have rejected such calls.
They fear that concessions will lead to demands for more
concessions and ultimately to calls for the autonomy or
independence of the Kurdish region.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months prominent figures, including the chief
judge of Turkey's highest court, have urged the government to
repeal laws that limit political freedom here. They include one
that restricts use of the Kurdish language.
</P>
<P>
   One of the political leaders who will have a voice in shaping
policy toward Kurds and Kurdish rebels, President Suleyman Demirel,
called on the rebels to heed Ocalan's call and give up their fight.
But he did not give any indication that the government was planning
a formal reply to Ocalan's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your leader is calling for unity, togetherness and peace,''
Demirel said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday. ``In the
end all of you will come to the same conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Surrender your weapons, turn yourselves in,'' he urged the
guerrillas. ``If your leader is in the position he is in, what can
you do?''

NICKLAUS TO PLAY IN THE MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Jack Nicklaus, who designed the golf course at
Muirfield Village on the outskirts of his native Columbus, will
play in The Memorial, which begins Thursday, after overcoming some
considerable odds.
</P>
<P>
   There was much speculation on when Nicklaus would play his first
PGA Tour event after having hip replacement surgery Jan. 27 in
Boston. The surgery was performed by Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum, who
told Nicklaus caution was the watchword following the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has heeded his words, waiting until two weeks ago to
play in a Seniors event and now before testing the PGA waters in a
tournament he started in 1976 and has won twice (1977, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to come back any faster than I thought I could
come back,'' Nicklaus said Wednesday. ``It was, `Jack, for the
first six weeks I don't want you to take a step without a crutch.'
I didn't. We actually scheduled my visit at five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five weeks, it was off the crutches and onto the cane.
(Bierbaum) said, `I don't want you to walk without the cane until
you can't limp.' After 10 or 11 days, I threw the cane away. I
wasn't limping anymore. He said that when I was stable enough,
`You'll probably want to go chip and putt. After you chip and putt,
you'll want to take the swinging motions and probably pretty soon
you'll want to put the golf ball in front of it. If it gets tired
and it hurts, don't do it.' I started swinging a club at about
eight weeks. Pretty soon, I just got tired of sitting around so I
didn't see any reason why I shouldn't play a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus returned to Boston recently for an examination and
played 18 holes with Bierbaum at The Country Club, where he shot
71. ``I played 18 holes with him and said, `What do you think?' He
said, `Go play.' I just happened to do the things he told me to do.
If it had taken six months, it would have taken six months. It
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus tuned up for The Memorial in the Bell Atlantic Senior
event at Avondale, Pa., where he finished 18th. ``I felt after that
I needed to take a few days off and I did,'' said Nicklaus. ``I
went to the Keys and fished for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence that Nicklaus had lost some distance
following the surgery, but part of that could also be that he is
59. And at that age he says he is uplifted just to be able to play
in his tournament. ``I don't think attacking the golf course has
anything to do with it,'' he said. ``You attack a golf course
mentally, not with your swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have great confidence in your swing and ability to hit
a golf ball, you'll have more confidence to be able to attack a
golf course. I think I'm going to be able to hit the ball up in the
air again. I think my power is going to come back to a certain
degree, but obviously it's not going to come back to the degree the
young kids have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to come back a lot more than it's been in
the last few years, simply because I'll be able to stay behind the
ball. You never saw a baseball player who stood on his left foot
and knocked the ball out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger players never saw Nicklaus play in his prime, but
they have great respect for him and his accomplishments. ``I think
you just look at the way he approached things when he was playing
and winning,'' said tour earnings leader David Duval. ``I think you
rarely saw him make big mistakes.''

CHOIR MEMBERS DESCRIBE HORROR OF CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barrett Baber began to pray when the flight attendant screamed
``brace yourselves.'' The plane shook furiously, and flames shot up
inside and outside the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `God, you're all-knowing and all-powerful. I am going
to go; this is it,''' said Baber, 19, who just completed his
freshman year at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Baber and several others were pushing panicked
passengers out a small opening at the top of a jammed emergency
door in the back of the American Airlines plane that crashed on
landing Tuesday. Then, he was out himself.
</P>
<P>
   Baber was among 19 members of a university choral group, the
Ouachita Singers, aboard American Airlines Flight 1420. They were
returning to Little Rock from a 10-day tour of Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight Tuesday, the end of their trip became the
start of a nightmare. The aircraft crashed on the runway during a
thunderstorm, cracked apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the group, senior James Harrison, was unaccounted
for Wednesday night, and two members were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman Jeff Root said he has received conflicting
reports about Harrison, a music director at First Baptist Church in
Royal, Ark. American Airlines issued a list midday Wednesday that
listed Harrison as a survivor. A later list from American did not
include Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to some people that saw him and are sure he
survived the crash, but he was helping people off the plane and
that was the last they saw of him,'' Root said about 5 p.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last word I got at least two hours ago was that his
parents were still waiting,'' Root said. ``If he was OK and his
wits were about him, why hasn't he called somebody by now?''
</P>
<P>
   American spokesman Tim Doke would not discuss the discrepancy in
the lists. But he acknowledged that ``mistakes obviously were made.
We regret they were made. But they were honest mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on board the plane were the choir director, Charlie Fuller,
his wife and three daughters, and communications Professor Dave
Ozmun.
</P>
<P>
   One of Fuller's daughters, 14-year-old Rachel, was in critical
condition Wednesday at Arkansas Children's Hospital with burns on
60 percent of her body. And senior Kristin Maddox, 22, the daughter
of Kay County, Okla., District Attorney John Maddox, was in
critical condition at Children's Hospital with burns and smoke
inhalation, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Clark, an Ouachita Baptist senior who was seated in row
25, described Fuller as a hero who helped people out of the plane
as flames shot from the cabin area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Fuller had gotten the side right door open, and he helped
us out,'' Clark said. ``A guy in front of me, an older man, was in
such a hurry he slipped and broke his leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Once out, Clark and the others were pelted with rain and hail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really, really windy,'' she said. ``We were trying to
duck and stay together and keep warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozmun, who was sitting about midway on the plane, said he tried
to reach for a handle to the exit door on the left wing when it
popped open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed it to one side to get out,'' he said. ``On the wing
there was fire. So in order to jump to the ground I had to jump
through fire. It was hot, but it didn't burn too bad. I singed my
hair a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Baber, who had been seated in row 30, said that as he got
farther from the plane, the ground became wetter and the water
deeper. He said he helped a man whose leg was slashed to the bone
and assisted flight attendant Jenny Gardner across a waist-deep
creek to higher and drier ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I can't swim,' and I said I could,'' said Baber,
who suffered numerous bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Baber's father, the Rev. Mark Baber, pastor of First Baptist
Church of Marion, Ark., was grateful Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``God was good to us; what can I say,'' he said. ``I'm in awe of
the opportunity to have my son alive with me, and in grief for
those who were not so fortunate last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozmun said he has known the choir members only about two weeks
but wasn't surprised when he saw them helping others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had witnessed their maturity and their witness with the
people they had met and shared with in Germany and Austria,'' Ozmun
said. ``I just knew last night that I didn't have to worry about
them too much, because I knew they had the fortitude to take care
of themselves and others.''

TELEVISION COMES TO BHUTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THIMPU, Bhutan _ They missed the first moonwalk, the O. J.
Simpson trial, the final episode of ``Seinfeld,'' and thousands of
hours of televised coverage of President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky. In fact, most people here haven't heard of Neil
Armstrong, O.J. or Bill _ or, for that matter, television.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, inhabitants of this remote kingdom tucked
in the Himalayas officially welcomed the talking box, taking a step
closer to a modern world kept at bay for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded into homes and shops equipped with TV sets, some stared
and others cheered and whistled at the nation's inaugural broadcast
_ the 25th anniversary celebration of their king's coronation.
Masked dancers twirled on the screen before them, clad in colorful
skirts and pointed metal helmets that, to Western eyes, looked
straight out of the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, after orange-robed monks blessed fruits, rice,
and ornate silver jugs of salty, buttered tea _ and the country's
first Internet service provider _ one of the king's four wives
pressed a button that launched the nation into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shangri-la, the fictional Himalayan paradise of the 1930s
classic novel ``Lost Horizon,'' where inhabitants of the secluded
valley never aged, so too the kingdom of Bhutan has managed to
shelter itself from the outside world and largely freeze its
culture in time.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of TV and the Internet to mark the anniversary
of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck's coronation is the latest move in a
gradual campaign to bring this poor nation out of isolation, but it
is also the most controversial. In a country that had only one
murder last year and where officials say only one person has died
of AIDS, some worry that throwing open a window to the outside
world could usher in a torrent of social ills unimagined by most
people here, and reshape the very fabric of Bhutanese life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go home and watch TV, it means you won't be talking to
your grandmom,'' said Karma Gallay, 27, who works for his family's
construction company in Thimpu. ``I'm afraid TV will glamorize
foreign culture. . . . Material possession is counted as such
success in the West, but here, you'll see a farmer saving every
chhetrum (penny) to build a monastery or a stupa for religion. I
don't want to lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are others such as Chencho Gyeltshen, 17, a
crimson-robed monk, who see a benefit to the changes: ``It's good
to have TV so we can know what other countries are doing. I know
India's below and China's above, but what happens there, I don't
know. On the other hand, I can see it as an evil, because someone
who never knew of stealing or murder could see it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing the good and evil of the modern world is a familiar
challenge in Bhutan; its leaders have tried for three decades to
follow a path to progress with one foot planted firmly in the past.
King Jigme's oft-repeated motto is to promote ``gross national
happiness'' _ the notion that material wealth and development
should not supplant spiritual well-being, cultural traditions, and
environmental preservation. Bhutanese people say that as much as
they might have to learn from the modern world, the West could also
stand to learn from Bhutan's example.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan is the only remaining independent Buddhist kingdom in the
Himalayas. Tibet, Sikkim, and Ladakh have all been annexed by
neighboring China or India, and perhaps that is why Bhutan has so
fiercely guarded its heritage and shied away from outside contact.
Tourism began only in 1974, and is limited by a $200 daily tourist
tax. Last year was the highest number ever _ a mere 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   This is a country of 700,000 people with 9,000 phone lines, not
a single traffic light, where the pace is so unhurried that dogs
sun themselves lazily in the road, and more people are killed by
bears than cars. It is a place with negligible crime, no lawyers,
and 5,000 underemployed soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side of preserving heritage and nature has been,
until recently, a lack of modern advances to improve people's
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, this country of spectacular, rugged topography had
no roads, and all travel was by horseback on winding mountain
passes. The country has no postal system or paper currency, not to
mention hospitals, running water, electricity or telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a small airport and 2,100 miles of road traverse
the country, though many people still live several days' walk from
the nearest road. The government says a majority of villages have
access to a health center, a primary school, piped water, and
latrines. Nearly 32,000 households have electricity, though 70
percent of homes still do not. Since 1985, the infant mortality
rate has halved, literacy has doubled to 54 percent, and life
expectancy has jumped by 20 years to 66.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan's per capita income of $645 is poor by Western standards,
but it is the highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the country is largely poor, hungry, and inadequately
educated. That is why many here think television and the Internet
could become powerful teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, watching TV was illegal in Bhutan, though
hundreds of people had set up satellite dishes and were watching
foreign programs, from wrestling to Hindi movies. Officials
estimate that there are 5,000 computers in the country, most in
offices, and about 4,000 TV sets, most of which were being used to
watch imported videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an advantage'' to TV and the Internet. ``Bhutan is
landlocked and one of the world's least developed countries, and
we'd like to copy and learn from other countries' experiences,''
said Sherub Tenzin, 49, the governor of Paro district. ``The
challenge is for people themselves to choose good from bad. But we
are so deeply rooted in our culture and religion that I think what
is bad or good can easily be seen by any humble person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kencho Pem, 41, a farmer in Pangzhi, a village less than an
hour's drive from the capital, has never seen a television, but
likes the idea of a box that is like a radio with pictures. She
would be willing to save as much as $200 toward buying one, but
first has to wait for electrical lines.
</P>
<P>
   Pem understands that TV would bring puzzling information from
faraway places, but says ``it would be good to have this TV. People
should have a positive attitude to whatever they see. Forget what's
bad and just take the good. Even if someone doesn't know how to
steal and sees it on TV, that doesn't mean they will pick up that
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Novice news anchor Tshewang Dendup, 29, has seen American news
and received two days of TV training last month. But he isn't
trying to emulate Tom Brokaw or Larry King. Like everything Bhutan
does, he said, ``We're trying to take the best from the West and
also the cream of Bhutan culture _ the middle path. It's a
tremendous challenge, especially in a society where half the
population is illiterate and what you project is going to be very
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Karma Ura, director of the Center for Bhutan Studies, worries
less about viewers aping bad habits from TV, and more about them
starting to question their own way of life. He has seen a few
moments of ``Baywatch,'' which he described as ``statuesque people
surfing in their underwear,'' and did not see the value of such a
show to the 85 percent of Bhutanese who are farmers.
</P>
<P>
   For villagers, ``TV will at first be a source of fascination and
excitement. People will see things they've never conceived of as
possible _ how tall others are, how rich they are.'' But he frets
that the next, perhaps inevitable, stage is to start to feel
inferior to an imaginary Hollywood life.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a carpet in front of his computer and an old-style,
unbound book of Buddhist writings, Ura reflected that ``Bhutan
balances tradition and modernity, environmentalism and development,
materialism and spirituality. It requires great courage not to
follow international trends . . . especially when your choice is so
divergent.''

   FEDERAL JURY DEADLOCKED IN GENENTECH PATENT CASE
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury deadlocked in a lawsuit contending that Genentech
had infringed a University of California patent in developing its
first big product, human growth hormone. The deadlock represented a
narrow escape for Genentech because the panel vote was 8-1 in favor
of the university, according to the jury's foreman. The university
said it would ask for a new trial.

</P>
<P>
   Having dropped more than 10 percent against the dollar since its
introduction at the beginning of the year, the euro hit a new low,
dragged down in large part by Germany's languishing economy. The
plunge has ignited a round of finger-pointing between European
political leaders and European central bankers, but it has
especially put the spotlight on Germany, which accounts for
one-third of the euro-zone's total economic output, and its new
left-of-center chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder.

A CASUALTY OF WAR :  FEWER TRAVEL TO HUNGARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ The pretty, cobblestone streets that wind through the
city's picturesque Castle District are usually almost unnavigable
this time of year, as throngs of tourists line up for a look inside
the Matyas Temple, or the view of the Danube from Fisherman's
Bastion.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, the queues are short and the outdoor cafes are
nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a casualty of war, or maybe just the end result of years
of dozing during geography class. Hungary's tourism industry is
suffering from what frustrated Hungarian officials call an unfair
and inaccurate idea that the Central European nation is in a war
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary _ and Budapest _ is one of the safest places in the
world,'' says Peter Kraft, the country's newly named state
secretary for Tourism. ``Now that we are in NATO, we are safer than
in anytime during our 1,000-year history.''
</P>
<P>
   True, those countries look close on the map. There's Yugoslavia,
being bombed every day for 71 days by NATO. And there's Hungary,
right on Yugoslavia's northern border.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there haven't been any war-related incidents on the
Hungarian side, although residents who live near the border report
they have sometimes heard the bombing. Still, some tourists have
been afraid to come, and the nervousness could end up costing
Hungary hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism industry in Hungary has been growing exponentially
since the political changes of 1990, and last year brought in $2.5
billion in revenues. Factor in the ``grey economy'' _ for example,
private homeowners who rent their rooms to travelers _ the number
is closer to $5 billion, Kraft estimates.
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to a startling 10 percent of Hungary's Gross
Domestic Product _ money it can't afford to lose because of some
silly misperceptions by foreigners, Kraft notes.
</P>
<P>
   GKI, a respected Hungarian research firm, estimates that
Hungary's surplus revenues from tourism could drop from $1.3
billion last year to $1 billion this year. The Hungarian Chamber of
Industry and Commerce projects a drop of $250 to $400 million in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations in the region are feeling the hit as well.
Croatia, which was just beginning to recover from the drop in
tourism resulting from the Balkans wars of 1995-97, is again being
victimized by the current war.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, too, is being affected _ not just because of its
proximity to Yugoslavia, but because the anti-NATO sentiment among
some of the populace makes Westerners skittish. Flughafen Wien AG,
which runs Vienna's International Airport, reported Wednesday that
air traffic was lower in April and May because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has affected us dramatically,'' said Janos Kurucz,
director of Vista, a leading Hungarian tourist agency. Croatia and
Greece _ longtime favorite holiday destinations for Hungarians _
have greatly decreased, he said. Air packages to Greece have
dropped by 20 percent, while bus trips to Greece have sunk by 60
percent, Kurucz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reasons are mainly psychological,'' he said.
``People simply feel uneasy traveling abroad'' when there's a war
on, Kurucz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go to Greece, but we decided not to do it. Our
parents were against it, because they thought it was dangerous,''
said Shelly Tymkow, 20, a student at New Jersey's Rowan University.
So she decided to come to Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   But if their elders knew they were in Hungary, ``they'd die,''
said Tymkow's traveling companion, 21-year-old Jaime Zazzara, as
she stood near Budapest's St. Stefan's Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Making a strong offense their best defense, Hungary has been
aggressively pushing itself to tourists. Some $300,000 of the
tourism budget has been redirected to a special marketing campaign
to combat unfounded war hysteria. Kraft has been personally
visiting European capitals to work with the Hungarian tourist
agencies there.
</P>
<P>
   It's mainly the North Americans and Japanese who fear war
spillover, travel agents say, since Western Europeans are more
familiar with their own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are from Germany. We are not so far away,'' said
63-year-old Ingrid Meier, as she sipped a drink at the city's famed
Gerbeaud coffeehouse. ``We are not afraid.''

MILOSEVIC GETS DRAFT OF PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-DIPLOMACY) 
(rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Russian and NATO envoys delivered an
incomplete draft of a peace settlement to President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia on Wednesday, and after a two-hour meeting,
Milosevic said he and his government would study the proposals
overnight and meet the envoys again at 9 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Milosevic was taking this approach from the West
and Russia seriously, leading legislators from Serbia's Parliament
were hastily summoned to a late-night meeting to discuss the
proposals. Serbian state television said there would be a special
session of the parliament on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A politician familiar with the discussions said the government
would urge parliament to approve the proposals. He said government
officials had stressed that a rapid introduction of international
forces into Kosovo under an eventual peace settlement would prevent
the Kosovo Liberation Army from infiltrating rapidly as Yugoslav
security forces withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals require a total withdrawal of Yugoslav security
forces from Kosovo before allowing several hundred to return in a
symbolic manner.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if the ultranationalist Radical Party, led by
Serbia's deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj, would vote for the
proposals, but Milosevic's Socialist Party, his wife's political
party and the Serbian Renewal Movement, led by Vuk Dras-kovic,
command a majority in the Serbian legislature.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to confirm the politician's account of
Wednesday night's meeting with government officials, or to predict
the outcome of the meeting Milosevic has scheduled early Thursday
with the peace envoys.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Yugoslav minister said that the talks between Milosevic
and the envoys were ``generally positive,'' and that he remained
optimistic that a settlement could be reached. He noted that
Russian and NATO positions were still unclear regarding the command
structure and composition of an international force to patrol
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was shown on television meeting the Russian envoy,
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, and the Finnish President, Martti
Ahtisaari, who came to describe NATO's position. Milosevic's top
generals were also in attendance, including the armed forces chief
of staff, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari represents the European Union, and although Finland is
not a member of NATO, he is presenting the alliance's position
because Western politicians do not want to be seen negotiating with
Milosevic, now an indicted war criminal. General Ojdanic has also
been indicted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The envoys arrived in a capital largely without electric power
because of the air strikes and suffused with war-weariness.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic, who has been signaling his willingness to
consider a settlement for several weeks now, is likely to judge
that an agreement will require more discussion, a senior European
diplomat said. That is because NATO and Russia still disagree on
key points of the plan, the diplomat said, and because Milosevic
will want to portray himself as a negotiator whose forces will not
simply capitulate to the West.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian spokesman, Valentin Sergeyev, described the meeting as
``pretty productive,'' the Interfax news agency said. ``It is
necessary for the Yugoslav leadership to accept this document,'' he
said.

SENIOR COMMANDERS REMAIN OPPOSED TO INVASION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of their first meeting with President
Clinton since NATO's air war against Yugoslavia began, the
Pentagon's senior commanders remain strongly opposed to mounting a
ground invasion to drive Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, defense
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though 10 weeks of air and missile strikes have not forced
President Slobodan Milosevic to bend to NATO's demands, the senior
commanders, including the chairman and vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, believe there is insufficient domestic and
international political support for sending ground troops into
Kosovo, the officials said. Among Pentagon strategists there are
strong reservations about an invasion that could quickly become
mired in the Balkans with no clear exit in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Gen. Henry Shelton, and the vice chairman, Gen.
Joseph Ralston, along with the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marine Corps, are to meet Clinton at the White House on
Thursday afternoon. Although the meeting was previously scheduled
as one of the president's periodic sessions with the nation's
senior officers, the war in the Balkans is expected to dominate the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who will also attend, said
Wednesday that he expected the discussion to cover ``a full range''
of issues facing the American military and NATO, including
``questions about whether or not there would be any kind of ground
option for a nonpermissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that there was no plan ``under any active
consideration'' for anything beyond the peacekeeping force of
48,000 that NATO has said it would send into Kosovo once a
settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a consensus for a strong air operation in the NATO
countries,'' Cohen said Wednesday after a ceremony welcoming
Kuwait's defense minister to the Pentagon. ``There is not a
consensus for a ground operation in a nonpermissive environment. So
we intend to focus on the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has urged the Pentagon and
NATO to at least begin planning for a ground invasion because of a
timetable that would require deployment in the summer if such a
huge force is to return the refugees before winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of ground troops is so remote to the Pentagon's
senior military officers that it was not specifically listed on
their agenda for the meeting. Administration officials said,
however, that they did expect a preliminary discussion on the
option of a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion on Kosovo is expected to focus on the progress of
the air campaign and the larger impact the war has had on the four
military services and their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force and the commandant of
the Marine Corps oversee the administration of their services,
including their budgets, personnel and weapons, but they do not
command any forces. That responsibility, along with drawing up war
plans, rests with the nation's regional military commanders,
overseen by the staff of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the chiefs have expressed reservations about
NATO's strategy and ever deeper misgivings about the prospects of
an invasion, which would require thousands of troops and would risk
significant casualties. On the 71st day of the air campaign, those
views have not changed, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody among the chiefs saying, `By
God, if we don't invade Kosovo, it will be a travesty,''' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton ruled out the use of ground troops when the air
war began on March 24, he has since modified the administration's
public position to leave open all military options.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Wednesday, the administration tried to play
down the idea that winter's approach was creating a timetable that
would force a decision on ground troops relatively soon, as Clark
and Pentagon and NATO commanders have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no deadline for any of these plans,'' the Pentagon's
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Wednesday. ``We know how to deploy
troops in the winter. We've proven that in Bosnia before. We
certainly know how to operate in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said the
alliance's goal was to return the hundreds of thousands of refugees
from Kosovo to their homes before winter, the United States and its
allies have already begun preparing to make the camps in Albania
and Macedonia habitable through the cold months.
</P>
<P>
   On the Joint Staff and among the chiefs, there is agreement,
officials said, that if diplomacy fails to produce a settlement,
the alliance will simply continue bombing. ``Winterization of the
camps will enable this to go right on into the winter if that is
required,'' Shelton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although some senior commanders have doubts, others believe the
air war might still force Milosevic to accept NATO's conditions and
withdraw the Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO aircraft flew 197 strike missions in Yugoslavia overnight
Tuesday, including 150 in the area around Mount Pastrik on the
Kosovo-Albanian border, where Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas are
engaged in fierce fighting with Yugoslav forces. The attacks
continued Wednesday, according to the command.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to pound away throughout the summer at the rate
we are going now,'' a senior diplomat said, ``we'll eliminate a lot
more Serbian ground forces. Milosevic has to decide whether to cash
in his chips now, or go on and risk losing a lot more.''

AT LEAST 9 DIE IN AMERICAN CRASH AT ARKANSAS AIRPORT 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Violent weather may have forced an American
Airlines jetliner to plow off a runway, where it broke apart,
killing at least eight passengers and a top-ranked pilot, aviation
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Full to capacity with 139 passengers and six crew members,
Flight 1420 left Dallas more than two hours late because of bad
weather. Touching down at Little Rock National Airport, Adams Field
about 11:50 p.m. CDT Tuesday in hail, high winds and thunderstorms,
the MD-Super 80 aircraft slid off a runway, smashed into a lighting
tower and cracked open in flames about 100 yards from the Arkansas
River.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of passengers fled the smoking fuselage into pounding
hail and waist-deep water. Eighty-three people were sent to local
hospitals, some for cuts and burns and at least seven with critical
injuries. Fifty-one were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so
thick we couldn't breathe. Even I pushed a few people, because your
natural instinct to survive just kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors included Ray Toler, musical band director at Texas A&AMP;M
University in College Station. He was injured and hospitalized.
About 25 members of a singing group from Ouchita Baptist University
in Arkadelphia, Ark., also were on board, returning from a concert
tour to Germany and Austria, where they performed for Kosovo
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had not released the names of the dead passengers
Wednesday night, pending notification of their relatives. Two
people were not accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard Buschmann, was an experienced American
Airlines pilot chief in Chicago and spent two months of every year
flying routine routes to maintain proficiency, airline officials
said. His cockpit assistant, First Officer Michael Origel, was a
new employee who finished his training in March. Origel, injured in
the crash, was interviewed by investigators Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The flight crew was about 30 minutes from the 14-hour daily work
limit, having flown from Chicago to Salt Lake City to Dallas first,
according to airline executives.
</P>
<P>
   On all flights, the captain makes the final decision whether to
take off and land after getting information from flight dispatchers
and weather experts, American Airlines Vice President Bob Baker
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Radar images reviewed Wednesday by the National Weather Service
showed the storm arriving at Little Rock's airport about the same
time the jet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden, powerful shift in weather conditions caused by a
thunderstorm dramatically changed the wind speed and direction
within 30 minutes of the plane's landing and shortly after the
crash, George Black Jr. of the National Transportation Safety Board
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the wind was relatively mild at 9 knots from the south
27 minutes before the accident, but shifted to the northwest and
increased in speed to 76 knots, or more than 80 miles an hour, five
minutes afterward. Heavy rainfall decreased visibility from seven
miles to one mile in that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That indicates that there was some severe wind in the area,''
Black said. ``We'll have to find out where that was and how it
relates later.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather information was gathered from monitors at the
airport that measure wind speed and direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what (the pilot) knew, we don't know what
information he had. We're still working the radar information, and
we'll get what information was transmitted to him from air traffic
control,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators retrieved the flight recorder and the cockpit
voice recorder, which were sent to Washington. D.C., for analysis,
Black said. He said data from the recorders will determine if the
severe shift in weather played a role in the accident and if the
shift was expected by the flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration official confided that the
pilot may have been attempting to take off after the landing and
was unable to generate enough power to lift off the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Black said information from the recorders will determine what
the flight crew was doing at the time of the accident. He said
investigators have no evidence indicating the pilot was attempting
to take off.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA official said the jet struck guided landing system
equipment and then a bridge of lights that span an embankment at
the end of the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the metal lighting structure slowed the plane's speed
and may have prevented it from going nose first into the Arkansas
River.
</P>
<P>
   The plane lay broken in several pieces Wednesday night near the
7,200-foot long, 150-foot wide runway.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers recounted a harrowing landing and frantic escape:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all kind of looking around basically in disbelief that
he was bringing that plane in with that weather situation. It was
absolutely horrendous,'' passenger Randy Hill told Cable News
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Tim Benton said the captain used the intercom to tell
passengers the landing would be delayed 15 minutes by a
thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's suicidal to try and land in 80-mile per hour winds. I
hope they get to the bottom of this,'' Benton told the Reuters news
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fire started at the front of the plane and spread back,''
passenger Barrett Baber said. ``Once the smoke got too thick, there
was nothing we could do. People were screaming, `God, please save
us!'''
</P>
<P>
   The jet's maintenance record showed no recent problems, said
American Airlines officials, who quickly expressed their sorrow and
offered to aid passengers and their relatives for as long as help
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am obviously shocked,'' American Airlines President and
Chief Executive Donald Carty told a news conference at the
airline's headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first deadly crash of a commercial airliner at the
Little Rock airport. The last major American Airline accident was
in December 1995 when a Boeing 757 crashed into a mountainside in
Cali, Columbia, killing 163 people.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, the former governor of Arkansas, said he and
Hillary Rodham Clinton were saddened to learn of the crash. ``We
join the American people in extending our deepest sympathies to the
families of those who died or were injured,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After enduring excruciating pain to help put the New
York Knicks one step away from the National Basketball Association
championship series, Patrick Ewing's 14-year pursuit of a title
took another cruel turn on Wednesday when tests revealed a partial
tear of his left Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing will miss the rest of the playoffs, and be forced to watch
as the Knicks continue their once improbable playoff push without
him. Tied at 1 game apiece with Indiana in the Eastern Conference
final, the Knicks will play Game 3 on Saturday at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team physician, Dr. Norman Scott, said the injury
will not require surgery, Ewing will wear a cast for six weeks. The
news was another disheartening blow for an aging superstar whose
career has been brilliant but haunted by misguided finger rolls,
ill-fated shots and the looming presence of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to work so hard and be so close to something
I've dreamed about for so many years,'' Ewing said. ``To not be
able to be on the floor to help my teammates is very frustrating
and disappointing. But if my Achilles ruptures completely, it would
end my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost befitting Ewing's trend of misfortune, his last shot of
this season happened to be a miss at the buzzer of the Knicks' Game
2 loss to the Pacers Tuesday night, leaving the series even at 1-1.
After pivoting in pain to catch a long pass, Ewing's 14-foot jumper
to tie the game banged off the rim as he grimaced. He had been
limping badly all night with what was presumed to be the same
Achilles tendinitis he had been playing with for nearly three
months.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew he was playing on a partial tear that he felt pop
during pre-game warmups. During the game, he mentioned the
sensation to Scott, but he was allowed to play on. Ewing finished
the night with 10 points in 26 minutes, just 48 hours after he
played 40 minutes in the Knicks Game 1 win and calmly delivered the
deciding free throws.
</P>
<P>
   To have his season end with a partial tear was totally
unexpected. Throughout the season, Ewing and the coaching staff
said they were convinced, after conversations with Scott and the
team trainer, Mike Saunders, that there was no likelihood of
further damage if he continued to play with tendinitis in his left
Achilles tendon. There were times when he missed games, 12 in all,
during brief stretches of March and April. But each absence was
because of the pain, not the danger.
</P>
<P>
   `'The risks were extremely low,'' Scott said. `'It's not likely
that tendinitis will go onto a tear. We had no problem with that,
and we don't now.''
</P>
<P>
   Treating Achilles' tendinitis in one of the tougher calls in
sports medicine, according to Dr. Andrew Feldman, who is the
director of sports medicine at St. Vincents Hospital in Manhattan.
Some patients with partial tears never show symptoms leading up to
the injury, he said, while others with pain never develop a tear.
</P>
<P>
   `'Does tendinitis always lead to a partial tear, no,'' said
Feldman, who treats professional and collegiate athletes. `'But in
my patients, if someone has chronic tendinits, if they were to ask
me, `Do I have an increased risk of tearing this as opposed to
someone who has no symptoms,' the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   An MRI was done as a precaution after Ewing felt the ripping
sensation in his Achilles before Game 2. When Ewing was shown the
results of the MRI on Wednesday morning, he was in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   `'He didn't believe me,'' Scott said. `'He was really depressed.
Here's something that is looking like it's reachable, and now this.
He had learned to cope with the tendinitis and was making his
contributions and now a new event. It was like anyone's normal
reaction: `Why me, why now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy had no answer for Ewing when he sat in his
office with the team's star center for about an hour on Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years as a Knick assistant and head coach, Van Gundy
has been a witness to every disappointment Ewing has had in his
effort to win a title. He has been by his side as an avid defender
when Ewing has been dogged for coming up short in big games,
criticized for seeming as selfish and booed by a public that has
never fully embraced the private star.
</P>
<P>
   He was there when Ewing crashed down on his wrist on Dec. 22,
1997, and within 24-hours had season-ending surgery. Ewing missed
the final 56 games of the regular season last year and made a
futile but gallant return in the playoffs. This year, he proved he
could recover his shooting touch, which many thought would never
return. Somehow, this latest setback seems even more troublesome
considering how much pain Ewing played in, how much adversity the
team has been through with Van Gundy's coaching status uncertain
and Ewing's own future as a Knick unclear, and how close the team
is to a title chance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   `'The reason he plays today is to win a championship,'' Van
Gundy said. `'All the personal achievements and team achievements,
with the exception of a championship, have been done. He fought
through a lot of pain to try to help us even though he knew he
couldn't be the Patrick Ewing everyone knew. But as we told him
many times, it's not about what you can't do, do what you can to
help us. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   `'To talk to him and to see him, I just felt very bad for him
because it's like he's being cheated out of another opportunity. I
feel for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy understands the team cannot use Ewing's injury as
an excuse to fail now. They have proven in the past that they can
win without Ewing. This season, with the additions of the slashing
Latrell Sprewell and lively Marcus Camby, the Knicks have unveiled
a team capable of running opponents ragged. Even the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, the Knicks scored 22 fastbreak points, though it took
Ewing's four free throws in the closing seconds to win it. In Game
2, with Chris Dudley at center next to Camby, Sprewell, Allan
Houston and Chris Childs, the Knicks went on a 17-4 run without
Ewing and nearly won the game. But nearly was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   `'Obviously, when you lose a great player it doesn't help you,''
Van Gundy said. `'He was the one guy who had the respect of the
officials to get a call when bumped. There are a lot of things he
does for us, like rebounding and low-post presence. We're going to
have to find some answers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At times this season Ewing was the one who kept the once
disjointed Knicks alive for a playoff berth they were on the verge
of missing the postseason for the first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks clinched the final seed after Ewing scored 27 points
and grabbed 19 rebounds against Boston, in the regular season's
next to last game. And in a display of just how high his pain
threshold can be, Ewing played through tendinitis and a strained
muscle in his ribcage to make game-deciding stops on defense and
shots on offense to give the Knicks a series-deciding Game 5 of
their dramatic first-round triumph over Miami.
</P>
<P>
   With three days until Game 3 of their series with Indiana, it
seemed Ewing would be able to catch a break and rest his aching
body.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's going to definitely help me,'' Ewing said after Game 2,
just hours before tests would reveal the partial tear. `'But
remember, Larry says I'm faking it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was his poke at Pacer Coach Larry Bird, who jokingly
questioned whether Ewing could be really hurt after the Knicks
center played 40 minutes in Game 1. The answer as to how hurt he
was came on Wednesday.

OLDER AIRPORTS AND HAZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a perfect world, there would be an extra 1,000 feet at the
end of every runway _ as federal regulation mandate for new runways
_ just in case the plane doesn't stop fast enough, or the pilot
touches down too far along the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond that, there would be an additional safety area to
cradle any runaway jet.
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world, there are older airports like Little
Rock's National Airport and at Logan Airport in Boston, which have
hazards that would not be permitted if they were built today. And
when pilots have to deal with bad weather, poor traction, and
obstructions looming just past the end of runways, the results can
be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock late Tuesday, American Airlines Flight 1420, with
145 people on board, tried to land in violent weather and
apparently hydroplaned on the wet runway, overshot the end, crossed
an access road, hit a steel light structure, and broke apart before
coming to rest on the bank of the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wasn't there an overrun area at the end of that runway?''
asked Norman Komich, a commercial airline pilot who works with
Damos Research, a Los Angeles-based aviation consulting firm. ``Why
was there a steel light tower at the end that wasn't frangible.''
</P>
<P>
   The light system did not break away, but instead turned the
sleek MD-80 fuselage into three chunks of scrap. Jet fuel leaked,
fire erupted. At least nine people died, including Captain Richard
Buschmann, the airline's chief pilot in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are likely to scrutinize what the flight crew knew
about weather conditions before deciding to land.
</P>
<P>
   The crash not only highlights the difficulties pilots face in
operating in a less-than-perfect world, it also raises questions
about the quality of equipment and personnel at smaller airports,
such as Little Rock's.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in Little Rock, which opened in 1917, and Logan, which
opened in 1924, pilots and controllers must work in conditions that
existed long before federal regulations requiring overrun areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logan, being an older airport, does not have the luxury of
having those standards'' of 1,000-foot-long overruns with no
obstructions, said Thomas Kinton Jr., Massport's director of
aviation. ``Absent shortening runways, we cannot achieve those.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is built into Boston Harbor, only two of the 10 major
runways at Logan have overrun areas of any significant length.
</P>
<P>
   New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport recently
installed a prototype ``arresting system'' that last month stopped
an American Eagle commuter plane with 27 people on board from going
into the water. The foam bed acts like an adhesive tape to stop
planes quickly and safely. Federal Aviation Administration
officials think it saved lives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators will spend much of their efforts trying
to determine what caused Flight 1420 from Dallas Forth Worth to go
off the end of the 7,200-foot-long runway in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   One area certain to gain considerable attention is what
Buschmann and the copilot, First Officer Michael Origel, who was
hired by the airline this year, knew about weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A violent storm with torrential rain and hail, and winds gusting
above 70 miles per hour was reported across the river from the
airport around the time the airplane touched down.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Logan, Little Rock does not have sophisticated Doppler
radar that helps controllers analyze the severity of local weather.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of Doppler radar played a role in the 1994 crash of
USAir Flight 1016 in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board found such a radar
system ``would have provided controllers with information about
severity of weather, and the information would have been beneficial
to the flight crew.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking federal safety official said that the FAA can be
slow in keeping pilots updated about weather. ``They pay attention
to it in the big cities, it's just when you get down to the next
level,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The national air traffic control system is hectic place to work,
and the busiest facilities attract the most confident controllers.
It is reflected in salaries _ the busier the airport or airspace,
the bigger the paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-paid controllers work at so-called Level Five
facilities, such as Logan. Little Rock is a Level Three facility,
according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials would not release tapes of air traffic controllers
talking to the American Airlines flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   As pilots approach an airport, they listen to a recorded tape
with updated field and weather information. The tape, known as an
ATIS, contains a barometric pressure reading used to set
altimeters. An FAA spokesman in Washington did not know when the
ATIS was last updated for Flight 1420.
</P>
<P>
   An outdated ATIS recording contributed to the near catastrophe
of an American Airlines MD-80 landing after midnight on Nov. 12,
1995, at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A low-pressure system was moving through the area, and with an
outdated ATIS tape, the altimeter reading was artificially high.
The plane cut a 100-yard swath through oak trees as it crossed a
ridge near the airport, lost power, and barely made it to the
runway.
</P>
<P>
   Komich and other pilots are angry that billions of dollars are
sitting unused in the FAA's Aviation Trust Fund. ``There is money
to make the system safer,'' he said. ``But it has flaws in it, and
the public needs to know.''

WATER-SKIING OPENS DOORS FOR DISABLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTAIC _ Some water-skiers see Matt Tracey as a mentor. He just
wants to offer encouragement to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It thrills me. That's why I'm here, to give any support I
can,'' said the 76-year-old retired painting contractor from West
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to see that disabled people today have a chance,
because I came along in an era where if you were disabled the word
was `unabled,''' said Tracey, who lost his right leg at age 9 after
being hit on his bike by a drunken driver. ``As in, `Your unable to
participate in what we're doing, so go over and sit on the bench
where you won't be in the way because we don't want you to get
hurt.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For people like us, we've already gotten hurt; now we want to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something, in this case, is water-skiing at Castaic Lagoon
through the Disabled Water Sports Program at the Cal State
Northridge Aquatics Center. With the assistance of volunteers, paid
staff and specially designed equipment that allows one to sit atop
the board, participants can get out of their wheelchairs and on the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're free. You're feeling as normal as possible,'' said
Anthony Orefice, 24, of Canyon Country, who lost the use of his
legs in 1993 following a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on that ski, you're flying around again, cutting
up the water,'' he explained, shivering back dockside after his
first and only ride of the day. ``You're not doing 2 mph an hour in
this chair; you're out there doing like 20. I like speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The whitecaps on this unseasonably chilly and breezy afternoon
did little to dissuade the medical supply sales rep, but they did
impact his water-skiing. ``I crashed a lot more,'' Orefice said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was inaugurated in September thanks to grants and
private donations, the program has offered a certain emotion, a
certain energy on the water that everyone involved seems to feed
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a good feeling,'' said Paul Jorgensen, 27, of
Newhall, a CSUN student employee who at various times prepares
skiers for their rides, operates the ski boat and serves as a
rescue diver aboard an accompanying Jet Ski, reaching fallen skiers
moments after a spill. ``It's fun working with them, and they get
excited and that gets you excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Even John Van Arsdale, a CSUN professor of leisure studies and
recreation, still gets caught up in the contagious emotion of the
day's activities after 23 years of calling the Aquatics Center his
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love seeing people achieve something that they
haven't been able to do before,'' said Van Arsdale, 54, of
Valencia, director of the renowned center.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized by the National Recreation and Park Association as
tops among such university facilities, the center is thought to be
the country's second-largest aquatics education facility of any
kind that teaches water and boating safety. Van Arsdale and his
crew see some 8,500 students and community members partake in
sailing, kayaking, canoeing, windsurfing, wakeboarding,
water-skiing and, occasionally, fishing.
</P>
<P>
   But no one lets the fun fog the issue of safety, he said.
Despite being fitted with life jackets, quadriplegics, for example,
have difficulties holding their heads above water during takeoff,
after falling and upon returning to the dock. ``They tell us they
can hold (their breath) for 40 seconds under (the water), `Then
come and pull me out after that,''' said Jorgensen. ``We get there
within like 10 to 15 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer Gina Arnold helps coordinate the disabled water-skiing
project and drums up interest through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `I've never done this before and always wanted to,
but I didn't know there was any service that would provide this,'''
said Arnold, 30, of Van Nuys, a participant herself who has been in
a wheelchair since contracting polio at age 3 while growing up in
Vietnam. ``I just like helping people. And I get to meet new people
and I get to know about other activities that are provided for the
disabled community.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the water-skiing, Arnold said, ``It's just exhilarating
and fun, and I haven't fallen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Schechter wasn't supposed to live after falling 65 feet
when his rock climbing support rope was severed by broken beer
bottles at Chatsworth's Stoney Point Park. Eighteen surgeries
later, he still wasn't supposed to walk. Now the Northridge
plumbing contractor walks with crutches and throws a ``life party''
each Aug. 5 _ the date of his 1990 accident _ to celebrate his
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   There he was Tuesday, perched on his Air Chair _ an unusual ski
that elevates above the water by way of a hydrofoil underneath it _
saying, ``Hit it.'' When the boat reached 12 mph, Schechter began
bouncing up and down on the device and zigzagging between the
wakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of an adrenaline junkie and I've always looked for
certain things, and because of the accident I can't do the things
that I used to do,'' Schechter said. ``And so for me it's
absolutely incredible to find those types of things again that
allow me to really have some freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Turned on to the disabled water-skiing project by Tracey during
their therapy sessions at CSUN's Kinesiology Department, Schechter
admires his old friend's perseverance in a time when he was told he
was ``unable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they tell you, `No,' the more you try,'' Schechter
said. &QL;

MARKET PLACE: MCI WORLDCOM FACES QUESTION OVER STATEMENT ON
SKYTEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When is the truth not the whole truth? That is the question
reverberating through the offices of MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, MCI Worldcom, the telecommunications giant, issued
what many investors took to be a firm denial that it might acquire
Skytel Communications Inc., a paging company. MCI said its
registration of an Internet address combining the companies' names
was ``not an indication of official company intention.'' To
investors' surprise, MCI announced such a deal just three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   The incident raises anew some prickly legal questions about when
a company's statements might be misleading, because of what the
company says or what it omits. Experts in securities law say that
MCI appears to be skating on thin ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask for my gut feeling, it looks pretty bad,'' said
James E. Schrager, a professor at the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   MCI maintains it has done nothing wrong and its comments were
misconstrued. Whether investors were misled by MCI's statements and
whether the company is liable for their losses can only be decided
in court or by federal regulators. So far, no lawsuits have
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   But questions arose on May 25 when an online news service called
Company Sleuth reported that MCI had registered the Internet domain
name ``skytelworldcom.com,'' an Internet address that combined
parts of the two companies' names.
</P>
<P>
   Registering domain names has become a common practice in
corporate America to try to ward off poachers, individuals who grab
names and then try to sell them to companies for high prices.
</P>
<P>
   The news that an employee of MCI had nailed down rights to the
joined name of these two independent companies renewed speculation
that Skytel was close to being acquired. Similar rumors had
surfaced periodically over the previous two months, with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Skytel announced that it had retained an investment
banker to explore ``strategic alternatives,'' which in Wall Street
lingo usually means that a company is seeking an acquirer. Several
publications, including Business Week, named MCI as a possible
suitor.
</P>
<P>
   When news services reported the new Internet address on May 25,
trading surged in Skytel shares, sending the stock price soaring.
After closing the previous day at $18.875, Skytel shares traded as
high as $21.875, a gain of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after noon that day, an MCI spokeswoman began
telling reporters who called to ask that the MCI employee who
registered the Internet address did so on his own initiative. The
employee, who worked in the company's Internet group, had seen
chatter about a possible MCI-Skytel deal on Internet message
boards, said Barbara Gibson, senior manager of corporate
communications at MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibson read to reporters a statement that said: ``From time
to time, MCI Worldcom employees, sometimes acting on their own
initiatives, register domain names they believe may be potential
targets of domain-name squatters. In this case, the action is not
an indication of official company intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors interpreted that statement to mean that MCI had no
intention of acquiring Skytel _ a new Web address notwithstanding.
That sent Skytel's shares falling back below the previous day's
closing price, to as low as $18.6875. The shares finished the day
at $20.125 on volume of 7.5 million shares, three times the stock's
recent average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, after the close of trading on the Friday
before the Memorial Day weekend, MCI announced it would buy Skytel
for $1.3 billion in stock _ or roughly $21.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in corporate disclosure and securities laws say that, in
light of the merger announcement, MCI has some explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   Even if MCI makes a practice of snapping up Internet domain
names that include the names of potential partners, this example
``dances close to the line,'' said Schrager of the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether MCI's statement would cause a reasonable
investor to be misled, either because of what it says or what it
omits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company can't speak half-truths,'' said Thomas Newkirk,
associate director of the SEC's division of enforcement. Newkirk
declined to comment on any aspects of the MCI-Skytel case. But
speaking generally about disclosure issues, he said companies
``can't make a statement that is true on its face but which is
false or misleading because it omits other information.''
</P>
<P>
   That precedent was laid out in a case involving Carnation's 1984
takeover by Nestle, the Swiss food and candy company. The SEC said
that Carnation had spread ``materially misleading'' information
when, in response to queries about its rising stock price and
rumors of a pending takeover, it said there was no news to account
for the stock action.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carnation was in takeover negotiations at the time, and
the SEC said that the company therefore had two options: say
nothing or tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Newkirk explained: ``A company can say `No comment.' But if it
does comment, it can't make a false or misleading statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnation later agreed to pay $13 million to settle a lawsuit
contending that the company had misled investors and artificially
depressed its stock price by denying the takeover rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, in 1988, the Supreme Court further expanded
the obligations of companies to disclose merger negotiations. In
Basic Inc. vs. Levinson, the court ruled that companies had an
obligation to avoid misleading denials of merger talks or
incomplete statements about negotiations once the talks reached a
stage that a reasonable investor would consider significant.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether those precedents would directly apply to
the Skytel situation, in which MCI's statements affected not its
own stock price but that of another company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibson, the MCI spokeswoman, said the company did not in its
statement last week confirm or deny anything about its intentions
regarding a takeover of Skytel. Instead, it offered ``No comment''
when asked specifically about the possibility. She added, ``It was
certainly not my intention to mislead anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many investors appear to be worried about the issue. At a
company meeting in New York Wednesday with financial analysts, no
one raised a question about the statements, despite some chatter on
Internet bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   But investors who sold their Skytel shares for less than $19
after hearing the company's disavowal of the Internet name might
soon raise some pointed questions of their own. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Signaling a likely theme for her potential Senate
campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton Wednesday decried the condition of
New York City's public schools, asserting that they had been
undermined by political infighting and underfinancing by City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In two speeches on the subject, the first lady never mentioned
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican who has also expressed
interest in running for the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   But her remarks _ at a spirited outdoor graduation at City
College in Harlem and at a $500-a-plate Democratic fund-raising
luncheon at Tavern on the Green _ clearly invoked the public
battling between Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and
suggested that it was ruinous for the school system. Mrs. Clinton
left little doubt that if she runs, she would attempt to make
Giuliani's stewardship over the city's schools a central issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never lift up our public schools _ or the students they
serve _ by tearing them down,'' Mrs. Clinton said as students rose
out of their seats in applause. ``We can never ensure the economic
future of this city or state or our nation by undermining the
public education system that is at the very foundation of the
American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who has been trying to use her recent travels to
New York as a way of establishing some connection to the state
where she has never lived, cited what she said was the motto for
Public School 1 in Manhattan: ``All children can learn _ no
exceptions, no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do this if we will stop pointing fingers and instead
use our hands to roll up our sleeves and get to work together,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides have been expecting his line of attack, and
some Democrats believe that the mayor's recent criticism of Crew,
whose appointment he had strongly supported, was a calculated
effort to distance himself from problems in the schools. And
Giuliani lingered at the lectern at City Hall when the topic came
up Wednesday, brushing away Mrs. Clinton's criticism as he sought
to turn the discussion back to what his aides want to be the
central subject of the campaign: her residency.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he viewed the speech as an attack on his education
policies, Giuliani responded: ``Well, I'm glad she found her way
there. Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter pressed him on the subject, he said: ``I think
that it's nice to see that she's finding her way around New York.
Maybe I'll travel to Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   The crosstown exchange offered an early glimpse of the intensity
that might accompany a contest between the two. The election to
succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring, is not until
November 2000. But the rows of television cameras recording Mrs.
Clinton's speech suggested the fierce interest that the hint of
such a race has stirred, even though neither Giuliani nor Mrs.
Clinton has announced that they are actually running.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks appeared sharper in tone that most of her
recent speeches in New York, which have tended to offer broader
discussions about the problems facing the nation. Her commencement
speech contained passages that sounded very much like a political
stump speech, complete with the kind of sharp, pungent sentences
that are likely to find themselves onto the evening news programs.
</P>
<P>
   The speech came one day after she spent 90 minutes meeting with
Hank Morris, the Democratic consultant who helped run the
successful campaign of Sen. Charles Schumer last year. Mrs.
Clinton's criticisms of the public school system Wednesday were
evocative of Schumer's attacks on Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wins, especially our children, if our schools are
plagued by poor test scores and performance, by low expectations
and social promotions,'' Mrs. Clinton declared, not mentioning that
Giuliani is, in fact, a strong opponent of social promotion, the
practice of allowing even failing students to go on to the next
grade. ``No one wins, especially our children, if politics takes up
much needed seats in the classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she would support more money for early
education and teacher training, as well as spending to improve
run-down schools and to reduce class size.

   BC-NEWMEDIA-IPOS-NYT (moved on Sunday, May 30)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, May 30,
about the flurry of initial public offerings among new-media
companies based in New York misstated the reason senior executives
are often unable to sell their stock for several months after the
start of trading. The practice is dictated by contracts between the
companies and their underwriters, not by Federal regulations. The
article also misidentified the headquarters of Lycos Inc., an
Internet company. Although it has a sales and marketing office in
Manhattan, it is based in Waltham, Mass. The article also
misspelled the name of a strategic-communications firm. It is
Siegel &AMP; Gale, not Siegal.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Saturday, May 29,
about the opinions of Presidential candidates on whether the next
President of the United States should get a pay increase misstated
the attitude of Elizabeth Dole. Rather than being one of five
Republican candidates declining to comment on the President's
salary, Mrs. Dole told Speaker J. Dennis Hastert in a letter last
week that Congress should reject a proposal to raise it to
$400,000. She said the current figure of $200,000 was ``fair and
appropriate,'' considering the many perquisites of the office.

left an incorrect impression about the location of a fire in

Florida on the Gulf of Mexico, not in the Okefenokee Swamp, which
is partly in northern Florida. The photos were slugged:

   The captions for photos NYT16 and NYT17, which moved on Tuesday,
left an incorrect impression about the location of a fire in
Florida. The smoke billowing on the horizon, over a higway in the
foreground, was from a different fire near Venice, in west-central
Florida on the Gulf of Mexico, not in the Okefenokee Swamp, which
is partly in northern Florida. The photos were slugged:

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Moments before American Airlines Flight 1420
skidded off a runway in a torrential rain storm at Little Rock
National Airport, Adams Field, killing nine and injuring dozens,
Jamie Goss had been reading.
</P>
<P>
   The last scene she read in ``Their Eyes Were Watching God'' told
a bracing tale of people surviving a hurricane. The book
foreshadowed what would happen to Goss in the last minutes of her
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:50 p.m. CDT Tuesday, the McDonnell-Douglas Super 80
lost control after touching down on the runway at the airport in
gusting winds and hail. The plane slammed into a light standard at
the end of runway, broke into several pieces and burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept remembering what I had read,'' Goss said Wednesday
from her home in Little Rock. ``The scene was about a storm and the
people couldn't see in the dark but ``their eyes were watching
God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Goss, a junior at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., who
celebrated her 21st birthday Tuesday, was flying home for a
two-week summer break. After the crash she managed to grab hold of
a woman sitting next to her. The pair found their way off the plane
safely only to be stranded in a marshy field near the Arkansas
River as the storm raged around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we left Dallas there were no problems with the weather,''
Goss said. ``But about 20 minutes before we landed we were warned
by the pilot that we were getting into some bad weather and the
ride would be bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little bit unnerving. But I knew we were in trouble
when we landed.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss described the landing as shaky and fast. She said she could
tell Capt. Richard Buschmann was trying to slow down but was losing
control. Three times the plane swerved off the runway and each time
the pilot seemed to gain control momentarily, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at the ground, and we were drifting off the
runway. We were going so fast and he never slowed down. Then we hit
the lights.''
</P>
<P>
   During the landing, Goss said, only a low murmur could be heard
among the 139 passengers. ``I didn't see a stewardess again.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic broke out as the plane crashed, broke apart and caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone went nuts,'' Goss said. ``They were screaming because
of the fire and the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in row 13 by the window and there was a small
crack in the side of the plane in front of us.'' Goss said. ``We
didn't even worry about where an exit was. We climbed over the
seats and out the first hole. I was holding on to the lady, pushing
her from behind and she was navigating us. We helped each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss said she briefly spoke to the woman during the flight from
Dallas but never asked her name and hasn't seen her since they were
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   As others around her screamed ``Oh God'' and ``We're going to
die,'' Goss said all she could think about was getting off the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you think about things like dying. But I just told
myself ``Well I can't die. I have to get myself out,''' she said.
``And you just struggle to do it. I just kept thinking about my
parents and friends and a thousand different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of in a daze. It's like you're lost and you're
trying not to be lost anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss said everyone in her group of survivors helped each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody just grabbed a hand,'' Goss said. ``That part amazed
me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   After escaping the burning plane, Goss and about 20 others waded
across a waist-deep marsh and lay in a field because their was no
cover from the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried that a tornado was going to get us, so we just
got on the ground,'' she said. ``People were yelling ``God save
us,' and in the field that's when some started reciting Bible
verses.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Goss said she began to pray, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other thing to do,'' she said. ``You just pray and
hope your parents know you're OK. And you hope we can last out here
(in the field during the storm).''
</P>
<P>
   Goss recounted her experience with remarkable calmness, saying
that is how she ``deals with things.'' She was even planning to go
to a movie theater later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But she said her true test of courage will come in two weeks
when she has to return to school for a summer session to continue
her degree in American Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get on another plane, and that's when we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other college students, members of the Ouachita Baptist
University choir of Arkadelphia, Ark., also were on the plane.

   Assistant professor of communications, Dave Ozmun, accompanied
the group of 30 on a tour of Germany and Austria, where they sang
at churches and schools and performed a concert for Kosovo
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great admiration for what the pilot had to go through
before the crash and afterward for our students,'' Ozmun said. He
said all in the group of mostly juniors and seniors were accounted
for, though some were seriously injured. Those who were not wounded
remained calm and helped other passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were quite impressive,'' he said. ``They handled
themselves very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozmun, who was working in his office Wednesday in Arkadelphia,
said he was lucky because he was sitting near an emergency exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it open easily and climbed out,'' Ozmun said. ``The
wing had fire on it and we had to jump through that. But we just
needed to get away from the plane as fast as we could because the
smoke was very stifling.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the weather was almost as bad as the smoke-filled plane,
Ozmun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in knee-deep water. People were yelling for their
family and friends,'' he said. ``And the hail was coming down very
hard, hard enough to hurt. It was hard to see and breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozmun said surviving such a crash was hard to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're suspended at that point,'' he said. ``You
just brace yourself and prepare for you don't know what. But that
part only lasted for about 10 to 12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very fortunate. The emergency exit opened quickly
and I got to the ground quickly.'' Ozmun said. ``I guess it's just
a sense of self-preservation. I just didn't have time to worry.''

FINAL ARGUMENTS BEGIN IN POLICE TORTURE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first day of closing arguments in an explosive
case of police brutality in New York City, a federal prosecutor
declared Wednesday that four police officers had brutalized Abner
Louima in a night of violence and terror that ended in a vicious
assault in a police station restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe that something so depraved and so cruel
could actually happen, let alone that it could be two New York
police officers in uniform who did it,'' the prosecutor, Alan
Vinegrad, told the jury, saying that one officer rammed a stick
into Louima's rectum while another held him down in a restroom at a
Brooklyn police station two years ago. Two other officers are
charged with beating Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who wielded the stick, Justin Volpe, interrupted the
trial last week in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn to plead guilty
to six federal crimes in the case and was no longer at the defense
table when Vinegrad spoke Wednesday. But Officer Charles Schwarz,
who is charged with restraining Louima during the attack, listened
intently at the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   Also listening closely were the three other defendants who
remain on trial after Volpe's unexpected exit from the case, which
came after he decided that the testimony against him had become
insurmountable and that his best course was to plead guilty and
throw himself on the mercy of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution portrayed Volpe Wednesday as the ``driving
force'' of the crimes against Louima, but said that the other
officers were his willing accomplices. The two defense lawyers who
presented their closing arguments Wednesday sought to use Volpe's
plea to suggest to the jury that the only guilty party had already
been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder, are charged with
joining Volpe and Schwarz in beating Louima in a police car between
the time he was arrested in a street melee outside a Flatbush
nightclub and the attack with the stick in the station house
restroom. Doctors said the attack tore Louima's rectum and bladder,
causing injuries that required three operations. And the final
defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is accused of trying to cover up
the beating in the police car and a second assault by Volpe on a
second man, Patrick Antoine, in the area of the street brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Schwarz and Bellomo are to give their closing
arguments Thursday _ both men have insisted the charges against
them are untrue _ while the lawyers for Wiese and Bruder told the
jury in their summations Wednesday that while Louima might have
been tortured by Volpe in the restroom, he had not been beaten in
the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they maintained, Louima had fabricated that incident
both because he was enraged at every police officer involved in his
arrest, which had ended with the restroom attack, and because he
and his family believed that he had to embellish his encounter with
the police to make his account of the attack in the restroom more
credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that he was violently assaulted in the bathroom and
Justin Volpe was part of that,'' Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London,
told the jurors in a courtroom whose gallery was packed for the
closing arguments. ``But he has to exaggerate what happened on the
street,'' London continued, because Louima and his family ``needed
to create more on the street so people would believe the bathroom''
attack.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Wiese, Joseph Tacopina, said that another reason
for Louima to make up the story about being beaten in the police
car was that he was so angry over the torture that ``he wanted
everyone or anyone who had anything to do with his arrest that
night to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer for Wiese, Russell Gioiella, touched on a theme
that was laced through Wednesday's defense arguments: that while
one sympathized with . Louima for having been ``violated in the
bathroom,'' that ``doesn't give him the right to blame innocent
people for things they didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another theme in the defense arguments by the lawyers for Bruder
and Wiese was that their clients had been charged because of what
Volpe had done in the restroom to Louima, a 32-year-old immigrant
from Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Wiese sits here because of what that monster Justin
Volpe did to Abner Louima in that bathroom,'' Tacopina asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor, Vinegrad, an assistant United States
attorney in Brooklyn, apparently anticipated that argument and
repeatedly insisted that the four remaining defendants had each
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In his summation, Vinegrad returned to the prosecution's
contention that the four officers who were charged with assaulting
Louima had mistakenly believed that he had punched Volpe in the
face and knocked him down during the melee. Vinegrad called Louima
``a man who Justin Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas
Wiese decided to violently punish for a crime that, as it turns
out, he did not even commit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And while Volpe ``was angry and wanted revenge'' and was the
``driving force behind what happened to Abner Louima in that
bathroom,'' Vinegrad said, ``he had help,'' and ``it was Charles
Schwarz who was all too willing to give it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In entering his guilty plea last week, after three weeks of
testimony in the case, Volpe said another officer was present
during the attack on Louima in the restroom, but he did not
identify that officer. Until the guilty plea, the prosecution had
focused much of its efforts on Volpe, and wrapped up its case
against the other defendants in two days. The defense lawyers also
quickly rested their cases, saying they had refuted the prosecution
case during cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Vinegrad said, Louima was ``living proof of the
horror of police brutality,'' and he urged the jury _ which is
expected to get the case after summations end Thursday _ to declare
through its verdict that ``the rule of law must prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the back of a patrol car,'' he said. ``This is not
a station house bathroom. This is a court of law.''

   The captions for photos NYT16 and NYT17, which moved on Tuesday,
left an incorrect impression about the location of a fire in

Florida on the Gulf of Mexico, not in the Okefenokee Swamp, which
is partly in northern Florida. The photos were slugged:

   The captions for photos NYT16 and NYT17, which moved on Tuesday,
left an incorrect impression about the location of a fire in
Florida. The smoke billowing on the horizon, over a higway in the
foreground, was from a different fire near Venice, in west-central
Florida on the Gulf of Mexico, not in the Okefenokee Swamp, which
is partly in northern Florida. The photos were slugged:

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Desperately, foolishly, the NBA searched for another
savior, building false idols and false hopes. Michael Jordan's time
was running out, then gone. And the best of times seemed certain to
go with him until a successor could be found.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually, we admitted there would not be another Michael
Jordan and that it was unfair to expect every Grant Hill, Penny
Hardaway or Kobe Bryant to fill his airspace.
</P>
<P>
   We did not, however, realize another truth until now. Basketball
doesn't need another Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It needs Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   You can make copies of the Mona Lisa, but they will never offer
the genius of the original. So it seems such a no-brainer now, like
finding your glasses on the top of your head. If basketball needs a
signature superstar, it doesn't need a copy. It needs someone
different enough to stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan fashioned his perfect exit, securing a sixth world title
with his final shot. Hold the pose. Roll the credits. Fade to
black. There is no need for a sequel. He was perfect for his time,
just as Bill Russell was for his, Julius Erving for his and Magic
Johnson and Larry Bird for theirs. But this is no longer Jordan's
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be the next Michael,'' said Spurs center
Will Perdue, who as a former Bull was present for Jordan's
ascension. ``There's going to be a Tim Duncan.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems so obvious, now that he has taken apart the Lakers and
all their eye-catching pyrotechnics with the most basic layups,
hooks and dunks that, rather than stress-test rims, barely seem to
touch them.
</P>
<P>
   The Stuart Scotts of television can shout all they want about
Bryant's stunning double-pumps. Duncan slipped in a simple jump
hook to win Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals, then laid
70 points on the Lakers in the next two games, all without ever
wagging his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Two games and two Spurs wins into the Western Conference finals,
the Trail Blazers have sent an army of defenders at Duncan. He
still has averaged 22 points and seems on the brink of another
LA-type eruption.
</P>
<P>
   But while Duncan has brought the Spurs within two games of
advancing further than they have ever been, this is all just a
start. Players around the league rush to declare Duncan the NBA's
best, but they immediately add that he is just 23, in his second
season and about to become much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players knew right off the bat with Tim,'' said Spurs center
David Robinson, a former Most Valuable Player once celebrated as
Duncan is now. ``You've got to let the fans pick who they want,
who's going to be Mr. Exciting and the attention-getter. It's not
always the most solid players that get all the attention. But
players see the stuff that's on the floor. Around the league, the
players knew. We saw how good he is and how great he's going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson knew and willingly passed the focus of the Spurs'
offense to Duncan, who this season was the only NBA player to rank
among the league's top 10 in each of the big man's measures of
statistical success: scoring, rebounding, blocked shots and
field-goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Tim's talent, you'd be stupid not to really let him go,''
Robinson said. ``The boy can really play. He can put the ball in
the hole. He gives our team just a great, solid scorer. I can use
some of the other abilities I have.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems little question Duncan is the difference in a team
that has gone from Western Conference contender to, with the
league's best record, championship favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to have raised his game to a different level in the
playoffs,'' said Perdue. ``That's what players of that caliber
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Spurs guard Steve Kerr, another former Bull who saw
Jordan's magnificence regularly: ``Tim's been blessed with the
opportunity to play with Dave and right away be on a good team. But
he's put this team over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is indeed helped by playing next to Robinson, especially
on defense, where the Admiral can take on Hakeem Olajuwon or
Shaquille O'Neal and allow Duncan to avoid the wear and tear of
dealing with the moves of the Dream or the brute strength of the
Diesel. But by assuming the first-option responsibilities on
offense, Duncan has taken the bulk of the pressure from Robinson
with a game that seems built for just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to last year, my role has changed,'' Duncan said.
``People accept their roles, and I accept mine.''
</P>
<P>
   A better indication about what Duncan expects of himself might
be his attitude regarding his play in the Western Conference
finals. Despite 44 points (on 16-of-26 shooting), 23 rebounds, 10
blocked shots and two wins in two games, he seems dissatisfied with
his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really frustrated with his play,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie
said. ``He's put up terrific numbers, and he's still mad at
himself. That makes him a terrific player.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's genius might lie in being so straight-faced that Duke
fans called him ``Spock'' when he was starring for Wake Forest. But
for all the Capt. Kirk overacting in the NBA, the stoic 7-footer
might be as confident as any rim-bender or fist-pumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just who I am,'' said Duncan, who shares little about
himself. ``I've never been someone who gets up and down. You have
to control your emotions out there so you never get too high or too
low. It's worked for me so far, so I'm not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that even keel has helped Duncan handle the load
that has been given him. So has honing his simple moves to the
point where the Spurs can rely on them every night.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan starts everything with unfailing loyalty to the basics,
from drop steps and short jump shots off the backboard to keeping
the ball high and out of the reach of quick-handed guards.
</P>
<P>
   His moves can be uncovered in the drills junior high coaches
teach their big-men-to-be, even in grainy George Mikan films. But
when perfected with obvious athletic talent, soft, sure hands and
surprising strength, they remain unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys like Michael. Even though you know what
he's going to do, you can't stop him,'' Perdue said. ``As hard as
you try, and you know it's coming, it's just impossible. Sometimes
that's the most frustrating thing. You watch the tape, and you
think, `Drop step, dunk, jump shot off the backboard. I think I can
get him.' Thirty points later, they're shaking their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, all the greats built their games from that
foundation, then soared where their talent would take them. And by
the end of Jordan's career, when he removed some of the flash to
become more efficient, there was a growing sense that there was
more to him than boundless ability. Duncan merely came in with the
style stripped away, building his game solely on substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's something that's tough for the average fan or even
the media to understand,'' says Kerr. ``You have to really, really
understand the game to understand how fundamentally sound a player
is, especially a guy like Michael. All you see is his dunking over
everybody, but you don't see how he got open to catch the ball, his
footwork, his hands, his shooting ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Tim has. Tim is as fundamentally sound as any big
man I've ever seen. He has unbelievable footwork. If you think of
the best players of all time, they all had a strong fundamental
base. Bird. Magic. Michael. Footwork. Passing. Shooting. Those are
the basics of the game. Then you add to that phenomenal talent.
Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the game. We need a lot more players like Tim.
He still might not get the recognition from the average fan. If you
polled the average fan out there, `Who would you start a franchise
with?' it would be Shaq. If you polled 29 GMs around the league, it
would be Tim, maybe unanimously. Those guys understand the
importance of great hands, great footwork, knocking down the free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the game, as great as Shaq is, Tim's better. He
may not be as physically gifted. But he's a better basketball
player. And I love Shaq. I'm a big Shaq fan. But Tim is the best in
the game. And he's in his second year.''
</P>
<P>
   The time is right for a player with no visible ego, no
entourage, no assistants around to answer the cell phone. In the
first post-lockout season of the NBA, where excess now seems almost
offensive, the time is right for a star whose approach to his sport
seems unchanged from when he was a swimmer and his stage was St.
Croix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic,'' Kerr said. ``Everybody is saying athletes want
to be stars. Tim is the most down-to-earth NBA superstar I've ever
seen. If anybody knocks him for not being Mr. Accessible, catering
to the media, it's a pretty big contradiction. Everybody knocks
guys for being Mr. Hollywood. He's a great player, a great guy,
down to earth. He just does his own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He does at least have a passing interest in his reputation. Told
of his first Sports Illustrated cover, which labeled his triumph
over the Lakers ``Substance over Style,'' Duncan said: ``Sweet.''
He almost smiled.
</P>
<P>
   But just as he might now be celebrated for his unadorned
professionalism, for his lack of ego and selflessness, if Duncan is
to become the league's top young celebrity, a backlash might
follow. Aloof and relatively inaccessible to the media, he would
seem able to carry the league's flag only so far.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, Bryant and the Lakers, the antithesis of Duncan's
no-frills flight, could still click and catch Duncan and the Spurs.
And the more spectacular styles of Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett or
Bryant will surely give them rooters, especially if they are to be
compared to a straight-faced 7-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain said no one roots for Goliath. And Duncan shows
little interest in making it easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time when they build you up and a time when they
tear you down,'' Robinson said. ``He's going to be a great player.
But you have to know it's all going to be temporary. He has to
enjoy doing what he's doing. That's the key. You enjoy that by
winning and playing together. Fortunately, we have a team that can
do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get wrapped up in yourself too much. It will
get to him some when it happens. He has a great personality for it.
He handles things well. But it will happen. If you can get the
success and win and do the things he needs to do, it (the backlash)
will be less.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Duncan seems perfectly suited for whatever comments
come. He has shown so little interest in winning praise, it seems
difficult to imagine him caring about deflecting criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great head on his shoulders,'' said Spurs guard Avery
Johnson. ``He'll stay focused. He's not a guy that grew up wanting
to be in Nike tennis shoes. He keeps everything in perspective. He
could care less if he does commercials. It's nice; financially,
it's rewarding. He won't think twice about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the media tears him down or builds him up, it really
doesn't faze him. He could care less. He's a pretty levelheaded
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the NBA could probably use such a leading man in the
post-Jordan era, assuming that role is won on the court. The game
has suffered when Jordan pretenders ignored the fundamentals to
practice the frills. If a star emerges whose highlights are basics,
he could do as much for the game in his time as his predecessors
did in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talked about ambassadors of the league, they
talked about guys who had flash, style,'' Perdue said. ``I was
reading about Vince Carter and his rookie season, but he was known
more for his spectacular dunks than his skill level. Tim is known
for his skill level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about driving by playgrounds and kids are
practicing up-and-unders and dunks and fancy layups, and nobody is
practicing their jump shot. Jump shooting is almost a lost art. You
talk about somebody being old school, he is definitely old school.
He may not dress like it, but he plays like it. Someday, we'll
drive by a playground and kids will be practicing Tim Duncan
moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan hasn't had that kind of impact yet. But if his rise is
made complete, the NBA might just get what it needed most, if not
exactly what it originally had in mind when Jordan departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a disciplined guy, a guy who stands for
something,'' says Johnson. ``A professional. You need a guy like
that. He's not about the hype and glitz. He's not trying to sing.
He's not trying to have his own corporation. He's just trying to
play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He entertains in his own way. He's not going to entertain with
hollering and hanging on the rim. You'll be able to appreciate his
Tim Duncanness. A good dose of more Tim Duncan is going to be good
for the league. We need guys like Tim Duncan.''

   The captions for photos NYT16 and NYT17, which moved on Tuesday,
left an incorrect impression about the location of a fire in
Florida. The smoke billowing on the horizon, over a higway in the
foreground, was from a different fire near Venice, in west-central
Florida on the Gulf of Mexico, not in the Okefenokee Swamp, which
is partly in northern Florida. The photos were slugged:

<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Litton Industries Inc., which has been
on the acquisition trail, is expected to report a 12 percent gain
in quarterly earnings today on strong performance from its
information systems and shipbuilding units.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of eight analysts by First Call Corp. puts Woodland
Hills-based Litton's earnings at $1.10 a share for its third
quarter ended April 30. The company earned 98 cents a share in the
1998 third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pegged Litton to turn in a strong performance early on
and stuck to that prediction throughout the quarter, said Chuck
Hall, First Call's research director. The range is from $1.06 to
$1.11 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's been real steady throughout the quarter.
There has not been any changes in the last two months,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Litton signed a contract to build at least
two 1,500-passenger cruise ships for American Classic Voyages Co.
The deal potentially could be worth $1.4 billion to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Patriquin, an analyst with Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. in Boston,
said most of Litton's quarterly growth will be driven by gains in
the information systems unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting about an 8 percent revenue growth, about 11
percent in operating profit and 12 percent eps (earnings per share)
growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 third quarter, Litton earned $46.8 million on
sales of $1.143 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Litton announced this week that its $528 million bid for
Avondale Industries Inc., a military shipbuilder, has been approved
by that company's board. Litton also is trying to buy Newport News
Shipbuilding Inc. for $1.9 billion, a combination opposed by the
Pentagon.

   The captions for photos NYT16 and NYT17, which moved on Tuesday,
left an incorrect impression about the location of a fire in
Florida. The smoke billowing on the horizon, over a higway in the
foreground, was from a different fire near Venice, in west-central
Florida on the Gulf of Mexico, not in the Okefenokee Swamp, which
is partly in northern Florida. The photos were slugged:

 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Helen McLaughlin was 73 when she died from what her
relatives call a mixup in prescription drugs. In death, she joined
a group that is causing increasing anxiety among health care
experts and federal regulators: the tens of thousands of Americans
who are killed each year not by illness, but by medication intended
to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Mrs. McLaughlin, a widow who lived with her two
daughters in Elizabeth, N.J., walked into the pharmacy department
of the local ShopRite supermarket to fill a prescription for
chlorpromazine, an anti-psychotic medication. She walked out,
according to her son Charles and Michael S. Smith, a lawyer who is
suing ShopRite on behalf of her family, with a drug that has a
nearly identical name, chlorpropamide, which is used by diabetics
to lower their blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly serious mistake, the family said. Mrs.
McLaughlin suffered from diabetes, and was already taking
medication for it. She took the new drug in addition to her regular
pills for three weeks when she was admitted to Elizabeth General
Medical Center with dangerously low blood sugar. That, Smith said,
unleashed a cascade of health problems for his mother, including
stomach ulcers and a drug-resistant bacterial infection. She died
on May 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the lawsuit, officials at ShopRite, a subsidiary of
Wakefern Food Corp, declined comment. But Charles McLaughlin, who
works as an ultrasound technician at Montefiore Medical Center in
New York, said he finds it difficult to comprehend that his mother
died from a medication she didn't need, or ask for. ``I work in a
hospital,'' he said. ``I know that errors occur. But on the other
hand there has to be some sort of failsafe system to prevent things
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no failsafe system, a fact that is becoming
increasingly apparent to officials at the Food and Drug
Administration, as well as independent drug safety experts. They
say Helen McLaughlin's death highlights a pervasive and dangerous
problem: with more medications on pharmacy shelves than ever
before, and more prescriptions being written, the nation's health
care system is overwhelmed, creating a growing risk that patients
will be killed or hurt by adverse reactions or mistakes.
Regulators, even after approving a new drug, cannot always predict
all potential side effects, or toxic interactions. Many pharmacists
are overworked, and filling more prescriptions with less help. And
with as many as a dozen medications available for any one ailment,
doctors are having a hard time keeping abreast of FDA warnings
about possible risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many new drugs available. And keeping
current with the information that goes with each drug has become
almost impossible,'' said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, undersecretary for
health at the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Washington. ``The
system is just not designed to help the practitioner.''
</P>
<P>
   The true scope of the problem is unknown, in part because
hospitals and doctors are not required to report it.
</P>
<P>
   But recent studies lead scientists to think that prescription
drugs are killing and injuring far more people than previously
believed, and experts estimate two-thirds of the deaths and
injuries could be prevented. Last year, a study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association estimated that 106,000 hospital
patients die and 2.2 million are injured each year by adverse
reactions to prescription drugs, not including cases where errors
are involved. The estimate was the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, in 1995, Dr. Lucian Leape, a health policy
analyst at the Harvard School of Public Health, found that 6.5
percent of patients at two teaching hospitals in Boston had been
injured by their medicines, and one third of these cases involved
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials are convinced the danger is growing. In a recently
released 150-page report, they called for pharmacists, doctors,
hospitals and drug companies to work together to create ``a new
framework'' for cutting down on the risks from the drugs the agency
approves. On Tuesday, meanwhile, the FDA put a new rule into
effect: requiring the manufacturers of some especially risky drugs
to distribute explicit warning pamphlets to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being harmed and some of the harm is preventable,''
said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research. ``All of these things are raising alarm
bells in people's minds that there is a potential for even more
serious problems. And the problem is pretty serious right now.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESSURES So Many Drugs, So Little Time
</P>
<P>
   That medications pose a public health threat is, in a sense,
testimony as much to medicine's success as its failure. As Leape
put it, ``Adverse drug events are a disease of medical progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical manufacturers are discovering new ways to treat
more diseases and conditions, from impotence to diabetes. The FDA,
long criticized as moving too slowly on drug applications, is now
approving products at a record-setting pace. And patients are
living longer with illnesses that could not be treated before.
</P>
<P>
   More prescriptions are being written, not only because there are
more drugs but because the population is aging; the elderly take
more than one third of all drugs that are prescribed. In 1992,
according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, 2.03
billion prescriptions were dispensed in retail pharmacies; by last
year, the figure was up to 2.78 billion. By the year 2005, the
association estimates, it will be 4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies, pressed like other health care providers by the cost
controls of managed care, are struggling to fill the higher volume
of prescriptions in less time, and with less help. ``I worked
12-hour days, and if you get to the bathroom once a day, you're
fortunate,'' said Adle Joseph, a pharmacist at the Leesburg
Pharmacy in Leesburg, Va., who spent 35 years with the Rite Aid
chain before retiring last year to join a slower-paced, independent
store. ``The conditions are just not conducive to good safety.''

 WASHINGTON: good safety.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Washington state, for instance, an investigation turned up
numerous prescription errors and lax safety procedures at Rite Aid
stores last year; documents provided by the state Board of Pharmacy
show that pharmacists complained that ``long work hours and
inadequate staffing'' contributed to their mistakes. The company
said only a few of the errors posed any danger to patients; it
settled the administrative charges with a $50,000 payment and
promised to make sure its procedures follow state law.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, too, are overloaded. Two decades ago, physicians
familiarized themselves with a relatively small pharmacopeia and
prescribed the same drugs again and again. Today, the choice of
medicines rests not only with doctors, but also with managed care
companies, which buy drugs in bulk to reduce costs and list them on
formularies that can change each month.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Providence,
R.I., Dr. Jeannette Chirico-Post, the hospital's chief of staff,
says she is concerned about how complicated prescribing drugs has
become. ``We have more drugs at our fingertips,'' she said, ``and
the potential for drug-drug interaction is far greater than we saw
10 or 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And while computer technology is available to help physicians
avoid mistakes and screen for dangerous combinations of drugs, few
hospitals and even fewer private doctors have it. Those that do say
the systems can produce so many false alarms they are nearly
impossible to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using medications in ways that we never used them
before,'' said Michael Cohen, president of the Institute for Safe
Medication Practices, a nonprofit organization investigates
prescription drug errors. He said the mistake in Mrs. McLaughlin's
case could have been avoided with clearer labeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies aren't keeping up with the times and
labeling their products as safely as they need to,'' he said. ``We
haven't developed the technology to prevent patient harm or we are
not incorporating it, because we say it's too expensive. We are not
investing the resources that we need to protect patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Sanchez lost his life for lack of such safeguards. He was
born healthy on Oct. 15, 1996, in a community hospital in a Denver
suburb. His mother had a history of syphilis; a neonatologist
prescribed a long-acting form of penicillin to keep the baby from
becoming infected. But a series of mistakes, uncovered by Cohen's
institute, which examined the death at the hospital's request, took
the newborn's life.
</P>
<P>
   A pharmacist misread the doctor's handwriting and delivered 10
times the proper dose, leading the nurses to confuse the medicine
with a newer generation of drugs that are administered differently.
Miguel's medication, a milky white suspension, was supposed to be
injected in the thigh muscle; typically, only clear liquids are
given in the veins. But the baby's nurses worried that such a huge
injection into a muscle would hurt the tiny infant. To complicate
matters, some new opaque suspension drugs had been approved by the
government for intravenous use. The nurses checked two medical
texts to see if the drug could be given intravenously, and found no
warnings against it. So they injected Miguel's penicillin into a
vein in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   The baby had a heart attack and died an hour later. ``It was
devastating,'' said Pat McCadden, the risk manager at Centura St.
Anthony North Hospital in Westminster, Colo., where Miguel spent
his brief life. ``Everybody had a hard time believing this could
happen, because these were very knowledgeable, experienced
nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ERRORS: Medication Threat Often Lies in Use
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of ways that people can be killed or injured
by their medicine. Outright mistakes, as occurred with Miguel, are
one; some experts say these medication errors account for a third
to one half of all cases. Known side effects, including dangerous
interactions between drugs, are another. Unforeseen side effects,
which do not turn up in testing but become apparent after a drug
comes into widespread use, are a third.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, these are known as ``adverse drug events,'' and in
recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has been troubled
by a string of them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Posicor, a high blood pressure medicine, was withdrawn from
the market last year, but not because the drug was harmful on its
own. Rather, Posicor became lethal in combination with a long list
of other drugs, so many that the FDA felt that doctors and
consumers could not keep abreast of the risks. FDA officials said
that 24 people taking Posicor in the 11 months it was on the market
had died, and that two or three of those deaths were directly tied
to Posicor, although a spokeswoman for Roche Laboratories of
Nutley, N.J., the drug's maker, has said ``no causal link'' was
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   _ The diabetes drug Rezulin, approved two years ago, can cause
liver damage, which prompted the FDA to issue repeated warnings to
doctors to closely monitor patients taking it. But an agency
investigation found that doctors were not listening; only 2.7
percent of patients taking Rezulin for three months were being
monitored according to the agency's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in March, the FDA and Rezulin's manufacturer,
Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains,
N.J., agreed that 43 people had suffered acute liver failure that
was possibly due to the drug; of these, 28 died. A panel of
independent scientific experts has recommended that the drug be
prescribed only to patients who do not respond to other therapy.

 WASHINGTON: other therapy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ The best-selling arthritis drug Celebrex, which was approved
by the FDA in January and has already been prescribed to more than
2 million people, is repeatedly being confused by doctors and
pharmacists with two other drugs: Cerebyx, an anti-seizure
medication, and Celexa, an antidepressant. The FDA has already
received 41 reports of the wrong prescription being filled; in one,
an 81-year-old woman wound up taking two antidepressants for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any serious injuries, thank goodness,'' said
Dr. Jerry Phillips, the FDA official who keeps tabs on medication
errors, referring to Celebrex. He is trying to persuade Monsanto
Co., which manufactures the drug, to change Celebrex's name, a
difficult task given that the company has spent tens of millions of
dollars advertising and promoting the medication.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Phillips said, the FDA is planning to install
computer software that will analyze proposed drug names to avoid
such confusion in the future. But at least one expert, Leape of
Harvard, said the agency should have taken that step years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA has essentially focused on the safety of the product,
whereas the major threat has to do with safety of use and misuse,''
Leape said. ``Their point of view has been that it is safe and
effective when used as directed, and the directions are on the
label, so read it. We have come to them repeatedly and said, `That
is not enough.' People make mistakes, even when it is all there.'''
</P>
<P>
   THE DRUG STORES: Pharmacists Tell Tales of Overwork
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one in health care is as acutely aware of the
potential harm of prescription drugs than pharmacists. Yet
pharmacists say little attention is paid to the difficulties they
face in today's complex health care environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Leesburg Pharmacy is a case in point. On a warm and sunny
afternoon recently, half a dozen patients were lined up behind the
counter waiting for their prescriptions to be filled; others milled
about the store. A series of bins with prescription slips and
medications formed a queue along the green formica countertop. All
told, 49 prescriptions were in one stage or another of preparation.
``And this is a slow day,'' said chief pharmacist Greg Chase,
</P>
<P>
   Leesburg is an independent pharmacy and, like pharmacies around
the nation, its profits are being squeezed by lowered
reimbursements from managed care companies. So it makes up the
difference in volume. The store fills about 300 prescriptions per
day, a 50 percent increase from three years ago, according to its
owner, Bruce Roberts. He said that leaves little time for
pharmacists to talk to patients about how to take their medication,
something experts say is essential if drugs are to be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medications have become much more complex, and the
interactions among these complex drugs is greater than it was in
years gone by,'' Roberts said. ``With managed care and pharmacists
being stretched to the limit, there is just no way that you can
provide the service that we really need to be able to educate the
populace as to the dangers of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roberts is trying. He has set up a private consultation
counter for patients who have questions. He has purchased a robot,
at a cost of $175,000, that can dispense the 200 most commonly
prescribed medications, a system that not only frees up pharmacists
to do more counseling but can also cut down on mistakes. And he has
diversified, selling gifts and offering lactation consulting and
other services so that he can afford the salaries of his three
full-time pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   That is a relief to Chase; he came to Leesburg Pharmacy two
years ago from a chain drug store, CVS, where three pharmacists
filled 600 prescriptions per day and often worked 12 hours straight
to do it. ``You've gone four to five hours without even a chance to
go to the restroom,'' he said, echoing the complaints of his
colleague, Joseph, who previously worked at the Rite Aid chain.
``Your mind is fried.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at CVS Pharmacy, which owns 4,100 drug stores in the
United States, and Rite Aid Corp., which owns 3,800 stores, said
they have no evidence that more mistakes are being made. But they
are concerned about workplace pressures, and are taking a number of
steps, including greater use of robots, to ease the burden. As
members of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the
companies are also sponsoring research by a University of
Cincinnati psychology professor who is examining ways to reduce
pharmacy errors.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Tony Grasha, said in an interview that mistakes
occur when psychosocial factors, such as stress at home, combine
with a higher workload. He said his studies show errors are rare,
about 0.5 percent of all prescriptions filled, and that those that
pose a danger to patients are rarer still. But, he said, with the
number of prescriptions growing, mistakes are serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tiny fraction percentage-wise,'' he said, ``but when
you are filling 3 billion prescriptions a year and are anticipating
4 billion by the year 2005, then even a very small percentage is a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state pharmacy officials are also worried. In addition to
the action against Rite Aid in Washington state, officials in North
Carolina are trying to force drug stores to cut back on
pharmacists' hours and to require lunch and bathroom breaks in an
effort to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Board of Pharmacy has also decided that when
a pharmacist who fills more than 150 prescriptions in a day makes
an error, both the pharmacist and the store will be held liable,
and face a possible license suspension or revocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our discipline actions are going up,'' said David Work, the
board's executive director, ``and errors are a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers are an important part of the pharmacy safety net, but
they have limitations. When Chase typed in the name of a
23-year-old patient who had been prescribed an anti-psychotic
medication, his computer issued a warning that the drug could be
dangerous in combination with another prescription in the patient's
file.

 WASHINGTON: patient's file.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the system presumes that a patient goes to the same pharmacy
every time. And the computers raise so many red flags, without
distinguishing the serious from the benign, that pharmacists grow
weary of them and start to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rite Aid case in Washington, one pharmacist dispensed a
drug with instructions for the patient to take triple the proper
dose, an order that, state officials said, would have resulted in a
computer alert. The message was apparently ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like crying wolf,'' said Susan Winckler, director of
policy and legislation for the American Pharmaceutical Association,
which represents 52,000 pharmacists. ``Some pharmacists call it
`the right hand syndrome.' You just hit the return key when you see
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, said most
pharmacy computer systems need serious improvement. In a recent
study, he asked 307 hospital pharmacies to fill 10 different drug
orders that had killed patients in 1998. Some contained an
overdose. Others called for two drugs that were deadly in
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were outrageous,''he said. Only four of the 307
pharmacies detected all 10 unsafe orders.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTIONS: Easing the Burden With Technology
</P>
<P>
   Deaths and injuries from drugs are vastly underreported, experts
say, in part because doctors fear civil lawsuits or, worse,
prosecution. When Miguel Sanchez died, Adams County, Colo.,
District Attorney Bob Grant brought charges of criminally negligent
homicide against three nurses who cared for the baby. Two pleaded
guilty in exchange for two years' probation; another was acquitted
at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They failed to perceive a substantial risk that the death of a
child would occur,'' Grant said. ``That's criminal negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen disagrees; in the wake of Miguel's death, he said, he
uncovered 54 procedural shortcomings that contributed to the
mistakes that killed the boy, from a hospital pharmacist who lacked
training in how to properly dose drugs for infants to unclear
labeling on the syringe to the textbooks that lacked crucial
warnings. Had any of the 54 been corrected prior to Miguel's birth,
he said, the baby might be alive today.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCadden, the hospital's risk manager, acknowledged the
flaws and said that, under Cohen's guidance, the hospital had taken
a variety of steps: ``Any medication going to the nursery is now
checked by two pharmacists. Two nurses in the nursery will also
double-check the medication.'' The hospital also hired a pediatric
pharmacist, ordered new textbooks and conducted educational
sessions for its staff. And Ms. McCadden, along with the three
nurses, have told their story to other hospitals and at
conferences, in an effort to educate other professionals. ``We've
done a lot of talking,'' Ms. McCadden said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the health care system can be designed to minimize
mistakes and drug dangers is one that has been promoted heavily by
Leape. He said, ``Errors are symptoms of a sick system, not a sick
person. Humans make mistakes. To the extent you can redesign around
that, you can get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the FDA could require pharmaceutical
companies to standardize their drug labels for easy reading.
Medicines could come with bar codes, so that pharmacists could use
scanners to check for the correct name, the same way a grocery
store clerk scans a jar of pickles. Doctors could trade their
prescription pads in for computers.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas are beginning to catch on in some unlikely places.
Two years ago, Kizer of the VA launched a major patient safety
initiative designed, in part, to minimize prescription drug errors
at the nation's 172 veterans hospitals and clinics. Over the next
two years, the department intends to spend $40 million on
technology that will allow doctors to use computers to write their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Providence,
R.I., a stately brick building that, from the outside at least,
looks anything but high-tech, the results are already in evidence.
Here, doctors still walk around with prescription pads in their lab
coat pockets, but only out of habit. They haven't used them since
December, except to prescribe narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   A computer terminal is in every examining room. Wireless
portable units (the hospital has installed optic fiber cables in
the ceiling) are on rolling carts in the hospital corridors. When a
doctor enters a prescription into the computer, it is checked and
double-checked. The machine rejects spelling errors, or overdoses,
and scans the patient's medical record for potentially dangerous
interactions with drugs prescribed by other doctors. The computer
then sends the order electronically to the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis of a similar system at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, Leape found that medication errors were reduced
by 80 percent. But hospitals have been slow to get rid of
prescription pads; according to Cohen, 12 percent of the nation's
hospitals have the capability for computerized prescription
writing, but only 6 percent use it.
</P>
<P>
   That is in part because not all doctors are enthusiastic about
it. When Dr. Chirico-Post, the chief of staff at the Providence VA,
announced that her hospital would be among the first in the
Veterans Health Administration to switch to computers, some doctors
complained that they didn't know how to type. Others argued it
would take too much time. And even those who like the system say it
has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dawna Blake, chief of the hospital's primary-care practice,
said she welcomes the warnings the system issues when she is
writing a prescription. ``It gives you a lot of nice reminders,''
she said. But, she said, the machine does slow her down; she still
takes patient notes by hand, and then enters them into the computer
at the end of the day. ``I can't sit there and enter my notes when
the patient is in the room,'' she said. ``To me, that's a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments did not deter Dr. Chirico-Post. With a hospital
pharmacy filling more than 500,000 drug orders for inpatients each
year, and another 500,000 outpatient prescriptions, she said, the
potential for errors and dangerous interactions is too great to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of working in the operating room,'' she said,
''dispensing a drug, giving a drug to the patient, is one of the
most dangerous things we do.'' &QL;

   Craig J. Thomas stands near the end of DaimlerChrysler Corp.'s
assembly line in Fenton, Mo., and waits for a spindly orange robot
to lower a pickup bed to meet the rest of a Dodge Ram truck. Then,
37 times an hour, 300 times a day, he bolts the bed to the truck
and waits for the next pickup to reach him.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, he got a break from the rhythm of the robots to
celebrate with other workers: The company said it would spend $435
million to expand the Ram factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this industry, the first thing they teach us is it is feast
or famine,'' said Thomas, 25, who has been feasting on overtime for
two years. ``A truck always sells.''
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is feasting, too. Flush with profits from five
fat years and scrambling to keep up with red-hot demand for pickup
trucks and sport utility vehicles, automakers are on an expansion
binge.
</P>
<P>
   In just the past month, DaimlerChrysler, General Motors,
American Honda Motor and Ford Motor have announced plans for
outlays of a stunning $1.54 billion to upgrade factories or build
new ones. Thursday, GM is expected to say it will spend another $1
billion to build a nine-story headquarters for its car engineers in
Warren, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole lot of new capacity,'' said Christopher J.
Benko, managing director of the Autofacts Group, a unit of
PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``There are probably more plants coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe trouble, too. In effect, the industry is gambling that the
economy will keep growing. If it is wrong _ if the economy stumbles
and America's love affair with new cars and trucks cools _ the
industry could be stuck with huge excess capacity, leading almost
inevitably to price wars, skidding profits and labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
   A production glut could also spell trouble for American
automakers, giving a competitive edge to Japanese and European
rivals that are less beholden to labor and thus more able to ride
out a recession by laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
   A recession seems a remote possibility right now, with auto
sales hitting a record 6.9 million in the first five months of this
year, up from a robust 6.4 million for the same period last year.
Still, some analysts say a slump in demand isn't a question of if,
but when.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the market starts to tail off, then you'll start to hear
about some of the more negative aspects and the plant closings,''
said Michael E. Robinet, director of forecast services at CSM
Worldwide, an auto research firm in Northville, Mich. ``There will
be some consolidation that will have to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   While automakers don't know when the economy will head south,
they do know that their rivals are breathing down their necks right
now. So they are focusing on giving customers what they want.
</P>
<P>
   What they want are trucks. In 1990, cars accounted for slightly
more than 67 percent of new-vehicle sales, while light trucks _
which include sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups _
totaled the rest. Last year, the two categories were almost neck
and neck; cars made up 52.4 percent of sales and light trucks 47.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign automakers, which have historically specialized in cars,
are now counting heavily on America's truck fever, partly in
response to the success of Mercedes-Benz's M-class sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, best known for its dependable sedans, plans to invest
$400 million to build a factory near tiny Lincoln, Ala., capable of
producing 120,000 sport utility vehicles or minivans annually
beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will enable us to offer a full range of vehicles in the
U.S., from small cars to light trucks,'' said Koichi Amemiya,
American Honda's president and chief executive. ``This demand has
stretched our production to the limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda has said it plans to invest $30 million to increase
engine-production capacity at its factory in Anna, Ohio, and
another $30 million to add the capacity to build sport utility
vehicles to its factory in Alliston, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, meantime, is spending $500 million to expand its new
$700 million Tundra pickup factory in Princeton, Ind., to enable it
to build large sport utility vehicles there starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, BMW will start building its X5 ``sports activity
vehicle'' at the Spartanburg, S.C., factory where its Z3 roadsters
are now built. BMW spent $600 million to expand the factory, and
plans to hire 1,000 more workers to build the X5.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and GM are hustling to meet demand, too _ or in GM's case,
to create it. GM has seen its United States market share of
passenger vehicles decline from 35.7 percent in 1990 to less than
30 percent last year; in a bid to reverse that slide, the company
said last month that it would pay $450 million to build an assembly
plant in Lansing, Mich., and $250 million for a plant producing
transmissions for commercial trucks in White Marsh, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Those projects come in addition to a $500 million commitment the
company made last year to replace its V8-engine factory in Flint,
Mich., with a V6-engine factory. GM spent $21 billion to upgrade
facilities in the United States between 1994 and 1998, and plans to
invest $28 billion more between now and 2004.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why the expansion drive if sales are flagging?
</P>
<P>
   GM makes no secret that it wants to close inefficient factories
and replace most of them with modern plants that can produce the
same number of cars and trucks using half or a third as many
workers.
</P>
<P>
   To placate its unions, GM has pledged to reduce its work force
through retirements, not layoffs. It has tried to locate new plants
near old ones so current employees can take the new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In total, we will not increase our overall capacity,'' said
Ronald L. Zarrella, president of GM North America. ``While the
Lansing plant is a car plant, the general direction of those
footprint decisions will be to shift more of our mix from cars to
trucks, crossover vehicles and other truck derivatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the big automakers, Ford has avoided building new
factories. Instead, it has managed to squeeze more production from
existing plants, notably by increasing their capacity to switch
from one model to another. Just last week, for example, Ford said
it would assemble a new luxury pickup truck, the Lincoln Blackwood,
at the factory in Claycomo, Mo., where it makes its F-series
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   These expansion announcements come as GM, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler prepare for negotiations this month for a new
three-year labor contract, and the United Auto Workers is certain
to demand the renewal of clauses that protect employees against
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the UAW has failed to organize workers at foreign-owned
plants, and the discrepancy creates an uneven playing field. It
mean lower labor costs for Japanese and European automakers in good
times and bad. While UAW workers are guaranteed 95 percent of their
pay even if they are laid off, companies with nonunion workers
wouldn't face those high costs in the event of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW is fighting the teamsters union for the right to
organize workers at Honda's Ohio factories. Hoping to exploit
Daimler-Benz's acquisition of Chrysler last year, it is also
campaigning to add Mercedes-Benz's American workers to its roster,
as well as those at Freightliner, a DaimlerChrysler unit that
builds heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In top-level meetings in Germany, the union has reportedly
accused the company of antilabor activities and pressed it to
remain neutral as the union continues its drive to represent the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the UAW seeks to expand its influence, labor experts
warn that it must cast aside its old militancy for the sake of its
members' job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real challenge here for labor,'' said David L.
Gregory, a law professor at St. John's University in New York. ``To
be competitive in an international economy, the unions are going to
have to cooperate with management.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's expansion of its Jeep factory in Toledo, Ohio,
is a good example of the pressures the union faces. After Chrysler
said it might close the aging factory and build a replacement
elsewhere, workers _ and the city _ engaged in an extensive ``keep
Jeep'' campaign. In the end, the company decided to spend $600
million refurbishing the old factory and another $600 million to
build a new one next door. But together, the two modern factories
will employ just 4,900 workers, down from 5,600 in the existing
factory, because they will be more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio taxpayers will pay a big piece of the tab: The company won
concessions from the city and state worth $232 million, or about
$47,000 for each job retained. This combination has drawn fire from
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, as an egregious example of
``corporate welfare'' because the company won concessions in
exchange for downsizing. Nader also questioned whether residents
whose homes are to be demolished to make room for the factory were
fairly compensated.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler makes no apologies. ``The city has worked with
the neighbors and I think everybody is happy now,'' said Gary L.
Henson, senior vice president of manufacturing for DaimlerChrysler.
``We're going to continue to reduce our costs as we modernize.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the company's trucks have proved so popular, its
Chrysler unit has added 15,000 workers during the 1990's. At its
Dodge Ram Quad Cab factory in Fenton, DaimlerChrysler will receive
$10 million to $20 million in aid from the State of Missouri for
worker training, but no tax breaks in exchange for its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an understatement to say that DaimlerChrysler's
investment has cheered the workers in Fenton. ``We've been through
a plant closing, the old-timers have, and we know what that
means,'' said Randy Glover, president of UAW local 136. ``Thank God
people can't get enough of this Dodge truck.''

WEATHER IS PRIME SUSPECT IN CRASH

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines Flight 1420 left Dallas/Fort Worth Airport at
10:40 p.m. Tuesday, about a half-hour after weather watchers
learned about a line of powerful thunderstorms 40 miles southwest
of Little Rock and moving east.
</P>
<P>
   The plane and the storms were headed for Little Rock. When they
met, the results were disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators piece together what caused Flight 1420 to crash
just before midnight Tuesday, a key question may be what the crew
knew about the storms that were pelting .MDNM/the runway at Little
Rock National Airport with hail, rain and high winds.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:25 p.m., about 25 minutes before the plane touched down,
the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning
for the area around Little Rock, meaning that hail and winds of 57
mph, or 50 knots, were possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone told me there were 50-knot gusts at the airport, I
would be leaving town,'' American's chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said
at a news conference. ``I don't know what the (wind) maximums are
on the MD-80. On the airplane I fly, the 767, it's 32 knots.''
</P>
<P>
   A McDonnell-Douglas spokesman said the MD-80 that crashed was
rated to land in 10 knots of tail wind, 25 knots of head wind and
30 knots of cross wind, or about 34.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday night what wind speeds Flight 1420
encountered as it approached the runway. A 75-mph gust was recorded
about five minutes before the plane touched down, but the weather
service said winds may have been around 32 mph about the time of
landing.
</P>
<P>
   George Black, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board, said investigators want to know what the pilot, Richard
Buschmann, was told about the approaching storm and the
deteriorating conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they
have to base that on the information they have,'' he told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Selfen, marketing director for the International Airline
Passenger Association, said that air traffic controllers generally
do a good job of passing weather information to pilots, but that
the system could have broken down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if the weather was as bad as we're hearing ... the
controllers at the airport should have made the pilots aware,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous systems warn pilots about impending weather, said Tim
Forte, a former federal investigator who teaches aviation at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   At D/FW Airport, American's dispatchers would have given the
pilot an update on the weather in Little Rock before the plane took
off, then updated the pilots along the way. The crew also had a
cockpit weather radar capable of detecting thunderstorms, Forte
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock airport is equipped with a low-level wind shear
alert system that uses sensors to detect wind gusts and wind shear,
FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquett said. It notifies air traffic
controllers visually and audibly of potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Wednesday whether the system alerted the
controllers to the wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/The air traffic controllers in Little Rock should have
given the pilots the latest conditions on the runway as the plane
approached the airport, Forte said. Officials haven't said publicly
what the air traffic controllers told the crew, except that the
plane was cleared to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There shouldn't be a lack of information at all,'' Forte said.
``Clearly, in the investigation, they're going to look at the
decision-making model and try to determine what else was going on
on that flight deck that we might not be aware of yet that would
allow him to make a decision to land in what appears to be pretty
severe meteorological conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no doubt that the weather was bad.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorms stretched from 45 miles north of the airport
to the Oklahoma boarder in southwest Arkansas, National Weather
Service meteorologist George Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:15 p.m., a 60 mph gust hit Hot Springs, 40 miles
southwest of Little Rock, Wilken said. That was followed by the
severe thunderstorm warning at 11:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The information was passed on to the air traffic controllers via
computer, Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have had the severe thunderstorm warning in hand,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm bore down on Little Rock, the weather service
tracked it on two Doppler radar systems: one in Little Rock and one
in Fort Smith, about 110 miles northwest of the airport. A third
weather service staffer passed the updates to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:32, the weather service recorded a 65-mph gust at its
office seven miles north of the airport. At 11:45, a 75-mph gust
was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, when the plane crash-landed, the peak winds
were about 32 mph, hail was falling and it was raining so hard that
the weather service recorded four-tenths of an inch in three
minutes, Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes after the plane landed, the strongest winds were
recorded, an 87-mph gust, Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and
the airline will review the data from the airport radar and the
weather service radar, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have access and listen to the tower recordings, the
cockpit recordings,'' American Vice President Bob Baker said.
``Until we get a full picture of the weather, we can't speculate as
to whether it (weather) was a part of this, to what degree, or even
what the weather really was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the best anyone could do was ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   American's pilots ``to a man'' would not try to land in 57-mph
winds, said Drew Engelke, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots
Association, who flies an MD-80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to know that that particular wind is out of the
capability of the aircraft,'' he said. ``Ideally, you would expect
that information to be relayed to the pilot. That's a question
that's going to have to be found out.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Seeking offense, Klesko's in left
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves keep searching for an answer in left field,
and Ryan Klesko might be it again.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko, who moved from left field to first base in spring
training because of Andres Galarraga's illness, moved back to left
field Wednesday as the Braves continued to try to fill an offensive
void.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Nixon never got untracked as an everyday left fielder _
he's hitting .194 _ and his replacement, Gerald Williams, hit .194
(14-for-72) in May, .182 (12-for-66) as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox said he made the move to get Randall Simon
some at-bats. He also indicated he plans to use Williams in left
field and Klesko as the designated hitter this weekend against
Boston. If Klesko stays in left field, Simon and Brian Hunter would
platoon at first base. The Braves were 6-3 with Simon and Hunter
sharing first base while Klesko was hurt in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever's best for the team,'' Klesko said of returning to
the position he played his first five full seasons in the majors.
``As long as they don't make me catch. I'll play anywhere.''
Simon's turn
</P>
<P>
   Simon welcomes some at-bats. In May, he went 0-for-8 with no
RBIs, all as a pinch hitter. That followed his .379 batting average
in April, when his pinch hit at-bats were scarce but he made seven
starts at first when Klesko had the sore hamstring. Smoltz update
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz got a good report from team orthopedist Joe Chandler
the morning after his first start since coming off the disabled
list with an inflamed elbow. Smoltz picked up his sixth win with
six scoreless innings. Said Chandler: ``Today we looked to see if
there was fluid, and it looked good. There was no fluid and no
soreness.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss hopes to return this weekend from the strained
quadriceps that has kept him out of the lineup since last Thursday.
``There's still a little something there,'' Weiss said. ``But it's
certainly better (than a similar injury last year).'' ... In the
first release of the All-Star balloting, Chipper Jones is the
closest Brave to winning a starting spot. He has received 46,527
votes, which trails only Arizona's Matt Williams (51,865) among
third basemen. Other Braves figuring in are Javy Lopez (33,218), a
distant third behind Mike Piazza (122,392) at catcher; and Weiss,
who is third at shortstop with 30,823 votes behind Rey Ordonez
(60,779) and Barry Larkin (60,161). Andruw Jones (27,777) is
seventh and Brian Jordan (23,847) 11th among outfielders.

 &HT;    Stahl, Faison selected 18th, 20th
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The baseball draft started 25 minutes late because of
a problem with the conference call. But once it began, Richard
Stahl and Vince Faison didn't have to wait long Wednesday to find
out where they had been selected.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, a 6-foot-7 left-hander from Newton High School in
Covington, was taken by the Baltimore Orioles with the 18th pick in
the first round. Faison, a two-sport standout from Toombs County
who has signed a football scholarship with Georgia, was selected by
the San Diego Padres at No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Redan High School shortstop Brandon Phillips was the next
Georgian taken, going to the Montreal Expos in the second round
with the 57th overall pick. He hit .630 with 14 homers as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Once the draft started, it took less than 15 minutes to complete
the first round. Stahl got a call shortly after 1:30 p.m., then
returned to school for his British literature class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 24 hours have seemed like a week,'' said Stahl, who
was 11-0 as a senior. ``I've been very nervous. The Orioles were
one of the teams that I was hoping would draft me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second year in a row that two high school players
from Georgia were picked in the first round. Last year, Corey
Patterson of Harrison was taken No. 3 by the Chicago Cubs and
received a record draft bonus of $3.7 million. Sprayberry's Rick
Elder, also an outfielder, was taken by Baltimore with the 26th
pick and received $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl and Faison are expected to receive bonus offers of more
than $1 million each. Last year, the No. 18 pick got $1,075,000 and
the No. 20 selection $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Faison told the Padres and others teams that he would forsake
college football if taken in the first round. His father, Vincent
Sr., is waiting for a second kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to turn down first-round money,'' said Faison, an
outfielder who hit .531 as a senior. ``My family will be
financially secure, and my dad will get some of the best medical
attention that's offered.

 &HT;    Money, schedule hot topics
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ While the 1999 U.S. Women's Open
Championship will get its fair share of media attention this week,
the golfers will earn half what their male counterparts will at
Pinehurst, N.C., June 17-20.
</P>
<P>
   The total purse is $1.75 million and the champion will take home
$315,000. Compare that with $3.5 million and $625,000 for the men.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the women probably won't even get the same level of
press coverage that they're enjoying this week. The 2000 Women's
Open at Merit Club in Libertyville, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, will
bump up against the British Open at historic St. Andrews June
20-23.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Capouch, chairwoman of the U.S. Golf Association Women's
Committee, said the USGA isn't concerned about the scheduling
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is going to have that much of a bearing on
the Women's Open,'' she said, ``because we are in a great market
area, and we are standing on our own now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there has been criticism that the women play their
biggest event in relatively isolated areas. Capouch announced that
the 2002 Women's Open will be held in Hutchinson, Kan., at Prairie
Dunes, another small venue in the same vein as Old Waverly and last
year's site, Kohler, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding prize money, Capouch said the USGA is ``working as
hard as it possibly can to do everything we can to make the purse
higher,'' but she doesn't see equal prize money happening soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equal treatment to the USGA,'' she said, ``is conducting a
national championship of high quality, and we do the same treatment
for the women at the Women's Open as we do for the men at the Men's
Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain, rain, go away
</P>
<P>
   A torrential storm Wednesday afternoon terrified people who had
parked their cars in nearby fields, but didn't faze officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course drains really well,'' said Capouch, no doubt
relieved to field a question unrelated to prize money and
scheduling. ``The course is in perfect condition, and they did not
have a lot of rain prior to last weekend, so I think the course can
stand water.''
</P>
<P>
   The early forecast for today is warm and humid with a chance of
afternoon thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Park and drive
</P>
<P>
   Grace Park, the 1998 U.S. Women's Amateur Champion, is a long
hitter whose game suits the Old Waverly Course, which is 6,431
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently at the NCAA, I hit a 342-yard (drive),'' said Park,
who won the individual title for Arizona State. ``The wind was
really strong with me, but still that was an official yardage. I've
hit a couple of times over 300, 280, somewhere around there. I
don't really account on how I hit it that long. I guess I've just
been fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, a native of South Korea who moved to Hawaii when she was
12, gained entry to the Open based on her amateur title. She'll
turn pro after this week.
</P>
<P>
   Button up
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, her first year as a pro, Nancy Lopez finished second to
Hollis Stacy in the Women's Open. She doesn't blame her driving or
her putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was because my zipper was busted on my pants that
final day,'' she said.

 &HT;    Karrie Webb: Getting a new grip on putting, LPGA Tour
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ Switching to a cross-handed putting grip has
made Karrie Webb a winner in four tournaments this year and the
favorite in the 1999 U.S. Women's Open that starts here today.
</P>
<P>
   But persistent questions about whether she can win her first
major have made the Australian just a little cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered these sort of questions at Dinah Shore this year,''
said Webb, who has won 13 tournaments since bursting onto the LPGA
scene in 1996 with a record $1 million rookie season. ``Coming into
the Dinah Shore (where she placed third), I only played 12 majors.
This is my 14th major that I have ever played in. I have a long
career ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Old Waverly be the Webb site? This year, she has finished
in the top 10 in all 11 of her tournaments and leads the LPGA with
$738,066.
</P>
<P>
   She has won from the front and from behind, after trailing by as
many as five strokes. Her 26-under par at the 1999 Australian
Ladies Masters in February set an LPGA record.
</P>
<P>
   Webb leads the LPGA in scoring average at 68.49, a full stroke
better than Annika Sorenstam of Sweden. She also leads the tour in
rounds under par (33 of 39), top 10 finishes (11 of 11), birdies
(192) and greens in regulation (.789).
</P>
<P>
   In the Open, she will be challenged by 149 other players,
including fellow Aussie Rachel Hetherington, Juli Inkster and Meg
Mallon, each of whom has won twice this year; veteran Nancy Lopez,
who has been the runner-up at the U.S. Open four times; Sorenstam;
and defending champion Se Ri Pak of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play another 15 years, I have 60 more chances at winning
a major,'' said Webb, 24, who shares her hometown with Greg Norman.
``I'm not in a hurry to win a major. If I win one, that is going to
be great. I think it goes along with winning your first tournament
ever: I think sometimes you don't really know what you are doing,
and everything falls into place and you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Webb has all of the tools to help that happen. Laura
Davies has called her the world's best ball-striker. After she won
the Mercury Titleholders on May 10, Mallon said, ``It looks so easy
that you forget how awesome it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning a major has never looked easy. Dottie Pepper, who is
paired with Webb in the first two rounds, said she thinks there is
undue emphasis on winning majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have often said I thought (Jack) Nicklaus started this whole
major rah-rah, because he built his schedule around majors and
evaluated his career on majors,'' said Pepper, who won the Dinah
Shore to end a three-year winless streak. ``Majors do not make a
career. Ask Andy North. He has won two Opens and that was about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper said she focuses more on getting into the Hall of Fame.
``I've got to believe that that is one of Karrie's goals as well,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who is not one of the most charismatic or talkative
players on the Tour, is characteristically understated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think my overall game has been pretty consistent,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But her putting has improved markedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a 10-, 15-footer in the first couple of holes,''
Webb said, ``it takes the pressure off trying to hit it close for
the rest of the day, because you sort of have the feeling that you
are going to make them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really put a lot of pressure on myself to hit the
ball close because my putting has been so good.''
</P>
<P>
   In her three U.S. Opens, Webb has not played well in the first
two rounds. Her best finish was fourth in 1997. She tied for 31st
last year. ``I definitely lost my patience with nine holes to go,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a season that would be stellar by most players'
standards, but it was sub-par for her. She won twice and was fourth
on the money list, but she was overshadowed by Sorenstam and Pak.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first two years, it was pretty hard to accept
anything less,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   So, she went home to Australia and changed her putting grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not think I had much to lose,'' she said. ``Years back,
in the mid-1980s, if a player went cross-handed, you thought it was
the end of her career because of the yips.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's career is far from over.

 &HT;    S. African anti-bias group got $25,000 from Atlanta Olympic
group
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Among the gifts made by Atlantans in their effort to
land the Summer Olympics, one stands out in documents released
Wednesday: $25,000 to the South African Non-Racial Olympic
Committee in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, founded in 1963, was dedicated to creating an
integrated South African Olympic team at a time when blacks were
barred from participating, its former president said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the country's team remained segregated, the committee,
known by the acronym SAN-ROC, worked to have it barred from
participating in the Olympics _ an effort which succeeded in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But SAN-ROC was not a political organization, said poet Dennis
Brutus, its first president until the late 1980s, in a telephone
interview from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``SAN-ROC was not formed to challenge the government,'' he said.
``Our concern was strictly with sport and the observance of the
Olympic charter.''
</P>
<P>
   Brutus said he did not know how the Georgia Amateur Athletics
Foundation money was used.
</P>
<P>
   The president of SAN-ROC in 1990 was Sam Ramsamy. In the 1990s,
as apartheid ended and an integrated South African Olympic team was
created, SAN-ROC merged with other groups to become the National
Olympic Committee of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Young, co-chairman of the Georgia Amateur Athletics
Foundation, said the donation to SAN-ROC was important because
South Africa was preparing to rejoin the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many leaders of Atlanta's bid group were passionate about what
South Africa meant to the Olympic Games,'' he said, ``and our
financial support for its efforts was a small means by which we
could share our passion.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report to the U.S. House Commerce Committee, the GAAF
said the grant was meant ``to help speed the destruction of
apartheid in South Africa.

 &HT;    Line between gift, bribe not crossed, leaders say
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympic leaders Billy Payne and Andrew Young,
co-chairmen of the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, met with
Olympics beat reporter Melissa Turner on Wednesday in the World
Trade Club at the downtown Sun Trust building for a
question-and-answer session on the GAAF's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have steadfastly denied that the Atlanta bid committee
did anything that violated the International Olympic Committee
rules on gift-giving and visits by IOC members. Does this report
mean you are changing your tune?
</P>
<P>
   Payne: The $200 rule was a guideline established to protect bid
cities from spending too much money. And the few times we exceeded
it, they were all personalized, specialized gifts _ 50 percent of
the time glass blown by Hans Frabel here to depict the sport that
was important to the IOC members. We were proud to give those
gifts. We believe they do not fit the category whatsoever of trying
to influence voters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where, then, do you draw the line between a gift and a bribe?
</P>
<P>
   Payne: The relativity of how we bid vs. others would certainly
be a beginning point. But we'll let others make those judgements.
</P>
<P>
   Young: You are also assuming influencing a five-step secret
ballot process can be done monetarily.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You characterize these expensive items as simply gifts for
friends. Were these IOC members really close friends?
</P>
<P>
   Payne: These people became in every respect our close personal
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Young: The gifts are seen as kind of mementoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a $1,000 carburetor kit a memento?
</P>
<P>
   Young: It is a memento if you come from a country where you
can't get a carburetor kit. Q: Why would GAAF pick up the cost for
tuition and accommodations for three young African athletes to
train in Atlanta if not to influence the IOC voters in those
countries?
</P>
<P>
   Young: Same reason we had an Olympic training camp in LaGrange.
Same reason we hosted the Angolan basketball team at Clark Atlanta
University. We are sports-loving people that see sports as
important in world development.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't there deserving, talented athletes with Olympic
potential all over? Why select these three?
</P>
<P>
   Young: If we could have gotten half a dozen kids with Olympic
potential, we would have found the money for them.
</P>
<P>
   Payn: A more appropriate answer would be, you do what you can do
and help where you can help. And while it may be small in the
context of the whole world of opportunity, it is demonstrative of
the way Andy has lived his life and been involved in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you not consider paying for the two tennis players from
the Republic of Congo as a favor to (expelled IOC member)
Jean-Claude Ganga?
</P>
<P>
   Young: Yeah. We were in the business of doing favors. But these
were not bribes. Q: Did you ever step back and ask why you were
spending $14,000 for two plane tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Payne: Because that's what the bill was. We were reimbursing
them for the cost of the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever feel you were taken advantage of by these IOC
members?
</P>
<P>
   Payne: We were so in love with the prospect of introducing the
world to the people of Atlanta and we were working within the
bounds of our own sense of fairness and honor and integrity.... and
(we) believe we did so successfully, that the sinister side of the
process never entered our minds for the whole three years. Q: Why
did you not provide this documentation to the IOC when they asked
for it months ago during their investigation of bid cities? Payne:
The IOC didn't ask for details. This asks the big questions and
wants all the details, which is precisely the forum we've been
wanting and have been asking for _ an official inquiry which we are
delighted to cooperate with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe the IOC would act on this information if they
had it?
</P>
<P>
   Payne: There are no gifts on there I believe would be
unfavorably or surprisingly or disgustingly received by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Young: The context we ought to frame this in is, we spent $6.5
million up to the bid. Toronto spent $15 million. Greece spent up
to $30 million. Melbourne spent $25 million. Given the amount of
money spent on the bid, to reach the conclusion that we bought the
Games with the smallest amount of money just doesn't compute.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Salt Lake City spent a great deal of money on gifts. Would
you consider them bribes?
</P>
<P>
   Young: When you (missed out on a previous bid), you become
friends with people, and their circumstances become desperate and
you try to figure out ways to help them. Part of what happened to
Salt Lake is friendships and people taking advantage of
friendships.... I think Salt Lake got a very bad rap. I don't know
what Salt Lake did and what they didn't do. I defend the
scholarships, but I don't defend any financial payments. But the
technical assistance to athletes, the scholarship opportunities
that help to improve the condition of athletics in those countries
(is fine). Q: Wasn't (ousted Salt Lake Olympic Chief) Tom Welch
also just in the business of doing favors for the IOC members?
</P>
<P>
   Young: He was. The difference is Salt Lake turned on people who
won them the Games. Tom Welch beat up his wife and they got angry
with him and wanted to get rid of him. He did some bad things _ bad
things in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you create the ``Atlanta model'' of wooing IOC members,
and then other cities took it to excess?
</P>
<P>
   Payne: Yes, I believe we made wonderfully sincere friendships
and I know we did it with the expenditure of a minimum amount of
dollars for gifts that we have established with this report.
Whether others since us have tried to develop the next iteration of
``let's be their friends'' and also give lavish gifts or the next
version of the Atlanta model, I don't know.

 &HT;    Agents chasing athletes causes league-wide alarm
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ It wasn't on the official agenda, but the subject
of agents was a hot topic Wednesday at the annual SEC spring
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions were prompted by the public admission of former
Florida linebacker Johnny Rutledge that he received $500 a month
from agent William ``Tank'' Black in exchange for a promise to sign
with Black's agency after his college career. Rutledge, a
second-round draft pick of the Arizona Cardinals, also said that
Gator teammates Jevon Kearse and Reggie McGrew took money while
playing in Gainesville. Black denies paying Rutledge, insisting
police forced the player to lie about accepting payments, the
agent's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is attempting to prosecute Black under a Florida law
that prohibits agents from giving money or other benefits to
college athletes who still have eligibility remaining. Black no
longer represents any of the Florida players.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent chills through the coaches here in Destin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares every coach to death, but all you can do is educate
the players on what the rules are,'' said Alabama coach Mike
DuBose.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida police and the NFL Players Association
are still investigating Black, who could lose his certification to
practice as an agent if convicted. The law also calls for a $5,000
fine and a maximum of five years in prison. Florida will report its
findings to the NCAA but faces no penalties because it did not know
the players were getting the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   TV talk
</P>
<P>
   _ The Georgia-South Carolina football game at Columbia on Sept.
11 will be televised on ESPN2. Kickoff will probably be 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Georgia Tech-Navy game at Annapolis will likely be on Fox
Sports Net South and start at noon.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN will televise Lou Holtz's South Carolina debut at N.C.
State on Sept. 4. As a result, Tennessee's opener against Wyoming
on that same day will be on ESPN2. _ Alabama's opener at Vanderbilt
will be on Jefferson-Pilot with a 12:30 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dave Neal has been named the new play-by-play man for the SEC
game of the week on Jefferson-Pilot television. Neal's father, Bob,
is a play-by-play announcer for Turner Sports and was the voice of
SEC football from 1984-91.
</P>
<P>
   The new guy
</P>

   New Georgia basketball coach Jim Harrick said he's been made
very welcome at his first SEC meetings. He also said people are
going to have to quit thinking of the SEC as only a football
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now got three guys in this league who have won national
championships,'' said Harrick, who took UCLA to the title in 1995.
Kentucky's Tubby Smith (1998) and Nolan Richardson of Arkansas
(1994) are the other two. ``Then you look at guys like Cliff Ellis
(Auburn), Eddie Fogler (South Carolina), and Jerry Green
(Tennessee) who have won a lot of games. Then you've got the young
guys like Billy Donovan (Florida) and Mark Gottfried (Alabama).
Man, there are a lot of heavyweight coaches around here. This
league is something.''

 &HT;    (Almost) a United-free environment
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We promise. From this date on _ at least during the
offseason _ this column will try to be Manchester United-free. But
a few loose odds and ends from the scintillating European Cup final
last Wednesday need to be tied up before embarking on a summer
without even mentioning the upcoming wedding of David Beckham and
Posh Spice or any other activity involving the Red Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The day after they shocked Bayern Munich 2-1 with two
injury-time goals, United's value on the London stock exchange rose
by about 30 pence a share, to roughly $797 million. And corporate
beancounters are frothing about United's further merchandising
potential, which surely will solidify its position as the
wealthiest club in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in football, it's all about brand development, not just
in Britain, but around the globe,'' said Nick Batram, London soccer
business analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Hating United, of course, is an equally lucrative pursuit in the
U.K., with ``Manchester United Ruined My Life'' currently high on
the sports best-seller lists. For all the wondrous soccer talents
of Beckham, Ryan Giggs and company, what they represent to the men
in monkey suits also has earned them plenty of derision from
self-proclaimed purists.
</P>
<P>
   On the pitch, United's success is dovetailing into optimism for
England's endangered Euro 2000 hopes. Saturday's Wembley qualifier
with Sweden, the first for new full-time manager Kevin Keegan,
could feature United striker Teddy Sheringham, who along with Ole
Gunnar Solsjkaer came off the bench to get the goals against Bayern
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   They also provided The Sun with perfect fodder for tabloid
headlines:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Subs Sink Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in England.
</P>
<P>
   Euro 2000: Yugoslavs denied visas
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government announced Wednesday it would deny travel
visas to members of the Yugoslavia national team, which is
scheduled to play Ireland Saturday in a Euro 2000 qualifier in
Dublin. UEFA, the European soccer federation, has ignored pleas
from Ireland and the sports ministers of other European nations to
call off the game because of the Balkan nation's actions in Kosovo
that have led to NATO bombings. Yugoslavia was banned from the 1992
European championships and the 1994 World Cup because its war
against Bosnia-Herzegovina ... A full weekend of qualifiers
starting Friday features Moldova at Germany, Belarus at Denmark,
Russia at France, Bulgaria at Poland, San Marino at Spain, Slovakia
at Portugal, Hungary at Romania, Croatia at Macedonia, Italy at
Wales, Czech Republic at Estonia and Scotland at the Faroe Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Atlas-Toluca final
</P>
<P>
   After shocking Cruz Azul 6-0 on aggregate in the Mexican Torneo
de Verano semifinals, Atlas has a chance to do something it hasn't
done in 48 years _ win a league championship. The Guadalajara club
will play host to Toluca tonight in the first leg of the finals,
providing a high-scoring possibility against the favorites. Juan
Pablo Rodriguez and Hugo Castillo scored two goals apiece in the
semifinals for Atlas. Toluca had a tougher time putting Santos
Laguna away 4-3 on aggregate. Enrique Alfaro got the winner in the
75th minute Sunday in a 3-2 triumph. The second leg of the finals
will be shown live at 2 p.m. Sunday on Univision.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Morientes' value rises
</P>
<P>
   If anybody wants to pry midfielder Fernando Morientes from Real
Madrid before his contract expires in 2003, they're going to have
to shell out a minimum of $94.2 million. His buyout clause was
raised from $21.9 million on Tuesday after Morientes scored twice
to give Madrid a 2-1 victory over Mallorca and second place in the
Primera Division.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Mazzone raps ex-boss
</P>
<P>
   Carlo Mazzone walked out Monday as head coach of Bologna, livid
over comments from owner Giuseppe Gazzoni before the Serie A season
wound to a close that he wanted to make a change at the top.
Mazzone made it for him, jumping to Perugia, his 10th Italian club.
... AS Roma finished fourth and fifth in the Serie A the last two
seasons under coach Zdenek Zeman, but that apparently wasn't enough
for him to keep the job. Club management is eyeing former AC Milan
head man Fabio Capello to succeed Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: 'Fairy tale' comes true
</P>
<P>
   With a stadium seating fewer than 10,000 and a budget thin even
by American A-League standards, SpVgg Unterhaching has been
promoted to the Bundesliga. The suburban Munich club sells Guinness
on tap at home games and is flexible with starting times to
accommodate its largely yuppie fan base. ``It's a modern fairy
tale,'' club president Engelbert Kupka exclaimed. England: Watford
gains promotion
</P>
<P>
   Although his club spends far less on salaries than he probably
did on wardrobe during his ``Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'' tour 25
years ago, Watford chairman Sir Elton John said he intends to toe
the line on wages despite moving up to the Premier League. Watford,
which beat Bolton Wanderers 2-0 Monday in a first-division playoff,
is ensured of at least $15 million in Premier League television
revenues. But John and manager Graham Taylor, the former England
coach, say they won't spend it all on player acquisitions.

DRUG SHOWS PROMISE IN COMBATING DIABETES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass.)  (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists reported Wednesday that they had cured diabetes in
monkeys by giving them transplants of insulin-producing cells along
with an experimental drug that prevented rejection of the donor
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are an important advance in diabetes research,
``strikingly different'' from all other previously tested
strategies, and a step toward the ultimate goal of curing diabetes
in humans, the scientists said. Their findings involving the
experimental drug known as anti-CD154 are to be reported later this
year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which
made the paper available ahead of publication.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-CD154 is an artificially made antibody intended to thwart a
key part of the immune system to ward off foreign tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental trials in humans have been approved by ethics
committees and the Food and Drug Administration. They are expected
to begin soon with support from the National Institutes of Health,
said the researchers and the drug's manufacturer, Biogen Inc. of
Cambridge, Mass. But they refused to give details like the starting
date of the trial or the number of patients to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Norma S. Kenyon, the lead author of the report from the
University of Miami and the Navy, said the findings represented the
most promising advance she had seen in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be something that is part of an eventual cure, but we
do not want to mislead people by saying we have a final answer at
this point and I do not want to raise false hopes,'' Dr. Kenyon
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Camillo Ricordi, a co-author of the report, said,
``It is a major reason for cautious optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   The islet cells, which were transplanted into the monkeys, are
the parts of the pancreas gland that produce insulin to control
blood sugar. Islet-cell transplants have been carried out in more
than 300 people in recent years but with limited success, Ricordi
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a year, the graft has functioned in fewer than 35 percent
of such patients and fewer than 10 percent have been able to stop
taking insulin. Thousands more people have received transplants of
the entire pancreas gland, located deep in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   However, a major problem with both islet cell and pancreas
transplants is that each recipient would have to take a combination
of powerful anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life. The
drugs increase the risk of infection and other complications, and
can also promote development of diabetes, even in those without the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   To the Miami team, the most exciting finding was that they could
safely prevent rejection with only one drug, not a cocktail of
drugs. Also, the animals grew normally and suffered no infections
or other complications. Anti-CD154 did not produce diabetes in the
monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments involved seven monkeys that were made diabetic
by removing their pancreas glands.
</P>
<P>
   Seven monkeys received islet cells from other monkeys even
though they were severely mismatched in blood and immune tests. The
cells were injected through a tube into blood vessels leading to
the liver where the cells took up residence. The procedure took
about a half hour and could be done as an out-patient procedure in
humans, Ricordi said.
</P>
<P>
   Six monkeys received injections of anti-CD154 on the day before
the islet cell transplant, that day and four additional times in
the next 28 days. Then the monkeys received anti-CD154 each month
thereafter. Islet-cell function improved over time.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is intended in part to test whether the islet
cells will continue to thrive after anti-CD154 is stopped, a year
after the transplant. Three of the six monkeys that have lived for
such a period no longer require injections of insulin or
anti-CD154. Anti-CD154 will also be stopped when the remaining
three reach the one-year anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Unanswered is the length of time that the recipients of the
anti-CD154 islet cell therapy can stay off insulin, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh monkey served as a scientific control and did not
receive anti-CD154. That animal began rejecting the islet cells six
days after the transplant and needed daily insulin treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In another paper published last week in the journal Diabetes,
Dr. Kenyon's team reported that anti-CD154 could reverse individual
episodes of islet cell rejection in animals if and when they
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Ricordi said islet-cell transplants had survived for more than
eight years in a human liver.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the American Diabetes Association did not return
a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-CD154 has been tested for safety in a small group of
people, a spokeswoman for Biogen said. It has also shown promise
among monkeys who have received kidney transplants.

CENSUS RULING COSTS BUREAU $1.7 BILLION, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has asked Congress for
an additional $1.7 billion that it said would be needed to conduct
the 2000 census as a result of a Supreme Court decision sharply
restricting the Census Bureau's ability to use statistical
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Tuesday to the Republican and Democratic
leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees, Jacob
Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the $2.9
billion that the administration had already requested to conduct
the census next year would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have already said they will spend whatever is
necessary to conduct the census without sampling, which political
analysts estimated would have added to the population counts in
urban areas that tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The additional $1.7 billion would push total spending for the
2000 census to $6.99 billion, dwarfing the $2.6 billion spent on
the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is evidence that in the absence of using modern
statistical methods, it is simply going to cost a lot more to do
the census,'' said Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the spending request, the cost of the census was
expected to be double that of 1990. Increases in the number of
women working outside the home, in immigrants with a limited
command of English and in people alienated from government have
made the American population more difficult and therefore more
expensive to count.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said that even with the additional spending, he could
not guarantee that the 2000 census would improve on the 1990
census, which missed 8.4 million people and double-counted 4.4
million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not more than cautiously optimistic that the 2000 census
might be better than we had in 1990,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said the additional money would mainly be
needed to pay the salaries and provide office space for 860,000
additional census takers. These field workers, or enumerators, will
go door-to-door to count people in households that did not return
mail-in census forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in paying the enumerators and giving them infrastructure
support, you're already over $1.2 billion,'' Prewitt said. ``Then
it's bits and pieces: more telephone lines, more technology
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Under its original plan, the bureau had hoped to keep down the
cost of the census by counting everyone in 90 percent of the
households in each census tract _ an area of about 1,700
households. Field workers would then count everyone in 1 out of 10
households in the remaining 10 percent of dwellings and use that
sample to estimate the number and characteristics of those missed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans objected to the plan, declaring that it was illegal
and would give Democrats a political advantage in the drawing of
boundaries for congressional districts, since many of those who are
missed tend to be minorities who live in overwhelmingly Democratic
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican politicians and advocates, including
then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, sued the administration, and on
Jan. 25 the Supreme Court ruled that the bureau's proposed
statistical sampling could not be used to determine the population
counts for purposes of allocating seats in the House of
Representatives among the states.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court left open whether sampling could be used to
determine population counts used to distribute federal money or to
draw boundaries for congressional or other legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders could not be reached Wednesday for comment on
the administration's figures.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, are gloating over the
Republicans' predicament of now having to finance an increasingly
expensive census as Congress and the administration are struggling
to stay under legally mandated budgetary targets for domestic
spending.  &QL;

 _ SF CHRON  
 Linux Wrestling Microsoft for the Desktop  
 By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Linux already has won the hearts of techies the world over, and
lately, the free operating system has carved out a place on
corporate servers. Could the typical office worker's desktop be the
next stop?
<P>
   Some signs are pointing in that direction, as a growing army of
Linux developers races to overcome obstacles that have kept
mainstream users at a distance. But most analysts say that although
the upstart OS will continue to spread rapidly, it's not likely to
put much of a dent in Microsoft's domination of the desktop, at
least not any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, known by its penguin logo, is an operating system _ the
basic software that controls a computer. Cooperatively developed by
volunteer programmers, it's available free on the Internet though
some companies sell enhanced versions on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   And Linux sales have been booming. Last year, they reached 2.6
million worldwide, up 47 percent from 1997, according to
International Data Corp. And there's no way to track how many more
people are downloading free copies.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers are big enough to make Microsoft take notice: An
internal memo leaked last year from the Redmond, Wash., giant
described Linux and other ``open-source'' software as ``a direct
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Linux has shown up in business and government mainly on
servers _ the big computers that manage networks of PCs _ but now
it's starting to appear on some ordinary computers.
</P>
<P>
   In Medina, Wash., the Seattle suburb where Bill Gates built his
palatial estate, City Hall recently installed a Linux system to
handle storage and retrieval of correspondence and other documents.
``We knew what we needed _ mostly ease of use and reliability _ and
what we could pay, and Linux was the clear choice,'' said Craig
Fischer, deputy city clerk. ''It's working out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Linux supporters still see servers and workstations
as their biggest opportunity, some vendors have their eye on the
broader business market. Consider these recent developments:
</P>
<P>
   _Dell, which in April began offering servers and workstations
with Linux instead of Windows, last week extended the program to
its OptiPlex line of mainstream business PCs. The Round Rock,
Texas, company also eliminated a $20 premium it previously had
charged for systems with Linux preinstalled, and it made Linux
software and information easier to find on its heavily traveled Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell apparently is the only major PC vendor offering
Linux preinstalled, but other heavyweights such as IBM and
Hewlett-Packard recently have pledged various kinds of support for
the alternative OS.
</P>
<P>
   _More than 1 million people have downloaded the Linux version of
Corel Corp.'s WordPerfect 8 word-processing program since the
company made it available free on the Web in December. Clearly
hoping that the Linux wave will help Corel regain ground it lost to
Microsoft in the Windows application market, the Ottawa software
publisher plans to deliver its entire next-generation suite,
WordPerfect Office 2000, for Linux this fall. Its popular graphics
titles are slated to follow early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Two other productivity suites, called StarOffice and Applixware,
already are available for Linux. Like WordPerfect, both can open
and save files in Microsoft Office formats, the standard in most of
corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   _The selection of software for Linux is growing steadily.
Netscape offers a version of its Communicator browser and e-mail
software, and IBM announced plans last month to bring its ViaVoice
speech-recognition technology to the platform. An open-source
project called WINE, with support from Corel and others, is
providing tools to help others ``port'' still more Windows programs
to Linux.
</P>
<P>
   And users who require Windows applications not yet available for
Linux now can run both operating systems at the same time with
VMware, a $199 ``virtual platform'' utility ($75 for noncommercial
use) released two weeks ago by VMware Inc. of Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   _To help nontechnical users switch to the new OS, Linux
distributors and developers are simplifying their installation
programs, which previously required users to enter numerous
technical details, and polishing up point-and-click interfaces that
make the system easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Among nearly half a dozen companies now selling Linux on CD-ROM,
the current leader in user-friendliness is Caldera Systems of Orem,
Utah. Its version, called OpenLinux 2.2, comes with an intelligent
installer that all but eliminates the need for users to understand
much about their hardware. Also included is KDE 1.1, a graphical
user-interface package that lets users choose the look and feel
they like best from among several elegant alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Other Linux distributors are concentrating mainly on server and
technical markets, but they, too, are putting increasing emphasis
on ease of use. Red Hat Linux 6.0, the latest release of the
best-seller among Linux distributions, includes both KDE and GNOME,
a new open-source user-interface alternative created, like Linux
itself, by a far-flung international team of volunteer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   And next fall, Corel plans to put its own name on yet another
``distribution'' _ a bundle of software built around the free OS _
featuring a specially enhanced, Windows-like version of KDE.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  _Linux distributors have been beefing up their support
programs, and they've been joined by startup companies specializing
in tech support, training, compatibility testing and consulting for
the free OS. Previously, cautious corporate technology managers
often refused even to consider Linux because such services weren't
available.
</P>
<P>
   LinuxCare Inc. of San Francisco hasn't yet reached its first
birthday, but it already has won a contract to provide support for
Dell's Linux systems. Just last month, it secured financing from
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers _ the well-known Menlo Park
venture capital firm's first Linux investment.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of these trends has convinced some business
customers that Linux is ready for mainstream desktops.
</P>
<P>
   The Burlington Coat Factory chain, for example, is installing
1,250 Dell systems with Red Hat Linux in some 250 stores in 42
states. They'll be used to run Web-based store-management
applications, including Burlington's Baby Registry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deploying in Windows boxes in 250 stores would be pretty
daunting,'' said Mike Prince, chief information officer of the
Burlington, N.J., company. ``We put Linux out there, and the boxes
run for six to 12 months without rebooting. It just seemed to us a
more stable, scalable and economical environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera's OpenLinux soon will appear on desktop PCs in the
office of the Kern County Superintendent of Schools in Bakersfield.
``We've had it on servers and some of the engineers' desktops for
nearly three years,'' said David Cates, network systems engineer,
``but now with Caldera's 2.2 release, it's finally become a viable
solution for the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the office's current PCs will ``go the way of the dodo''
this year because of Year 2000 problems, he said, and up to 100 of
them will be replaced with low-cost hardware running OpenLinux,
WordPerfect and, to fill any software gaps, VMware.
</P>
<P>
   Several local school districts, according to Cates, also are
planning to switch to Linux on classroom machines; some of them
even plan to install the free OS on their Apple Macs.
</P>
<P>
   While watching such developments with interest, analysts said
they don't expect Linux to sweep the business world, at least in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be proven wrong,'' said Bill Peterson, Linux
market analyst at IDC in Framingham, Mass. ``But I still think the
real opportunity for Linux is the server and will be for several
years to come.'' He noted that Microsoft's domination of the
desktop market is still increasing, while sales of Linux for server
deployment rose 212 percent from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   George Weiss, an analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford,
Conn., put the point more forcefully: ``Linux just isn't a
significant part of the desktop market,'' he said. ``It doesn't
offer compatibility with the wide variety of applications written
for Windows nor does it offer any compelling advantage over what we
have already.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Linux partisans agree up to a point, but they argue
that the situation is changing fast. ``The general view is that
Linux is pretty slick on the server but still needs another six to
eight months in the oven before it's ready for the desktop,'' said
Arthur Tyde III, founder and executive vice president of LinuxCare.
``But there are already plenty of good office applications, and if
you prebuild the desktop for people, they have no trouble using
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next year,'' Tyde said, ``I think you're going to see
explosive growth in this area.''

   LONDON _ After squirming under public criticism of a banking
venture with Pat Robertson, the conservative American television
evangelist, Bank of Scotland said Wednesday that it was reviewing
its relationship with him .
</P>
<P>
   It was the first indication by the bank that the project, which
was once described as something of a coup, might be foundering.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism from depositors began almost immediately after the
bank agreed in March to establish a joint telephone and Internet
banking venture with Robertson, hoping to harness its expertise in
telephone-banking to Robertson's vast data base of followers.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Scotland has a similar deal with the retailer J.
Sainsbury PLC and saw the venture with Robertson as a smart way to
tunnel into the rich U.S. banking market. The bank's executives
vouched for Robertson's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But the depositors, and some Scottish institutions, did not
quite see it that way. About 500 depositors _ none of them big
accounts, according to the bank _ switched their money elsewhere.
Gay rights groups and churches protested the bank's association
with a figure who is depicted as a right-wing fundamentalist. The
local West Lothian district council said it might close a $400
million account with Bank of Scotland in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, matters came to a head.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Scottish disapproval of him, Robertson used an
episode of his television show, ``The 700 Club,'' to call Scotland
a ``dark place'' where ``you can't believe how strong the
homosexuals are.'' The remarks made the front page of The Scotsman,
one of the country's main newspapers, on Monday and were seen as
putting the bank in an untenable position with its heartland
Scottish clientele.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, after the bank announced that Robertson would be
the chairman of the new venture, the Trades Union Congress,
Britain's biggest labor organization, threatened a boycott by
100,000 members using the bank's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Iain Fiddes, director of public relations for Bank
of Scotland, said the contentious ``700 Club'' program had ``now
been received and reviewed.'' ``The Bank is considering its
position, and a statement will be made in due course,'' Fiddes said
in a statement that was issued shortly after Bank of Scotland stock
fell 3.7 percent to close at 850 pence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank will meet with the other shareholders, Robertson
included, in the next few days,'' Fiddes said. Bank executives are
expected to meet with Robertson in Boston on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a potentially lucrative venture that would offer
telephone banking to as many as 50 million television viewers, with
the possibility later of credit cards, loans and mortgages. But
analysts said financial damage to the Bank of Scotland would be
limited if it pulled out of the deal, because it involves no
capital investment or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network in
Virginia Beach, Va., did not immediately respond to telephoned
requests for comment. Its vehicle for the project with Bank of
Scotland is called Robertson Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Scotland is not Robertson's only British business
partner. Last January, he became a non-executive director of Laura
Ashley PLC, the ailing clothing and home furnishing retailer.

 SIDE _ SF CHRON  
 REVIEW/HENRY NORR  &HT;     Replacing Windows With Linux Is Tricky 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
To see just what would be involved in replacing Windows with Linux
as a desktop operating system, I recently tried out two of the
latest releases of the open-source OS, Caldera Systems' OpenLinux
2.2 and Red Hat Software's Red Hat Linux 6.0. I also checked out a
word-processing application, Corel's WordPerfect 8 for Linux. It
was my first experience with Linux or any form of Unix.
<P>
   On the whole, it wasn't encouraging: Trying to install the new
OS on a machine already set up for Windows 98 brought me up against
a long list of frustrations, and I still don't have Red Hat
running. But I did finally manage to get Caldera's OpenLinux
installed, together with WordPerfect 8.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with installing Linux alongside Windows is that
the two systems require different hard drive formats, so they have
to be installed on separate drives or partitions (portions of a
hard disk set up to operate like a separate drive). Caldera's
installer incorporates a special Linux-compatible version of
PowerQuest's PartitionMagic, a popular Windows partitioning
utility. My problem was that I'd already partitioned my hard drives
with the regular Windows version. As a result I already had more
than four partitions, which turns out to be as many as the Caldera
version of the program can handle _ a limitation not mentioned in
OpenLinux's otherwise-excellent manual.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Caldera tech-support rep had explained the problem, I
disconnected one of those drives and tried instead to install
OpenLinux on an unpartitioned 18-gigabyte SCSI drive. The manual
told me I had to defragment it _ a long slow task on a drive that
big. Once that was done, the actual installation went smoothly,
until I got to a screen that asked me to specify whether my
hardware clock runs in local time or Greenwich Mean Time _ a
question I couldn't answer without studying the manual. The
installer also guessed wrong about the specs of my video card,
until I told it to check again.
</P>
<P>
   I did finally get the OS installed on the SCSI drive, but
BootMagic, a utility that was supposed to let me choose between
Linux and Windows 98, apparently couldn't find Linux there. Neither
could the utility that's supposed to uninstall Linux partitions.
</P>
<P>
   So I tried again on a different drive, this one a Castlewood
Orb, a new device that uses 2-gigabyte removable platters. Again
the installation went pretty smoothly, and this time BootMagic saw
the new OS. But when I selected it, OpenLinux reported a ``file
system failure'' leaving me no choice but to reset the machine.
</P>
<P>
   My adventures with Red Hat 6.0 were even more unpleasant. This
distribution includes not one but two partition utilities. But both
turned out to be beyond me _ they kept asking me to do things like
``enter a mount point'' _ a concept the manual acknowledges is
likely to be unfamiliar, but never effectively explains. Suffice it
to say that my many attempts to figure out what they're after have
so far been in vain.
</P>
<P>
   I finally decided to back up and reformat one of my standard
drives so I could dedicate it to OpenLinux. Now it's working pretty
well. The point-and-click interface it comes with is attractive,
fairly easy to figure out, and very customizable. WordPerfect 8 is
a polished and powerful word processor, with all the features of
its Windows sibling. When I went online, Netscape Communicator 4.5
was noticeably faster on Linux than on Windows 98 on the same
400-MHz Pentium II system, or on my 400-MHz Power Mac. But I still
can't figure out how to get the system to recognize my CD-ROM
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: Once it's completely installed, Linux may be
easy enough for just about anyone to use. The trick is getting it
on your machine. If you try it, I recommend that you use a freshly
formatted internal IDE drive. And if possible, arrange to have a
Unix geek on hand to help.  &LR;

U.N. MISSION FINDS `INDISPUTABLE EVIDENCE' OF ETHNIC CLEANSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The leader of a U.N. mission to Kosovo has
found what he called ``indisputable evidence'' of Serbian ``ethnic
cleansing'' of Kosovars, as well as ``ample evidence'' of
``serious'' damage caused by NATO's airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council, Sergio Vierira de Mello,
the U.N. undersecretary-general and the emergency relief
coordinator, warned Wednesday that the problems of the people
inside Kosovo and Yugoslavia would ``dramatically deteriorate
unless the conflict is soon brought to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most basic rehabilitation of shelter and essential
services will require colossal efforts and resources'' and needs to
begin soon, de Mello concluded in a written summary of his oral
report to the Council, which was released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even allowing for spontaneous, uncontrolled brutality, the
team collected indisputable evidence of organized, well-planned
violence against civilians,'' he wrote in the summary.
</P>
<P>
   De Mello and the representatives of 12 U.N. relief organizations
and private relief groups traveled more than 1500 miles in an
11-day trip to gather information. He reported that his team found
``a depressing panorama of empty villages, burned houses, looted
shops, wandering livestock and unattended farms.'' Signs that the
inhabitants had ``fled on very short notice, probably in terror,
was the most disturbing finding,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He also singled out the plight of 500,000 Serb refugees from
Croatia and Bosnia, who, he said in remarks to reporters after the
Council meeting, were living in what he called ``subhuman
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and American representatives praised de Mello's
report.

BAY-AREA STUDENT BREEZES INTO SECOND ROUND OF SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley, one of 13 children from home schools
competing in the 72nd National Spelling Bee, spelled his way into
Thursday's final rounds of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old, who attends Tri-City Homeschoolers in Newark,
Calif., coolly worked his way through ``nonuble'' in the third
round of competition Wednesday. It is an adjective denoting the
number nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the word right away, but I worked through it
because of the definition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean said he was never nervous on stage in a contest that opened
with 249 top spellers. ``I've been studying the practice list on
and off for two-and-a-half years ... so I didn't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean's parents, Mike Conley, a software engineer for Apple
Computer Inc., and Bryanne Conley, a teacher at Tri-City, weren't
as composed as their son. ``People always say it's worse for the
parents, and they're right,'' Bryanne Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Sean spelled ``Talmudic,'' referring to the writings
constituting Jewish religious and civil law, and ``lexicon,'' a
rather appropriate word for a spelling contest.
</P>
<P>
   For each word, Sean calmly asked for the definition and for any
alternate pronunciations. Then, with a concentrated gaze, he
spelled each without haste or hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my mind worked as well as his,'' said Chris, who was
sponsored by the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who by the age of 2 already had begun to read and to spell
words such as ``Albuquerque'' using refrigerator magnets, and the
103 remaining contestants will go through progressively tougher
rounds to determine the winner. There were 249 students who made it
to the first round of the bee.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader, Sean loves to compete, participating in math
contests and chess tournaments as well as spelling bees. He also
enjoys learning the martial art of karate and playing the piano.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the National Spelling Bee, sponsored by the E.W.
Scripps Co., will receive $10,000 in cash and other prizes.

 Genentech Wins UC Lawsuit  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Genentech Corp. eked out an important legal victory yesterday when
a federal jury in San Francisco failed to find that the biotech
giant had infringed on a University of California patent for human
growth hormone.
<P>
   Although eight of nine jurors concluded that the South San
Francisco firm had copied UC's work, a lone juror sided with
Genentech, sparing the company as much as $1.2 billion in actual
and punitive damages that the university was planning to seek. But
the deadlock also allows UC to seek a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won,'' said Genentech attorney Sean Johnston. ``The
University didn't prove its case.''
</P>
<P>
   UC lawyer Gerald Dodson said he was ``disappointed we didn't get
a unanimous verdict'' but said he was ``heartened'' that all but
one juror sided with the university.
</P>
<P>
   UC spent nine years and $20 million trying to prove that, 20
years ago, two former Genentech researchers used DNA purloined from
a UC lab in San Francisco as the starting point for Genentech's
growth hormone drug, called Protropin.
</P>
<P>
   Dodson said UC lawyers now must decide whether to press their
patent-infringement claim in a new trial, which could cost an
additional $2 million. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors prescribe Protropin for children who are abnormally
small and need help to grow. Protropin and a second growth hormone,
Nutropin, generated $214 million, or almost 20 percent of
Genentech's total sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted media attention because the two former
Genentech scientists who worked on the growth hormone project took
opposite sides during the six-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   German-born researcher Peter Seeburg, testifying for UC, alleged
that he and David Goeddel conspired to use UC's DNA and concealed
that fact for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Seeburg said he returned to a UC lab one month after he had quit
working there, removed a DNA sample and put it in a refrigerator at
Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Goeddel denied he ever used the DNA that Seeburg took, and
offered his 20-year-old lab notebook as proof that he had grown a
separate DNA sample in his lab at Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight of nine of us believed Mr. Seeburg took it (the UC DNA)
and used it,'' said juror Don Ladue, a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric
supervisor. ``He had it (the DNA) sitting there in an icebox. He
was under pressure. Sure he used it.''
</P>
<P>
   S. Mau, a juror from the East Bay, said the panel was bothered
by inconsistencies in Goeddel's notebook. ``In the beginning, he
recorded everything, hour by hour,'' Mau said. ``We felt it was
strange how his notes got so vague just where the switch supposedly
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Goeddel, who now is chief executive of another South San
Francisco biotech firm, Tularik Inc., defended his work in a brief
telephone interview with The Chronicle. He said Genentech has
posted his notebooks on its Web site so that scientists can
scrutinize his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as solid a notebook as any scientist has ever kept,''
Goeddel said, adding, ``Hopefully, my scientific reputation won't
be tarnished by one person's unsubstantiated claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeburg, now a scientist with the Max-Planck Institute in
Heidelberg, Germany, could not be reached for comment. But in a
letter published this week in the scientific journal Nature,
Seeburg repeated his contention that under ``increasing pressure''
to finish the growth hormone project in 1979, ``my colleague
(Goeddel) and I agreed to use the University of California's DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this conflicting scientific testimony generated
headlines, jury foreman Ronald Losch said jurors didn't dwell on
their different version of events. The issue that finally hung the
jury was technical, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's lawyers claimed that their growth hormone DNA had
subtle but important differences from UC's version. Losch said the
lone juror agreed with Genentech and refused to go along with the
eight jurors who decided that the two DNAs were identical enough to
support the university's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech stock fell 31 cents to close at $86.50 per share as
the verdict broke just before the close of trading.

 Texaco Board Ends Talks With Chevron  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Texaco's board of directors terminated merger talks with Chevron
yesterday, saying a combination was ``unacceptable for several
reasons, including complexity, feasibility, risk and price.''
<P>
   Until yesterday, neither company had admitted that talks were
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said Texaco slammed the door because differences
between the oil giants proved intractable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both sides realized that getting FTC approval would
have been too big a hurdle,'' said Keith Petersen, analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also appears Chevron wasn't being overly generous
financially and Texaco executives may simply have decided they'd
rather keep their company and their jobs,'' Petersen concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse press release, Chevron Chairman Kenneth Derr said he
was ``surprised that the Texaco board turned down a very
competitive offer that included a significant price premium to
Texaco shareholders and an opportunity to receive Chevron stock
with its acknowledged strong growth prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they think both Chevron and Texaco will continue
to seek merger partners. The logical suitor for Texaco now is Royal
Dutch Shell, with which it already operates service stations and
refineries in the United States under joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron is expected to woo independent oil companies, mostly
because other ``majors'' already have gone to the altar with
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that could be prospects for Chevron include Conoco,
Phillips Petroleum, USX Marathon, Burlington Resources, Anadarko
Petroleum, Kerr McGee or Enron, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chevron nor Texaco was viewed as needing to merge. Both
are well-managed companies with strong balance sheets. But a merger
would have enabled the combined firm to cut costs by an estimated
$1.5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron reportedly offered $80 a share or a total of $42 billion
for New York's Texaco, although that price was never confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But Texaco continued to trade at a $15 discount to the rumored
price, indicating Wall Street speculators didn't believe the deal
would come off.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts late yesterday theorized that the issue of corporate
succession was a problem. Derr was believed to have insisted on
retaining chairmanship of any combined company until he retires in
two to four years. The hitch concerned who would succeed him _
Texaco Chairman Peter Bijur or Chevron Vice Chairman David
O'Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   In general, analysts speak more admiringly of Bijur but O'Reilly
was presumed to have held the stronger hand as a key executive of
the acquiring firm.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the talks marks the second time this year that
San Francisco's Chevron has failed in a merger attempt.
</P>
<P>
   It tried to buy Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles, but lost
out to BP Amoco in March in a $26.8 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Chevron-Texaco deal gone forward, antitrust officials
would have &UR;  &LR; probed the combined company's control of the refining
and fuel retailing marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a merger of Chevron and Texaco (with its Shell
connections) would have put 43 percent of all branded gasoline
stations in the hands of related companies, far ahead of
Mobil-Exxon's 12-percent market share and Arco's 11-percent market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Most industry watchers said they believed the FTC would have
ordered divestitures to prevent unacceptable market power.
</P>
<P>
   News of the talks' collapse came after the close of trading.
Texaco's stock closed up 31 cents, at $64.50, on the New York Stock
Exchange. Chevron's stock closed up $1.56, at $92, also on the Big
Board.

 Pricing for Calls to Internet Still in Limbo  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; A frenzy has erupted in California over a proposal that could have
increased what consumers pay to surf the Internet.
<P>
   But the proposed plan, which would have reclassified calls to
the Internet as long-distance instead of local, has been modified
and won't impact what consumers pay to get online _ at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, state regulators will vote today on two proposals _ one
that largely would keep the status quo and another that would
reopen the issue to examination by state regulators at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
   It all stems from a dispute between Pacific Bell and Pac-West
Telecomm, a competing local phone company that provides phone
service to many Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The two are fighting over whether Pac-West should be compensated
for handling calls made from Pac Bell's customers to various ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, local phone companies are
obligated to pay one another for completing each other's local
calls. The industry term for this is ``reciprocal compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a Pac Bell customer calls a business that uses
Pac-West Telecomm for local phone service, Pac Bell pays Pac-West
for ``terminating'' the call. Phone companies have to maintain
networks capable of receiving calls from other phone providers, and
the termination fee helps defray that cost.
</P>
<P>
   The same rules apply for calls made to Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, much of the phone traffic is one-sided. Residential
callers, who are predominantly Pac Bell customers, dial their ISPs,
which use competing phone companies because they have lower rates.
Pac Bell, in turn, is forced to pay its startup rivals to complete
the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell argues that even though a computer user dials a local
phone number to hook into an ISP, the call actually is
long-distance because the Internet is a global network and the call
can wind up anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the state Public Utilities Commission
disagreed, ruling that calls to the Internet were local and that
reciprocal compensation should apply. But several weeks later, the
Federal Communications Commission said calls to the Internet were
long-distance. However, the FCC gave states the right to decide
whether companies should pay one another for completing calls.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative law judge with the PUC has recommended that
calls to the Internet still be considered local and that Pac Bell
should pay Pac-West _ or any competing phone company _ for
completing those calls. Pac-West says it is owed $50 million by Pac
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But PUC Commissioner Josiah Neeper originally proposed
reclassifying Internet calls as long-distance and ending reciprocal
compensation, stirring up longtime fears that higher charges soon
would apply.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs and phone companies have suggested that if reciprocal
compensation is ended, the phone companies would have to raise the
rates they charge ISPs. The ISPs, in turn, would have to charge
consumers more to access the Internet. Some have even floated the
idea of per-minute charges.
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, the PUC has fielded dozens of e-mails,
phone calls and faxes from consumers who were upset or concerned,
said Rob Feraru, the PUC's public adviser. Some state senators also
sent the PUC a letter, asking it to postpone voting until a later
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are calling in a lather,'' Feraru said. ``Some are
just unclear on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Neeper changed his proposal, recommending
that the issue be re-examined by the full commission sometime in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the new proposal still isn't sitting well with some in the
industry and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This commission has already decided that these calls are local
calls. This is just an attempt &UR;  &LR; to rewrite the rules,'' said Regina
Costa, telecommunications analyst with The Utility Reform Network.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Griffin, president of Pac-West, said the new Neeper plan
is better than the first one but that it still could lead to the
reclassification of Internet calls as long-distance down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't decide anything, it just delays a decision even
longer,'' Griffin said. His company is supporting the judge's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Other competing phone companies also support the judge's
proposal and say Neeper's new plan doesn't resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Neeper's ``plan doesn't do what we'd like it to do and it isn't
terrible either, but it largely leaves the issue unresolved,'' said
Eric Artman, MCI WorldCom vice president for industry relations.
``It could have numerous adverse impacts down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell had been pushing to reclassify the calls as
long-distance, but officials say they are content with Neeper's
idea of reopening the issue to debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest in this issue, and it should be
fully developed and discussed,'' said Bill Mashek, a spokesman for
Pac Bell. ``But we believe we will prevail based on the weight of
evidence from the FCC and the simple logic that a call to the World
Wide Web is not local, but goes around the world so it's
interstate.''

GATESES GIVE RECORD $5 BILLION GIFT TO FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In what is considered the largest gift ever by a
living person to a foundation, Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates
and his wife, Melinda French Gates, on Wednesday announced a gift
of $5 billion to the William H. Gates Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's philanthropies now rank third among U.S.
foundations, if the $1.3 billion assets of the Gates Learning
Foundation are added. Only the David and Lucile Packard Foundation
at $12.2 billion and the Lily Endowment at $12 billion are larger,
according to June figures from the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a
newspaper based in Washington. The combined endowment of the Gates
foundations is now $11.3 billion, larger than that of the Ford
Foundation, which has $11.1 billion in assets, said Stacy Palmer,
editor of the Chronicle. By itself, the William H. Gates Foundation
ranks fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just huge, $5 billion in one fell swoop,'' Ms. Palmer
said. ``It sets the sights of various philanthropists that much
higher, that someone is putting that much money into
philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palmer recalled how the media magnate Ted Turner, the
founder of CNN, had asked in 1997 if the nation's wealthiest people
were giving enough to charity, when he announced a gift of $100
million a year for 10 years, equaling $1 billion, to establish the
United Nations Foundation. That gift was considered the largest
donation by a living person at the time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Gates donation came from Microsoft stock the couple
sold, a foundation spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The William H. Gates Foundation focuses on child and maternal
health in developing countries, and education and community
assistance in the Pacific Northwest. The Gates Learning Foundation
is designed to address the ``digital divide'' between people who
have access to technology and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the Gates Foundation has given more than $200
million to health-related causes, including $25 million for the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, $50 million to prevent
maternal and child mortality, $20 million for international family
planning efforts, and $100 million toward children's vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reflection of Bill and Melinda's growing enthusiasm
for what their giving can do in these areas,'' said the foundation
spokesman, Trevor Neilson. ``People's lives around the world can be
improved and in some cases saved by giving them access to services
that in the United States we take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The William H. Gates Foundation also announced Wednesday a $50
million grant to the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health,
an international organization based in Seattle, to promote the
development of a new vaccine to prevent malaria, which infects 300
million to 500 million people a year, said Dr. Gordon Perkin, head
of the group. As many as two million people, mostly children, die
of malaria, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' worth is estimated at $75 billion, making him the richest
individual in the world.

 _ SF CHRON   Button-Down Magazines Getting a Little Hot Under the Collar 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It's spring, and high-tech and business magazines have discovered
the selling powers of sex.
<P>
   In an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace,
button-down magazines like Fortune, Forbes and Upside are trying to
grab readers by splashing sizzling headlines and sexy pictures on
their covers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune has led the way, with a provocative May 10 cover,
``Addicted to Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   That cover followed Fortune's April 12 issue, which showed a
close-up of a woman's derriere, wrapped snugly in a pair of jeans
with the headline, ``How Levi's Trashed a Great American Brand.''
That cover ran on the East and West coasts and in Chicago, while a
cover featuring race car driver Jeff Gordon ran in the South and
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   At least Fortune's Levi's cover story was about blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   There's less of an excuse for the skin and leather paraded on
the cover of the June issue of Upside. To illustrate a June cover
story called ``100 Hot Companies,'' this San Francisco technology
mag shows the bare midriff of model Sandra ``Angelica'' Sage
squeezed into a tight pair of black leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ms. Sage has nothing to do with Upside's list of top privately
held technology companies. Instead, the list is full of companies
in fields such as communications equipment, enterprise software and
Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Upside chief executive David Bunnell defended the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we convey something that is hot, sexy and alluring?''
he said. ``We chose the best image to convey that.''
</P>
<P>
   He disses as ``bland and boring'' his competitor Red Herring's
June cover of its own top 100 companies. That cover features a
large number 100 against a red background, with squiggly lines
indicating something dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The goal isn't merely to sell the magazine. ``Covers are not
just for newsstands,'' said Bunnell, a veteran publisher. ``Where
our magazines go, people get lots of magazines. You have to grab
their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ziff-Davis' wholesome monthly Yahoo Internet Life features
the thighs and cleavage of ``Austin Powers'' sidekick Heather
Graham on its June cover.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Wired magazine was whacked by Brill's Content, a
monthly that tracks the media, for going ``from nerdy to naughty''
with January cover lines such as ``Salon's Web Dream,'' ``The Truth
About Vibrators,'' ``William Gibson Reveals His Secret eBay
Obsession'' and ``Phone Sects: What Happened When the Amish Went
Wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill's blamed Wired's new parent, New York magazine giant Conde
Nast. (Of course, the latest issue of Brill's features a caricature
of the New York Times' Maureen Dowd, clutching a lollipop and a
blazing machine gun, with the cover line ``Op-Ed Vixen.'')
</P>
<P>
   Using sex is an age-old technique and one stolen from
advertising. Indeed, New Media _ a monthly trade magazine for
multimedia and Web designers _ has a raging debate in its letters
section over a Macromedia ad featuring what one reader called a
``leather-clad dominatrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of dominatrices, check out the photo of CrossWorlds
Software's CEO Katrina Garnett gracing the May 31 cover of Forbes.
Last month, Forbes sent out press releases to hype the story.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember Garnett for her low-cut dress in her ads last
June; apparently, she's had another makeover, as the Forbes cover
shows her with hair slicked back, glossy lips pursed, wearing a
high-collared black vinyl jacket and clutching a red arrow, snapped
in two.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the journalism behind these photos is all solid,
which is to say: Don't judge a magazine by its cover.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ALMOST HOME &QL; 
The long-delayed sale of Wired Digital appears about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced last October, calls for Internet portal
Lycos to buy the San Francisco Web pioneer for $83 million. It's
been tripped up several times: Lycos tried its own merger with USA
Networks, the Securities and Exchange Commission repeatedly sought
clarification in the Lycos-Wired filing papers, and the Wired
Digital shareholders bickered among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Lycos-USA merger was killed, and last week, the SEC
gave the green light to the Lycos-Wired Digital deal. All that's
left is for shareholders to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The big sticking point was an odd provision that gave the
original shareholders _ including Wired founders Louis Rossetto and
Jane Metcalfe _ a lower value than who  &LR; for their stake in the
company. That's been hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's been resolved,'' Metcalfe said this week. ``It
looks like it will close sometime around the end of June.''
</P>
<P>
   FREE SPEECH FUND-RAISER &QL; 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation is going offline to raise money
to support its fight for free-expression rights online. The
Grateful Dead spin-off band Ratdog and The Flying Other Brothers, a
band comprised of Silicon Valley executives, will perform June 18
at the Fillmore Auditorium. Tickets are $35 and are available at
all BASS Tickets outlets; $250 VIP tickets, which get you into a
preshow private party, backstage passes and preferred parking, are
available online at  &LR; www.eff.org/fillmore &LR; .

FINALLY, CHARISMATIC FAVORED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Six months and 11 starts after he was last
favored to win a race, Charismatic is the 2-1 low number on the
Belmont Stakes morning line announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was victories in the Kentucky Derby (at 31-1) and
Preakness (at 8-1) to turn him into the people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we are until they start betting,'' trainer D. Wayne
Lukas said, apparently not convinced the fans are convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, second in the Derby and Preakness, is the 7-2 second
choice in the 12-horse field, and Silverbulletday, the filly with
the eight-race winning streak, is third at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic drew the comfortable post 4, next to Silverbulletday
in post 3. Menifee got post 10 in the blind draw.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 opponents for Charismatic would be the most in a Belmont
with a Triple Crown on the line since 12 ran against Canonero
(beaten by Pass Catcher) in 1971. No Triple Crown winner has beaten
more than seven horses in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that has a Belmont horse and is ready to run, they
should get in there, so when we look back Sunday morning, whether
(the winner is) us or somebody else, we can say this was the best
horse,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shot at Bob Baffert, who didn't enter Silverbulletday
in the Derby or Preakness but also didn't discourage speculation
she'd have won.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bob Lewis, who, with his wife Beverly, owns Charismatic:
``Bring 'em on, whether they're fillies or colts. Bring 'em all
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasten your seatbelts: Lukas said the Wednesday-morning flight
that brought Charismatic _ as well as Silverbulletday, Pineaff and
Prime Directive _ from Louisville was smooth despite the lightning
storms that delayed it for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the horses traveled well,'' Lukas said, adding
facetiously, ``except for Silverbulletday; she was reluctant to get
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's decision to enter the filly was a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she deserves a chance,'' Menifee trainer Elliott
Walden said of Silverbulletday. ``I don't know if I'd do it in the
Belmont...''
</P>
<P>
   Nice place to visit: Walden brought Kentucky-based Menifee to
New York early enough to give him a 5-furlong workout over the
Belmont track Tuesday. The trainer enjoys the lush stable area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big barns, big stalls, a beautiful backside,'' Walden
said. ``If I wasn't concerned about my children being mugged, I'd
probably move here and race here all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Best bet? Chris Antley, the Charismatic jockey who publishes his
own stock-market newsletter, offered his latest ``buy'' tips:
Yahoo, America Online and CMGI, also an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Triple Crown for the week,'' Antley said.
</P>
<P>
   For early risers: Lukas said Charismatic will go out for a
gallop at 5:30 (EDT) this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic completed his serious workouts Tuesday by going 5
furlongs in 1:00 2/5 at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   How about 999? The morning-line maker was lenient toward
Teletable, making him (begin ital)only(end ital) 99-1.
</P>
<P>
   The son of 1993 Belmont winner Colonial Affair has never raced
above the maiden level, winning once in four starts, not at all
since Feb. 15. Teletable is the latest longshot to be entered in a
Triple Crown race by owner Robert Perez and Alfredo Callejas.
</P>
<P>
   Sign here, please: Visa renewed _ through 2005 _ its sponsorship
of the $5 million bonus for winning the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Walden said 1998 Belmont winner Victory Gallop is
aiming for the Aug. 29 Pacific Classic at Del Mar.

 _ SF CHRON   Pacific Exchange Picks New CEO 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a surprise move, the Pacific Exchange named former mutual fund
executive Philip DeFeo as chief executive, succeeding Robert
Greber, who will remain chairman.
<P>
   Until February, DeFeo, 53, was president and chief executive of
Van Eck Associates Group, a New York fund company with $1.5 billion
in assets that specializes in commodities and international stocks.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo's appointment comes amid wholesale changes among the
exchange's top officers. In the last few months, President Warren
Langley and Chief Financial Officer Kim Williams resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The new CEO arrives at a critical juncture for the Pacific
Exchange, the nation's third-largest stock-options market. Earlier
this year, its pending merger with the Chicago Board Options
Exchange collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the exchange has been scrambling to update its
technology to permit computer-based trading of options. Currently
it uses a traditional trading-floor system, where brokers shout out
orders to buy and sell options.
</P>
<P>
   Floor-based exchanges, such as Pacific, face a growing challenge
from electronic rivals that claim they can match buyers and sellers
of securities more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, DeFeo said he plans to study all options open
to the exchange. ``Everything will be under review,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, DeFeo said he will re-examine negotiations under
way with New York brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald to start a
computer-based stock options trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed deal, Cantor would provide its proprietary
electronic trading technology and the Pacific Exchange would move a
portion of the 800 options it handles from its Montgomery Street
trading floor to the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo said he didn't know enough about the exchange's stock
trading operations to comment on plans for that business, which has
been losing money and market share in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Greber, 61, a securities industry veteran, joined the Pacific
Exchange in 1990 as chief of marketing and became chairman and CEO
six years later. In an interview, he said he told the exchange's
board after the CBOE merger fell apart in January that he intended
to step down as CEO before year-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I put myself first,'' said Greber, who noted
that he doesn't plan to look for another job.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate move, the exchange said its members approved a
plan to reduce its board of governors from 22 to 21 seats and
require that 11 be public representatives. Seven seats currently
are set aside for the public, while others are held by brokers and
exchange officials.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows an appeal to U.S. exchanges by Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt to reserve half of board
seats for the public.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRM SUCCEEDS MAKING TITLES FOR MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. -- They are the first thing an audience sees
and typically the last to get done in the Byzantine process of
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   They are a movie's titles and logos. And in the final furious
weeks leading up to a major Hollywood release, craftsmen in the
niche art can be found in unassuming buildings in quiet corners of
the suburban San Fernando Valley packaging a director's creation
just so.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do here goes to the heart of the directors' vision,''
said Tony Valdez, partner at motion-graphics specialist Lumeni
Productions. ``It comes down to a question of how the film is
branded.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumeni's portfolio includes ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me,'' ``Pushing Tin,'' ``Terminator 2,'' ``Con Air,'' ``The Mask of
Zorro'' and logos for Miramax, Gramercy, Rysher Entertainment and
Jerry Bruckheimer Films.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the 10-employee company works on as many as 200
projects per year, often in the final weeks before a film opens.
For its efforts, Lumeni takes in about $1.2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director often doesn't know what the feel of the film will
be like until it's just about finished, so we don't get the work
until it's a month before opening,'' said Gilbert Yablon, who heads
the software side of Lumeni. ``He'll labor over the visuals and
feel he's created a masterpiece so that if we don't match it, what
we've done can seem like a tie that doesn't go with a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasing studios and directors often means working around the
clock to meet deadlines that simply can't be extended. ``It gets
fast and furious here sometimes,'' Yablon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize how films can be worked on until
about three weeks before they get to theaters,'' added Mark
Dornfeld, a longtime visual-effects specialist with The Walt Disney
Co. who recently left to form a joint venture with Lumeni. ``It's
most cost-effective to get a film onto screens as quickly as
possible once you're done with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite intense hype over the computer-generated special effects
that have helped transform modern filmmaking, Lumeni executives are
wary of abandoning tried-and-true techniques that deliver within
budget. By teaming with Dornfeld, a two-decade veteran of Hollywood
post-production, they're now offering a fusion of
computer-generating capabilities and standard optical processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to take off-the-shelf software and make it do
extraordinary things,'' Yablon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're noodlers,'' Valdez added. ``People who are predicting
that the age of doing everything digitally is just around the
corner are not being realistic because of the costs. What we offer
is going to depend on the film's budget and how we can give them
the most bang for their buck.''
</P>
<P>
   With conventional optics, different parts of a scene are filmed
separately against a blue screen. That background is then erased as
the images are layered on one another and then filmed again with
the still widely used optical printer.
</P>
<P>
   With digital technology, images are simply scanned into a
computer and converted to electronic data. Technicians then use
computers to manipulate the images. ``We do use computers sometimes
but the bottom line is getting work out in the most cost-effective
manner,'' Valdez said.
</P>
<P>
   Being cost-effective has grown more important in recent years
due to the proliferation of players in the business and tighter
budgets for Hollywood's major films. The 1997 closures of two large
players -- Boss Films and Warner Bros.' digital operation --
underscored the brutal competition for special-effects and
post-production dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a niche by ourselves, but the field's been blown
wide open recently, so it's a very different playing field now,''
Valdez admitted. That means making money has become much tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become very difficult to do special effects on features
because the profit margins are so small,'' said Tom Atkin, director
of the Visual Effects Society trade group. ``There's a lot of
bidding and price wars so it's difficult to cover overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition for film work is especially intense because having
the association with major studios and their movies carries an
invaluable premium, Atkin noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if your portfolio has recognizable imagery from
features, it's a real attention-getter and brings a lot more
credibility,'' he said. ``The other reason why people like doing
features is that the artists and craftspeople are storytellers and
the biggest palette is the giant screen. It is the best format as
far as impact on an audience because you have a 40-foot screen,
digital sound and the audience's undivided attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Lumeni's work is done with a killer deadline. Take, for
example, Lumeni's creation of a new logo for Miramax, a task that
consumed more than a year off and on. The final result is the
studio's name floating across the East River with a Manhattan
skyline moving from late afternoon to night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to give very much the sense of Miramax being a
New York company,'' Valdez said. That meant using
computer-generated water and ``taking apart'' and reconstructing
buildings to give the illusion of time-lapse photos.
</P>
<P>
   Lumeni had the good fortune for the new logo to debut late last
year with ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which went on to win the Best
Picture Academy Award. ``We put a lot of our heart into it and
Miramax was tickled,'' Valdez said.
</P>

   Earlier this year, Lumeni aggressively expanded its capabilities
by bringing on Dornfeld. It's a tactic for standing out from the
dozens of other shops by offering quick-fix service with the
ability to create and produce a single memorable icon that sums up
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Dornfeld's first project, under the Custom Film Effects banner,
was completing the quirky titles of ``Pushing Tin,'' which were in
the style of an air traffic controller's scribbles laid over jets
zipping across the New York City skyline. The project was completed
in association with design firm Imaginary Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to be hooked into the concept of the film's
tone and feeling of what it's like to be a controller,'' Dornfeld
said. ``A director is going to be very concerned about how the
start of the film is going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dornfeld left Disney last year to move outside the corporate
fold but found that the costs of firing up his own business would
be prohibitive. ``I'm not a businessman and I didn't want to
mortgage my house,'' he said. ``I started looking at the cost of
post-production visual effects and the infusion of digital
technology and I thought, This town doesn't really need another
house when there's already 75 or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives say that the collaboration resulted in a
``gangbusters'' first quarter despite the tightness of the overall
feature film market. ``I think we've really hit the ground
running,'' Dornfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Dornfeld, who has four employees, started work earlier this year
using mostly optical printer techniques for a project that cost the
client $20,000 for 600 feet of film; creating the same footage
digitally would have cost $65,000. ``A lot of people are trying to
work digitally because they need to pay off the costs of a very
large digital workstation,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Valdez, Dornfeld and Yolan have anything against
digital technology. They just don't see it as the solution to every
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange environment we're in right now because the
optical printer can do a lot of our bread-and-butter work, while
the computer can handle really complex jobs,'' Yolan said.

   Claudia Seay's quest for a cheaper air fare from Little Rock to
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport might have saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   Seay and her boss regularly travel to Dallas on business, taking
a flight in the morning to D/FW and returning at night. They had
planned to travel Tuesday, but at the last minute decided to wait a
day to get cheaper fares.
</P>
<P>
   She heard about the crash late that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss said we really dodged the bullet on that one,'' said
Seay, an international sales manager with Day Runner of North
Little Rock, Ark. Seay arrived Wednesday morning on the first
flight of the day from Little Rock with co-worker Carla Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airport was really calm,'' Davenport said. ``Sitting in
the lounge area, you could tell it was on everybody's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were police around the Little Rock airport, Seay said.
And the flight to Dallas was full, Seay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to death,'' Seay said shortly after arriving in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The two talked about changing their plans but decided they
wouldn't let the crash interrupt their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep going,'' Davenport said. ``You can't arrange
your whole lifestyle every time something happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The co-workers planned to return to Little Rock on Wednesday
night, Seay said.

CAPTAIN WAS 20-YEAR VETERAN WITH OVER 5,000 HOURS OF MD-80
EXPERIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The pilot who died while landing American Airlines Flight 1420
during a thunderstorm in Little Rock, Ark., was a 20-year veteran
of the airline who had flown 5,500 hours on MD-80s, the airline
said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Warren Buschmann, 48, of Illinois was trying to
land the Super MD-80 when it skidded off the runway, crashed into a
light tower and burst into flames, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Buschmann's first officer, Michael Origel, and four flight
attendants survived.
</P>
<P>
   Origel, 36, based in Chicago, sustained a broken leg. Flight
attendant Nancy Luna of Irving suffered a fractured pelvis and
Jennifer Chapman sustained a compound leg fracture, airline
officials said. Flight attendants Tammy Gardner and Laurie Nelson
were not seriously injured, the airline said. All four are based at
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Their hometowns were not immediately available. Efforts to reach
family members last night were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Origel is a recent arrival to the world of commercial flying,
the airline said. He completed his training in March and joined
American Airlines. He had accumulated 186 flight hours with
American and his first assignment was as the first officer on the
Super MD-80, airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In bad weather, the first officer's responsibility would have
been manning the radios to get weather reports from the airport
control tower.
</P>
<P>
   Buschmann lived in Naperville, Ill. An experienced pilot, he had
accumulated 9,600 hours of flying time, including 5,500 on the type
of plane that crashed. He was one of four chief pilots based in
Chicago and his experience qualified him to check other American
pilots on their handling of that aircraft, American spokeswoman
Andrea Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   Buschmann and Origel, who had both been on duty for nearly 14
hours, started their day in Chicago, flew to Salt Lake City and
then on to Dallas-Fort Worth. Thunderstorms in Texas delayed their
departure to Little Rock, where they had expected to spend the
night.

 Adobe to Cut 250 Jobs, Beef Up on E-Commerce  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Adobe Systems Inc. yesterday announced it will slash 250 jobs by
the end of the year, the second round of layoffs to hit the San
Jose graphics software maker in the past nine months.
<P>
   Adobe officials said savings from the layoffs, which will cut
about 9 percent of Adobe's workforce, will be used to beef up the
company's Internet commerce services. Adobe, criticized in the past
for being slow to take advantage of the Web, plans to turn its
popular Internet site into a portal for Internet graphics services.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the same breath, Adobe executives said revenues for its
second quarter, which ends tomorrow, should be better than
expected. Adobe expects as much as $246 million in revenues for the
quarter, which would touch the high end of analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is doing well and we are certainly excited by
that,'' said Bruce Chizen, Adobe executive vice president for
worldwide products.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have an obligation to all of our constituents, our
stockholders, our customers and certainly our employees to grow
this company aggressively,'' he said. ``This is geared toward
making sure we have enough resources to invest in things that will
fuel our long-term growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Adobe dominates the market for graphics and document software
used by publishers with programs like Illustrator, Photoshop and
PageMaker.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, which has about 2,700 employees worldwide, said 40
percent of the job cuts will come from the closure of its European
corporate headquarters in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The office has about 100 finance, technology, human resources,
legal and sales employees whose jobs will be consolidated in
Adobe's main headquarters in downtown San Jose. The firm will keep
sales and support offices open in Munich, London, Paris and
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Another 125 workers in San Jose will lose their jobs, including
about 90 people who work in Adobe's printing engineering research
and development department.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe revolutionized the publishing industry with printing
software like PostScript, but growth in that part of the business
has been flat for several years, Chizen said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining job cuts will occur as Adobe centralizes other
operations like sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Adobe announced a restructuring that eventually
pared 350 positions, or 12 percent, of its workforce. Those
cutbacks included some senior executives as Adobe streamlined its
management.
</P>
<P>
   For the latest round, Adobe will take a onetime $15 million
restructuring charge. Chizen said the company's goal is to save
about $25 million to $30 million in administrative costs annually.
</P>
<P>
   Although plans are still sketchy, Adobe plans to use the savings
to become more aggressive with electronic commerce and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Chizen said the company is considering ideas like selling a Web
version of its professional graphics software to people who may
only have occasional need for the program. Or Adobe could use the
site to license clip art.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the site could become a broker for other Web design and
digital imaging services, much like financial sites offer mortgage
services.
</P>
<P>
   The twin announcements were made before the market opened
yesterday. Adobe stock closed at $75.06, up $2.56 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe halted trading after the market closed Tuesday to avoid
after-hours trading in anticipation of yesterday's announcements,
but that action fueled speculation by analysts that Adobe was going
to acquire another company or announce poor earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Although the actual news wasn't as dramatic, analysts endorsed
Adobe's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good overall strategy,'' said Hana Nada of U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray, which has a ``buy'' rating on Adobe. ``They've been
getting bloated of late, but now they can focus their energy on the
Web site to try to turn it into a publisher's portal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fagin of Bear, Stearns said Adobe ``was doing the smart
thing looking at where they can trim some fat.''

 EEOC Accuses PETCO of Gender Bias  &HT;     By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued PETCO
Animal Supplies for sex discrimination yesterday, claiming the
giant pet food chain paid female managers in its East Bay stores
substantially less than their male counterparts.
<P>
   EEOC officials said they have so far identified five women who
were paid less than similarly skilled men doing the same job _ in
one case $10,000 a year less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is very clear that men and woman have to be equally
paid when they have similar qualifications and experience,'' said
EEOC regional attorney William Tamayo. ``This lawsuit serves to ...
address what appears to be a systemic problem within the company.''
</P>
<P>
   PETCO, which is based in San Diego and is the country's No.2 pet
food retailer, denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers' salaries are based on breadth and scope of
management experience and other business considerations,'' said
Janet Mitchell, senior vice president of human resources. ``The
company has a strong commitment to equal employment opportunity and
does not discriminate against employees on any basis, including
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, focused on PETCO's treatment of five women managers in
1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges in the lawsuit:
</P>
<P>
   _PETCO allegedly told its Walnut Creek manager Sherri Savage
that a $22,000 salary was ``the best that we can do,'' even though
her male predecessor had been paid $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   _The company allegedly told Savage it could not pay her more
than $26,500 when she later took over as manager of its Martinez
store, even though her male predecessor had been paid $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   _PETCO allegedly told its Dublin manager Katherine Bloom that
there was ``no money in the budget'' to increase her salary above
$27,300. Seven months later when Bloom transferred to another
store, the firm paid $36,000 to her male replacement, who had no
prior experience at PETCO or any other pet food stores.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC officials said they expected news of the lawsuit to bring
forward similar complaints from other women. The suit sought
compensation including back pay and benefits for the women,
possible reinstatement if they had left the company, and punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the lawsuit was part of a heightened agency
emphasis on combating sex discrimination in workers' pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said that
Equal Pay Act cases ... should be a priority,'' Tamayo said. ``This
is a big issue for our chairwoman, Ida Castro, who used to be head
of the women's division of the U.S. Department of Labor.''
</P>
<P>
   PETCO operates 482 stores nationally.

THE WIND HELPS BLOW AWAY TWO MORE FAVORITES AT FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The summer sizzle, the museums, and the subway system
were all out of commission and on strike in Paris Wednesday, and so
were the seeded stars who took to the clay for their quarterfinal
assignments at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Kuerten and Alex Corretja did a disappearing act that
left a bizarre men's semifinal round with by three unseeded gate
crashers and one very veteran master of ceremonies in 13th-seeded
Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, who won his first title at Roland Garros in 1997 and
expected to re-assume that post this year, and Corretja, the
sixth-seeded Spaniard, went crashing from contention in straight
sets. Under aggravating conditions on center court, where an
unrelenting wind whipped the clay into sirocco-strength whorls,
Kuerten was reduced to a crestfallen bystander by the brute
strength, and brutal drop shots, of 100th-ranked Andrei Medvedev,
7-5, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Medvedev, whose career went into steep recession
after he reached the semifinals here six years ago, blithely
attributed his resurgence to a head-over-heels reunion with his
on-again, off-again girlfriend, Anke Huber of Germany. Kuerten
linked his own dispassionate performance to the pressure of being
the tournament favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to do all the things just by myself, but I
couldn't do,'' the eighth-seeded Kuerten said. ``I just didn't play
good today; it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Corretja, weakened by a recent bout with mononucleosis and a
mid-event brush with food poisoning, bowed to 54th-ranked Fernando
Meligeni, Kuerten's Brazilian understudy, 6-2, 6-2, 6-0. The match
was remarkable only for the progressive absence of any
counterpunching from Corretja, who allowed the 28-year-old Meligeni
to play the final set virtually uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't move my legs at all, so if you cannot move your
legs in tennis, you better stay home, no?'' said Corretja, normally
a human backboard.
</P>
<P>
   With his balding pate, wrinkled shirt and plaid shorts, Medvedev
looked more like he was ready to to go bowling after mowing his
lawn rather than taking on the tournament darling in the
quarterfinals of the Grand Slam played in the world's most stylish
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are practice shorts,'' said Medvedev, who finds them as
comfortable to play in as they are to practice and sleep in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took all the labels off,'' he added, aware that his
contractual responsibilities lie elsewhere. ``I'm not going to
change now.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Medvedev's casual attire, his game was tailored to the
clay like high fashion. He kept his ground strokes deep, the better
to force Kuerten backward and taunt him with drop shots; he
threaded his down-the-line backhands; his returns were cannons, and
he served with such steady placement that Kuerten waited 1 hour 41
minutes before taking a peek at a break point. After Medvedev broke
him in the first game of the final set, Kuerten could do nothing
but applaud the Ukrainian's brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev rose to fourth in the world back in 1993, the year he
went to the semifinals here, but an array of injuries, including a
wrist he fractured when his 6-foot-4-inch frame landed on it during
a match against Michael Chang at the 1995 Australian Open,
conspired against him. As did his misery whenever he and Huber,
with whom he is unofficially engaged, were on the outs.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev said he had not felt like a serious Grand Slam
contender since 1994, and by last year he was ``maybe half dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really care that my ranking was dropping faster than
the ball from the high building,'' he said. ``But six weeks ago I
started to think that I'm 105 in the world and perhaps that it is
not a position where I would like to see myself.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Medvedev, who barely qualified for the main draw and
admitted he had not won two matches in a row since last October,
will see himself in the semifinals against Meligeni, whom he has
beaten in both previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev had inspired himself here by toppling Pete Sampras in
the second round. ``Beating Pete, doesn't matter if it's on clay or
mud or water, it doesn't matter,'' he said. ``You beat him in
backgammon, you feel good. Is like a second birth in tennis, in
life. It's fantastic.''

 MAC Q&AMP;A/HENRY NORR  &HT;     Office 98 Simplifies Mac-PC Exchanges 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: &LR;  This new question-and-answer column for Mac users
will run the first Thursday of each month. David Einstein's
Computing Q&AMP;A will continue to run the other Thursdays.
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Q: I have Microsoft Office 4.2.1 on a Power Mac 7500. I can't open
Microsoft Excel or PowerPoint files that come from Windows
machines; by the same token, Windows users can't open Excel or
PowerPoint files I send. And when I send a Word document to a
Windows user, it typically loses formatting. Is this a function of
my machine or my version of Microsoft Office? If I got a G3, will
all my conversion issues go away ... or should I just give in and
get a Dell?!
</P>
<P>
   A: No need for new hardware, Mac or PC. The problem is just that
your version of Microsoft Office saves files in formats different
from those that Office for Windows uses.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there's now a solution: Upgrade to Office
98 for the Mac, which saves files in the same formats as the
current Office for Windows, and even the upcoming Office 2000 for
Windows. Once you upgrade, you shouldn't have any problem reading
files PC users send.
</P>
<P>
   In the other direction there's one small complication: When you
e-mail a Mac Office file to a Windows user, she might get two
attachments with your message, one for each of the two ``forks''
into which most Mac files are divided. The smaller one will
probably be unreadable, but just tell your correspondents not to
worry _ the larger attachment should open just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that the upgrade will cost you $250 to $300. It
also requires at least 90 megabytes of free disk space and 16
megabytes of RAM (32 recommended).
</P>
<P>
   One warning: Retail upgrade packages might not include

The Year 29,941 Problem
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Mac II that uses Mac OS 7 and wonder whether there
will be any trouble if the clock turns over to 2000. I have
Visa/MasterCard processing software and when I tried it with a card
that has a 2000 expiration date, it worked, but will it still work
next January?
</P>
<P>
   A: One advantage of being a Mac user is that you don't have to
worry about whether your computer and operating system will still
work come next January. (As ``Hitchhiker's Guide'' author and Mac
devotee Douglas Adams put it, ``We may not have got everything
right, but at least we knew the century was going to end.'') The
very first release of the Mac OS, way back in 1984, could handle
dates up 2040, and all recent versions are good up to 29,940 A.D.,
although you'll need to update the Date &AMP; CQ  &LR; Time control panel
before 2019 (see &LR;  http:// &LR;   &LR; www.apple.com/about/ &LR;   &LR; year2000/) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Applications like your credit-card software, however, are a
different story. Some programmers rely on their own code, instead
of the Mac OS, to handle dates, and in these cases there's no
guarantee they did the right thing. Try contacting the publishers
of the programs you depend on _ most have a page on their Web sites
about ``Y2K compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   But in your case, especially if your software goes back as far
as your hardware (10 or 12 years), that might not work, because
most publishers test only recent versions of their products. If you
can't get a straight story, you'll need to test for yourself. Apple
provides advice about how to do that at the same site mentioned
above.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Staying Connected
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year I bought a new Mac G3 PowerBook with a 56K internal
modem and switched Internet service providers at the same time (to
Mindspring). The problem is that I get disconnected often when I'm
on the Internet. My ISP blames the phone lines, the phone company
blames the modem and the ISP, and Apple blames everyone but
themselves. How can I find out what the problem is and what can I
do to fix it?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: The first thing I'd do is download and install something
called Apple Modem Updater 1.3.5, which you can find at &LR;  http:/ &LR; 
 &LR; /asu.info.apple.com &LR;   &LR; /swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11315.  &LR; It will
update the modem's firmware (its built-in instructions) and put
some new software into your System Folder.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, try some controlled experiments to zero in
on the problem. Take your PowerBook someplace where a friend has a
reliable Internet connection, and try going online from there. If
you don't get disconnected there, your phone line at home is
probably at fault. If you get dropped no matter where you are, grab
one of those promotional CD-ROMs from America Online or some other
Internet provider and sign up for a free trial. If that works where
Mindspring doesn't, time to change ISPs.

BAY-AREA STUDENT BREEZES INTO SECOND ROUND OF SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley, one of 13 children from home schools
competing in the 72nd National Spelling Bee, spelled his way into
Thursday's final rounds of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old, who attends Tri-City Homeschoolers in Newark,
Calif., coolly worked his way through ``nonuble'' in the third
round of competition Wednesday. It is an adjective denoting the
number nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the word right away, but I worked through it
because of the definition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who was sponsored by the San Francisco Examiner, said he
was never nervous on stage in a contest that opened with 249 top
spellers. ``I've been studying the practice list on and off for
two-and-a-half years ... so I didn't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean's parents, Mike Conley, a software engineer for Apple
Computer Inc., and Bryanne Conley, a teacher at Tri-City, weren't
as composed as their son. ``People always say it's worse for the
parents, and they're right,'' Bryanne Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Sean spelled ``Talmudic,'' referring to the writings
constituting Jewish religious and civil law, and ``lexicon,'' a
rather appropriate word for a spelling contest.
</P>
<P>
   For each word, Sean calmly asked for the definition and for any
alternate pronunciations. Then, with a concentrated gaze, he
spelled each without haste or hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my mind worked as well as his,'' Mike Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who by the age of 2 already had begun to read and to spell
words such as ``Albuquerque'' using refrigerator magnets, and the
103 remaining contestants will go through progressively tougher
rounds to determine the winner. There were 249 students who made it
to the first round of the bee.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader, Sean loves to compete, participating in math
contests and chess tournaments as well as spelling bees. He also
enjoys learning the martial art of karate and playing the piano.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the National Spelling Bee, sponsored by the E.W.
Scripps Co., will receive $10,000 in cash and other prizes.

NINE KILLED AS JET CRASHES IN STORM IN LITTLE ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 5th graph to add wind speed; subs penultimate graph to
clarify two aboard are unaccounted for.) (rm) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ An American Airlines jet carrying 145 people
touched down in a furious thunderstorm late Tuesday, slid off the
runway and was sliced open as it hit a lighting tower. Nine people,
including the captain, were killed in the fiery crash, and more
than 80 people were injured, some with severe burns.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified passengers on what had been an uneventful, though
delayed, flight from Dallas scrambled out of the hole in the
burning fuselage and huddled in a low-lying field a few feet from
the Arkansas River while being pelted by dime-size hail. Others
squeezed through an emergency exit, and some jumped from a wing
that was ablaze with burning jet fuel. Several of the victims were
apparently seated near the wings of the twin-engine McDonnell
Douglas Super 80, where a fast-growing fire prompted the panicked
exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came to a stop I looked over my shoulder and saw a
fireball coming down the aisle,'' said Phyllis V. Caruth, a
statistics teacher at Little Rock Central High School. ``I thought,
`Forget the purse, woman, get out of the plane.'''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said it was too soon to blame the weather
as a primary culprit, but made it clear that the landing conditions
were severe.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Black, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said winds had picked up from 10 miles per hour a few
minutes before the crash to 30 m.p.h. near the moment of impact,
which occurred at 11:51 P.M. A few minutes after the crash, radar
equipment picked up enormous gusts of up to 88 m.p.h., Black said.
</P>
<P>
   George R. Wilkins, operations officer at the National Weather
Service station in North Little Rock, said a line of thunderstorms
was approaching the airport from the northwest at the time the
plane was landing from the south. He said the peak gust at the
moment of landing may have been as high as 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The airport had equipment to detect windshears, but
investigators said they did not yet know whether the gusts
registered on the equipment or whether the crew had been informed
of the severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said the crew had been informed by the Dallas
dispatcher that there was bad weather in the Little Rock area, but
said it was not known whether the Little Rock tower advised the
crew of its severity. Officials of the National Transportation
Safety Board said the plane's voice and data recorders were
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of the crash, the airport lost electrical power,
Black said, although he did not know if that was caused by the
collision with the light tower or by the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The two-man crew of Flight 1420 had been on duty for 13.5 hours,
a half-hour short of the American Airlines limit for flying duty.
They had begun their day in Chicago, making stops at Salt Lake City
and Dallas, where the flight was delayed two hours because of bad
weather, before departing for Little Rock. American Airlines denied
that the crew was fatigued, but other pilots said the long day may
have pushed the crew to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   The flight captain, Richard Buschmann, who died in the crash,
had flown for American Airlines for 20 years and was the company's
chief pilot in Chicago. The co-pilot, Michael Origel, had just
finished his training in March; he suffered a broken leg in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420, scheduled to leave Dallas at 8:30 p.m., had been
delayed for more than two hours because the scheduled plane had not
arrived due to bad weather in north Texas, several passengers said.
Around 10:30 p.m., American brought over an MD-80 which had been
stationed in a hangar, and the flight left around 10:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University senior who was returning
home to Little Rock, said there was no turbulence or noticeable bad
weather until about 15 minutes before landing, when she saw
thunderclouds and lightning not far away. The descent seemed
ordinary until touchdown, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like he was trying to brake, but couldn't,'' Ms. Goss
said. ``Then all of a sudden, I said, `Oh my God, we're on the
grass,' and we had veered off the runway to the left. We were going
way too fast. Then there was this boom, and then a really loud
boom, and all the lights went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, the Transportation Board investigator, confirmed that the
plane had left the runway to the left, heading down an embankment
to the river, until it hit the lighting tower and several other
pieces of heavy airport equipment. The crash stopped the plane from
dropping into the water, he said, but in doing so it ripped the
plane's skin apart and caused the fire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In terror, passengers in the back rows managed to escape through
the rear hatch, while those in the front got out through the
torn-open fuselage. The fire was in the middle of the plane, and it
spread swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see there was flame from the middle of the plane to
the back and it was getting worse,'' said Richard M. Klamm, a
chemical salesman from Pine Bluff, Ark. ``You look at it and then
you wonder how anyone came out of it. It was like a dream: you
think you'll roll over and it'll be a dream. It wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goss said there was no warning from the crew that a crash
was imminent, and said she saw no flight attendants helping people
out of the plane. Firefighters had to use chisels to pull some
passengers through openings in the plane's side.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goss' father, Patrick J. Goss, is a partner at Wright,
Lindsey &AMP; Jennings, which is President Bill Clinton's old law firm.
Mayor Jim Dailey of Little Rock said the president had several
friends on the plane, all of whom survived.
</P>
<P>
   Area hospitals treated 83 people for injuries, mainly abrasions,
cuts and burns, while 51 people escaped without injuries. The
authorities said two people were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The nine fatalities confirmed by the county coroner were the
first in the 82-year history of Little Rock's airport, and the
first on an American commercial plane since December 1997.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark.: as the plane 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The scenario that the storm approached one end of the runway
as the plane approached from the other probably is correct,''
Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather data show that conditions were relatively calm 27
minutes before the accident, Black said. At that time, the wind at
the airport was out of the south at about 10 mph and visibility was
seven miles with lightly scattered clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But two minutes after the crash, the wind was out of the west
with gusts to nearly 30 mph, Black said. The gusts of more than 80
mph were recorded five minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said Buschmann alerted them about 30 minutes before
the crash that storms were looming around Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A half hour before the crash, he said there were strong
(storm) cells,'' passenger Barrett Baber said. ``He said we were
going to try to go around them; that was the last I heard'' from
Buschman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on Runway 04, which points almost north, and
then veered off the left side of the 7,200-foot runway before its
end, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Richard Klamm said he was certain he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time the pilot made his first bumpy touchdown until
the plane came to a stop was about 20 to 25 seconds,'' said Klamm,
49, of Pine Bluff, Ark. ``While you are swerving back and forth,
you don't have time to see your life flash before your eyes. I was
just thinking, `Get this plane under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane touched down, it bounced, came back down and
bounced again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell the pilot did not have control of the craft,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it slid past the end of the runway, the plane turned right
into the large steel stanchion supporting the runway lights.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the fuselage was split just behind the cockpit, the
left side of the plane was ripped open by the steel light supports
and the left wing was torn off and crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   The tail of the plane separated from the rest of the fuselage.
Fire rolled through part of the plane, and some of the injured
apparently were seriously burned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting and rescue vehicles reached the scene within six to
seven minutes, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage because
they could not get emergency exits open, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Black called the plane ``a clean aircraft, with no maintenance
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was delivered to American in August 1983. As of April 30, the
plane had logged nearly 49,000 hours of service and been through
nearly 27,000 takeoff/landing cycles. One takeoff and one landing
constitute one cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at the brakes, the runway surface, drainage of
the runway and the runway's skid resistance in determining why the
aircraft was not able to stop,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we don't know how far down the runway the plane
touched down, and whether the pilot tried to get it back into the
air when he saw that he could not stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Wednesday whether wind shear _ a rapid change
in wind direction and speed that can bring an airliner crashing
down _ was a factor in the accident, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock airport has a low-level wind-shear detection
system but does not have the newer Terminal Doppler Weather Radar
that was developed for the FAA after the wind-shear crash of Delta
Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport in 1985, NTSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock Mayor Jim Dailey said he hopes that the
investigation shows that the city's emergency response was
``helpful in saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first commercial aviation accident at our airport,
and, at the least, we will use this as an opportunity to be more
prepared in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was en route to a speaking engagement in
Colorado, called Dailey from Air Force One to express his concern
for the crash victims and to offer his support in the
investigation, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also was asking about two friends of his who were on the
plane, Nancy and Craig Wood,'' the mayor said. ``I was able to tell
him that they both survived the crash and were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wood served in Clinton's administration while he was
governor of Arkansas, and Craig Wood is a member of the city's
water board, Dailey said.

By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Focusing on ``what the pilots were trying to
do,'' federal investigators tried to determine Wednesday why an
American Airlines jetliner crash-landed in a severe thunderstorm,
slid off the runway, broke apart and burned, killing at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the 145 people on board the McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 were injured, some critically, as hysterical passengers
scrambled off Flight 1420 from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport when it
crashed while landing at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday. The left side of the
plane's fuselage was peeled away as it slammed into a large steel
structure that supports runway alignment indicator lights.
</P>
<P>
   All but one passenger had been accounted for by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told harrowing tales of escaping from the thick smoke
and roaring flames as a violent downpour, hail and wind gusts of 75
mph enveloped the wreckage at Little Rock National Airport, just
yards from the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so
thick we couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I pushed a few people, because your natural instinct to
survive just kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
recovered the flight data boxes from the cockpit. They may yield
information about what the pilots knew of the weather conditions
when flight controllers cleared them to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recovered recorders and the tower transmissions. From
here, we will go into understanding what the pilots were trying to
do,'' said George Black, an NTSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they
have to base that on the information they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Richard Buschmann, 48, one of six members of the flight
crew, was killed in the crash. His co-pilot survived with broken
legs and other serious injuries and was ``interviewed briefly,''
Black said, declining to say what the co-pilot told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The four flight attendants, all based at D/FW, also survived,
although two were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said that ``all of us'' at American ``are terribly
sorry that this accident has occurred. ... It is clearly a terrible
day for all of us at American Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said airline officials ``will be doing everything we can,
together with the team of investigators, to determine exactly how
and why this accident happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Delayed for two hours by turbulent weather in North Texas, the
flight was on the last leg of a journey that originated in Chicago,
with stops in Salt Lake City and D/FW before Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As it approached Little Rock, the plane ``started to rock pretty
good,'' said Kevin Mergel, 21, who was on the flight with other
members of the Ouichita Baptist University choir.
</P>
<P>
   After it touched down, ``I knew something was wrong when we
started to swerve,'' Mergel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to God he could straighten out,'' Mergel said,
referring to the pilot. ``He was trying to reverse it and correct
things before making a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University student, said the
plane was out of control immediately as the pilot struggled to slow
it down and keep it on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't,'' she told the ``Washington Post.'' ``I thought
we were never going to stop. Every time he would try to brake, we
would go to the left. I realized we were going farther and farther
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking out the window at the ground, and the third time
he tried to slow down, I saw the grass rushing by and knew we were
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NTSB was not ready to declare weather a factor in
the crash, conditions at the Little Rock airport deteriorated
rapidly as the aircraft approached the runway.

   The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, as
well as tapes of the conversations between the pilots and air
traffic controllers, will be reviewed ``to determine what the
pilots knew or were told about the weather before they landed, and
what they might have attempted to do once they got into trouble,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Steady winds of 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph were reported in
the Little Rock area just before the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have tried to
land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone told me there were 50-knot gusts at the airport, I
would be leaving town,'' said Cecil Ewell, who oversees all
American Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist George Wilken said radar
images showed the storm arriving in Little Rock about the same time
as the plane. MORE &QL;

SHARES OF CKE DECLINE ON BAD NEWS

   LOS ANGELES -- Shares in CKE Restaurants Inc. fell sharply
Wednesday as the parent of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's food chains
said it would widely miss analysts' first quarter earnings
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food restaurant operator lost $4.3125, or 23.88
percent, to close at $13.75 after the company issued a statement
Wednesday morning stating it would earn closer to 35 cents per
share than the 45-cent consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by
First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the drubbing was justified. ``They missed
estimates by 22 percent, so the stock's down in line with that,''
said Doug Christopher at Los Angeles-based Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co.
``When you disappoint in this market you're going to get hit
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, Calif.-based CKE said same store sales at its Carl's
Jr. and Hardee's restaurants would be down 4.7 percent and 4.8
percent, respectively, for the quarter ended May 17, accounting for
the bulk of the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to be hitting a plateau for a while,'' William Foley,
CKE's chief executive said in a statement. Foley also said
conversion of some Hardee's restaurants into Carl's Jr. outlets
hurt sales.
</P>
<P>
   Following the announcement, SunTrust Equitable Securities
analyst Robert Derrington downgraded the company to ``long-term
attractive'' from ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, CKE said its Taco Bueno restaurants will show
a 10.7 percent increase in same-store sales and $27 million in
total sales for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   CKE operates 874 Carl's Jr. restaurants in the western United
States and Mexico, 2,785 Hardee's restaurants throughout the
country and abroad, and 111 Taco Bueno restaurants in Texas and
Oklahoma. CKE expects to report earnings June 14.

LAST GROUP OF REHABILITATED BEARS WILL BE RELEASED INTO WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE HADLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five black bears, scrubbed and nourished after a
winter in a Lynnwood, Wash., rehabilitation facility, will be sent
out into the world to fend for themselves on Thursday in Eastern
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They're the last five to be released of 16 that were taken in by
the PAWS Wildlife Center between March and December last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen bears is well over the usual two or three the center
gets each year, said Deb Dyson, PAWS rehabilitation manager.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife experts told PAWS the reason for so many distressed
bears last year was likely the poor berry crop in Eastern
Washington caused by drought.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson also said that housing and business developments are
encroaching on traditional bear habitat, creating problems for
bears that use those areas.
</P>
<P>
   The five bears all came from the same area in Wenatchee, Wash.,
Dyson said. A couple of the cubs were orphaned when their mother
was shot as a nuisance bear, she said. Several of the other cubs
were found thin and with coats in poor condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what happened to the mother. They wouldn't have
survived the winter if we hadn't rehabilitated them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those bears had to be sedated so they could be bathed to get rid
of mange and they were also given medicine to fight ringworm. They
were nourished back to health with fruits, mostly vegetables and
some dry dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Keepers were careful to avoid habituating the bears to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't go in with the bears,'' Dyson said. ``They don't see
us giving them food. We try not to stand there and stare at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, photographers are allowed to shoot pictures, but
otherwise there is normally no visual contact, Dyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bears that become too used to being around humans or, especially
bears that associate food with humans, are considered more likely
to become dangerous bears.
</P>
<P>
   Things got crowded at times at the PAWS center this winter,
Dyson said, with close to 14 bears there at one time.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 16 bears that came in during the year died under
anaesthesia and another had to be killed because its leg was too
mangled to be repaired after it was hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   One, which came from California early last year, was released
last summer. Two bears were released into the North Cascades two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Six were released during the winter. The center first induced
hibernation by cutting back on their food, laying out straw for
denning material, and creating dark, quiet conditions. The bears
were then sedated and moved to suitable denning locations that had
been found by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The five bears to be released on Thursday will travel across the
mountains towards Wenatchee in a convoy to Pateros. Three will go
to one area, and two will go to another area.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the bears released during the winter wear radio collars
and are being tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all seem to be doing fine,'' Dyson said.

TEAMSTERS REACH ACCORD WITH HAULERS OF NEW CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also AUTOMAKERS-EXPANSION, AUTO-SALES) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Averting a strike that would have disrupted the Big Three
automakers, the Teamsters' union and trucking companies that haul
new cars to dealers reached a tentative contract agreement
Wednesday in negotiations that were the first big test for James P.
Hoffa, the union's new president.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa trumpeted the four-year contract as a major triumph for
12,800 car-haul workers, increasing their pay and pensions and
providing health insurance to those who retire before the age of
65. In addition, the agreement for the first time provides coverage
of prescription drugs, supplementing Medicare, for retirees 65 and
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract serves notice the Teamsters are back,'' Hoffa
said in a news conference Wednesday morning at a hotel in
Arlington, Va., where at 1 a.m. the two sides had reached
agreement. ``This contract sets a new standard for working people
across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's backers hope that the accord, struck 25 hours after the
expiration of the old contract, is only one of many that will yield
impressive wage and benefit gains like those his father, James
Hoffa, achieved when he headed the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the new contract provided enough of a nod to management,
inc,uding the lack of a raise in the first year, that the
president's critics within the union were able to argue that it was
in no way a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Like a politician trying to put the best gloss on developments,
Hoffa boasted that the union had persuaded the car haulers to
surrender on two of their major demands: a lower starting pay for
new car-haul workers and increased use of part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, industry officials had argued that
they needed to reduce labor costs and gain more flexibility to keep
railroads and nonunion companies from increasing their share of the
car-haul market. But Ian Hunter, the chief negotiator for National
Automobile Transporters Labor Division, which represents 17
car-hauling companies, acknowledged that he had made numerous
concessions to prevent a walkout. ``We were very eager to avoid a
strike,'' Hunter said. ``And we have succeeded in one of our
acknowledged obligations, to improve the financial status of our
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts said a number of factors had given
Hoffa the upper hand at the bargaining table. With Detroit churning
out cars at record levels, even a short strike could have greatly
disrupted dealer sales, especially those of hot-selling cars.
Further, the nation's low unemployment rate would have made it
harder for car-hauling companies to find replacements for striking
workers. And the Wall Street boom has made it easier for the
industry and itr benefits fund to afford more generous pensions and
healdh coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously has won some important things in this
agreement,'' Harley Shaiken, a professor of industrial relations at
the University of California at Berkeley, said of Hoffa. ``He went
into it with important leverage. The automakers didn't want a
strike, and they leaned on their transporters.''
</P>
<P>
   The current average pay of the car-haul employees _ drivers and
the garage workers who maintain the trucks _ is about $20 an hour.
Under the agreement, which faces a ratification vote over the next
few weeks, they are to receive a $1,500 lump-sum payment, rather
than a raise, in the first year and then 50-cent-an-hour wage
increases in years 2, 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Further, those with 25 years' experience will be able to retire
at 55 with a $2,500 monthly pension; under the old contract, they
could not receive a $2,500 pension until 57.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the industry's chief negotiator, said the contract would
increase labor costs 3 percent to 4 percent each year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Terry Hewer, who as a business agent with Local 299 in Detroit
represents 850 car-haul workers, said: ``From what we've seen, it's
an excellent contract. The negotiating committee did a good job
meeting one of our biggest concerns, which was better pension
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa declared that he had forced the industry to drop plans to
use Mexican truckers to transport new cars to the United States
from Mexican factories. But Hunter maintained that management had
not put forward such a proposal. ``We never asked to use Mexican
drivers,'' he said, ``not once.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Paff, a longtime Hoffa critic who is national coordinator of
Teamsters for a Democratic Union, said the contract provided for
too many concessions. In particular, he cited a provision
eliminating much of the overtime pay that car-haul workers now
receive by working on weekends: In the Midwest and the South, the
new agreement will allow companies to hire new mechanics and pay
them straight time when they work on weekends, rather than time and
a half or double time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoffa's brought back concessions to the Teamsters,'' Paff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Big Three welcomed the agreement. A strike of much
duration at all could have cost the automakers hundreds of millions
of dollars in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy about it,'' said James Holden,
DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for sales and marketing.
``You'd hate to have anything like a transportation interruption
interrupt this market.''
</P>
<P>
   David Healy, an automobile analyst with Burnham Securities,
said, ``Generally car plants don't have enough space to store more
than a couple days' output, so a strike would have clearly involved
some plant shutdowns and some layoffs and would have whacked
profits.''

TODD-AO HIRES CONSULTANTS FOR POTENTIAL SALE OR MERGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Post-production specialist Todd-AO Corp.,
generating little enthusiasm on Wall Street in the past year, has
hired investment bankers to explore putting the company up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made Wednesday, had little effect on shares of
the Los Angeles-based company, which edged up 12.5 cents to
$8.6975, leaving the issue down 33 percent since it touched $13 a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the current market valuation does not reflect
Todd-AO's unique position and growing global reach in providing the
most technologically advanced post-production techniques to the
industry,'' says a printed statement from Salah Hassanein,
president and chief executive officer of the company created in
1952 from a partnership between late film producer Michael Todd and
American Optical.
</P>
<P>
   Hassanein said Todd-AO has retained Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. to
advise the company on options including a sale, merger or joint
venture. Company officials noted there has been no decision on a
specific option and said there is no assurance a transaction will
result.
</P>
<P>
   Todd-AO, which has won 19 Academy Awards including this year's
sound-mixing award for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' has been
aggressively buying smaller rivals to become a one-stop provider of
sound and video-editing services for Hollywood producers.
Burbank-based Four Media Co. has employed a similar strategy in
recent years, and its stock has also remained depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say many of Hollywood's service providers have been
hurt in the past year by intense competition and by major studios'
decisions to keep closer watch on spending and to give the green
light to fewer big-budget projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-production is a tough business to make Wall Street
notice,'' said entertainment industry analyst Arthur Rockwell.
``The street's not patient, and there are a lot of costs in
upgrading equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd-AO, which has facilities scattered throughout Los Angeles,
previously reported a 9 percent gain in profits to $3.4 million, or
35 cents a share, in the six months that ended Feb. 28, with
revenues up 31 percent to $62.3 million.

D/FW AIRPORT CENSORS TV COVERAGE OF CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON DICKSON and CAROL LEWIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS/FORT WORTH AIRPORT _ Overhead televisions usually
dominate the passenger waiting areas at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport
with nonstop news and e entertainment, but their screens were blank
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There were no TV reports of the deadly crash of American
Airlines Flight 1420 in Little Rock, Ark., hours after it had taken
off from D/FW.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, many passengers who had been traveling all
morning were unaware of the crash. Several heard the news from
passers-by after inquiring about the large number of reporters in
the terminals.
</P>
<P>
   In Terminal A, grief counselors turned their backs on media
cameras and quietly boarded a flight to Little Rock, where they
were to console and comfort survivors and victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplains were on duty in the three chapels at D/FW to talk to
anyone who wanted to talk.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping some of the harsher realities out of the terminals
by limiting TV coverage is routine after an accident, airport
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weller, a D/FW spokesman, said airport policy allows an
airport manager or an airlines official to cut off the TV monitors
if they believe the content will upset travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to show people that when they are getting onto
a plane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the televisions came on about 10:30 a.m., the programs were
mostly feature stories on fashion and business. The programming is
provided by CNN Airport Network, which features coverage that is
different from CNN's main newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wanted to get the news could find televisions in
restaurants and bars tuned to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Batiste, 28, a Little Rock attorney who flew to D/FW
Wednesday morning, noticed there was no news coverage of the crash
on the airport TVs and no talk of it among airline and airport
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell they were a lot more attentive to us today,''
she said. ``But when you walked into the airport, it was like
nothing had happened. Nobody was talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman who lives in Mountain Home, Ark., began trembling and
seemed to fight back tears when told of the accident as she boarded
a 12:42 p.m. flight to Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I am nervous. I am terrified,'' said the woman, who
identified herself as A. Davis. ``I don't usually fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew of the crash had questions.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Allman of Dallas, returning Wednesday from Little Rock
after his daughter's graduation, said many passengers on his flight
wanted to know why Flight 1420 tried to land in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got a lot of questions,'' he said. ``It was a pretty
bad storm last night. It started raining pretty tough about 11
o'clock last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock residents Del Medlin and his wife were relieved to
be on the ground after they arrived to visit their son at Baylor
University in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's original flight out of Arkansas Wednesday morning
was canceled, and they speculated that the aircraft for that flight
was the one that crashed Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we took off, I could see the wreckage. It was almost in the
Arkansas River at the end of the runway. There were big sections of
it,'' Medlin said.

EWING'S DEPARTURE LEAVES BOTH TEAMS UNCERTAIN AS TO ITS EFFECT ON
THE SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In 1994, his Game 7 tip-in against Indiana sent
the New York Knicks to the finals. A year later, his finger roll
off the back iron allowed the Pacers to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing's presence in the Eastern Conference's enduring
rivalry has been almost as luminous as Reggie Miller's the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   That fact was not lost on the Pacers Wednesday after they
learned that Ewing would miss the remainder of the playoffs because
of a partial tear in his left Achilles' tendon, suffered in Game 2
here on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see he was hurting,'' said Mark Jackson, the Pacer
point guard and Ewing's former teammate. ``I'm proud of him. He's a
warrior. A lot of guys wouldn't have even suited up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added: ``This is still going to be a difficult series.
The proof is there that the Knicks are a team that can deal with
adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Coach Larry Bird, Jackson and Miller were among
several Pacers who implied after Game 1 that Ewing was not as
injured as he or the Knicks claimed. The comments came after Ewing
played 40 minutes and scored 6 points down the stretch of a victory
at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Miller went so far as to end his post-game news conference on
Tuesday night by getting a dig in at Ewing for missing the game's
last shot.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the game often comes down to such situations, Miller
looked over at Ewing waiting in the wings and said, ``Isn't that
right, Pat?''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Miller and the Pacers were subdued by the news of
Ewing missing the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing often dominated his counterpart at center, Rik Smits, in
the early 1990s before Smits began maturing and developing as a
pivot player. Yet over the past two seasons, Smits began exploiting
Ewing's defensive liabilities when the Knick center returned from
wrist surgery last season and limped noticeably this season.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller's heroics are most remembered in the playoff series
between the two teams, Ewing hit his share of crucial shots against
Indiana in the post-season _ including a putback in the 1994
conference finals that vaulted the Knicks into the league finals.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, he made four consecutive free throws in the final
30.6 seconds to help insure the upset and give the Knicks
home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame because Patrick is such a great competitor and
has been a huge part of this great rivalry and the great games the
two teams have played,'' Miller said. ``The Knicks are still going
to be dangerous. It doesn't make our job any easier. It probably
makes it tougher because they will step it up even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Walsh, the Pacers' team president, said he noticed a
marked difference in Ewing between Games 1 and 2. ``He played 40
minutes in Game 1, and I saw him in the second game and was
surprised to see him limping,'' Walsh said. ``Maybe that took more
out of him than most people thought. I'm sorry to hear that. I
really do respect him as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he expected the Knicks to alter slightly their
offensive philosophy and try to force an up-tempo game when the
conference finals resume Saturday night in Game 3 at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Patrick is the go-to guy and all that,'' Walsh
said. ``But the rest of their team, we don't expect things to
change that much. We still think they're going to be a very
formidable team. For the most part, the other guys were the ones
playing huge roles along with Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh added: ``They'll get more defensive oriented, look for
transition baskets and look for mismatches on the floor and exploit
them. In some ways, because we're a big team, they could put a
bigger team out there with Patrick. Now they'll try to create more
mismatches.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing missed another critical shot Tuesday
night, but this time you felt there would be redemption. The
Knicks' younger, faster legs seemed to have the Eastern Conference
finals in control: they stole the opener in Indiana and Games 3 and
4 were at home. You knew the Big Fella would have one more chance.
But there will be no redemption. Not this season. Dr. Norman Scott,
the team physician, says the partial tear of Ewing's left Achilles'
tendon will mend without surgery; Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who rode
his warrior center hard, like a workhorse, referred to Ewing's
being in uniform for ``a few'' more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is clear now; not the series, Ewing's future, the
organization's future. The Knicks' foundation has unexpectedly
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering image from the Knicks' 88-86 loss in Game 2 came
when Ewing walked off the Market Square Arena court seconds after
his 14-foot jumper bounced long off the back of the rim. Ewing's
face tightened, and suddenly he let out a bellowing ``Aaaagggghhh''
that momentarily stunned Pacers fans in the midst of their
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   That roar encapsulated not simply one night of frustration but
many seasons of bitter disappointments. Now the season-ending
frustration had greeted him once again. This time it seemed a bit
too much to bear. That was the final shot at a championship this
season, perhaps ever.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has watched Ewing evolve from the bashful teen-ager
to the ferocious college player to the rugged pro knows that there
is so much agony and irony to his 14-year career. Even this latest
injury has a sorrowful symmetry: when he returned from a fractured
wrist last season, Indiana was the post-season opponent and the
Pacers won the series.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is leaving the post-season with a partly torn tendon,
Indiana is the opponent. Last year, Ewing was lauded for his
courage but criticized for upsetting the chemistry of the team.
This year, critics say he was the wagon wheel on the Knicks'
Ferrari. Critics agree that he is a presence that opponents must
contend with, but can't always agree whether that presence is
imposing or suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, without a championship Ewing's legacy is
unclear. Perhaps this accounts for the sense of urgency that
repeatedly has led Ewing to push his body seemingly beyond its
limits. John Thompson, Ewing's coach at Georgetown, watched Game 2
and spoke to Ewing Wednesday morning. For several months he had
tried to tell his former player to take it easy, that his pursuit
of a championship was becoming obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a thin line between desire and bad judgment,''
Thompson said ``Patrick crossed that line a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Patrick and I respectfully disagree with the fact
that he made himself get out there and play,'' Thompson said. ``But
I know why, I know what he wants and I know how he is.'' Thompson
said he never told Ewing not to play. ``I told him that it was
bordering on being dangerous, and every time the final buzzer would
go off, I'd breathe a sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the Knicks are better off without Ewing, better when
he's not in the game. Now we'll see. Ewing's season-ending injury
completely takes the training wheels off the new Knicks and all but
forces Van Gundy to rely consistently on a running game.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's loss may be a bigger nightmare for Indiana than the
Pacers realize, for it means that Marcus Camby will get more
minutes; the last person Indiana wants to see get more minutes is
Camby. The Pacers simply have no answer for the Knicks in
transition. If there could be a game with 1,000 fouls, Indiana
would take it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can say this about Ewing: in an era of so much
fans anger directed at millionaires who play games for a living,
and don't always put forth the effort, not a season, not a game has
gone by in Patrick Ewing's career _ college and professional _ that
he has not put forth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In a way this led to a breakdown of his body: he could not say
no. These are his Hall of Fame qualities: the ability to endure
pain, play with pain, play through pain. He inspired the team, even
as his presence sometimes helped hurt the team. Ewing wanted so
desperately to be part of a championship season. Now he'll watch
with an odd sense of ambivalence. If they lose, he can look back at
that missed 14-footer as the signature of his season. If they win?
If they win, in some ways that might be even more excruciating for
a player who prided himself on carrying the team on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he can only hope that his missed shot on Tuesday night
in Market Square Arena wasn't his final shot.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark.: as the plane 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The scenario that the storm approached one end of the runway
as the plane approached from the other probably is correct,''
Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather data show that conditions were relatively calm 27
minutes before the accident, Black said. At that time, the wind at
the airport was out of the south at about 10 mph and visibility was
seven miles with lightly scattered clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But two minutes after the crash, the wind was out of the west
with gusts to nearly 30 mph, Black said. The gusts of more than 80
mph were recorded five minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said Buschmann alerted them about 30 minutes before
the crash that storms were looming around Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A half hour before the crash, he said there were strong
(storm) cells,'' passenger Barrett Baber said. ``He said we were
going to try to go around them; that was the last I heard'' from
Buschman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on Runway 04, which points almost north, and
then veered off the left side of the 7,200-foot runway before its
end, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Richard Klamm said he was certain he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time the pilot made his first bumpy touchdown until
the plane came to a stop was about 20 to 25 seconds,'' said Klamm,
49, of Pine Bluff, Ark. ``While you are swerving back and forth,
you don't have time to see your life flash before your eyes. I was
just thinking, `Get this plane under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane touched down, it bounced, came back down and
bounced again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell the pilot did not have control of the craft,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it slid past the end of the runway, the plane turned right
into the large steel stanchion supporting the runway lights.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the fuselage was split just behind the cockpit, the
left side of the plane was ripped open by the steel light supports
and the left wing was torn off and crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   The tail of the plane separated from the rest of the fuselage.
Fire rolled through part of the plane, and some of the injured
apparently were seriously burned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting and rescue vehicles reached the scene within six to
seven minutes, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage because
they could not get emergency exits open, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Black called the plane ``a clean aircraft, with no maintenance
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was delivered to American in August 1983. As of April 30, the
plane had logged nearly 49,000 hours of service and been through
nearly 27,000 takeoff/landing cycles. One takeoff and one landing
constitute one cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at the brakes, the runway surface, drainage of
the runway and the runway's skid resistance in determining why the
aircraft was not able to stop,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we don't know how far down the runway the plane
touched down, and whether the pilot tried to get it back into the
air when he saw that he could not stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Wednesday whether wind shear _ a rapid change
in wind direction and speed that can bring an airliner crashing
down _ was a factor in the accident, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock airport has a low-level wind-shear detection
system but does not have the newer Terminal Doppler Weather Radar
that was developed for the FAA after the wind-shear crash of Delta
Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport in 1985, NTSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock Mayor Jim Dailey said he hopes that the
investigation shows that the city's emergency response was
``helpful in saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first commercial aviation accident at our airport,
and, at the least, we will use this as an opportunity to be more
prepared in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was en route to a speaking engagement in
Colorado, called Dailey from Air Force One to express his concern
for the crash victims and to offer his support in the
investigation, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also was asking about two friends of his who were on the
plane, Nancy and Craig Wood,'' the mayor said. ``I was able to tell
him that they both survived the crash and were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wood served in Clinton's administration while he was
governor of Arkansas, and Craig Wood is a member of the city's
water board, Dailey said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Focusing on ``what the pilots were trying to
do,'' federal investigators tried to determine Wednesday why an
American Airlines jetliner crash-landed in a severe thunderstorm,
slid off the runway, broke apart and burned, killing at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the 145 people on board the McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 were injured, some critically, as hysterical passengers
scrambled off Flight 1420 from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport when it
crashed while landing at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday. The left side of the
plane's fuselage was peeled away as it slammed into a large steel
structure that supports runway alignment indicator lights.
</P>
<P>
   All but one passenger had been accounted for by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told harrowing tales of escaping from the thick smoke
and roaring flames as a violent downpour, hail and wind gusts of 75
mph enveloped the wreckage at Little Rock National Airport, just
yards from the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so
thick we couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I pushed a few people, because your natural instinct to
survive just kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
recovered the flight data boxes from the cockpit. They may yield
information about what the pilots knew of the weather conditions
when flight controllers cleared them to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recovered recorders and the tower transmissions. From
here, we will go into understanding what the pilots were trying to
do,'' said George Black, an NTSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they
have to base that on the information they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Richard Buschmann, 48, one of six members of the flight
crew, was killed in the crash. His co-pilot survived with broken
legs and other serious injuries and was ``interviewed briefly,''
Black said, declining to say what the co-pilot told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The four flight attendants, all based at D/FW, also survived,
although two were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said that ``all of us'' at American ``are terribly
sorry that this accident has occurred. ... It is clearly a terrible
day for all of us at American Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said airline officials ``will be doing everything we can,
together with the team of investigators, to determine exactly how
and why this accident happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Delayed for two hours by turbulent weather in North Texas, the
flight was on the last leg of a journey that originated in Chicago,
with stops in Salt Lake City and D/FW before Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As it approached Little Rock, the plane ``started to rock pretty
good,'' said Kevin Mergel, 21, who was on the flight with other
members of the Ouichita Baptist University choir.
</P>
<P>
   After it touched down, ``I knew something was wrong when we
started to swerve,'' Mergel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to God he could straighten out,'' Mergel said,
referring to the pilot. ``He was trying to reverse it and correct
things before making a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University student, said the
plane was out of control immediately as the pilot struggled to slow
it down and keep it on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't,'' she told the ``Washington Post.'' ``I thought
we were never going to stop. Every time he would try to brake, we
would go to the left. I realized we were going farther and farther
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking out the window at the ground, and the third time
he tried to slow down, I saw the grass rushing by and knew we were
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NTSB was not ready to declare weather a factor in
the crash, conditions at the Little Rock airport deteriorated
rapidly as the aircraft approached the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, as
well as tapes of the conversations between the pilots and air
traffic controllers, will be reviewed ``to determine what the
pilots knew or were told about the weather before they landed, and
what they might have attempted to do once they got into trouble,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Steady winds of 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph were reported in
the Little Rock area just before the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have tried to
land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone told me there were 50-knot gusts at the airport, I
would be leaving town,'' said Cecil Ewell, who oversees all
American Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist George Wilken said radar
images showed the storm arriving in Little Rock about the same time
as the plane. MORE &QL;

ALBANY CHIEFS WANT TO SPEND MORE TO FIGHT TOBACCO USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The leaders of both houses of the Legislature
have called for a major increase in state spending on anti-tobacco
advertising and education, and Gov. George said Wednesday that he
would not be averse to such an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver proposed a $90 million a year
program, compared with the $6.5 million that the state now spends.
He said the effort should be financed in part by a state-mandated
price increase on tobacco products, to be included in the
long-delayed budget for the fiscal year that began April 1.
</P>
<P>
   That way, the state would not have to wait until the
disbursement of its $25 billion share of the $206 billion national
settlement with the tobacco industry begins, which could be a year
away.
</P>
<P>
   New York's anti-tobacco campaigns, which total $8.2 million a
year when federal grants are included, are far smaller, when
adjusted for population, than those of the eight other states that
have such programs. The biggest spenders are California, at $120.1
million a year, and Florida, at $70.4 million. Eleven other states
expect to begin anti-tobacco efforts in the next year; at least 10
of them plan to spend much more per capita than New York.
</P>
<P>
   In his proposed budget, Pataki called for financing the program
at the $6.5 million level over the next year. Several studies have
shown that advertising, in particular, can be effective in cutting
smoking rates, but anti-smoking advocates contend that New York
spends too little to make a dent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Pataki's response to such criticism was, ``If you
look at anything, the state could be spending more.'' He then
changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the governor, a Republican, said he would not
oppose a major increase in anti-smoking efforts as long as it was
in the context of a sound budget.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Democrats who control the Assembly nor the
Republicans who control the Senate included an increase for
anti-tobacco spending in the budget proposals they passed earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has been preparing a $90-million-a-year anti-tobacco
package for several weeks, and in an interview Tuesday he disclosed
its basic elements, saying they would become part of the Assembly's
position in budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Silver proposed a increase of five cents per pack in the
state-mandated minimum price for cigarettes _ effectively a tax
increase under a different name _ with two cents a pack going to
anti-tobacco programs like advertising and education.
</P>
<P>
   The programs would also get 10 percent of the state's share of
the national tobacco lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said he, too, wanted to see
some portion of the settlement money used for ``anything having to
do with education on the pitfalls of smoking.'' He said it should
be much more than the state now spends.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was wary, however, about the prospect of including an
increase in anti-tobacco spending in the next budget before the
settlement money is in hand.

A `STAR TREK' SERIES GOES GENTLY INTO DEEP SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' series finale bristles with
bang-up battle scenes and then takes its fans through a gentle rite
of separation.
</P>
<P>
   Seven seasons, nearly 200 episodes, and after this week it was
all one fine toss in a holosuite.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that's so bad _ beats the Bajor out of earthbound
drudgery. As the Ferengi barkeep Quark says, Earth is ``nothing
more than a rotating ball of boredom.''
</P>
<P>
   The concluding episode is called ``What You Leave Behind.'' It
begins where all creatures, earthling and alien, take pleasure: the
sack. Ezri Dax (Nicole DeBoer) and Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig)
are cuddling and promising each other that they'll survive the
impending battle.
</P>
<P>
   If you dropped out a while back, the Federation Alliance is
tussling with the Dominion from off in the Gamma Quadrant. It's bad
enough that the Jem'Hadar are fighting our heroes, but they're
joined on the Dominion side by the dreaded Breen and the
Cardassians.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: There's trouble in River City. Also, the
notorious Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo) is making mischief. Maybe he'll
be joined by his loathsome brother Cul de Sac. Kidding about the
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the audio and visual effects were missing from the
review tape sent to critics, but clearly this is an episode that
fills the screen with lots of pop _ battling starships firing
salvos, spinning out of control, burning and exploding
spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Can ships burn in space, without oxygen? Just wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners are taken. Executions are ordered. Backs are stabbed.
A few characters bite the dust or traipse into that big wormhole in
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the series finale seems to lurch to its conclusion
in fits and starts. It seems to end, and then exhales a few more
story threads. It's as if ``DS9'' doesn't really want to find the
exit.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of those endings involve Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery
Brooks), who must have a confrontation with his nemesis Gul Dukat.
</P>
<P>
   ``DS9'' also brakes for a final tribute to its principal
characters _ brief clips from previous episodes _ as they prepare
to disperse to destinations across the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The parting emphasis is on comradeship and the wonder of space,
with affection but a blessed minimum of sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   And what a lot of characters there are. Thirty years ago, the
original ``Star Trek'' made do with three characters _ Kirk, Spock,
McCoy _ at the center of the show. ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' tripled that, and ``DS9'' added still more characters
and deliberately accentuated their complex ties to one another on
the space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``DS9'' became so complicated that, truth be told, it barely
resembled its two predecessors, even though sometimes, in tribute,
it recycled story fragments from ``Star Trek'' and ``Star Trek:
TNG.''
</P>
<P>
   There are adversaries in any ``Star Trek'' _ Q, the Borg, Gul
Dukat, the shape-shifting Changelings of the Dominion. But ``DS9''
seemed to hit its highest notes with story lines among crewmates,
not with invading monsters.
</P>
<P>
   That ``DS9'' leaves its crew so widely scattered at its
conclusion might say something about a lack of future plans.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount says it isn't mapping a ``DS9'' theatrical movie,
which would involve reassembling the crew. (After last year's
``Insurrection'' disappointment, ``Star Trek'' is taking a rest
from the movies, period.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there plans, Paramount says, for a new TV series anytime
soon. The fourth ``Star Trek'' prime-time franchise, UPN's ``Star
Trek: Voyager,'' will have next season to itself in the Delta
Quadrant.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, though, you've got to believe that there will be
another TV startup. How about a series based at Starfleet Academy?
One of the ``DS9'' regulars, viewers learn this week, happens to be
headed in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   In a night of series resolution, the character left most in
limbo is none other than the station commander, Sisko.
</P>
<P>
   The way I had it figured, he would resign his commission, find
his bliss as a movie critic, team up with another critic and,
voila, ``Sisko &AMP; Ebert.''
</P>
<P>
   It would truly be a match made in the heavens.

GATES REMARKS IN MAGAZINE IMPEDE MICROSOFT LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. once again tried to show in court
Wednesday that the company was beset by potentially lethal
competition, even presenting as evidence an e-mail message from one
of its employees who called the competitive situation ``a very
scary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a Microsoft lawyer, Michael Lacovara, tried to make the
case that the personal computer business was seriously threatened,
he first had to get past comments that Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, made in an interview published by Newsweek magazine last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predicting the imminent demise of the personal computer has
become an annual ritual,'' Gates said. ``Well over 100 million PCs
will be sold this year. That means the world now buys almost as
many PCs as color TVs.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Fisher, the government witness facing cross-examination
from Lacovara Wednesday, raised the issue of Gates' remarks when
the lawyer tried to suggest that the operating systems in Sony's
new Play Station toy or in the Palm Pilot personal organizer could
pose a threat to Microsoft's industry-dominating Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara, of the Sullivan and Cromwell law firm, dismissed
Gates' observation, asking, ``Isn't that exactly what you'd expect
Gates to say publicly, given the nature of Microsoft's business?''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the rebuttal phase of the trial now under
way, Microsoft subpoenaed thousands of documents from America
Online, Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications Corp. about
the online service's purchase of Netscape and Sun's cooperative
role in the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara has not hidden Microsoft's excitement about what it
found in those documents, and he entered a few into evidence
Wednesday to support his assertion that Microsoft faces competitive
threats.
</P>
<P>
   One document, prepared last November by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
the investment banking firm that managed the Netscape acquisition
for America Online, lays out what Goldman took to be ``The
Strategic Rationale: The Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The first point in the plan said the company could extend
Netscape ``to be a more comprehensive desktop application, bundling
communications and productivity applications to absorb more share
of computing time, with the goal of becoming the user's de facto
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara also entered into evidence an e-mail message from last
July describing a meeting between Sun and America Online
executives. In the message, a Sun executive said America Online
planned to begin using a new browser on its service based on Java,
Sun's programming language. This, the Sun executive wrote, would
``break the deadly embrace with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the world's largest Internet service provider,
with some 17 million subscribers, has distributed Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser with its software since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's courtroom maneuvers were intended to persuade the
judge that Microsoft faces competitive threats that could undermine
the monopoly position that lies at the heart of the government's
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Several documents were entered into evidence under seal,
including every document obtained from America Online, at the
online service's insistence. But none of the public documents
showed that America Online subscribed to any of the opinions and
plans offered by the documents from Goldman and Sun.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it was not at all clear that any of it made much of
an impression on Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the
case without a jury. After Lacovara had introduced several of these
documents, Jackson calmly asked him to stop, noting that they were
``cryptic'' and the witness, Fisher, was not familiar with them.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Jackson added, ``All this is from last fall. It's
not clear whether this is current thinking or just wishful
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger point Lacovara offered was that America Online and
other companies were trying to counter Microsoft's dominance by
offering word processers, spreadsheets, e-mail programs, calendars
and other applications as online products that work with any
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   It was this budding business strategy that a Microsoft employee
called ``very scary,'' and Fisher acknowledged that Microsoft might
have reason to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is moving under our feet,'' Lacovara said on the
courthouse steps later.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the lead government lawyer, responded, ``The
fundamental issue for us is the operating system monopoly. And that
hasn't changed.''

ANALYSIS: THE CODE OF SILENCE AS A CO-CONSPIRATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (with NY-LOUIMA-TRIAL)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Narrowly speaking, Alan Vinegrad's job Wednesday was
simply to convince a jury of the guilt of four New York police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Vinegrad, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, crisply
proceeded through his summation, and as he recounted the intricate
sequence of events that culminated with an officer's jamming a
stick into Abner Louima's rectum, he also poured steaming buckets
of condemnation on a far larger target: the New York Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He told jurors of a sergeant _ not one of the defendants _ who
turned away from the sight of the filthy stick because he wanted to
``see no evil, hear no evil.'' He told them of one of the
defendants' mentors, a captain _ also not a defendant _ who
literally counted the days until he was reassigned out of the
despised Internal Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   He told of officer after officer _ none of them defendants _ who
did not raise one word of protest as Louima was marched through the
lobby of the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn, his pants
down around his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the four defendants. They are not as well
known as Justin Volpe, the former police officer who confessed last
week to tearing a hole in Louima's rectum and bladder. But as
Vinegrad argued the evidence Wednesday, he repeatedly sought to
connect their actions with the department's much-examined culture
of silence.
</P>
<P>
   It is a culture, he said, where officers felt free to inflict
``street justice'' against anyone who dared to raise a hand against
them. It is a culture, he said, where officers felt free to write
false arrest reports to cover up acts of brutality on innocent men.
It is a world, he said, where officers felt free to plot and lie
and evade when confronted by questions from Internal Affairs, or
even the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Vinegrad described a culture in which those who were
sworn to uphold the rule of law instead casually subverted it in
ways large and small.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial is about justice,'' he said in his summation. ``It
is about holding these defendants responsible for breaking the rule
of law and for taking the law into their own hands in a violent and
brutal way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the streets of Brooklyn. This is not the back of a
patrol car. This is not a station house bathroom. This is a court
of law. In this courtroom, the rule of law must prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have only begun their summations, but they, too,
had harsh criticism for the Police Department. They described their
clients as scapegoats for politically cowed police commanders.
</P>
<P>
   In their view of the evidence, the Police Department is a place
where officers rat out innocent comrades for the sake of a
promotion. It is a place, they said, where internal affairs
investigators lay treacherous traps during interrogations, hoping
to trick their brethren into saying something incriminating.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad dwelt at length on how police treated Patrick Antoine,
another Haitian immigrant who was arrested that night. At the time,
Antoine, 36, was walking home from a friend's house. He was minding
his own business; he had had nothing to do with the melee outside
the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Then Volpe _ searching for a man who had hit him in the face
outside the nightclub _ ran up behind Antoine. He screamed at him
to stop, and then he began beating him with his fists and
flashlight. It took seven stitches to close a cut in Antoine's
head.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad said that both Volpe and his supervisor, Sgt. Michael
Bellomo, soon realized that Antoine was utterly innocent, that he
was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But rather than admit
error, Vinegrad said, the two settled on an easier solution: ``Lock
him up on a trumped-up, phony charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad read to jurors reports Volpe and Bellomo wrote in which
they gave identical accounts of how Antoine attacked Volpe without
provocation, causing Volpe to suffer ``substantial'' pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds great, doesn't it?'' Vinegrad asked jurors. ``Very
official sounding. Good enough to lock Patrick Antoine up for all
sorts of different crimes: felony assault, obstructing government
administration in the second degree, disorderly conduct. Only one
problem. It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Bellomo deny they conspired to falsify charges against
Antoine. Even so, the trial testimony has shown that nearly every
single word in their reports about Antoine was factually incorrect,
and Vinegrad suggested that the notion of owning up to error was
never really an option in the culture of the 70th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do about a guy who's been assaulted unjustifiably
by a cop?'' Vinegrad said. ``I mean, do you go up to him and say:
`I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry Police Officer Volpe punched you in the
head and hit you with a flashlight and started a fight with you.
Would you like to file an excessive- force complaint?''
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad did, however, take note of one instance in which a
supervisor in the 70th Precinct seemed less concerned about
protecting his own than in seeing justice done.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the testimony of Officer Mark Schofield, one of the
first officers who came forward with incriminating evidence against
Volpe. Days after the bathroom assault, Schofield testified, he
sought the advice of a sergeant in the 70th Precinct, Jeff Fallon.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad said Fallon told the officer: ``If you know something
about what happened that night, if somebody actually did this to
Louima, then they are animals. They are not your friends. Don't go
protecting anybody.''

KWAN MAKES TOUGH DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The aspiring collegian stared at the essay question that was
part of her UCLA application:
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you looking forward to in life?''
</P>
<P>
   This was a compulsory exercise, a secondary component in the
overall judging. No one would have forgiven Michelle Kwan for
skating. With minimal exertion, she could have strung together
words that would have earned her high technical marks.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan could have written by rote the story of her disappointing
second-place finish to Tara Lipinski in the 1998 Olympic ladies
figure-skating competition and how she looked forward to competing
for the gold medal that had eluded her when the Winter Olympics
convene again, in Salt Lake City three years hence.
</P>
<P>
   No one would have been the wiser, save for Kwan. Only she would
have known that answer was no less a cop-out than turning a triple
toe loop into a double toe loop in the waning seconds of a free
skate. The truth is, if Kwan weren't looking forward to more in
life than skating, she wouldn't have bothered with a college
application.
</P>
<P>
   So that's where Kwan started her essay, with an admission:
</P>
<P>
   Whereas she once figured she'd just glide through life as a
skater, she'd now rather go to college and strive to be something
more, maybe even something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to fall into that rut and go the same old
route,'' said Kwan, a featured performer in Tom Collins' Champions
on Ice troupe, which will perform at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim
on Friday and at the Sports Arena on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people involved with skating and that's all they do.
I don't think life is about sticking to one thing. It's about
developing an all-around presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan has spent more than half her life wowing judges with her
jumps and her  &UR; !ital! &LR; joie de vivre &UR; !off! &LR; . But that's not the only
group on whom she has made an indelible impression. You can add to
the list the college admissions officers at UCLA, who green-lighted
the 18-year-old's entrance into the university. She will enroll as
a freshman in the fall, much to the consternation of the more
myopic members of the figure-skating community.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Dick Button was a freshman at Harvard in 1948
when he won his first Olympic men's singles title and that he
successfully defended his Olympic crown as a senior while balancing
the then-revolutionary triple toe loop with his thesis,
``International Socialism and the Schumann Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget that two-time U.S. Olympian Tenley Albright entered
Harvard Medical School after capturing the gold medal in 1956 and
that Debi Thomas was a premed student at Stanford when she took
home the ladies' silver medal from Calgary in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   It sends some people into a camel spin just thinking about Kwan
pulling all-nighters or possibly putting on the dreaded ``freshman
15.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a college degree to recognize hypocrisy in its
various hybrid forms. How is it that basketball player Baron Davis
is criticized for not bothering to finish his schooling at UCLA and
Kwan is criticized for bothering to start hers?
</P>
<P>
   Kwan scoffs at some of the feedback she has gotten. People have
told her she's making a mistake. ``Don't go to college,'' their
reasoning goes. ``You'll miss out on a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Kwan sees it, she can't afford not to go. Ten years down
the road she doesn't want to be like NASCAR superstar Jeff Gordon.
The driver who seemingly has everything expressed regrets in a
recently published interview about not having any college
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying that right now about going to high school,'' said
Kwan, who had private tutors for five years beginning in the eighth
grade, one of many concessions she made to her skating career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had the social life of regular school,'' said Kwan,
who made the 1994 Olympic team as an alternate at the age of 13.
``Most of all, I followed my dreams. Now I have a chance to catch
up in that experience. Now I have a chance to do something pretty
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Kwan how she'll fit ice time and ballet classes and
choreography sessions and cardiovascular work and a full class load
into a typical weekday. Her dorm room might be the only thing more
crammed than her schedule. She hasn't sat down yet with Frank
Carroll, her longtime coach in Lake Arrowhead, to devise a master
plan. The Champions on Ice summer tour concludes on June 19,
affording her the rest of the summer to figure things out.
</P>
<P>
   All she can say for sure is she's doing the right thing. The big
picture is clear in her mind, even if the details are a little
sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is best for my skating and what is better for Michelle?
That's sort of the dilemma I faced when I was making this
decision,'' said Kwan, who delayed college for a year to try life
as a full-time skater on for size.
</P>
<P>
   The fit was OK, but it was like a skating outfit that hugs the
skin. There wasn't a whole lot of room for growth. School, Kwan
decided at length, was just the accessory she needed to complete
herself and her skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just skate, you're putting everything on hold,'' Kwan
said. ``You're not really living your life. You can end up dwelling
on skating all the time. It's like, hmmm, I better work on that
triple lutz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be good in a way to have to juggle everything.
College is going to be a great diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   A great decision, too, no matter what happens in 2002. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Paul O'Neill didn't want to talk about the Mets'
three-game visit to Yankee Stadium that begins Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that big a deal,'' he said.
</P>

   The Yankees' right fielder didn't even want to talk about his
home run off Mel Rojas at Shea Stadium in the Yankees' 8-4 victory
in the opener of last year's Subway Series.

``It didn't mean that much. They didn't lose by one game, did
they?''

   Well, yes, come to think of it, the Mets did lose by one game.
In the National League wild-card race, they finished one game
behind both the Cubs and the Giants; the Cubs won the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mets were 9-7 against the American League East
in interleague games last year, losing two of three to the Yankees
kept them out of what would have been a three-way wild-card
playoff. And this season the Mets and the Yankees, along with most
of the other natural geographic rivals in both leagues, will be
playing each other six times, including the July 9-10-11 dates at
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   For the Yankees, those six could mean the difference between
first place and second place. For the Mets, the difference in a
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   On form, those six games figure to be more of a burden for the
Mets than for the Yankees. And the Mets don't think they got a fair
shake.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Mets' rivals has to play the reigning World Series
champions six times, although the Braves, the perennial NL East
champions, will be playing six games with the Red Sox, currently
the AL East leaders. If you're wondering what the Atlanta-Boston
connection is, Boston was the Braves' ancestral home before the
franchise moved to Milwaukee in 1953, then to Atlanta in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an equitable schedule,'' said Mets manager Bobby
Valentine, alluding to six Mets-Yankees games, ``but it's great for
the fans, and the fans make up the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But with half of their 18 interleague games in AL ball parks
this season, the Mets will be able to use the designated hitter in
nine games. Three potential wild-card rivals _ the Cubs, the
Cardinals and the Giants _ play only 6 of their 15 interleague
games in AL ball parks.
</P>
<P>
   The DH is the silliest rule in sports; one league uses it, the
other doesn't. But it gives the Mets a wild-card edge.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees were 4-2 against the Mets over the first
two interleague seasons, Joe Torre isn't enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare for us,'' Torre said recently. ``The fans
love it, the whole city is charged and that part is great, but the
outcome of the game is torture. There's so much made out of winning
and losing. I've got to pick up my dry cleaning. Those are the guys
that torture you.''
</P>
<P>
   But interleague games were adopted in 1997 for those guys who
work in the dry cleaners, those fans everywhere _ not for the
managers and the players who would surely prefer a peaceful weekend
series in Detroit or Florida to the cauldron that will be Yankee
Stadium this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, interleague competition should involve the Yankees
going against all of the NL teams each season, not just those in
the NL East. Or the Mets going against all of the AL teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mix and match the schedules, as the National Basketball
Association and the National Hockey League do when not constrained
by a labor dispute, so that each team visits every other city.
Think of the fun if the Dodgers, the Giants and, yes, the Arizona
Diamondbacks played in Yankee Stadium every season; if the Mets
played in Cleveland and Seattle. Yes, some interleague matchups
might not mean much. Tampa Bay in Milwaukee, or Kansas City in
Montreal. But every matchup would provide a new stage for the best
players and pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, for example, will be playing baseball in Yankee
Stadium on Friday night for the first time. Now in his seventh
season, all in the National League, the Mets' catcher sounded like
a little kid going there for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history,'' he said. ``The whole idea of you're playing
where Babe Ruth played. How can you not have more adrenaline?''
</P>
<P>
   And no matter what Paul O'Neill thinks about the first of two
Subway Series this season, how can you not think it's a big deal? &QL;

CHARISMATIC LIVES UP TO HIS NAME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Md.)   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He favors his great-grandfather. It is amazing how the genes
come through.
</P>
<P>
   He poked his great chestnut head through the open portal of a
727 Wednesday, the same stately way presidents and popes do when
they are visiting foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   His owner named him before ever laying eyes on him. He was just
a yearling with some Secretariat heritage on a slip of paper, and
Beverly Lewis named him Charismatic because, well, ``because
Charisma was a beautiful name, but Charismatic had a more masculine
sound to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever have it right. He flew up from Kentucky Wednesday
morning, outlasting the thunder and the lightning the way he had
outlasted all the contenders in the Derby and the Preakness. Now he
was coming North to race on Saturday in the Belmont, where his
great-grandfather once ran, ran like a Kentucky spring tornado with
a purpose.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The creamy-white plane had no markings on it, no logos to tip
off anybody about the precious cargo inside. Tethered a few spaces
away was a filly named Silverbulletday, one of the threats to keep
Charismatic from winning the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The plane taxied over to the tarmac at an air-cargo terminal on
the north end of Kennedy Airport, and was met by a portable ramp
from the H.E. (Tex) Sutton First Class Equine Air Travel company.
</P>
<P>
   Down came the trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, in jeans and boots, a
green jacket and white cowboy hat. Then came Lukas' favorite stable
pony.
</P>
<P>
   Then came royalty. The first part out the doorway was the nose
with the white marking, not quite as elongated as that of his
great-grandfather, but starting in the same spot, right between the
forceful eyes. Seeing Charismatic for the first time, I got the
chills.
</P>
<P>
   (For reference, I later went home and stared at the only sports
memento in my house, a photograph of me petting Secretariat in May
1989 at Claiborne Farm, courtesy of a sugar cube. They look alike.
And I am not the only one who thinks so.)
</P>
<P>
   The colt strode comfortably down the steep ramp, when he sensed
a couple of dozen photographers greeting the great chestnut hope.
They did not call out the way they would to a rock star or a
politician, but somehow Charismatic knew this was all about him,
and he turned that massive neck and chest to the right, as if to
say, ``All right, boys and girls, you've got 10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great horse, great horse,'' I heard a photographer say, while
looking through his lens. Then the horse was in the Sallee
transport van, en route to Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   When he emerged outside Barn 10, Charismatic was frisky and
composed, and his handlers washed him down, let him move his legs
in a modest field. He will do no serious training in New York
because Lukas did all the work back at Churchill Downs, seeing no
problem in shipping Charismatic 80 hours before the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my formula,'' Lukas explained later. ``After the
Preakness, we've always come in here on Wednesday. We went back to
Kentucky because our staff lives there, and it's always good to
sleep in your own beds, and keep costs down, but also these horses
don't handle change very well, and you want to keep them in their
own environment.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said he never second-guessed himself Wednesday in
Kentucky, even when a brutal storm postponed the flight by several
hours, but he conceded, ``I might really wish I hadn't, come Sunday
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was feeling pretty good after arriving at the
track just in time for the draw and discovering that Charismatic
had lucked out with the No. 4 post position. He said his colt got
off the plane in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows he's getting a lot of attention,'' Lukas
said, ``but I don't think he knows he's going to be a star on
Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   The former basketball coach tried to muster up his most
pessimistic version of the trip to New York. ``It's just like the
NCAA and the NBA,'' he said. ``It's tough to win on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say this is the road. Charismatic once nearly
slipped away in a claiming race, but his bloodlines are very good,
including a great-grandfather who won the Belmont by 31 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic never knew his great-grandfather. Secretariat passed
from this world on Oct. 4, 1989, and Charismatic was foaled on
March 13, 1996, a few miles away in Bluegrass country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same expression, the same ears, the same little crest in
the neck, the same muscles,'' Lukas said later.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lukas received a call from Ron Turcotte, who rode
Secretariat to the Triple Crown, and they talked for 40 minutes,
finishing each other's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we make Charismatic finish his gallop, he gets mad
because he wants to run more,'' Lukas said. ``He kicks at the
ground. Or he runs an extra eighth. Turcotte said Secretariat was
exactly like that.''
</P>
<P>
   They all know there can never be another Secretariat (another
Babe Ruth, another Ali), but they do know that racing is waiting
for a Triple Crown champion. Some of these genes have been this way
before. &QL;

FIGHT FOR JAPAN PHONE CARRIER BECOMES TEST ON OPEN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ One of the largest shareholders in International Digital
Communications, the target of a takeover fight between Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and Cable and Wireless PLC, said
Wednesday that price would not be the sole determinant of its
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corp., which holds a
17.7 percent stake in International Digital, a struggling Japanese
phone carrier, said that his company had made no decision yet but
that such matters as the preservation of jobs and the potential
impact on Japan's reputation for resistance to foreign investment
would be weighed alongside the price.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over International Digital, the first takeover
fight pitting a Japanese company against a foreign one, has been
cast as a test case of Japan's willingness to open one of the few
relatively strong areas of its economy to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   International Digital's board has said that the decision whether
to accept one of the offers is up to shareholders. Toyota, as one
of the largest shareholders, has a pivotal role, as does Itochu
Corp., which holds a stake of the same size. Naoki Kitajima, a
spokesman, said Itochu had made no decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cable and Wireless, which also owns 17.7 percent of
International Digital, raised its all-cash offer to 69 billion yen,
or $570 million at current exchange rates, plus the assumption of
International Digital's debt. The improved offer came in response
to a sweetened offer from Nippon Telegraph. Details were not
disclosed, but NTT's offer is believed to be worth 68 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless contends that NTT has not made a firm bid
under Japanese law because of restrictions on it as a
government-controlled company. The offer is dependent on changes in
the law that would not take effect until October at the earliest,
while the new Cable and Wireless offer is good until June 15.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Okuda, who is considered one of the most
progressive Japanese executives, suggest that the barriers to entry
may be cultural as much as regulatory and that the standard rules
of the takeover game will have to change to accommodate elements of
Japanese corporate culture, with its dedication to preserving
employment.
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, it is unclear exactly why Nippon
Telegraph and Cable and Wireless are so eager to acquire
International Digital. The company is about one-fifth the size of
KDD, Japan's largest international carrier, but shoulders roughly
five times the debt, according to Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Telegraph could use International Digital to start an
international business, but it could just as easily do so on its
own, analysts say. Cable and Wireless could use International
Digital to gain a bigger presence in the Japanese market but at
some expense to its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   As the new chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers
Associations, Okuda finds himself in this case torn between that
organization's pledge to help ease the record unemployment in Japan
and the interests of Toyota's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he found himself having to address the subject of
Toyota's plans for its International Digital stake Wednesday at the
employers federation's regular news conference, where his main
agenda was to have been to urge the government to move quickly to
devote as much as 8 trillion yen, or $66 billion, to combating
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors have long complained that Toyota places other
interests ahead of their own. Its investment in noncore businesses,
which range from telecommunications to financial services and real
estate development, have not mirrored the success of its auto
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming harder for Toyota to ignore those voices now that
it wants to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, in
part because it hopes to attract more foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Telegraph and Cable and Wireless have tussled before. A
few years ago, analysts said, they disagreed over the disposition
of an NTT subsidiary called NTT Personal, in which Cable and
Wireless had a stake. Ultimately, Nippon Telegraph had its way and
the business was handed over to NTT Docomo, the company's former
mobile-phone business that was partly spun off earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But not without some hard feelings. ``Cable and Wireless has
made an enemy of NTT one time already,'' said Makio Inui, a senior
telecommunications analyst at Nikko Salomon.

ADVERTISING: RFK JR. PUSHES BOTTLED WATER TO AID ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a seemingly incongruous image: Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. _ crusading environmental lawyer, member of the famous
Kennedy dynasty and potential political candidate _ in a meeting
with local supermarket executives to persuade them to distribute a
new product.
</P>
<P>
   But the product has a catch that helps the picture make sense.
Keeper Springs' Mountain Spring Water is being introduced to
finance efforts to preserve and protect local waterways nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about selling a bottled water, it's about
getting out a message,'' Kennedy said during an interview at Pace
University Law School's Environmental Litigation Clinic Inc., where
he runs a team that has successfully won more than 150 legal
actions totaling more than $1 billion in judgments against
polluters of the Hudson River over the last decade. The cleanup of
the Hudson River is now a national environmental model.
</P>
<P>
   Using seed loans from friends and family, Kennedy and other
environmentalists formed Tear of the Clouds LLC to introduce Keeper
Springs, which is named after the 35 ``keeper'' groups across the
country that protect and improve local waterways.
</P>
<P>
   To get out its message in the crowded field, Keeper Springs is
introducing a print and outdoor campaign in the New York area, with
a budget estimated at $2 million to $3 million that zeros in on the
clean waterways cause.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is being created by DeVito/Verdi in New York, which
was selected in April after a review involving 10 shops. The
initial ad is boldly political. The headline asserts, ``After just
one sip, you've done more for the environment than most
politicians.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that the ad reflected his years of frustration
fighting the rollback in national environmental regulations, which
he said was backed by big money polluters with political clout.
Besides his work at Pace, Kennedy is also the chief counsel for the
national Water Keeper Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth sailing for Keeper Springs is by no means assured. The
product is coming to market against some 500 other bottled waters
and the industry is starting to consolidate among powerhouses such
as Nestle's Poland Spring, Danone Group's Evian and waters marketed
by the beverage giants Pepsico and Coca-Cola, said Michael Bellas,
chairman of Beverage Marketing Corp., the consulting concern that
provides annual reports for the International Bottled Water
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Bellas also questioned whether consumers were moved enough by a
cause to make a purchase, noting that other good causes have tried
to bottle water without much success, including some municipalities
in Texas and an Indian tribe in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough go,'' Bellas said. ``Ten years ago, it was like a
field of dreams _ you bottled water and they came. Now it's far
more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy who bears a striking resemblance to his late father,
said he and John Hoving of the Hudson Riverkeeper environmental
group came up with the idea while skiing in New York State and saw
that the ski area was marketing its own water. With financing an
issue, the Hudson Riverkeeper was seeking new income sources, and
had signed a licensing agreement with Sony Signatures to use its
name on sunglasses, hats and outdoor apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, hey we could do this,'' Kennedy recalled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like much political advertising, Keeper Springs' campaign is
direct and to the point. One ad shows New York's East River in the
year 2026: with New York's skyline serving as a panoramic backdrop,
a beautiful woman swims in azure water amid the fish. Other ads
feature such headlines as ``All our profits go to cleaning up the
environment. Bottled Water doesn't get purer than that'' and ``To
532 endangered species, it's holy water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a very clear point of difference, and we
should push that difference,'' said DeVito/Verdi president Ellis
Verdi.
</P>
<P>
   For the bottle itself, a Tiffany's designer created the
product's blue, red and white label with an oval disk of a colorful
mountain lake scene and the message ``All our profits to the
environment,'' set off by stars. The label also gives a brief
history of the Hudson Riverkeeper, which spawned a national
movement, and urges people that ``if you want clean water, fight
for it!''
</P>
<P>
   Working in Keeper Springs' favor is a booming bottled water
market. Bottled water accounted for $4.3 billion in sales last
year, with premium brands showing the fastest growth, up 30 percent
last year to about $1 billion, according to Beverage Marketing.
Today, about half of all adults drink bottled water, said Tear of
the Clouds general manager Gil Solnin . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Solnin said research by Newman's Own, which was founded by actor
Paul Newman to help charities, showed that some 70 percent of
consumers would try a product if it benefited a cause they cared
about.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's name has been mentioned often as a possible candidate
for political office in New York state. But Kennedy, the third
child of Robert F. and Ethel Kennedy, dismissed the notion that the
bottled water would help him put his name and record in the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's name does not appear on the product, but as company
founder he will help publicize the product and he also might be
able to draw some celebrity support. The annual Hudson Riverkeeper
dinner, for instance, is usually a celebrity draw and has welcomed
guests like actors Harrison Ford and Billy Crystal, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Keeper Springs is being introduced first in the New York
metropolitan area and will move then throughout the Northeast
before eventually going national.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heavy competition, distribution in the New York area
has been excellent, Solnin said, and he credited Kennedy's efforts
with helping the product get shelf space in a crowded market.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy said it was the environmental cause that had
resonated with the supermarket executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, I didn't have to show up; they loved the
idea,'' Kennedy said. ``They've been very supportive.'' &QL;

L.A. AGENCY SETS SCHEDULE FOR SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CITYHOOD
HEARINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: With budgeted story BC-INFORMATION-GAG-LADN) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Public hearings into San Fernando Valley cityhood
should begin by late July, officials for the agency overseeing the
breakup study decided Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A day after receiving Valley VOTE's proposal for what the
unprecedented study should include, a Local Agency Formation
Commission committee set an ambitious work schedule that counts on
the city to cooperate fully in providing data for the comprehensive
financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule could be further complicated by the San
Pedro-Wilmington secession drive, as community leaders turned in
Wednesday what they said are more than enough petition signatures
to gain a cityhood study of their own.
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO is sending the Valley VOTE proposal to all City Council
members, Mayor Richard Riordan and all city departments. LAFCO
leaders want the city to respond by June 30 so the agency can
decide what the study will include and approve a request for
information for the city at a public hearing July 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to begin to move on this,'' said Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the LAFCO committee
assigned to the cityhood issue.
</P>
<P>
   While LAFCO must hold the July meeting as required under state
law, its committee will do most of the work culminating with a
possible citywide vote in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The committee set its hearing schedule for the third Thursday of
every month beginning in August. They will be scheduled in the
evening to encourage attendance and will be held across the San
Fernando Valley and the San Pedro-Wilmington area.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders were encouraged with the committee's
decision to reach out to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Valley VOTE process, this is a public process.
LAFCO by law has to make the decisions, but they have to hear from
the public,'' said Richard Close, chairman of Valley Voters
Organized Toward Empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   If the study finds secession would be financially neutral for
both the Valley and the remaining city of Los Angeles, LAFCO would
put the secession plan on the ballot. It would have to be approved
by a majority of voters in the Valley and in the city as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders said the group's proposal seeks a
comprehensive and fair study.
</P>
<P>
   The secession group's plan would divide the city's assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenditures equitably between the Valley
and the remainder of the city. Buildings, land, libraries, parks,
facilities, infrastructure, equipment and vehicles already within
the Valley would become the property of the new proposed city.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE also proposes that regional facilities, notably Los
Angeles International Airport, the Port of Los Angeles, and the
Department of Water and Power, be managed through joint operating
agreements. They would be negotiated for as long as three years
after a favorable public vote.
</P>
<P>
   The LAFCO committee did not comment on Valley VOTE's proposal.
Members sought to set a tone that plays no favorites in the
possible municipal divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to caution against getting too cozy,'' Yaroslavsky
said. ``I think from this point forward we have to have a public
disclosure role.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky was responding to a suggestion from Valley VOTE
leaders that the LAFCO committee work closely with city and Valley
VOTE leaders to deal with any disagreements during the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps the integrity of the process a lot to have
everyone lay out their cards as early as possible,'' said Bob
Scott, who chaired the Valley VOTE committee that prepared the
study proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky said the full LAFCO commission will decide any
disagreements based on recommendations from his committee.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders told the committee they appreciate the
agency's position as the study's arbiter. Yet they fear that city
officials will resist or oppose what they contend should be a
smooth study process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (this month's) deadline creates the need for the city
to have a unified response vs. a bureaucratic response. Will it be
cooperative or a stone wall, we will have to wait and see,'' Close
said.
</P>
<P>
   How to pay for the study remains a potential hurdle. The cost is
pegged at between $1.8 million and $2.6 million and primarily would
pay for economic and legal consultants.
</P>
<P>
   While state lawmakers, and city and county officials wrestle
with the funding issue, LAFCO is compiling a list of consultants so
they can be interviewed and ready to work when funding is
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, we're just looking at a good divorce
lawyer,'' joked City Councilman Hal Bernson.

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ During his campaign a year or so ago to
reassure anxious Germans about adopting a new European currency,
then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted at almost every opportunity
that the euro would be ``as strong as the deutsche mark.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, five months after the euro's well-publicized debut, the
original fear has proved almost exactly wrong. It is not the euro
that is dragging down Germany, but German issues that are dragging
down the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Having dropped nearly 12 percent against the dollar since its
introduction on Jan. 4, the European single currency reached a new
low here Wednesday of $1.0327, settling later in New York at
1.0355, and is inching ever closer to the economically
insignificant but politically mortifying level of 1-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's plunge has ignited a round of finger-pointing between
European political leaders and European central bankers, who met
Wednesday and refused to intervene on behalf of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also put the spotlight on Germany, which accounts for
one third of the 11-nation euro zone's total output, and on its
Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Otmar Issing, the European Central Bank's chief economist and a
former top official at the German central bank, said this week that
Germany is in danger of becoming ``the sick man of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth is running well below 2 percent, slower than any
other euro zone country but Italy. Its exports are languishing,
investment capital is heading overseas and unemployment remains
stuck above 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And at the center of all that is a continued paralysis over
reducing Germany's high tax rates and making its rigid work rules
more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Irish or the French
that are pulling down the value of the common currency,'' wrote
Oliver Schumacher on the front page of Wednesday's issue of Die
Zeit, the influential German weekly. ``No, it is above all the
Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   The political implications are profound. Schroeder, who is
playing host at a meeting of European heads of government on
Thursday in Cologne, had hoped to produce a common declaration on
plans to fight unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But he was unable to reach agreement with France, and the
meeting will in any case be overshadowed by the euro's decline and
by deliberations over the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to the Yugoslav war, which has given Schroeder
the image of a refreshingly tough leader on foreign policy, the
chancellor's popularity has climbed in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic problems have ignited a new wave of criticism
about what his detractors call a rudderless leadership.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the euro has other problems. Investors were rattled
last week when European finance ministers agreed to let Italy run a
slightly higher budget deficit than it had originally promised. The
war for Kosovo underpins such pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists agree that German stagnation is the biggest
problem. More than anything else, they say, the euro's decline
stems from a glaring contrast between slow growth in Europe and the
continuing surge of the U. S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   And that disparity stems primarily from Germany as well as
Italy, which together account for about half of the euro zone's
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   France's output is growing at an annual rate of more than 2
percent. Many smaller European countries _ Finland, the
Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Ireland _ are growing well above 3
percent annually, overcoming problems caused by the Asian financial
crisis and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, with its high degree of flexibility, has
managed to get through the problems fairly well and so did some of
the smaller countries'' in Europe, said Thomas Mayer, a senior
economist at Goldman, Sachs here. ``But Germany has not.''
</P>
<P>
   German government officials dismissed such criticism Wednesday,
arguing that the euro's decline was not a problem in itself and
that German growth would accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident of a pickup in the second half of the year,''
Economics Minister Werner Mueller, said in an Italian newspaper
interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A weak euro does give Europe a lift because exports become
cheaper and therefore more competitive in the American and other
foreign markets. But the euro's decline also undermines its
credibility and puts the European Central Bank in an increasingly
difficult position.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because European growth has slowed so sharply, the
central bank cut its base-line interest rate to 2.5 percent from 3
percent early in April. If the bank now tried to defend the
currency by raising rates, it would very likely slow European
economies further. Bank officials also argue that attempts to
intervene in world money markets would almost certainly be futile.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank,
appeared tired and impatient with reporters' questions about the
euro's decline after a board meeting here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These very short-term volatile movements in exchange rates _
I'm inclined to play them down,'' Duisenberg said. But other board
members, notably the outgoing president of the Bundesbank, Hans
Tietmeyer, have said in the last few days that they are unhappy
about the euro's fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Duisenberg tried to dampen expectations about
intervening in world markets, but he left himself room for
maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will comment on intervention when it is necessary to do
so,'' he said, adding that ``the issue of intervention was
discussed only to the extent that we spoke about what I should say
when a question comes on the issue of intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   The key question, though, comes back to Germany and Schroeder.
Gerhard Grebe, an economist here with Bank Julius Baer, said
investors were closely watching what his new finance minister, Hans
Eichel, would propose in its next round of tax reforms, due on June
30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new government created a lot of uncertainty that damaged
the relationship with the corporate sector,'' Grebe said. ``If
Eichel comes up with really substantive cuts in corporate rates and
real relief, then everybody will realize there is a change in
public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Schroeder has shown little willingness to challenge
the orthodox socialist wing of his Social Democratic Party on some
major policy issues. Indeed, he has ignited a new round of protests
from industry groups by pushing through laws that remove the
tax-free status of people in low-paying part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a complete failure to act on structural
reforms,'' said Stephen Bell, an economist at Deutsche Bank
Securities. ``Indeed, they've been marching in the other
direction.''

COMMENTARY: SCALPING LAW TRIMS WALLETS OF KNICK FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you wanted to see the New York Knicks play the
Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis Tuesday night, you could have bought
a seat for $65 from a ticket broker. But if you'd like to see them
play this weekend in Madison Square Garden, expect to pay at least
$250.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for this price difference is that New
York is a much bigger city with more affluent fans competing for
seats. But you find a similar gap even when you compare New York
with Los Angeles, another metropolis with lots of wealthy fans.
</P>
<P>
   During the first two rounds of the basketball playoffs, when the
Lakers were still in contention, brokers were selling tickets to
games in Los Angeles for $50. The cheapest seats available in New
York during those earlier rounds cost three to four times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Why so much more? Perhaps the main reason is that so many
politicians are determined to protect us. Unlike California and
Indiana and most other states, New York outlaws ticket scalping,
and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has just issued an inch-thick
report demanding even stiffer penalties for scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's law, which was renewed this week by the Legislature,
makes it illegal to resell a ticket for more than 10 percent above
the face value. Ticket brokers have evaded the law by operating in
New Jersey and Connecticut, but they still run the risk of
prosecution if they make a deal with anyone in New York. These
restrictions on the legal flow of tickets have fostered black
market practices and prices.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people in Los Angeles and Indianapolis can resell
tickets for whatever they want, so the holders of season tickets to
Laker and Pacer games can readily profit by selling their playoff
seats to brokers. And although the brokers are legally free to
charge astronomical prices, there are so many tickets on the open
market that they cost less than in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you allow tickets to be openly traded, the more
you'll see prices come down,'' said Stephen Happel, a professor of
economics at Arizona State University at Tempe. He has seen this
process firsthand in Phoenix, where he helped persuade the
authorities to establish areas outside sports arenas at which
licensed brokers, street scalpers and fans can sell tickets on game
day at any price they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is such an anomaly,'' Happel said. ``Right there
under the shadow of Wall Street, you're trying to turn people into
criminals for buying and selling pieces of paper that are
essentially no different from call options. But you can't defeat
the laws of demand and supply. The more restrictions you put on
selling tickets, the more you'll drive up prices, and the more
you'll encourage hard-core criminals to get in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminal results of the current law are amply documented in
the report issued last week by the attorney general. His
investigators took more than four years studying brokers and box
office employees to discover what was already known by economists
and citizens of the old Soviet Union: When you fix the price for
something below its market value, people will pay bribes to get
their hands on it.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the widespread corruption should be combated by
classifying box office bribery and ticket scalping as felonies.
(They are now misdemeanors.) But why not eliminate the crime wave
by eliminating the crime? In an interview, the attorney general was
asked why a ticket broker shouldn't be as free to set prices as,
say, a real estate developer like Spitzer's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could make a theoretically powerful argument in favor of
lifting price controls on tickets,'' Spitzer said. ``But a
legislative decision was made to impose the controls, and that has
created an attendant problem of commercial bribery. All we're
trying to do is eliminate the bribery that has become endemic in
the ticket industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer did have some words of encouragement for New Yorkers who
would like the same freedom to buy tickets as people in other
states. He suggested that box offices at arenas and Broadway
theaters could start selling market-priced tickets on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they could eliminate the middleman,'' Spitzer said,
``and auction off tickets on Ebay directly to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is intriguing, but it's hard to imagine the local box
offices doing anything so creative very soon. For now, the cheapest
way to see the playoffs is to drive to Indianapolis.

 &HT;    Polk un-retires to coach Georgia Bulldogs
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ Ron Polk, one of the most celebrated baseball
coaches in NCAA history, has decided to come out of retirement and
take over the struggling program at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement could come as early as today with a
news conference in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Polk, 55, has been an assistant athletics director at
Mississippi State for the past two years after serving 22 years as
the Bulldogs' coach. In that span he won 888 games and took
Mississippi State to the College World Series five times. He is one
of three coaches to take three different schools to the CWS. He
went with Arizona as an assistant in 1966 and with Georgia Southern
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual SEC spring meeting here, Georgia athletics
director Vince Dooley would neither confirm nor deny that Polk
would be replacing Robert Sapp, who recently was reassigned in the
athletics department.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at his home in Starkville, Miss., Polk would say only:
``I can't say yea or nay. There's a lot going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk returns to the state where he broke in as a head coach.
After serving as an assistant at Arizona (1966), New Mexico (1967)
and Miami-Dade South Community College (1968-71), Polk was hired as
head coach at Georgia Southern in 1972. A year later he had the
Eagles in the CWS.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in Statesboro, Polk was hired at Mississippi
State, where he won four SEC championships and took the Bulldogs to
the CWS in 1979, 1981, 1985, 1990 and 1997. At Mississippi State,
he coached 27 All-Americans and 12 future major-leaguers, including
Will Clark and Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 years as a head coach, Polk has a record of 1,043-486. He
has taken teams to the NCAA Tournament 17 times, winning six
regional championships. His 888 wins at Mississippi State are the
most in SEC history.
</P>
<P>
   Polk stepped down after the 1997 season in order to turn the
program over to Pat McMahon, one of his proteges. But after two
years of administrative work, Polk informed friends earlier this
year that his batteries had been recharged and that he was ready to
coach again.
</P>
<P>
   He has coached amateur baseball all over the world and was a
coach on U.S. Olympic teams in 1988 and 1996. He is a member of the
athletics hall of fame at both Georgia Southern and Mississippi
State.
</P>
<P>
   Polk was the national coach of the year in 1973 and 1985.

TALENT ABOUNDS AND ISSUES EMERGE FOR WOMEN'S OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Kan., Ill.)  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ On the course, it has been another
interesting year for women's professional golf. Karrie Webb leads
the LPGA money list and has won four times this year. Kelli Kuehne,
a two-time U.S. Amateur Champion, won her first professional
tournament last month.
</P>
<P>
   Two other young players with star potential recently decided to
turn professional: Jenny Chuasiriporn, a runner-up at least year's
U.S. Open, and Grace Park, who recently won the National Collegiate
Athletic Association individual women's championship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the U.S. Women's Open begins Thursday at the Old Waverly
Golf Club, a picturesque course in northeastern Mississippi some
150 miles from Memphis, women's golf is still facing challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For example, why has next year's Women's Open been scheduled for
the same week as the 2000 British Open at St. Andrews, a conflict
that could diminish the attention given the women's event?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Women's Open attract more attention and publicity at
more heavily populated sites, rather than in more rural areas, such
as this year's site and the 2002 site, Hutchinson, Kan.?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions were answered by Mary Capouch, chairman of the
U.S. Golf Association's women's committee, at a pretournament news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the conference was called to announce that the 2002
Women's Open would be held at Prairie Dunes Country Club in
Hutchinson. But with women's golf heading toward the next century
blessed with new talent but facing some of the same old issues, the
subject quickly changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have grown so much in just the last five years; we feel we
can take the Women's Open anywhere and be successful,' Capouch said
talking about taking the tournament to non-major market areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the easiest marketing area, but we had somebody
who really wanted us, and a $900,000 commitment from the state of
Mississippi to help market the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Capouch was also asked about the discrepancy in prize money
between the men's and women's U.S. Open champions _ $625,000 for
the men's winner this year, and $315,000 for the women's winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on that,'' Capouch said. ``We're proving our
worth as a USGA championship and our attendance is growing. We hope
our prize money will grow, and we're working on it each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about next year's Women's Open at the Merit Club in
Libertyville, Ill., going head-to-head against the British Open,
Capouch remained optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is going to have that much bearing on the
Women's Open,'' Capouch said. ``Libertyville is a northern suburb
of Chicago. We expect to get good crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   If this year's Women's Open can match the excitement of the
previous two, the tournament will be terrific. Se Ri Pak won in
memorable fashion last year over Chuasiriporn, prevailing in an
18-hole Monday playoff that went two extra holes. In 1998, Nancy
Lopez thrilled the gallery and almost fulfilled her career-long
quest to win an Open, before losing by one stroke to Alison
Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   This year's course, although particularly challenging on the
back nine, has wider fairways and lower roughs than other recent
Open cites, meaning there will be more birdie opportunities, and
probably more players with a realistic chance to win. Wednesday's
weather was not unbearably hot, with highs in the upper 80s but the
humidity could rise this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Among those to watch in the 150-player field:
</P>
<P>
   _Webb, who has been the Ladies Professional Golf Association's
most-dominant player this year, but who is still looking for her
first major.
</P>
<P>
   _Dottie Pepper, who won the year's first major, the Nabisco
Dinah Shore.
</P>
<P>
   _Park, playing her last tournament as an amateur, is one of the
longest hitters in the field and confident she can do what
Chuasiriporn did last year.
</P>
<P>
   _Lopez, who will once again be the sentimental favorite, but who
is bothered by a sore left knee.
</P>
<P>
   _Juli Inkster, who has won three majors, but never the Open,
although she finished second in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '92 Open was really tough; I still think about it a lot,''
said Inkster, who has won two tournaments this year. ``When you
grow up as a little kid you want to win the U.S. Open. That's what
you practice for. That's what you watch. That's what you see. To
get your name engraved on that trophy is the ultimate''  &QL;

AFTER 5 STRONG MONTHS, AUTO INDUSTRY IS ON TRACK TO SET ANNUAL
SALES RECORD

 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Auto executives were exuberant Wednesday as May's car
and truck sales propelled the industry toward its best year ever.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weak results from General Motors Corp., the industry's
sales rose 5.3 percent in May compared with results in the period a
year earlier, when sales were also stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 17.3
million was surpassed only by a rate of 17.8 million set in
December 1986. Anything more than an annual rate of 15 million is
considered strong.
</P>
<P>
   For the first five months of 1999, buyers have snapped up 6.9
million cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks,
well ahead of the 6.4 million they bought in the first five months
of 1986 _ the industry's best sales year.
</P>
<P>
   ``May was a blockbuster sales month for Ford and the industry _
stronger than we expected,'' said Robert Rewey, Ford Motor Co.'s
group vice president for marketing, sales and service. ``A record
year is within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford sales rose 8.1 percent, to 379,153 vehicles. Light-truck
sales climbed 5.8 percent, while car sales rose 11.5 percent. The
results exclude Volvo, which Ford bought earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are responding to strong economic fundamentals _
growth in jobs and income, low inflation and interest rates, as
well as innovative products,'' &UR;  &LR; Rewey said. ``We believe those
fundamentals will keep U.S. auto sales healthy for the rest of
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler, the American unit of DaimlerChrysler AG, had its best
month ever. ``We're thrilled with the performance for the month,''
said James P. Holden, executive vice president for sales and
marketing at DaimlerChrysler. ``It's been a great five months.'' He
predicted the industry would exceed the record of 16.1 million
vehicles sold in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's sales rose 5.9 percent, to 264,732, with car
sales up 1.5 percent and sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans
and pickup trucks up 7.7 percent. The company's Mercedes-Benz unit
saw its sales rise 6.8 percent, to 16,732.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's sales gains came despite a 4.4 percent sales
decline last month at GM, compared with its sales in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market this month once again was really hot,'' said Roy S.
Roberts, vice president and group executive for North America
vehicle sales, service and marketing at GM, which sells more cars
and trucks in the United States than any other company. So far this
year, GM's sales are running 1.3 percent higher than they were in
the first five months of last year.
</P>
<P>
   GM's car sales dropped 6.7 percent, while its sales of sport
utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks fell 1.9 percent. Most
of the declines came from Chevrolet, GM's largest division, where
sales fell 11.4 percent. Sales of full-size sport utility vehicles
like the Suburban, the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon were so weak that
GM executives are considering whether to offer rebates on them to
bolster sales.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Corp. said its sales rose 4.7 percent, to 142,625,
in May compared with results in the period a year earlier, and an
executive there said the industry's sales pace seemed to have
climbed to a new level. ``There seems to be a developing consensus
that this is a new plateau, not merely a surge,'' said Yale Gieszl,
executive vice president at Toyota Motor Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Honda Motor Co.'s sales rose 6 percent, to 98,158, last month,
with sales of pickup trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles
jumping 42.6 percent because the Odyssey minivan is proving so
popular. Car sales inched up 0.4 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Five years of strong sales, which seem to be only getting
stronger, have prompted Honda and many other automakers to announce
plans to build new factories or expand existing factories.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly because sales have been so strong this year,
automakers were relieved to learn Wednesday that the teamsters'
union and the vehicle-transport companies that deliver new cars to
showrooms had averted a strike by agreeing to a new four-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the threat of a car-transporter strike behind us, we are
looking forward to a strong summer selling season,'' said Dick
Colliver, executive vice president of American Honda.

CRASH RESPONSE TEAM ANTICIPATES CATASTROPHE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a demonstration of one the grim realities
of the airline business, American Airlines was able to launch a
huge, well-planned response to the crash of Flight 1420 late
Tuesday night in Little Rock in a matter of hours _ precisely
because it had a anticipated such an event.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, every key executive in the company's
crisis response management team was in place at the airline's
high-tech System Operations Control Center near Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport, at American's headquarters a half-mile away, or tied into
the crisis response team by phone.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 a.m., two jets filled with members of the airline's
Customer Assistance Relief Efforts, or CARE Team, and the technical
experts who make up its emergency response ``Go Team'' were
airborne and headed for Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30, the cafeteria in the company's headquarters had been
turned into a fully equipped media conference center with cable
connections for live TV hookups, risers and platforms for
photographers, broadcast-quality audio hookups for radio reporters
and a buffet table for the horde of reporters and other news media
members who descended on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As terrible as all of this is, we recognize that it is part of
the industry,'' said American spokesman Al Becker, who has been
involved in crisis response efforts after six fatal American or
American Eagle crashes in his nearly 30 years with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have a plan in place _ and hope we never to put
it into effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the crash about 11:50 p.m. Tuesday, Art
Pappas, managing director of American's Systems Operations Control
Center, was phoned and told of the crash. Pappas called Robert
Baker, American's executive vice president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, the two men were in position at the head
of huge, U-shaped conference table in the ``bridge'' room
overlooking the main control room at the SOC, a room the size of
two football fields that looks much like NASA's Mission Control,
only about 10 times larger. Gathered around them were senior
representatives of nearly every effected department: flight
operations, ground operations, safety, scheduling, cabin service,
meteorology, reservations, corporate communications, legal and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission, Becker said, was to ``immediately regain control
of the situation to whatever degree we can and to begin responding
in the most effective, and most humane way we can to the tragedy
that had just occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   That response includes subtle efforts to protect the airline's
image. American made sure its news media briefing room had no
American signs or insignia visible. Two speakers' lecterns with
American Airlines logos used for happier events sat in the corner
of an adjacent room, while American executives stood behind a plain
brown lectern.
</P>
<P>
   But Becker downplayed the efforts at image damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of protecting the image flows from how well you
perform under great adversity,'' he said. ``And it evolves into how
you take care of the passengers and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps in activating American's plan was to call
in some of its 1,200 CARE team members _ American employees
systemwide who have volunteered to respond to the scene of an
accident to aid survivors and victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   (American was criticized early Wednesday because families who
awaited the flight at Little Rock's airport were initially confused
about what had happened.)
</P>
<P>
   While the airline has long had a practice of assigning employees
to the families of passengers involved in a crash, six years ago it
instituted a formal and thorough training process for its CARE Team
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are authorized to do whatever is necessary to make sure
that families are comfortable,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Wednesday, American had activated 213 CARE Team
members, Becker said. Of those, 121 were either in Little Rock or
en route there. Each of those team members will be assigned to a
family affected by the accident.
</P>
<P>
   CARE Team members are given carte blanche to pay for funerals,
hotel accommodations, meals, transportation and whatever else
victims or their families need.
</P>
<P>
   Most survivors, for example, needed new clothes because the ones
they were wearing when they escaped the crash were ruined by jet
fuel, mud and rain. Whatever remains of their luggage was still on
board the stricken plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our responsibility,'' American Airlines spokesman Mark
Slitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But David Stempler, president of the Airline Travelers
Association in Washington, D.C., said Wednesday that that sense of
responsibility has been a relatively recent development for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone full circle from the less-than-caring, barely
responsible agencies and airlines to those who find this policy to
be more effective,'' Stempler said. ``It's a good business
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also federal law. In 1996, President Clinton signed the
Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act, which gives survivors
someone to turn to for information after an aviation accident.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was written after the 1996 crashes of TWA Flight
800 off Long Island, N.Y., and a ValuJet plane in the Florida
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Stempler said bending over backward for the families of victims
and survivors serves the airlines in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines that pride themselves on service, like American, want
to be there in bad times as well as good,'' he said. ``Airlines get
criticized if they do a bad job of it.''

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Focusing on ``what the pilots were trying to
do,'' federal investigators tried to determine Wednesday why an
American Airlines jetliner crash-landed in a severe thunderstorm,
slid off the runway, broke apart and burned, killing at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the 145 people on board the McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 were injured, some critically, as hysterical passengers
scrambled off Flight 1420 from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport when it
crashed while landing at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday. The left side of the
plane's fuselage was peeled away as it slammed into a large steel
structure that supports runway alignment indicator lights.
</P>
<P>
   All but one passenger had been accounted for by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told harrowing tales of escaping from the thick smoke
and roaring flames as a violent downpour, hail and wind gusts of 75
mph enveloped the wreckage at Little Rock National Airport, just
yards from the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so
thick we couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I pushed a few people, because your natural instinct to
survive just kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
recovered the flight data boxes from the cockpit. They may yield
information about what the pilots knew of the weather conditions
when flight controllers cleared them to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recovered recorders and the tower transmissions. From
here, we will go into understanding what the pilots were trying to
do,'' said George Black, an NTSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they
have to base that on the information they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Richard Buschmann, 48, one of six members of the flight
crew, was killed in the crash. His co-pilot survived with broken
legs and other serious injuries and was ``interviewed briefly,''
Black said, declining to say what the co-pilot told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The four flight attendants, all based at D/FW, also survived,
although two were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said that ``all of us'' at American ``are terribly
sorry that this accident has occurred. ... It is clearly a terrible
day for all of us at American Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said airline officials ``will be doing everything we can,
together with the team of investigators, to determine exactly how
and why this accident happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Delayed for two hours by turbulent weather in North Texas, the
flight was on the last leg of a journey that originated in Chicago,
with stops in Salt Lake City and D/FW before Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As it approached Little Rock, the plane ``started to rock pretty
good,'' said Kevin Mergel, 21, who was on the flight with other
members of the Ouichita Baptist University choir.
</P>
<P>
   After it touched down, ``I knew something was wrong when we
started to swerve,'' Mergel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to God he could straighten out,'' Mergel said,
referring to the pilot. ``He was trying to reverse it and correct
things before making a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University student, said the
plane was out of control immediately as the pilot struggled to slow
it down and keep it on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't,'' she told the ``Washington Post.'' ``I thought
we were never going to stop. Every time he would try to brake, we
would go to the left. I realized we were going farther and farther
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking out the window at the ground, and the third time
he tried to slow down, I saw the grass rushing by and knew we were
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NTSB was not ready to declare weather a factor in
the crash, conditions at the Little Rock airport deteriorated
rapidly as the aircraft approached the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, as
well as tapes of the conversations between the pilots and air
traffic controllers, will be reviewed ``to determine what the
pilots knew or were told about the weather before they landed, and
what they might have attempted to do once they got into trouble,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Steady winds of 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph were reported in
the Little Rock area just before the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have tried to
land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone told me there were 50-knot gusts at the airport, I
would be leaving town,'' said Cecil Ewell, who oversees all
American Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist George Wilken said radar
images showed the storm arriving in Little Rock about the same time
as the plane. MORE &QL;

LITTLE ROCK, Ark.: as the plane 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The scenario that the storm approached one end of the runway
as the plane approached from the other probably is correct,''
Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather data show that conditions were relatively calm 27
minutes before the accident, Black said. At that time, the wind at
the airport was out of the south at about 10 mph and visibility was
seven miles with lightly scattered clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But two minutes after the crash, the wind was out of the west
with gusts to nearly 30 mph, Black said. The gusts of more than 80
mph were recorded five minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said Buschmann alerted them about 30 minutes before
the crash that storms were looming around Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A half hour before the crash, he said there were strong
(storm) cells,'' passenger Barrett Baber said. ``He said we were
going to try to go around them; that was the last I heard'' from
Buschman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on Runway 04, which points almost north, and
then veered off the left side of the 7,200-foot runway before its
end, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Richard Klamm said he was certain he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time the pilot made his first bumpy touchdown until
the plane came to a stop was about 20 to 25 seconds,'' said Klamm,
49, of Pine Bluff, Ark. ``While you are swerving back and forth,
you don't have time to see your life flash before your eyes. I was
just thinking, `Get this plane under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane touched down, it bounced, came back down and
bounced again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell the pilot did not have control of the craft,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it slid past the end of the runway, the plane turned right
into the large steel stanchion supporting the runway lights.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the fuselage was split just behind the cockpit, the
left side of the plane was ripped open by the steel light supports
and the left wing was torn off and crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   The tail of the plane separated from the rest of the fuselage.
Fire rolled through part of the plane, and some of the injured
apparently were seriously burned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting and rescue vehicles reached the scene within six to
seven minutes, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage because
they could not get emergency exits open, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Black called the plane ``a clean aircraft, with no maintenance
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was delivered to American in August 1983. As of April 30, the
plane had logged nearly 49,000 hours of service and been through
nearly 27,000 takeoff/landing cycles. One takeoff and one landing
constitute one cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at the brakes, the runway surface, drainage of
the runway and the runway's skid resistance in determining why the
aircraft was not able to stop,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we don't know how far down the runway the plane
touched down, and whether the pilot tried to get it back into the
air when he saw that he could not stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Wednesday whether wind shear _ a rapid change
in wind direction and speed that can bring an airliner crashing
down _ was a factor in the accident, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock airport has a low-level wind-shear detection
system but does not have the newer Terminal Doppler Weather Radar
that was developed for the FAA after the wind-shear crash of Delta
Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport in 1985, NTSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock Mayor Jim Dailey said he hopes that the
investigation shows that the city's emergency response was
``helpful in saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first commercial aviation accident at our airport,
and, at the least, we will use this as an opportunity to be more
prepared in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was en route to a speaking engagement in
Colorado, called Dailey from Air Force One to express his concern
for the crash victims and to offer his support in the
investigation, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also was asking about two friends of his who were on the
plane, Nancy and Craig Wood,'' the mayor said. ``I was able to tell
him that they both survived the crash and were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wood served in Clinton's administration while he was
governor of Arkansas, and Craig Wood is a member of the city's
water board, Dailey said.

L.A. MAYOR PUTS TIGHT LID ON DATA FOR CITYHOOD STUDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: With budgeted story BC-LA-SECESSION-LADN) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In only the 10th executive order of his six years
in office, Mayor Richard Riordan has imposed tight controls on what
city financial information will be shared with the agency
overseeing cityhood for the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan ordered all department heads to funnel all data intended
for the Local Agency Formation Commission study through interim
City Administrative Officer Paul Cauley, Chief Legislative Analyst
Ron Deaton and the Mayor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Long concerned that the city's resistance to secession would
lead to a lack of cooperation in the study, Valley Voters Organized
Toward Empowerment leaders saw the executive order Wednesday as the
first step in a ``gag order'' intended to discourage bureaucrats
from dealing directly with LAFCO staffers or consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fair interpretation when no information can go
to LAFCO or the public without the consent of the CAO and the CLA
that that will have a chilling effect on the distribution of
important public information,'' said Valley VOTE chairman Richard
Close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filter process sends a subtle, or not so subtle message:
Don't talk to the public without the clearance of the CAO or the
CLA.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the May 11 executive order obtained Wednesday showed
that Riordan, an outspoken secession opponent, had told department
heads that all responses for the LAFCO study must first be reviewed
and, if necessary, revised, by Cauley, Deaton and Riordan's office.
</P>
<P>
   The directive states the procedures are necessary to ensure
coordination of the information, as well as to be able to defend
and explain the facts provided.
</P>
<P>
   We must ensure ``that our efforts are coordinated,'' Riordan
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Cauley, who according to the directive would oversee the data
collection, refused to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral Chief of Staff Kelly Martin said the directive is a
``good faith'' effort to come up with a procedure that will provide
information in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is overblown,'' she said. ``This is just a way to
coordinate responses. Usually when people want a bunch of
information they normally want to know where the coordination point
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said neither LAFCO nor Valley VOTE was notified of the
directive because it was considered to be a ``purely internal''
organizational tool. She added that the Mayor's Office felt it was
being responsive to the concerns of LAFCO and Valley VOTE that
there be an identified place to put forward requests and to receive
information.
</P>
<P>
   She said LAFCO consultants likely would interview managers
directly, though probably in the presence of a person from one of
the coordinating offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a good-faith commitment to work cooperatively and
to get the facts out, and this directive is totally consistent with
that. There is nothing sinister about this, about having a central
collection point. Many times we have coordinated things through the
CAO. We think the facts need to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaton, the council's top adviser, said the city should be able
to present its view of the information, but added he sees no
problem in theory to LAFCO having direct access to managers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick said the process
represents a ``kind of behind-closed-doors'' approach that excludes
the public.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wants a council committee that would oversee
LAFCO's request for information and the city's responses, thereby
providing public forums.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said a committee appointed by council President John
Ferraro would give the public and council a chance to see the
information and allow for a broader consideration of contrasting
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure information is provided in an expedient,
accurate, fair and appropriate manner,'' Chick said. ``It certainly
should not be left up to city staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Calemine, LAFCO's executive officer, said state law allows
the agency to ask for city information, but does not specify a
procedure or penalty for failure to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Calemine said the commission likely would test the city and
perhaps even the law if it feels stonewalling by the city is taking
place, but until then would refrain from trying to guess its
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to take the position that all parties will be honorable
and cooperative until there is evidence to the contrary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   General managers, some of whom said they hadn't paid much
attention to the directive, said they were unsure how to interpret
it. Some said that in the absence of any LAFCO requests to date
they have not set up the internal procedures specified by the
mayor, including designating a high-ranking department point
person.
</P>
<P>
   Tony DeClue, assistant general manager in the Department of
General Services, said the department is ``obliged to follow the
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the department -- which is responsible for some 800
buildings, more than 9,000 vehicles and about 25 aircraft -- will
work out a system after the first requests for information arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll run the first one up the flagpole and see what works,''
he said.

CHARISMATIC IS 2-1 CHOICE FOR TRIPLE

<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Charismatic flew through thunderstorms into New
York Wednesday morning for the final scene in his Triple Crown
drama. The chestnut colt was accompanied by three horses who will
try to snatch the Belmont Stakes from his grasp and shepherded by
his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who was wearing a white cowboy hat and
keeping a wary eye on his celebrated horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the crossroads in racing,'' Lukas said, taking the
broad view after stabling Charismatic in his stall at Belmont Park.
``Tracks are changing ownership and the business is searching for
answers. A Triple Crown winner would be an enormous thing for
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he made it clear that winning the Triple Crown would be an
enormous thing for the entire Charismatic team, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic has responded at every turn,'' Lukas said. ``He's
had three great runs, in the Lexington, the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness. If he gets one more, we'll all be very happy. If he
doesn't, we'll still be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   After being delayed two hours in Louisville by weather,
Charismatic was led down a ramp from the chartered horse plane and
up another ramp into a van for the short trip from Kennedy Airport
to Belmont Park. Then Lukas hustled upstairs just in time to take
part in the draw for the Belmont Stakes, and was rewarded when
Charismatic drew the No. 4 post position in the starting gate and
was made the 2-1 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve horses were entered in the race, which will be run for
the 131st time Saturday and which has completed Triple Crown honors
for 11 winners, though none since Affirmed in 1978. It has also
meant the end of the dream for 14 horses, including the last six
who tried, starting with Spectacular Bid in 1979 and reaching a
peak of drama in the last two years, when Silver Charm and Real
Quiet lost thrillers at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, the trainer of Silver Charm and Real Quiet, will
try to spoil the Lukas scenario when he runs the filly
Silverbulletday, who drew the No. 3 slot alongside Charismatic and
was made the third choice at 4-1 behind Charismatic and Menifee at
7-2. Baffert already had flown to New York from Churchill Downs the
night before the horse caravan arrived, and Lukas played a teasing
game with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some really bad weather in Louisville that delayed the
boarding of the horses,'' he said, with a smile. ``They were all
eager to get on the plane _except Silverbulletday. She was
reluctant to get on.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, undaunted by any suggestion that his filly might resent
the challenge of racing 11 colts a mile and a half, later replied
with a straight face: ``Wayne said she traveled beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert, trying to put the task into perspective, added:
``Fillies can take only one of the Triple Crown races. If she had
trained this way before the Derby, we would have entered her in the
Derby. But the Derby wasn't the right time for her. The Preakness,
we drew the outside post. Now, we've cranked up her works. She's a
classy filly who moves effortlessly, and we'll find out if she's
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like Lukas, he also viewed the Belmont Stakes
philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this two years in a row,'' he said. ``You
have to have a great horse to win two Triple Crown races. We need
stars in racing. And you have two of them running Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Three, if you count Menifee. His trainer, Elliott Walden, who
spoiled Real Quiet's bid last year when Victory Gallop won the
Belmont by a nose, appeared with his two rival trainers at the draw
ceremony. ``Menifee is showing less strain than Victory Gallop
did,'' he reported. ``In the Derby, he ran a great race. I think he
could have won if he got turned loose a little earlier. In the
Preakness, he was dominated by Charismatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The two horses who accompanied the stars on the flight were
Pineaff, winner of the Tampa Bay Derby, and Prime Directive, second
in the Derby Trial and the Illinois Derby. Both were listed on the
early line as 30-1 long shots. The only horses in the Belmont with
single-digit odds were Charismatic, Menifee, Silverbulletday and
Best of Luck, winner of the Peter Pan Stakes, who was fourth choice
at 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Post position in the Belmont Stakes is not particularly
important because the track is wide and the distance long, giving
the horses plenty of room and time to get into position for their
best moves. &QL;

LITTLE ROCK, Ark.: as the plane 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The scenario that the storm approached one end of the runway
as the plane approached from the other probably is correct,''
Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather data show that conditions were relatively calm 27
minutes before the accident, Black said. At that time, the wind at
the airport was out of the south at about 10 mph and visibility was
seven miles with lightly scattered clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But two minutes after the crash, the wind was out of the west
with gusts to nearly 30 mph, Black said. The gusts of more than 80
mph were recorded five minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said Buschmann alerted them about 30 minutes before
the crash that storms were looming around Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A half hour before the crash, he said there were strong
(storm) cells,'' passenger Barrett Baber said. ``He said we were
going to try to go around them; that was the last I heard'' from
Buschman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on Runway 04, which points almost north, and
then veered off the left side of the 7,200-foot runway before its
end, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Richard Klamm said he was certain he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time the pilot made his first bumpy touchdown until
the plane came to a stop was about 20 to 25 seconds,'' said Klamm,
49, of Pine Bluff, Ark. ``While you are swerving back and forth,
you don't have time to see your life flash before your eyes. I was
just thinking, `Get this plane under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane touched down, it bounced, came back down and
bounced again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell the pilot did not have control of the craft,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it slid past the end of the runway, the plane turned right
into the large steel stanchion supporting the runway lights.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the fuselage was split just behind the cockpit, the
left side of the plane was ripped open by the steel light supports
and the left wing was torn off and crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   The tail of the plane separated from the rest of the fuselage.
Fire rolled through part of the plane, and some of the injured
apparently were seriously burned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting and rescue vehicles reached the scene within six to
seven minutes, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage because
they could not get emergency exits open, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Black called the plane ``a clean aircraft, with no maintenance
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was delivered to American in August 1983. As of April 30, the
plane had logged nearly 49,000 hours of service and been through
nearly 27,000 takeoff/landing cycles. One takeoff and one landing
constitute one cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at the brakes, the runway surface, drainage of
the runway and the runway's skid resistance in determining why the
aircraft was not able to stop,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we don't know how far down the runway the plane
touched down, and whether the pilot tried to get it back into the
air when he saw that he could not stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Wednesday whether wind shear _ a rapid change
in wind direction and speed that can bring an airliner crashing
down _ was a factor in the accident, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock airport has a low-level wind-shear detection
system but does not have the newer Terminal Doppler Weather Radar
that was developed for the FAA after the wind-shear crash of Delta
Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport in 1985, NTSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock Mayor Jim Dailey said he hopes that the
investigation shows that the city's emergency response was
``helpful in saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first commercial aviation accident at our airport,
and, at the least, we will use this as an opportunity to be more
prepared in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was en route to a speaking engagement in
Colorado, called Dailey from Air Force One to express his concern
for the crash victims and to offer his support in the
investigation, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also was asking about two friends of his who were on the
plane, Nancy and Craig Wood,'' the mayor said. ``I was able to tell
him that they both survived the crash and were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wood served in Clinton's administration while he was
governor of Arkansas, and Craig Wood is a member of the city's
water board, Dailey said.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Focusing on ``what the pilots were trying to
do,'' federal investigators tried to determine Wednesday why an
American Airlines jetliner crash-landed in a severe thunderstorm,
slid off the runway, broke apart and burned, killing at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the 145 people on board the McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 were injured, some critically, as hysterical passengers
scrambled off Flight 1420 from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport when it
crashed while landing at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday. The left side of the
plane's fuselage was peeled away as it slammed into a large steel
structure that supports runway alignment indicator lights.
</P>
<P>
   All but one passenger had been accounted for by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told harrowing tales of escaping from the thick smoke
and roaring flames as a violent downpour, hail and wind gusts of 75
mph enveloped the wreckage at Little Rock National Airport, just
yards from the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so
thick we couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I pushed a few people, because your natural instinct to
survive just kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
recovered the flight data boxes from the cockpit. They may yield
information about what the pilots knew of the weather conditions
when flight controllers cleared them to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recovered recorders and the tower transmissions. From
here, we will go into understanding what the pilots were trying to
do,'' said George Black, an NTSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they
have to base that on the information they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Richard Buschmann, 48, one of six members of the flight
crew, was killed in the crash. His co-pilot survived with broken
legs and other serious injuries and was ``interviewed briefly,''
Black said, declining to say what the co-pilot told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The four flight attendants, all based at D/FW, also survived,
although two were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said that ``all of us'' at American ``are terribly
sorry that this accident has occurred. ... It is clearly a terrible
day for all of us at American Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said airline officials ``will be doing everything we can,
together with the team of investigators, to determine exactly how
and why this accident happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Delayed for two hours by turbulent weather in North Texas, the
flight was on the last leg of a journey that originated in Chicago,
with stops in Salt Lake City and D/FW before Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As it approached Little Rock, the plane ``started to rock pretty
good,'' said Kevin Mergel, 21, who was on the flight with other
members of the Ouichita Baptist University choir.
</P>
<P>
   After it touched down, ``I knew something was wrong when we
started to swerve,'' Mergel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to God he could straighten out,'' Mergel said,
referring to the pilot. ``He was trying to reverse it and correct
things before making a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University student, said the
plane was out of control immediately as the pilot struggled to slow
it down and keep it on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't,'' she told the ``Washington Post.'' ``I thought
we were never going to stop. Every time he would try to brake, we
would go to the left. I realized we were going farther and farther
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking out the window at the ground, and the third time
he tried to slow down, I saw the grass rushing by and knew we were
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NTSB was not ready to declare weather a factor in
the crash, conditions at the Little Rock airport deteriorated
rapidly as the aircraft approached the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, as
well as tapes of the conversations between the pilots and air
traffic controllers, will be reviewed ``to determine what the
pilots knew or were told about the weather before they landed, and
what they might have attempted to do once they got into trouble,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Steady winds of 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph were reported in
the Little Rock area just before the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have tried to
land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone told me there were 50-knot gusts at the airport, I
would be leaving town,'' said Cecil Ewell, who oversees all
American Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist George Wilken said radar
images showed the storm arriving in Little Rock about the same time
as the plane. MORE &QL;

CHARLES PIERCE, 72, IMPERSONATOR OF SCREEN DIVAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Pierce, a female impersonator who found fame in his
witty satirical sendups of stage and screen icons, died on Monday
at his home in Toluca Lake, Calif. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Don Lee Kobus, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the form, Pierce set the stage for a future
generation of impersonators but preferred to be known as an actor
rather than a drag queen. No one who was anyone escaped inclusion
in his vast repertory of leading ladies, whom he wickedly
caricatured ``with slashing histrionic flashes of insight,'' said
Clive Barnes in The New York Times, reviewing Pierce's first New
York performance in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant mimic, Pierce was legendary for his poignant
rendition of Katharine Hepburn as Coco Chanel and for his onstage
re-enactments of the battles between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford
in ``Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,'' in which he played both
roles. His portrait gallery also included Gloria Swanson, Mae West,
Tallulah Bankhead, Carol Channing and Barbra Streisand. He was,
Barnes wrote, ``the living equivalent of an Al Hirschfeld
cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Watertown, N.Y., Pierce began working as a radio
announcer at 16 before moving to Los Angeles two years later to
study acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. After performing
sporadically in Off Broadway and regional theater for several
years, he accepted a job in 1954 at Club La Vie in Altadena,
Calif., in hopes of a steady income. Dressed simply in a tuxedo and
carrying a box of props, he took the stage and deftly created a
succession of characters based on the intonation of a voice or the
look in an eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time I was the only entertainer working for a salary
in a gay situation in Los Angeles,'' Pierce recalled in a 1997
interview. ``I opened myself up by appearing there because in those
days I never would have been hired from there to do a television
sitcom. Today it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   He performed continuously for the next 36 years in clubs and
theaters across the United States and Europe, his audiences
peppered with celebrities including Angela Lansbury, Lucille Ball,
Sir John Gielgud, Anthony Hopkins, Vladimir Horowitz and Rudolph
Nureyev, many of whom suffered his skewering gladly.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared as a guest on television series including
``Designing Women,'' ``Fame,'' ``Laverne and Shirley'' and ``Love,
American Style,'' as well as numerous talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

SKRUDLAND AND STARS READY TO WIN GAME 7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brian Skrudland kneeled in the Dallas Stars'
dressing room Wednesday and tied the skate of his 8-year-old son,
Simon.
</P>
<P>
   It was more attending to the details for Skrudland, whose role
as the Stars' fourth-line center has consisted mainly of doing the
little things in this postseason run. But in Friday night's seventh
and deciding game of the Western Conference finals, Skrudland wants
the play of the fourth line to be the headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing we have to realize is that we can do more,
each one of us can do more,'' the Stars center asserted. ``I mean
Brian Skrudland can score goals, Blake Sloan can score goals, Grant
Marshall can score goals. That's the kind of thing that turns Game
7s around. That's the kind of thing that wins Stanley Cups. Those
are the expectations we should have of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars prepared for Game 7 by taking Wednesday off, staying
away from the rink, not even thinking about hockey. Not Brian
Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thought Skrudland, 35, might have trouble keeping up
with his young Stars linemates might have things backward. Sloan,
22, and Marshall, 25, could be chasing the old man around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's excited,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He's been
good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And no better than in a critical Game 6 victory Tuesday in
Denver. Skrudland, Sloan and Marshall combined to average about
eight minutes of ice time _ hardly what an outsider would think
could change a game. But the line trio was the first that Hitchcock
praised afterward. Hitchcock cited the line for injecting energy
into the Stars with hard-working shifts that helped wear down the
Avalanche defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They established a presence for us,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Skrudland, Sloan and Marshall came together
almost by happenstance. Hitchcock was looking for the balance that
would allow him to use his fourth line more than the four minutes
it saw in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock swapped Pat Verbeek on the third line for Marshall and
moved Marshall to the left wing, and both lines found a new
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall and Sloan, because of their energy and ability
speedwise, really helped us there,'' Hitchcock said. ``They had
fresh legs, and it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   And mix those fresh legs with Skrudland's determination and you
have the kind of line that can make the difference against the
Colorado Avalanche, which is playing its fourth liners only three
minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, we're a better team when we're playing four lines,''
Hitchcock said. ``It makes everyone on our team better when we're
playing four lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Four lines playing means more rest for Mike Modano and Joe
Nieuwendyk. But Skrudland said he wants to be more than just the
guy who deflects some of Modano's minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think we should just go out and eat up the clock
and give Mike and Joe a breather,'' Skrudland said. ``To me, that's
wrong. We don't want to just eat up the clock, we want to eat up
the competition. We want to contribute in every aspect of the
game.'' And it doesn't matter to Skurdland that Marshall has not
scored a goal in 35 career playoff games. Sloan hasn't scratched in
12, and Skrudland last scored in the postseason in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this time of year, that doesn't matter,'' Skrudland said.
``This time of year is made for players like us. This time of year
is when you need a fourth line. We want to be the
difference-makers, and I think that's a healthy thing.'' nn

UNMANNED PLANES FLY LOW AND GET THE PICTURE OVER KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESEVO VALLEY, Macedonia _ As the NATO air campaign grows into
nearly nonstop bombing, the light unmanned aerial vehicles known as
drones are crisscrossing the skies over Kosovo, acting as
electronic scouts, finding and filming elusive targets, especially
Serbian troops hidden in bunkers or woods, and sending those images
immediately to fighter jets overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least 21 drones, the only aircraft that the allies let fly at
such low altitudes, have been lost to gunfire or mechanical
problems, said NATO and Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   The drones are part of the electronic warfare that is being
waged from border posts like this one and from bases here, in
Albania and even Bosnia. At Observation Post 380, on a plateau that
overlooks villages and summer fields sprinkled with poppies, French
and British soldiers aim their Doppler radar, infrared telescopes
and communications towers toward the border two miles away,
watching and listening to the Serbs and in Kosovo directly to the
west.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal now is to overwhelm the Serbs with technology,'' said
Maj. Arnaud Bellynck, a French paratrooper and a commander in the
French brigade that is assigned to the eastern sector of northern
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   To operate effectively, the drones have to be near the
battlefield, which required the deployments here and in Macedonia
to be carried out quietly. France, Germany and the United States
have based unmanned surveillance planes here despite the Macedonian
government's insistence that NATO has a headquarters here just to
carry out a peace accord, and not to fight an air war.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Hunter surveillance plane flies from the Skopje
airfield. The more sophisticated unmanned Air Force Predator is
based in Bosnia, at Tuzla, according to NATO and Pentagon officials
who are equally wary of acknowledging the role of the Bosnian
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no choice, given the short range of these planes'' a
NATO officer said. ``But it's worth it. We're getting fabulous
imagery of Serb forces, refugee movements and battle-damage
assessments. So we know how well we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   No NATO official said the intelligence matched the quality that
they could obtain from pilots who would fly at low levels or ground
troops. ``It's very good, but it is limited,'' said Bellynck.
</P>
<P>
   The videos, as well as photographs from the drones, have become
critical as NATO concentrates on Serbian troops and equipment. To
avoid detection, the troops are in small units hidden under trees,
in camouflaged bunkers and near villages.
</P>
<P>
   Programmed to fly as low as 1,000 feet, the surveillance planes
capture on camera what they see on the ground and immediately relay
the pictures to forward aircraft like A-10 and F-16s, whose pilots
call in strikers to bomb the targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest thing now, to get those pictures in real
time for tactical information so we can move on the targets as soon
as we find them,'' said an allied official.
</P>
<P>
   The information and photographs are generally sent first to
controllers here and then to NATO headquarters here, in Italy or
Belgium. The information relayed through the Hunter planes is
processed through the Apache task force in Albania, according to a
Pentagon official, and much of the video from the Hunters and
Predators is sent to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Bellynck said allied soldiers conducted electronic eavesdropping
along the border and were becoming adept at ``distinguishing the
sound of cows from the Serbs.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: NEW WELFARE RULES MAY BE TESTED IN NEXT RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proponents of the 1996 welfare law are finding plenty of reasons
to feel smug these days. Republican leaders held a news conference
last week to proclaim a triumph after releasing a study by the
General Accounting Office that showed plunging welfare rolls,
soaring employment rates among former recipients and no burst of
homelessness, as many of the law's opponents had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   So should opponents, including several high-ranking
administration officials who resigned when President Clinton signed
the Republican-sponsored bill, acknowledge they were wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Wendell Primus, one of those officials who resigned
in protest and who now works for the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington. It might seem
churlish to slough off all the good news, but Primus has a point.
The test of the '96 act comes when the next recession hits and
there will be no federal security blanket for the first time in 60
years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Primus echoed testimony he gave to
Congress last week. ``Many former recipients are surviving on less
income today than when they were on welfare. And the number that
will need to return to the rolls in the next few months or years in
an effort to make up for their lost income by combining work and
welfare could prove staggeringly high.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the good news. Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar at
the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group,
testified last week that the welfare law, rather than the robust
economy, was a key reason ``for this unprecedented decline _ now
reaching 44 percent since March 1994'' in caseloads. He estimates
that there are almost 7 million fewer people on welfare. He cites
an analysis by the federal budget office that reductions in welfare
benefits were offset by ``two- or threefold gains in income due to
work.'' Besides, he says, perhaps 30 percent of poor single-mother
families live with nonfamily members from whom they can derive
support.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO adds to the cheery evaluation. Its review of studies
from seven states finds employment rates of people who left welfare
rolls ranging from 61 percent to 87 percent. Those are stunningly
high numbers, well beyond predictions when the law was passed. By
contrast, the employment rates among current welfare recipients
hover around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brauner and Pamela Loprest at the Urban Institute reviewed
11 studies of people who have recently left welfare and turned up
another encouraging result: More than half of the employed people
who left welfare worked 30 or more hours a week, nearly full time.
A few of the studies found that a majority of recent welfare
recipients report that life is better for those who leave the
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Primus presents a darker view. Incomes of single-mother families
did rise before the 1996 act passed. But between 1995 and 1997, the
income of the poorest 20 percent of single-mother families fell by
almost 8 percent despite a fast-growing economy, a substantial
increase in federal tax credits for poor working parents and the
fact that time limits on welfare benefits had not kicked in. The
fall in welfare benefits overwhelmed the rise in earnings. And
Primus rebuts Besharov's suggestion that the income of nonfamily
members could fill in the gap. ``Maybe 3 percent of the million
households who lost money coped by sharing income,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find an income loss for roughly a million families of $860
per family, which represents a decline of 15 percent,'' he added.
``That's big.''
</P>
<P>
   Primus also points out that welfare rolls fell after 1995 five
times more than did the number of people living in poverty. He says
that Besharov exaggerates the importance of income gains reported
by the government for all female-headed families because many of
those families were not poor. In one study, only 35 percent of
those who left welfare earned as much as $12,000 a year, and even
that level falls short of the poverty level for a family of three
by about $1,000. A Wisconsin study showed that between a third and
a half of those who left welfare for good had income above the
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Institute study concludes that most people who leave
welfare ``report having incomes that are lower than or similar to
their combined earnings and benefits before exit.'' Its review also
shows that only about half to two-thirds of people who leave
welfare receive Medicaid benefits and only about half receive food
stamps even though the welfare law did not withdraw these benefits.
Participation rates for those who leave welfare are much lower than
among those who continue on welfare. About a third of the families
who leave welfare report problems paying for food and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Primus focuses on another threatening statistic. In Maryland,
about 20 percent of welfare recipients returned to the rolls after
three months. In Wisconsin, about 30 percent returned after 15
months. ``The issue of families needing to return to welfare will
become more important as an increasing number of recipients reach
their time limit on aid and returning to the rolls will no longer
be an option for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The data behind any evaluation of the welfare-to-work programs
are skimpy. Few states have conducted reliable surveys. ``We could
draw no conclusion about the status of most families that have left
welfare,'' the GAO says. But Primus and others provide enough
cautionary tidbits to make the case that ``considerable caution
ought to be exercised before pronouncing welfare reform an
unqualified success.''

DOCUMENTS SHOW GIFT-GIVING BEFORE ATLANTA WON '96 GAMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Congo, Switzerland, Libya, South Korea, Ga, Utah, Fla.)   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the House Commerce Committee investigating Atlanta's
bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics said ``a number of concerns'' were
raised Wednesday when bidders released documents showing that
lavish gifts, favors and payments were made while attempting to
secure the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials have denied making any cash payments or giving
scholarships to members of the International Olympic Committee and
their relatives in an effort to sway votes, as officials in Salt
Lake City did in winning the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   However, preliminary documents made available showed undeniably
that the gift-giving culture did not begin in Salt Lake City, that
a number of IOC. members had their hands out and that Atlanta
bidders were eager to grant their wishes. Many of those receiving
favors were the same IOC members who have been disciplined for
their abuses in the Salt Lake City bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials donated $25,000 to the South African
Non-Racial Olympic Committee as that country sought to re-enter the
Olympic movement after three decades and gave 38 gifts that
exceeded the IOC's limit of $200, including a $948 carburetor kit
to Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya, who resigned in the Salt
Lake City scandal. A Tiffany jewelry box worth $616.25 went to Kim
Un Yong, a powerful IOC. member from South Korea who was censured
for attempting to secure jobs for his children in the Salt Lake
City episode.
</P>
<P>
   Even Marc Hodler, the IOC member from Switzerland who blew the
whistle on the Salt Lake City scandal and was in charge of
overseeing bidding procedures, violated the Olympic committee's
rules by accepting from Atlanta officials a Steuben crystal skier
worth $457.24.
</P>
<P>
   The expelled IOC member who most abused his role in the Salt
Lake City case, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo Republic, also
figured prominently in Atlanta's gift-giving efforts. Among the
things that raised the eyebrows of Commerce Committee investigators
was $14,099.40 paid to the Nick Bollettieri training camp in
Florida for the training of two teen-age tennis players from Congo
Republic in July of 1990, two months before Atlanta won the 1996
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think Salt Lake City is an aberration, but
time will tell,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, Republican from Michigan
and chairman of the Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight
and investigations, which began in inquiry into the Atlanta bid
last month in an effort to determine whether legislation is needed
to correct abusive bidding practices.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce committee investigators will arrive in Atlanta Thursday
to begin examining 1,400 boxes of files related to the bid. The
Atlanta committee has opened only nine boxes to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent revelations in Salt Lake City have left the Olympic
rings tarnished,'' Upton said. ``It is important for athletes and
fans to know if these problems are unique to the 2002 Winter Games
or if they're common practices among bid cities.''
</P>
<P>
   In other favors related to Ganga, the Atlanta bid committee
donated $19,294 worth of soccer equipment and uniforms for children
in the Congo Republic in 1990 and worked with the Coca-Cola
Foundation, which donated $10,000 for a scoreboard for a soccer
team in Brazzaville.

NATHAN S. ANCELL, ETHAN ALLEN CO-FOUNDER, DIES AT 90  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Conn., Mo.)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathan S. Ancell, a co-founder of Ethan Allen Inc., who
pioneered the concept of selling furniture in room-style settings,
died Monday at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Ancell, who grew up in New York City and graduated from Columbia
University, established a small housewares company in 1932 with his
brother-in-law, Theodore Baumritter.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, they bought a bankrupt furniture factory in
Beecher Falls, Vt. Soon, Ancell once recalled, they ``fell
hopelessly in love'' with Vermont and its history of craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, they introduced a line of ``early American'' furniture
under the name Ethan Allen, the leader of the Green Mountain Boys
in the Revolutionary War. Eventually, they adopted the name of the
company's most popular line as the corporate name and moved the
company's headquarters to Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the appeal of its colonial-style designs, the company's
innovative sales techniques helped Ethan Allen grow.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, stores typically displayed furniture in rows of
chairs, beds and tables. ``But Nat Ancell understood that people
really wanted to see how furniture would look in a designed
environment _ that people are not buying furniture, they are buying
life styles,'' said Farooq Kathwari, the current chairman of Ethan
Allen. ``This placing of furniture in life-style settings is known
as the gallery concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The company first employed this method of displaying furniture
in coordinated roomlike settings in department stores and, later,
in the 1960s, developed the concept further in its Ethan Allen
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ancell succeeded his brother-in-law as chairman in 1970. Ethan
Allen was bought in 1980 by Interco Inc. of St Louis for $150
million. Ancell continued to run the company until 1985, when he
handed over the day-to-day management to Kathwari, who led a
management group that bought the company back from Interco in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ensuing years, Ancell remained an adviser to the
company. Today, Ethan Allen is one of the nation's largest
furniture companies, with more than 300 dealers and 21
manufacturing plants in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ancell is survived by two daughters, Susan Darley and Penny
Randall, and six grandchildren.

FRANK SPENCER, ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO STUDIED PILTDOWN HOAX, DIES AT
58  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Mich.)   By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frank Spencer, an anthropologist who rummaged through
the bones of controversy to theorize about the identity of the
mastermind behind the Piltdown Man hoax of 1912, died on Sunday. He
was 58 and lived in Bayside, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Queens College, where Spencer had
been a professor and chairman of the anthropology department.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1990 that Spencer, a specialist in the history of
physical anthropology, weighed in with his hypothesis about who was
responsible for planting a skull and bones in a gravel pit near the
English village of Piltdown and setting a false trail, which for
some 40 years diverted scientists seeking the timetable of man's
origins.
</P>
<P>
   Though some had long doubted the evidence found at Piltdown, the
fraud was not fully exposed until 1953, when the skull and a lower
jaw, originally represented as coming from the same ancient
individual, were found to be from two contemporary creatures of
different species. The skull was that of a modern man and the jaw
that of a modern orangutan with its teeth filed down.
</P>
<P>
   As the plot was bared, suspicion fell on Charles Dawson, who had
found the bones and brought them to the attention of scientific
authorities at the British Museum and who had died in 1916. But as
a country lawyer and an amateur geologist, Dawson seemed to lack
the knowledge and the access to the bones needed to fabricate
evidence of a ``missing link'' between ape and man.
</P>
<P>
   There was no lack of possible accomplices and over the years
many figures, mostly scientists, were mentioned as suspects. These
included Dr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the famed paleontologist
and a Jesuit priest who hunted for fossils with Dawson in Piltdown
and who after the exposure of the hoax was said to have commented
cryptically, ``I know who did the Piltdown hoax, and it was not
Charles Dawson.''
</P>
<P>
   Another famous figure who came under scrutiny as a possible
confederate of Dawson was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of
Sherlock Holmes. The accusations linking him to the plot were all
circumstantial: he lived not far from the site of the discoveries,
knew Dawson and was fascinated by fossils.
</P>
<P>
   But Spencer's research took him in another direction, focusing
his attention on a hitherto unsuspected anatomist named Sir Arthur
Keith, who in 1912 had been a rising star of the British scientific
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Keith was then the conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons. He died in 1955, two years after the
Piltdown Man was shown to have been concocted.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spencer was born in Chatham, not far from Piltdown, the
debunking of the Piltdown claim, when he was 11 years old, made no
memorable impression on him. However, when in 1976 he was writing
his doctoral dissertation at the University of Michigan about a
physical anthropologist named Ales Hrdlicka, the doctoral student
noted that his subject had once written to Keith questioning the
find, only to be snubbed. He wondered why.
</P>
<P>
   Through years of investigation, which he documented in
``Piltdown, a Scientific Forgery,'' published by Oxford University
Press in 1990, Spencer established that before Dawson publicized
his finds, Keith was aggressively propounding his view that the
first human beings evolved earlier than had been supposed and that
the first manifestation of their development was the enlarged
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of a Piltdown Man fulfilled Keith's hypothesis of a
missing link with a modern-sized brain and a simian jaw, which he
claimed was a more legitimate and direct ancestor of man than the
European Neanderthals and the Java Man found just before the turn
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   By Spencer's reckoning, Keith was the scientist with the most to
gain from the Piltdown discovery. As Spencer wrote, the hoax had
been ``a deliberate use of fraud to alter the entire course of
paleontology.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Australia, Dr. Ian Langham, a historian, had
independently reached similar conclusions about Keith, and when
Langham died in 1984, his research became available to Spencer.
Elaborating on Langham's findings, Spencer was able to establish
that Dawson and Keith held secret meetings dating back to a year
before the supposed discovery.
</P>
<P>
   As Spencer reconstructed the plot, Keith provided technical
expertise and possibly the bones, which were stained to look
prehistoric. Dawson then planted them in the gravel pit where he
then led others, including Teilhard, on fossil hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty convinced that this is the definitive solution,''
Spencer said in an interview when his book appeared. ``We don't
have the smoking gun. But I think the interpretation we've made is
a reasonable one and in harmony with the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, the editor of The History of Physical Anthropology and
the author of several monographs and many articles, had originally
been trained as a medical microbiologist and worked in British and
Canadian hospitals before switching fields.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Elena, and his mother, Doris, of
Rochester, England.

REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE Y2K COMPLIANCE ON SHIPS ENTERING PUGET
SOUND PORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Commercial vessels entering the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and Puget Sound will have to prove their on-board computers won't
pose a safety hazard when the new year clicks over to 2000 under
new Coast Guard procedures expected to be put into effect later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels from big cargo haulers to commercial fishing boats will
have to respond to a series of questions about ``equipment critical
to the operational safety of the vessel,'' said Capt. John
Veentjer, chief of the Marine Safety Division for the Coast Guard's
13th District, which includes such major ports as Seattle, Tacoma
and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about so-called ``Y2K'' problems will be included
with those asked when vessels routinely provide their 24-hour
advanced notice of intent to enter a port, Veentjer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also ask if the company owning the vessel has a
documented Y2K policy in place, yes or no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also will ask information about navigation,
steering, propulsion and power generation systems and cargo
handling equipment and other safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will ask if they had inventory checks for the ship to
identify and categorize potential non-compliant equipment,''
Veentjer said.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of critical on-board systems could result in container
ships, some weighing as much as 50,000 to 75,000 deadweight tons
and carrying as many as 5,000 shipping container units, rampaging
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of computerized cargo handling equipment could result in
hazardous material being spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Veentjer and other officials are meeting on Thursday with
Canadian coast guard representatives at Coast Guard facilities at
the Port of Seattle to hash out wording on the requirements, which
will be published in the Federal Register and on the Coast Guard's
Internet site when ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the same procedures in place for vessels that enter
the Strait of Juan de Fuca regardless of whether they are going to
turn left and head to Vancouver, B.C., or turn starboard and head
to the Port of Seattle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The extended requirements will be in effect for 24 hours before
and 24 hours after Sept. 9, 1999, Jan. 1, 2000, and Feb. 29, 2000,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The September date is included because old computer programs
might read the abbreviation ``9/9/99'' as a code to shut down. The
Feb. 29 ``Leap Year Day'' might not be included in some programs.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on what to do with vessels that might pose risks to
navigation or the environment because computers on-board or ashore
fail will be left to the captain of the port.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Mike Moore, currently executive officer to
Capt. Miles Booth, captain of the port in Seattle, will succeed
Booth on June 28 and is now heading local efforts at bringing
vessels here into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be ready in advance as much as possible and to
minimize the number of vessels we know little about showing up just
before midnight on Dec. 31 and expecting to enter a port here,''
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Most container ships entering the Port of Seattle and Port of
Tacoma are liners owned by steamship companies that regularly bring
the same vessels into Puget Sound, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have information on those vessels in hand ahead of
time, so that we will know in advance if they have been checked out
as much as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While questions about Y2K compliance will be globally imposed at
ports throughout the United States, providing consistency for
shipping lines, each of the 40 or so captains of the port will have
authority to make judgments because each port has different
currents, weather and other local conditions to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tug availability is another factor that varies from port to
port and a captain of the port might require a vessel to have a tug
escort, depending on his evaluation of the vessels response to the
questions,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could ask a vessel to remain at sea or merely not to use
autopilot as it enters our navigable waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some steamship operators and their associations independently
are taking precautions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petroleum tanker industry, for example, has decided all of
its vessels will be at sea or tied up at dock at the critical
dates,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are at dock, they are not going to transfer oil until
they are sure they don't have unexpected computer problems. We
didn't go to them with this. They just came to us and said, `That's
just how we're going to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard's own Vessel Traffic Service, which operates
radar and video systems on its shipping lanes much like the air
traffic control systems oversee plane traffic, is bringing its
systems into Y2K compliance and will have backup systems in place.
Rescue boats also are being checked.

STARS OWN ADVANTAGE IN DELICIOUS DECIDER (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Now'' we can talk about Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for your patience and your understanding about tabling
this subject until other, more important items on the agenda _ like
the Dallas Stars winning Game 6 Tuesday night _ were checked off.
</P>
<P>
   But now we've come down to it, and did you ever, really expect
anything less?
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, those who get paid to have an opinion are saying this
heart-stopping, incredibly delicious Western Conference finals
series is ``too close to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's too close not to call.
</P>
<P>
   Stars win Friday night. Mark it down. Stars win.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that's just an opinion, too, but there are too many
portents that say the pendulum in this anything-goes series has
finally swung toward the Stars for good.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Stars must do to keep it there and advance to
the Stanley Cup Finals against Buffalo:
</P>
<P>
   Refuse to panic or get caught up in the first-period blitzkrieg
that the Avalanche will come with, because that's the only chance
the visitors have.
</P>
<P>
   Play the same game that they put on the ice in the second and
third periods Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Use the uplifting spiritual ``force'' that a sellout crowd of
17,001 psyched-up fans will provide.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure Eddie Belfour is wearing extra-dark shades and that he
understands that just because the sun's still out in Texas at 6:30
in the evening, that doesn't mean it's not a night game.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hockey gods seem to be smiling on the Stars now. The
same NHL playoff schedule makers that hurt the leg-weary Stars with
a quick turnaround between Games 4 and 5 have now granted them an
extra day to rest for Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   That helps the Stars, with their older, slower defensemen, far
more than it does the younger, always ready-to-skate Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Game 7 to see who goes to the finals ... it's probably what
everybody in the world of hockey wanted,'' Mike Modano said after
the Stars' 4-1 victory tied the series at three games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Well, everybody but the world of Denver, which has grown weary
of seeing the Avs lose at home during these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. It won't happen again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Avs, a remarkable 8-1 on the road during their playoff
run, must accomplish something no other team has been able to do
this entire season: beat the Stars three times in their own
building.
</P>
<P>
   Hell will have its own hockey rink before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take that home-ice advantage,'' vowed Jamie
Langenbrunner, who scored two opportunistic goals to lead the Stars
to Tuesday night's victory.
</P>
<P>
   A bad sign for the Avalanche is that the Stars were able to put
Sunday's glimpse of NASCAR-on-Ice behind them and rediscover that
delicate balance between strong, positional defensive hockey and
offensive pressure on Colorado goalie Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars played tentatively in the first period, searching for
that balance. They were waiting and reacting, however, instead of
being aggressive. When Claude Lemieux tipped in Adam Foote's
blazing slap shot from just inside the blue line with less than 35
seconds remaining in the period, things looked ominous for Dallas.
Goals scored in the final minute of a period are particularly
devastating and the Stars have been allowing that to happen far too
often.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of deflating the Stars, it worked to their
advantage. They came out for the second period with a new sense of
urgency while the Avalanche, smelling blood on the ice, turned
careless. Jere Lehtinen's chip shot over Roy's left shoulder tied
the score and turned the momentum in the Stars' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Game 7 will cap a tremendously entertaining series between two
desperate and dissimilar teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, without question, has a collection of immensely
talented players. The Stars have a great team, playing a great
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs are Van Cliburn on ice. The Stars are Jerry Lee Lewis,
hot licks and great balls of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get by on just pure talent, not against Dallas,''
Avalanche defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh said.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like frustration, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   Resignation?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these teams has come this far to quit now. This ain't
for show anymore. This is a war and the casualties are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only sad thing is that one of these teams will be finished
playing Friday night,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   Sad, but true. Remind me to drop him a postcard from Niagara
Falls. nn

LITTLE ROCK, Ark.: as the plane 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The scenario that the storm approached one end of the runway
as the plane approached from the other probably is correct,''
Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather data show that conditions were relatively calm 27
minutes before the accident, Black said. At that time, the wind at
the airport was out of the south at about 10 mph and visibility was
seven miles with lightly scattered clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But two minutes after the crash, the wind was out of the west
with gusts to nearly 30 mph, Black said. The gusts of more than 80
mph were recorded five minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said Buschmann alerted them about 30 minutes before
the crash that storms were looming around Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A half hour before the crash, he said there were strong
(storm) cells,'' passenger Barrett Baber said. ``He said we were
going to try to go around them; that was the last I heard'' from
Buschman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on Runway 04, which points almost north, and
then veered off the left side of the 7,200-foot runway before its
end, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Richard Klamm said he was certain he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time the pilot made his first bumpy touchdown until
the plane came to a stop was about 20 to 25 seconds,'' said Klamm,
49, of Pine Bluff, Ark. ``While you are swerving back and forth,
you don't have time to see your life flash before your eyes. I was
just thinking, `Get this plane under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane touched down, it bounced, came back down and
bounced again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell the pilot did not have control of the craft,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it slid past the end of the runway, the plane turned right
into the large steel stanchion supporting the runway lights.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the fuselage was split just behind the cockpit, the
left side of the plane was ripped open by the steel light supports
and the left wing was torn off and crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   The tail of the plane separated from the rest of the fuselage.
Fire rolled through part of the plane, and some of the injured
apparently were seriously burned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting and rescue vehicles reached the scene within six to
seven minutes, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage because
they could not get emergency exits open, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Black called the plane ``a clean aircraft, with no maintenance
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was delivered to American in August 1983. As of April 30, the
plane had logged nearly 49,000 hours of service and been through
nearly 27,000 takeoff/landing cycles. One takeoff and one landing
constitute one cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at the brakes, the runway surface, drainage of
the runway and the runway's skid resistance in determining why the
aircraft was not able to stop,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we don't know how far down the runway the plane
touched down, and whether the pilot tried to get it back into the
air when he saw that he could not stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Wednesday whether wind shear _ a rapid change
in wind direction and speed that can bring an airliner crashing
down _ was a factor in the accident, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock airport has a low-level wind-shear detection
system but does not have the newer Terminal Doppler Weather Radar
that was developed for the FAA after the wind-shear crash of Delta
Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport in 1985, NTSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock Mayor Jim Dailey said he hopes that the
investigation shows that the city's emergency response was
``helpful in saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first commercial aviation accident at our airport,
and, at the least, we will use this as an opportunity to be more
prepared in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was en route to a speaking engagement in
Colorado, called Dailey from Air Force One to express his concern
for the crash victims and to offer his support in the
investigation, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also was asking about two friends of his who were on the
plane, Nancy and Craig Wood,'' the mayor said. ``I was able to tell
him that they both survived the crash and were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wood served in Clinton's administration while he was
governor of Arkansas, and Craig Wood is a member of the city's
water board, Dailey said.

USC PAIR GOES IN FIRST ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last week, USC pitcher Barry Zito said he pitched
well enough this season to be considered a first-round pick in the
Major League Baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, a junior left-hander who pitched at Pierce College last
year, didn't imagine he would be among the top 10 picks. But that's
what happened Wednesday when the Oakland Athletics made Zito the
ninth overall selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to the (A's), so it was something that was an
outside (chance),'' Zito said. ``It just blows my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   USC catcher Eric Munson, the consensus top college player
available, went to Detroit with the third pick. Munson is the
highest selection from the L.A. area since the Angels took UCLA's
Troy Glaus with the third pick in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Royal High's Scott Rice, a 6-foot-6 left-hander who wasn't a
full-time starter until this season, became the second pitcher from
Simi Valley in as many years to be picked in the first round. He
was joined by Pepperdine pitcher Jay Gehrke as a supplemental
first-round pick; Gehrke was taken by Kansas City at No. 32.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who was 6-2 with a 3.31 ERA this season, went to Baltimore
with the 44th pick. Jeff Weaver, a Simi Valley graduate who went on
to become an All-American at Fresno State, was taken by Detroit
with the 14th pick last year and is now in the majors with the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who committed to pitch at Arkansas next year, said he
``had no clue'' he was going to be drafted as high as we was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very excited,'' he said. ``When I woke up this
morning, I wasn't nervous. People have been telling me, `You could
go as early as a sandwich pick,' but I heard a lot of stories about
the draft so I wasn't trying to expect anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he is going to start negotiating with the Orioles this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get out there and play baseball,'' he said. ``I
don't want to start fighting in negotiations. That's not a great
way to start my baseball career.''
</P>
<P>
   The career of Westlake High's Kevin Howard is off to a rough
start _ if he signs at all. Howard, considered one of the top 50
high school players available, dropped to the 22nd round, where he
was picked by the Padres. Howard committed to the University of
Miami and may have scared off teams with his signing-bonus demands.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two rounds of the draft were completed. The final half of
the draft, which is limited to 50 rounds, is today.
</P>
<P>
   Zito is 12-2 with 146 strikeouts this season for the Trojans. He
struck out 16 batters in a game three times and became the third
pitcher to go undefeated in the Pac-10 conference.
</P>
<P>
   The A's probably took Zito _ who starts Friday night in the
first game of USC's super-regional series at Stanford _ for two
reasons. First, Zito is polished and, barring injury, should move
through the minor leagues fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I know how to pitch,'' Zito said, ``and I have three
pitches that I command.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Zito was disillusioned by his holdout last year after he
was drafted in the third round by Texas and indicated earlier this
season he wants to sign quickly and begin his pro career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be signed within a week or two after the
(college) season is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, who missed 21 games earlier this season, is batting .338
with 14 home runs and 40 RBI. His selection fulfilled early-season
predictions of being the top college player available in a draft
considered thin on talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited to be with the Tigers and to be in the
American League,'' Munson said. ``Obviously I'd like to get up
there as quick as I can, but I'm going to have to be patient.
Whatever they have in store for me is great.''
</P>
<P>
   USC, Pepperdine and Cal State Northridge were all affected by
the draft, whether by losing current players or facing the
possibility of losing high school players who have committed for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had top recruits Alberto Concepcion (second round)
and Pat Manning (third) drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrke, from North Dakota, saved a school-record 18 games for
Pepperdine after transferring from Arizona State last summer. He
expects to have quick negotiations with the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' Gehrke said. ``I'm as happy as I can be. I want
to get going and I'm excited to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN recruit Chris Testa, an outfielder at Palmdale, was a
fifth-round choice of the Rockies. Catcher Jeremy Sickles and
outfielder Danny Phillips, both juniors at CSUN, also were drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Testa said he will negotiate with the Rockies before deciding
whether or not to fulfill his college commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm weighing my options right now,'' Testa said. ``I'm pretty
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Christensen, a catcher at Arlington High in Riverside who
visited Pepperdine on a recruiting trip and signed with UCLA, was
taken by Seattle with the 11th pick in the first round. Ricky
Manning, one of the Bruins' top football recruits, was taken by
Minnesota in the 22nd round.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas pitcher David Walling, who was being recruited by CSUN
in 1997 when the school temporarily dropped baseball, was also a
first-round pick. The Yankees drafted Walling at No. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, with the first overall pick, selected Josh Hamilton
(P-OF) from Athens Drive High in Raleigh, N.C.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Focusing on ``what the pilots were trying to
do,'' federal investigators tried to determine Wednesday why an
American Airlines jetliner crash-landed in a severe thunderstorm,
slid off the runway, broke apart and burned, killing at least nine
people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the 145 people on board the McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 were injured, some critically, as hysterical passengers
scrambled off Flight 1420 from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport when it
crashed while landing at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday. The left side of the
plane's fuselage was peeled away as it slammed into a large steel
structure that supports runway alignment indicator lights.
</P>
<P>
   All but one passenger had been accounted for by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told harrowing tales of escaping from the thick smoke
and roaring flames as a violent downpour, hail and wind gusts of 75
mph enveloped the wreckage at Little Rock National Airport, just
yards from the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so
thick we couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I pushed a few people, because your natural instinct to
survive just kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
recovered the flight data boxes from the cockpit. They may yield
information about what the pilots knew of the weather conditions
when flight controllers cleared them to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recovered recorders and the tower transmissions. From
here, we will go into understanding what the pilots were trying to
do,'' said George Black, an NTSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they
have to base that on the information they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Richard Buschmann, 48, one of six members of the flight
crew, was killed in the crash. His co-pilot survived with broken
legs and other serious injuries and was ``interviewed briefly,''
Black said, declining to say what the co-pilot told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The four flight attendants, all based at D/FW, also survived,
although two were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said that ``all of us'' at American ``are terribly
sorry that this accident has occurred. ... It is clearly a terrible
day for all of us at American Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said airline officials ``will be doing everything we can,
together with the team of investigators, to determine exactly how
and why this accident happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Delayed for two hours by turbulent weather in North Texas, the
flight was on the last leg of a journey that originated in Chicago,
with stops in Salt Lake City and D/FW before Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As it approached Little Rock, the plane ``started to rock pretty
good,'' said Kevin Mergel, 21, who was on the flight with other
members of the Ouichita Baptist University choir.
</P>
<P>
   After it touched down, ``I knew something was wrong when we
started to swerve,'' Mergel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to God he could straighten out,'' Mergel said,
referring to the pilot. ``He was trying to reverse it and correct
things before making a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University student, said the
plane was out of control immediately as the pilot struggled to slow
it down and keep it on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't,'' she told the ``Washington Post.'' ``I thought
we were never going to stop. Every time he would try to brake, we
would go to the left. I realized we were going farther and farther
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking out the window at the ground, and the third time
he tried to slow down, I saw the grass rushing by and knew we were
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NTSB was not ready to declare weather a factor in
the crash, conditions at the Little Rock airport deteriorated
rapidly as the aircraft approached the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, as
well as tapes of the conversations between the pilots and air
traffic controllers, will be reviewed ``to determine what the
pilots knew or were told about the weather before they landed, and
what they might have attempted to do once they got into trouble,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Steady winds of 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph were reported in
the Little Rock area just before the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have tried to
land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone told me there were 50-knot gusts at the airport, I
would be leaving town,'' said Cecil Ewell, who oversees all
American Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist George Wilken said radar
images showed the storm arriving in Little Rock about the same time
as the plane. MORE &QL;

AVALANCHE FAMILIAR WITH SLIPPERY SLOPE
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Claude Lemieux's face mirrored the 19 other Avalanche
players around him as the horn sounded ending Game 6 on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   There was the distinct look of ``What now?''
</P>
<P>
   The ``what now'' was gone less than 24 hours later, replaced by
the knowing looks of players who had been down before only to
bounce back. Colorado coach Bob Hartley said his players only have
to reflect on this season to do so again in Game 7 of this Western
Conference finals series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if we look at Game 7, we have to open up the book
that we started writing since training camp,'' Hartley said. ``We
jump like so many hurdles. We trip on a couple of occasions. But
every time that we went down, we found ways to get back up. That's
called facing adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing adversity has become a Colorado specialty this season.
</P>
<P>
   From Patrick Roy tearing up Hartley's office after a
regular-season game, to a season littered with inconsistency, to
falling behind Detroit 2-0 in the West semifinals, to blowing a
chance to wrap up a Stanley Cup berth because of an uninspired loss
in Game 6, adversity has been an Avalanche linemate.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly does the book say about how to bounce back?
</P>
<P>
   ``The same way we bounced back from every setback,'' Lemieux
explained. ``It's by going into the game and not thinking and not
looking past that first shift, not looking past that first period
and not making too much of it, but just going out and playing the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche players failed to follow that plan in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Joe Sakic called Game 6 a must-win game, and player
after player had talked of dreading going back to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   So when a once DOA-looking Stars bunch took a 2-1 lead,
Avalanche players admitted to panicking, pressing and then folding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 6, as of right now, doesn't mean a thing,'' Avalanche
winger Shjon Podein said. ``It's a one-game deal now. You are going
to hear it from so many people. It's 60 minutes for the series.
It's 60 minutes to go to the Stanley Cup, and that's all that
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley said if a single lesson needs to be learned from Game 6,
Colorado needs to play a fearless, risk-taking style that has
helped them to advance this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't play cautious,'' Hartley said. ``We're all out. We
have a great-skilled hockey club, and we have to use those skills
to our advantage.'' Home on the road Why? The Avalanche can't say.
</P>
<P>
   But they do agree it is lucky that Game 7 is being played in
Dallas. They are 8-1 on the road this playoffs, compared with 3-6
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we try to do too much at home, if we get too
fancy if we try to put on a show,'' Shjon Podein said. ``I know
that on the road we seem to keep things a lot more simple, cut down
on the turnovers, play a more basic game and we wait for our
chances. When we get our chances, we take advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche has won two of the three games at Reunion Arena so
far, but their only road loss this playoffs came against the Stars
in Game 2. Series to remember The Detroit-Colorado series may have
been bloodier, but Claude Lemieux said the Dallas-Colorado series
is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely one of the best that I've been a part of,''
Lemieux said. ``It's one of the most unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it's good for the NHL, because it generates interest as
fans try to figure out a series that has become a constant
cliffhanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, let's start rubbing our crystal balls, and
hopefully, we can see the future before Friday,'' coach Bob Hartley
said. ``And if not, there is going to be two great hockey clubs
going at it and it should be a great battle.'' nn

   LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles school district may seize 48
North Hollywood homes and apartments under eminent domain to make
room for a new elementary campus.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed school is one of 13 citywide that members of the
Board of Education will discuss today, all planned to ease
overcrowding at existing campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Construction would remain a long way off even if the board makes
the selections today. First, an exhaustive environmental study of
each location must be prepared, and all homes that would be taken
would be appraised. Then the full school board would have to vote
on whether to acquire each site and buy out the property owners.
</P>
<P>
   For most sites, such a vote would be at least a year away, said
LAUSD real estate director Robert Niccum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the district's preferred location for a new school in
suburban North Hollywood, in the city's San Fernando Valley
northwest of downtown, already has alarmed some residents who could
be forced to sell their homes to the district at market rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my memories are here from all my life,'' said Lorraine M.
Crews, who has lived in the area since 1942. ``I'm 77. I don't want
to be uprooted.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other proposed schools of the 13 to be discussed today would
be located in the San Fernando Valley. The district might be able
to build both without taking any homes, possibly locating them atop
an old gravel pit in nearby Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the district planning to build 100 schools in the
next 10 years, the school board increasingly will face the choice
of taking the homes of people like Crews or picking sites that
might not work as well.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion comes at a time when district officials are
considering changing the way they select sites.
</P>
<P>
   School board member David Tokofsky, who serves on the facilities
committee, said he wants more community input in the way sites are
selected. He said today's discussion might be premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we be going ahead with site selection if we don't have
a selection process?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the facilities committee, for example, will look at
nine possible sites today for the proposed North Hollywood
elementary school. They will then tell district staffers which site
deserves further study.
</P>
<P>
   Some choices would require seizing few homes, if any. But those
relatively painless options are located too far away from the
overcrowded schools the district wants to relieve, said Niccum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade-off is you don't help one of those schools that
needs help, and that's exactly the kind of policy question that the
board has to decide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another location a block away from the North Hollywood site
contains an abandoned police station, but Niccum said the city's
parks department already owns the property and wants to use it for
a senior center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to get the vacant police station,'' he said.
``It is already spoken for.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sun Valley, the district needs a new high school and middle
school. At first, the district identified several sites that would
have involved bulldozing houses or apartments. But during a meeting
in January to seek community input, residents suggested that the
district consider instead building both schools on a local gravel
pit.
</P>
<P>
   Niccum said he didn't know what kinds of environmental
contamination the district would have to look for before picking
such a site. But he has recommended that the committee choose the
62-acre site for further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, there's a lot we could do with that site,'' he
said.

REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE Y2K COMPLIANCE ON SHIPS ENTERING PUGET
SOUND PORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Commercial vessels entering the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and Puget Sound will have to prove their on-board computers won't
pose a safety hazard when the new year clicks over to 2000 under
new Coast Guard procedures expected to be put into effect later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels from big cargo haulers to commercial fishing boats will
have to respond to a series of questions about ``equipment critical
to the operational safety of the vessel,'' said Capt. John
Veentjer, chief of the Marine Safety Division for the Coast Guard's
13th District, which includes such major ports as Seattle, Tacoma
and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about so-called ``Y2K'' problems will be included
with those asked when vessels routinely provide their 24-hour
advanced notice of intent to enter a port, Veentjer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also ask if the company owning the vessel has a
documented Y2K policy in place, yes or no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also will ask information about navigation,
steering, propulsion and power generation systems and cargo
handling equipment and other safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will ask if they had inventory checks for the ship to
identify and categorize potential non-compliant equipment,''
Veentjer said.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of critical on-board systems could result in container
ships, some weighing as much as 50,000 to 75,000 deadweight tons
and carrying as many as 5,000 shipping container units, rampaging
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of computerized cargo handling equipment could result in
hazardous material being spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Veentjer and other officials are meeting on Thursday with
Canadian coast guard representatives at Coast Guard facilities at
the Port of Seattle to hash out wording on the requirements, which
will be published in the Federal Register and on the Coast Guard's
Internet site when ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the same procedures in place for vessels that enter
the Strait of Juan de Fuca regardless of whether they are going to
turn left and head to Vancouver, B.C., or turn starboard and head
to the Port of Seattle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The extended requirements will be in effect for 24 hours before
and 24 hours after Sept. 9, 1999, Jan. 1, 2000, and Feb. 29, 2000,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The September date is included because old computer programs
might read the abbreviation ``9/9/99'' as a code to shut down. The
Feb. 29 ``Leap Year Day'' might not be included in some programs.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on what to do with vessels that might pose risks to
navigation or the environment because computers on-board or ashore
fail will be left to the captain of the port.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Mike Moore, currently executive officer to
Capt. Miles Booth, captain of the port in Seattle, will succeed
Booth on June 28 and is now heading local efforts at bringing
vessels here into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be ready in advance as much as possible and to
minimize the number of vessels we know little about showing up just
before midnight on Dec. 31 and expecting to enter a port here,''
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Most container ships entering the Port of Seattle and Port of
Tacoma are liners owned by steamship companies that regularly bring
the same vessels into Puget Sound, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have information on those vessels in hand ahead of
time, so that we will know in advance if they have been checked out
as much as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While questions about Y2K compliance will be globally imposed at
ports throughout the United States, providing consistency for
shipping lines, each of the 40 or so captains of the port will have
authority to make judgments because each port has different
currents, weather and other local conditions to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tug availability is another factor that varies from port to
port and a captain of the port might require a vessel to have a tug
escort, depending on his evaluation of the vessels response to the
questions,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could ask a vessel to remain at sea or merely not to use
autopilot as it enters our navigable waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some steamship operators and their associations independently
are taking precautions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petroleum tanker industry, for example, has decided all of
its vessels will be at sea or tied up at dock at the critical
dates,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are at dock, they are not going to transfer oil until
they are sure they don't have unexpected computer problems. We
didn't go to them with this. They just came to us and said, `That's
just how we're going to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard's own Vessel Traffic Service, which operates
radar and video systems on its shipping lanes much like the air
traffic control systems oversee plane traffic, is bringing its
systems into Y2K compliance and will have backup systems in place.
Rescue boats also are being checked.

DAY OFF `GREAT FOR' OLDER STARS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Stars took Wednesday off, with most
players not even coming to the rink.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he expects his team to skate
about 30 minutes today and then make the morning skate an optional
tomorrow. Hitchcock said he's hoping to use the extra day off
between games to get his team healthy and energized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for us,'' Hitchcock said. ``Any time with an
older team that you can get extra time off, it can't do anything
but help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the Stars are used to performing without practice
because they have used that format throughout the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't been doing this, it might be a problem. If we
were a younger team, it might be a problem,'' Hitchcock said. ``But
we've prepared for this all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano said players from both teams will
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice having two days off,'' he said. ``There should be
great energy in that building for Game 7.'' NO PRESSURE
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano has two assists in the past three games and is
minus-2 in that span. Meanwhile, Colorado Avalanche center Peter
Forsberg has a goal and three assists and is a plus-2 in those
three games.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Hitchcock said that doesn't mean Modano and linemates
Jere Lehtinen and Brett Hull are playing poorly against Forsberg,
Valeri Kamensky and Claude Lemieux. Instead, he said the Stars' top
offensive line has the toughest checking job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line is playing against three world-class players,''
Hitchcock said. ``They broke even \Rin Game 6\S and that gave us a
chance to win. In Game 5, we didn't break even, and we didn't win
because of it. I think that's a big responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said he still looks at his role as checking, even though
he, Modano and Lehtinen have combined for 16 playoff goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a checking line all year, and that's been a hard
thing to get used to,'' Hull said. ``But I think we look at
ourselves that way right now. We look at ourselves as a checking
line that can score goals.'' QUICK CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have been particularly cautious about avoiding bad
line changes and almost got caught in two in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a conscious effort of leaving two people on the ice
in every (shift change),'' Hitchcock said. ``With (goalie Patrick)
Roy and their defensemen, they really took advantage and caught
Detroit six or seven times a game. We try to have certain people on
the ice until the shift is cleared, and sometimes that's hard
because you can get caught up for some extra seconds.'' TWO DRAFT
PICKS SIGNED
</P>
<P>
   The Stars announced the signing of 1997 draft picks Brenden
Morrow and Ryan McKercher to standard three-year rookie contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, a burly winger who was the Stars' first-round pick (25th
overall) that year, will join the Stars at training camp in
September and is a lock to make the Michigan K-Wings. McKercher, a
defenseman who was taken 189th, will also be on hand at training
camp, but could return for one final year of junior play if the
Stars deem he is not ready for the K-Wings. HRKAC CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Tony Hrkac, who has been out a month with cracked
ribs, has been practicing at full speed for a week and likely is
available if Ken Hitchcock needs him for Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, who has not changed his lineup for the past three
games, likely will leave his forward group intact. CONSISTENCY
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have not lost three games in a row with Ed Belfour in
goal since he joined the Stars before the 1997-98 season. Belfour
has played 155 games (regular season and playoffs combined) and has
not lost more than two in a row. nn

TALKS BETWEEN CHINA AND NORTH KOREA SET TO START 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update with actual arrival of Kim Yong Nam in Beijing,
changing verb tenses in 1st and 2nd grafs. No other changes.) (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ North Korea's No. 2 political leader arrived in
Beijing Thursday for the first high-level meeting between the two
communist allies in eight years, talks that will be closely watched
by the United States and China's Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the
Supreme People's Assembly, brought a large entourage of political,
trade and military officials and may also visit Shanghai and
Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Months in the planning, the talks are intended to demonstrate
that the alliance between North Korea and China remains strong.
They come just as the United States has made its own offers of
cooperation in an effort to moderate North Korea's military and
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, in the early 1950s, China sent troops to
help North Korea beat back the advancing Americans, and China has
remained determined ever since to preserve the communist government
there as a buffer on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance has been a tortured one. Even though Kim Il
Sung, the North Korean leader at the time, visited Beijing in 1991,
the relationship was deeply strained the next year when China bowed
to practical reality and recognized North Korea's archenemy, South
Korea, with its dynamic economy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, China has been concerned about North Korea's
disastrous economic policies, which have forced China to provide
large amounts of aid and could cause a social collapse, and about
the North's missile tests, which have undermined China's regional
security goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea is a troublesome ally,'' said Bates Gill, a
military expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``But
the Chinese see propping up the regime as their only real option.''
</P>
<P>
   In the talks this week, North Korea is expected to ask for
renewed commitments on the food, energy and other aid that has
helped the government of Kim Jong Il (the son of Kim Il Sung)
survive a famine and severe slowdown of its industries. The
country's rigidly controlled, closed economy has never recovered
from the demise of the Soviet Union and the subsidies and barter
arrangements that Moscow provided.
</P>
<P>
   China, in turn, is expected to press its secretive ally to
moderate its behavior in areas that have threatened China's own
strategic interests, appealing to North Korea not to repeat its
tests of a new long-range missile.

A FIERCE BIDDING WAR FOR A FIVE-STAR HOTEL IN BANGKOK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Have a drink in the tranquil lobby of the
Regent Hotel here, beneath palm fronds and the hand-painted silk
ceiling, and you would scarcely guess that this five-star refuge is
the object of one of the most lively and improbable bidding wars in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The combatants are Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and an American-born
Thai citizen, William E. Heinecke. Goldman owns 34 percent of the
Regent and wants to buy control of the hotel. Heinecke's company,
Royal Garden Resort, owns about a one-quarter stake and is
determined to fend off the investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The battle, which began after Goldman bought its holding in the
Regent two months ago, reaches an important junction on Thursday,
when both sides are required to submit final tender offers for the
356-room hotel. Neither will disclose its next move, but Heinecke
maintains that cash alone will not guarantee victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more than just money involved,'' he said in his
office here, cluttered with model airplanes and photographs of him
at the wheel of a 1966 Ferrari racing car. ``This property has a
bit of emotion attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the outcome of the bidding war is less significant
than the fact that it is taking place at all. Bangkok is glutted
with half-empty hotels. And while it has been nearly two years
since the devaluation of the Thai currency set off the Asian
crisis, most investors still give this country a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first takeover battle in Thailand since the
crash,'' said Anil Thadani, chairman of Schroder Capital Partners,
a private investment firm in Singapore that owns a stake in Royal
Garden Resort. ``Hopefully, it marks the reawakening of investor
interest in Thailand.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the Regent also demonstrates that some assets in
Thailand remain valuable, even amid the economic wreckage. Although
the Regent's bookings and profits swooned in 1997, rooms began
filling up again last year as Goldman and other foreign investment
houses sent battalions of bankers to help Thailand sort out its
debt-ridden banks and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, which through its real estate funds owns stakes in the
Essex House in New York and the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel,
Calif., first became interested in the Regent last year, when a
troubled Thai investor put a 24 percent stake up for sale. That
deal was snatched by Heinecke.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman returned the favor in April, when Heinecke thought he
had completed a deal to buy an additional 33 percent from a
Japanese investor. Instead, Goldman walked away with that stake and
promptly made a tender offer for the rest of the Regent's parent,
the Rajadamri Hotel Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get an opportunity, anywhere in the world really, to
buy a five-star existing property because people tend to hold them
for dear life,'' said Henry Cornell, who supervises Goldman, Sachs'
equity investments in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell said Goldman's offer was superior because it is offering
to buy the entire hotel at a value of $45 million. Heinecke is only
willing to buy 10 percent, just enough to keep Goldman from gaining
effective control.
</P>
<P>
   But Heinecke has been a wily opponent. The 49-year-old
entrepreneur was born in the United States, but spent the last 36
years in Thailand. He has become a tycoon here with interests from
hotels and restaurants to toiletries and golf accessories. In 1991,
he became a Thai citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Heinecke is turning his local standing into a weapon. He is
casting the battle as one between a scrappy local outfit and a
giant foreign interloper. The argument resonates in a country where
fears of foreign colonization have risen as much of corporate
Thailand has tumbled into insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who feel that some foreigners have tried to
take advantage of Thailand when it was down,'' Heinecke said.
</P>
<P>
   Pravit Rojanaphruk, an editor and columnist at The Nation, an
English-language newspaper here, said: ``Of course, there are fears
of foreigners overrunning Thai society. But whether it is bad for
Thailand is debatable. The Thais who owned the assets before didn't
do such a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell is careful not to criticize the Regent's managers, who
he insists he would retain. But he noted that the company could do
more. He said Goldman would use the Regent as a base to build or
buy other hotels. For starters, he envisions a new Regent on the
resort island of Phuket, in Thailand's south.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a spectacular company with great assets,'' he said.
``You need someone to imbue it with strategic purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinecke said the Regent's shareholders do not want Goldman to
turn the hotel into a vehicle for speculative ventures. Among the
minority shareholders are the Thai Farmers Bank, the Crown Property
Bureau, the business arm of Thailand's royal family, and the king
himself.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Heinecke seems to be holding his own. Barely 2 percent
of the shares have been tendered to Goldman. Unless it offers more
money or a stronger sales pitch, it is unlikely to gain control.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell does not seem ready to give up, but he complains that a
simple real estate deal has become a political football. ``We're
not the big, bad foreign bogeyman,'' he said. ``It's not like we're
going to pick the hotel up, put it on a boat, and move it to New
York City.''

SPORTS COLUMN: METS GO INTO BRONX IN A FUNK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sweaty and satisfied Bobby Valentine finished
throwing batting practice to some Mets pitchers Wednesday and
playfully chirped about how effective he had been. He returned to
the dugout for a drink and continued gabbing about the most routine
baseball exercise. It was typical Valentine. He likes to talk and
embraces the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those attributes, this is a poor time to be Valentine.
The Mets are limping along and will begin a three-game series
against the Yankees Friday night at Yankee Stadium. The appealing
interleague matchup will be scrutinized and will receive an
abundance of news media attention, even with the Knicks still
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Valentine and his Mets are mired in an unenviable
position. The Mets have been perennially overshadowed by the
Yankees, who have won two of the last three World Series titles.
Now, when the Mets have the perfect chance to slap the Yankees and
steal some space on New York's baseball marquee, even if only
temporarily, they are traipsing into the Bronx in a funk.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost their sixth straight game Wednesday night against
the Reds. They have too many outfielders, they do not have
consistent starting pitching, they have some players who have
groused anonymously about Valentine's penchant for changing
lineups, and they even resorted to a team meeting on Tuesday. Those
are obvious signs of a wayward club. Could there be a worse time
for the Mets to be playing the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict how I would rather go into the series,''
Valentine said. ``I'll let you know afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all Valentine can say. The manager says that the best way
for the Mets to challenge the Yankees is by being healthy, and that
means that Edgardo Alfonzo's sprained left foot must heal. But
Valentine would surely be elated if the Mets were in first place
and were taking a winning streak into this intriguing series. He
just would not admit that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the schedule,'' Valentine said. ``The next time we
play them, that'll be the next time we play them. Whether or not
that's a good time or a bad time, it's the time we play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza and Bobby Bonilla were two players who were critical
of the Mets' having to face the Yankees six times this season.
Piazza argued that three games are enough because they would be
less likely to detract from a meeting in the World Series. Bonilla
smartly said that the Mets are the only team in the National League
East who are saddled with six games against the Yankees, instead of
three. Even Valentine grudgingly agreed that opposing the Yankees
six times is a drawback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they feel it's an advantage to play us six times instead of
the Braves six times? Probably,'' Valentine conceded. ``If they
think it's to their advantage, it's probably to our disadvantage.
It is what it is.''

   And the Mets are what they are, a struggling 27-26 team that
could plummet further against the Yankees. The Yankees will start
David Cone, Orlando Hernandez and Roger Clemens _ a former Cy Young
Award winner, a poised Cuban who can be especially arduous on teams
who rarely see him, and a five-time Cy Young Award winner. The Mets
will counter with Rick Reed, Masato Yoshii and Al Leiter. No one
from this trio would be working this weekend if he pitched for the
Yankees, even if it was a four-game series.

   A reporter reminded Valentine that Hernandez had pitched a
no-hitter for five and two-thirds innings and allowed one run and
two hits over eight innings in the only contest the Mets actually
won, 2-1, against the Yankees last season. Valentine nodded and
said: ``He was tough on us. I won't say he's tougher than Cone or
Clemens.''

   While Piazza theorized that the Mets could be helped by the
``playoff atmosphere'' of the series, Valentine tried to lessen its
importance and acted shocked when he was told George Steinbrenner
would be outraged if the Yankees were swept. In the end, the series
will count as three more games. But, this weekend, it will be
everything.

   ``What we need to do is win games and win our division,''
Valentine said. ``They're not in our division. They're in our town.
There's nothing that three or six games can do to tarnish or take
away from what they've done and it's not going to stand by itself
for whatever we do. It won't stand alone. It's going to be mixed in
with 162 games in our record. That's what's going to matter.''
