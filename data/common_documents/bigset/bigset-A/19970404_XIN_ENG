<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's ruling People's
Alliance (PA) and the opposition United National Party (UNP) have
agreed to adopt a bipartisan approach towards the resolution of
the ethnic conflict, Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar
announced here tonight.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the leader of the opposition had exchanged
letters about a number of arrangements which are intended to
develop a common, cross-party approach - a bipartisan approach
towards the resolution of the ethnic conflict in the country,"
Kadirgamar said.
</P>
<P>
"The need to restore peace was of overwhelming importance, for
progress in other areas in the country and for the prosperity of
the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a need which transcends party politics. There can be no
doubt that a great many of Sri Lankans irrespective of political
persuasion, share this view and believe that efforts should be
made to develop common approaches towards the resolution of the
conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the understanding between the parties was an important
and valuable step to help resolve a vital issue. "It deserved to
be welcomed widely by the people and by the friends of Sri Lanka."

<HEADLINE> Belarusian Leaders Meet Chinese Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MINSK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Belarusian leaders today held talks
on bilateral relations with Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo who
arrived last night for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with the Chinese official this morning,
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that Belarus highly
values relations with China and regards it as a sincere friend.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that developing a friendly relationship with
China is not only in the interests of the two countries but also
conducive to world peace.
</P>
<P>
He said Belarus and China should cooperate more effectively in
the fields of politics, economy and science and technology as well
as international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier briefed Lukashenko on China's foreign
policy and its relations with other countries. He said that both
Belarus and China oppose any countries imposing their own will and
model on others and hold that every country should have the right
to choose their own road of development.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that by signing political documents with his Chinese
counterpart Jiang Zemin during his visit to China last year,
Lukashenko has promoted Sino-Belarusian ties to a new level and
laid the legal foundation for further improvement.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday morning, Belarusian Prime Minister Sergei Ling
told the Chinese official that Belarus is satisfied with its
relations with China and hopes to strengthen cooperation in the
fields of auto industry, chemical industry, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Wu told his host that China is willing to explore new ways and
areas for cooperation with Belarus under the conditions of their
market economies and is encouraging Chinese enterprises to
establish direct economic and trade links with their Belarusian
counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Kohl to Run for Reelection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- After a record 15 years in office,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today revealed his plan to seek
another four-year term in the 1998 general election.
</P>
<P>
"I will run because I believe that I have an obligation to do
this in the current situation," Kohl said in an interview with
Germany's ARD television network.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing difficult international developments," Kohl said
while celebrating his 67th birthday at an Austrian spa in Bad
Hofgastein. It is the first time he made clear his intentions to
run for a fifth term.
</P>
<P>
Having been in office since 1982, Kohl is currently the longest
serving leader in major Western countries. He oversaw some of the
most indelible developments of the country, including the 1990
unification.
</P>
<P>
But his popularity has been declining recently as the country
suffers a post-war record unemployment and a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll conducted by the RTL television network today
showed that 67.5 percent of the some 60,000 people asked were
against Kohl running again in October, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) said today
that it would name its candidates for chancellor in April next
year as planned.

ROME, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini today said that United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
had cleared up a statement which ruffled Italian feathers on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his earlier statement, Annan said Italy needed to make
"psychological reparation" for last Friday's tragic shipwreck of
Albanians before going in to lead a multinational aid protection
force.
</P>
<P>
Dini reacted sharply on Wednesday, saying Albania, not Italy,
might be expected to compensate for the wave of immigrants Italy
has had to cope with.
</P>
<P>
But today Dini said Annan had explained his meaning
"better": that Italy must do everything needed to make sure the
aid operation runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he shared these views and added that Italy would also
do everything in its power to assist Albania regarding the
shipwreck itself.

<HEADLINE> EU "Anxious" for Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union was as anxious
as anyone for Middle East peace, but a lasting settlement was a
matter for Israel and the Palestinians, the European Commission
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It would be useful and acceptable for our role to be enhanced,
but so far only one side has asked for it," said Josep Coll i
Carbo, spokesman for Manuel Marin, the European Commissioner
responsible for Middle East affairs.
</P>
<P>
Coll i Carbo made the remarks at a news briefing when asked
whether there might be a European initiative following calls by
the Arab League for a greater EU role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue was certain to be raised during a meeting of
EU and Mediterranean foreign ministers in Malta later this month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting -- which will include Israel -- will go ahead
despite a pledge by the Arab League on Monday to freeze relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arab-Israeli relations have plummeted since Israel started
building a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the 15 EU member countries and the south
Mediterranean, including Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco,
Tunisia, Algeria, the Palestinian Authority and Israel are due to
meet in Malta on April 15 and 16 to assess progress in the
Euro-Med Partnership agreed in Barcelona, Spain, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hopes are growing that the European Union might at last play a
key role as a broker to save the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU's influence is underpinned by the fact that it accounts
for 53 percent of foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority and is
Israel's biggest trading partner.

<P>
PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
today that the 1938 Munich Treaty signed by France and Britain to
let Hitler's Germany grasp one part of Czechoslovakia is a
"shameful resignation of democracy."
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the two chambers of the Czech parliament in
Prague, Chirac said that Europe should draw a lesson from it,
which he said had "thrown the entire Europe into darkness,"
according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
"For all one generation of mine, this shameful resignation of
democracy is considered as its greatest error. It threw the entire
Europe into darkness and tragedies. We should, for Europe, draw a
lesson from it," he said.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain signed the treaty to appease Nazi Germany
and fascist Italy, in the German Bavarian city on September 30,
1938, allowing Germany to annex one part of Czechslovakia at a
time when world fascist forces were starting World War II.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II of Britain made an apology to Prague when
she visited the Czech Republic in March 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Reaffirms French Demand for NATO's European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today reaffirmed France's demand for the building of a European
identity of defense in the NATO Southern Command, which he said is
the precondition for the return of France to NATO's integrated
military command, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
"If the reform of NATO allows Europe to assume a responsibility
permitting the definition of a European identity of defense,
France is ready to adhere," said Chirac at a press conference in
the Czech Republic where he was making a visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that he cannot give a final answer to the question of
whether France and the United States can resolve their dispute
over the Europeanization of NATO's Southern Command, and that the
two countries are continuing their talks "in the best spirit."
</P>
<P>
"If, to the contrary, it is for the reasons that I perfectly
understand and which don't make up any problem between the United
States and France, the Americans can maintain their complete
control of NATO, and France will remain in its present situation,"
said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
France now maintains a single membership of NATO while
remaining independent of the NATO trans-Atlantic integrated
military command structure dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
On the NATO Madrid summit to be held in July, Chirac said that
he is "very optimistic" about the result the summit can obtain and
that France does not have any difference with the United States
over the timing and agenda of the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that reform of NATO "could be finalized and ended in
Madrid."

BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- "Deng Xiaoping and Modern China,"
a pictorial biography of China's late senior leader, has been
published in both Chinese and English by the Modern Publishing
House.
</P>
<P>
With nine chapters and 150,000 Chinese characters, the book
includes over 500 pictures recalling Deng's contributions to China
and the Chinese people in his 70-plus years of revolutionary
activities.
</P>
<P>
A clear-cut image of Deng is presented in the book: as a young
man, he went abroad to seek ways to help China; as a soldier, he
fought in a number of places; as a staunch Party member, he was
indomitable; as a statesman, he worked out a blueprint for China;
and as an old man, he was affectionate toward his family.
</P>
<P>
The authors also wrote a widely-popular 12-part documentary on
Deng which was first televised in January in China.
</P>
<P>
The book was revised five times in the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Companies Urged to Practice Self-Intellectual Rights Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies and institutions
shouldn't just bury their heads in scientific research, they must
also learn how to protect their intellectual rights in today's
competitive market economy, state councillor Song Jian stressed
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of delegates from 45 companies and
institutions, including the Beijing Founder Group and Qinghua
University, Song said that China has established a basic legal
framework for intellectual rights protection, which includes the
newly-revised criminal law containing strict punishment for
violators.
</P>
<P>
But because China has yet to establish competent law enforcing
organizations in the area of intellectual rights protection,
companies and institutions for the time being have to learn how to
protect themselves and leave no areas vulnerable to intellectual
rights violation, Song said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of intellectual rights
protection for China's own famous-brand goods in the world.
Chinese officials and economists recently have been calling on
companies to publicize this issue more widely and also to improve
the quality of their goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held in the Great Hall
of the People here today to mark the 7th anniversary of the
promulgation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The participants, who are from the various circles of the
Chinese capital, agreed that the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR is
of historical and international significance.
</P>
<P>
Also, they said that today's meeting is very important for the
publicity and implementation of the Basic Law as well as for Hong
Kong's smooth transition and its stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to handle matters concerning Hong Kong according
to the Basic Law, in order to make Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one
country, two systems" come true in the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, presided over the forum.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending and addressing the gathering were Wang
Hanbin, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress; Zeng Jianhui, director of the Information
Office of the State Council; Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch; Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council; and Wu
Jianfan, a member of the former Committee for Drafting the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Wan Hanbin said the Basic Law, which has made the "one country,
two systems" concept into law, stipulates the basic system and
policy of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it outlines a clear blueprint for the future of Hong
Kong, and turned the concept of "one country, two systems" into a
series of concrete provisions in the law, he said, adding that the
Basic Law will provide a legal guarantee for the successful
implementation of the "one country, two systems" concept.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Nomination of Tshisekedi as Zairean PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the nomination
by Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko of Etienne Tshisekedi as the
country's prime minister, saying it should create a "favorable
condition" for the two warring sides of Zaire to start talks this
weekend in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the nomination of Tshisekedi as the new
chief of the Zairean government. This nomination should create a
favorable climate for the inter-Zairean negotiations which should
open at the end of the week in South Africa," said French Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will be held through the mediation of Mohammed
Sahnoun, the envoy of the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity for the Great Lakes region in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
On the plight of the refugees and displaced people in Zaire,
the spokesman said that their situation remains "very worrying."
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our utmost to appeal to the international
community, especially to the humanitarian organizations and our
Western partners, in order that a solution be found and that one
can save the people in distress when it is still not too late,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that a French Foreign Ministry official in charge of
African affairs had discussed the issue with a U.S. State
Department official in Paris Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Thai Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today told the visiting Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
that China and Thailand can develop long-term, good-neighborly and
all-round cooperative relations marked by mutual trust and a view
to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Sino-Thai friendship has set a fine example for the
peaceful co-existence between countries with different systems,
adding that his meeting with Chavalit is like that between old
friends who have been reunited.
</P>
<P>
He said he was convinced that Chavalit's current China visit
will further the development of bilateral friendly and cooperative
relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Thailand have enjoyed time-honored friendship, and
they have always been good friends and neighbors, Jiang said,
noting that although the international situation has changed
greatly since the two countries forged diplomatic relations, they
have always trusted and understood each other and had a sincere
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Friendship between the people of the two countries has
increased, he said, and they have made progress in many areas.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that countries with diverse systems should and can
achieve peaceful co-existence and common development," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said the number of government ministers, military
leaders and enterpreneurs who accompanied him on his China trip
set an unprecedented record, and symbolizes the deep friendship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he can see great changes that have taken place in China
every time he comes to the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai people are pleased with this," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Thai government will continue to devote itself
to promoting Thai-Chinese friendship, and adhere to the "one
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that the two countries belong to
Asia, the Chinese government has always attached great importance
on advancing its friendly ties with Thailand, and they have a good
basis for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to consolidate and foster bilateral
good-neighborly relations at the dawn of the next century, to
raise such ties to a new high," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Citing 1997 as important in Chinese history, he said China will
witness two major events this year: the forthcoming 15th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which will follow the
concept of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in
order to push forward the opening up and socialist modernization
drive into the 21st century; and the China's resumption of
exercising its sovereignty over Hong Kong, which will bring it a
more prosperous and stable future according to the policies of
"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and "high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return to the motherland is the first step to the
completion of China's peaceful reunification, which will be
followed by Macao's stable transition and the solving of the
Taiwan issue," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted China's reunification complies with desire of the
people and the historical trend, saying that splitting the
motherland will be in vain.
</P>
<P>
A stable, developing and powerful China will be a major
contribution to peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region,
as well as in the world at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his thanks to Chavalit and the Thai
government for their adhering to the "one China" stance and
supporting China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said the Thai government and people are fully
confident in China's development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's smooth resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong is a source of pride for the Chinese
people as well for all Asians.
</P>
<P>
A unified and powerful China is an important strength for
safeguarding world peace, he said, and the unwarranted charges
against China by some people are completely erroneous.

<HEADLINE> Forum to Mark 7th Anniversary of HK SAR Basic Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang said that the Basic Law has displayed increasing vitality
and importance as it relates to Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the law will play a crucial role
for the region's long-term prosperity and stability after China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
Also, it will have a far-reaching impact on China's cause of
reunification in general, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in carrying out the Basic Law, all matters
should be handled in strict accordance with it.
</P>
<P>
And, it is of utmost importance to ensure the realization of
the principles of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy, so as to
guarantee the Hong Kong SAR will enjoy the executive, legislative
and independent judicial power and power of final appeal,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Matters within the autonomy of the SAR should be administered
by the SAR on its own, and anything that is up to the Hong Kong
people to decide will be decided by them alone, without any
interference of the central government, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that for a comprehensive implementation of the Basic
Law, no hasty revisions should be made of it.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that the socialist system and policies
shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong SAR, and the existing
capitalist system and way of life there will remain unchanged for
50 years, Wang reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The law also says that "no amendment to this law shall
contravene the established basic policies of the People's Republic
of China regarding Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, shows that the basic policies of the People's
Republic of China regarding Hong Kong set in the Sino-British
Joint Declaration have been contained in the Basic Law, which
cannot be revised within 50 years, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that strict implementation of the Basic Law is
highly important for Hong Kong's continued success in the next 50
years.
</P>
<P>
With the guarantee of the Basic Law, and with the efforts of
the Hong Kong compatriots and the support of all the Chinese
people, Hong Kong will surely have an even brighter future after
its return to the motherland, he added.

Zeng Jianhui said that the Chinese government promised in the
Sino-British Joint Declaration to guarantee Hong Kong residents'
freedom of speech and publication.
</P>
<P>
During the drafting of the Basic Law, Zeng said, ensuring Hong
Kong residents' freedom of the press was included at the request
of the press circles in the region. This clearly shows that the
Basic Law specially guarantees freedom of the press, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, after Hong Kong returns to the
motherland on July 1, 1997, freedom of the press in Hong Kong will
be fully guaranteed by law.
</P>
<P>
Zeng stressed that the information departments and institutions
between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong will not be
subordinated to each other or interfere in each other's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The management method of the Chinese mainland media shall not
be used in Hong Kong and Hong Kong will act in accordance with its
original system and rules of operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan said since the promulgation of the Basic Law, various
social organizations, newspapers and people in the various circles
of Hong Kong have done a great deal to promote the Basic Law,
which has had a positive influence on society.
</P>
<P>
He summarized the work to promote the Basic Law as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- large-scale activities have been held to mark the
anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law;
</P>
<P>
-- a rich variety of public activities have been conducted to
introduce the Basic Law throughout the year;
</P>
<P>
-- a batch of supplementary books have been published about the
Basic Law to help clarify issues for Hong Kong people;
</P>
<P>
-- activities have been held that included the related
departments of the inland areas to expand the influence of the
Basic Law;
</P>
<P>
-- more and more Hong Kong people have conscientiously studied
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the majority of Hong Kong residents and the
international community firmly uphold the Basic Law in the various
activities of preparing the Hong Kong SAR in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with matters in strict accordance with the Basic
Law, they have come to realize that the Chinese government has a
serious attitude toward the implementation of the Basic Law, and
believe that the Basic Law is sure to be carried out to the
letter, he noted.

Chen Ziying said it is seven years since the promulgation of the
Basic Law, and Hong Kong has entered its late-transitional period.
</P>
<P>
"We strictly abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and
firmly upheld the principle that Hong Kong's development in
politics, economy, society and other fields must be in line with
the Basic Law," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Facts prove that only if China and Britain strictly abide by
the Joint Declaration and principles in line with the Basic Law,
will both sides enjoy smooth cooperation on the Hong Kong
question, and Hong Kong will be stable in the transitional period,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said sticking to the Basic Law is a fundamental practice
in preparing the Hong Kong SAR, adding that implementation of the
law also needs to be combined with the characteristics of Hong
Kong, in order to respect its history and actual situation, and to
settle matters concerning the basic interests of the local
residents with a realistic approach.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that although the Basic Law is about the Hong
Kong SAR, it is also a national law, which must be abided by not
only by the Hong Kong residents, but also by the people in the
inland areas, either in the Hong Kong SAR, or in the provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities of the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
He also corrected the misunderstanding of some people that they
will be free to go to Hong Kong and establish an organ there
after July 1, 1997, saying that these ideas run counter to the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jianfan said it is of highest importance to adopt a
practical and effective measure to ensure the Basic Law will be
carried out successfully.
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcement departments must attach great importance to
the implementation of the Basic Law, supervising the carrying out
of the law and solving the legal matters during the process in
time, he noted.

HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An Australian College has joined
in a Hong Kong university to offer distance-learning business
courses to pave the way for future operations in the Chinese
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
A further education and training college, the Open Learning
Institute of Technical And Further Education (TAFE) based in
Queensland, Australia, joined in the Hong Kong College of
Technology International (HKCTI) in operating the four business
diploma courses now offered in the Hong Kong college.
</P>
<P>
And the two colleges wish to introduce the courses in the
Chinese inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Institute and the HKCTI are interested in exploring
the China market," HKCTI program development executive Flora Chan
Kit-ching was quoted by English-language newspaper South China
Morning Post today as saying.
</P>
<P>
HKCTI is now the sole Hong Kong examination center for China's
government-administered self-study High Education Examination.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and
Executive Councilor of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Henry Tang Ying-yen applauded the event. "This event highlights
two key elements which are vital to the future development of
business in Hong Kong. The first is education and the second is
collaboration," he said.

"There are many examples in Hong Kong of companies teaming up
with others around the world to offer customers the best possible
service or product, like the establishment of manufacturing joint
ventures.

<P>
PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today promised the Czech Republic that France will do all it can
to help Prague join the European Union (EU) in 2000 and the NATO
in 1999, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the two chambers of the Czech parliament in
Prague today, Chirac said, "Prepare ourselves without delay,
prepare ourselves together."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held later today, Chirac said, "Europe
cannot exist in the future if it is not united."
</P>
<P>
"The split of Yalta has done us a lot of pain, and it should be
definitely erased," said Chirac, referring to the division of
Europe in two blocs after World War II.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO Madrid summit to be held in July will
discuss how to "renew the alliance to adapt it to the present
imperatives of European security and to reaffirm within itself a
European identity of defense, in which the Czech Republic should
fully play its role."
</P>
<P>
"The Czech Republic should be one of those countries which will
join NATO in 1999," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "constructive cooperation" between NATO and
Russia, Chirac said that it is necessary to establish a charter
between the two sides so that Moscow will not think that NATO's
expansion makes up "an aggression or humiliation" for it.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Hungary, Poland and Romania should also be
the countries to join NATO in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between NATO and central European countries
applying for its membership will begin in January 1998.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Alliance Rejects Offer of Zaire Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Alliance of Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) today rejected an
offer of six ministries to join a government headed by zaire's
new Premier Etienne Tshisekedi, a report from Goma said.
</P>
<P>
Raphael Nghenda, ADFL Information Commissioner, told reporters
as he boarded a plane in the eastern Zairean town of Goma for the
talks in South Africa that his alliance would not accept the
posts reserved by Tshisekedi for them.
</P>
<P>
He boarded the plane in the company of Bizima Karaha, Foreign
Affairs Commissioner for the ADFL which led the rebellion to
fight to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko in eastern Zaire last
October.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today Tshisekedi unveiled a 26-member cabinet in
Kinshasa with no associates of President Mobutu and six
ministries reserved for the rebel alliance in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Tshisekedi, addressing a news conference on the formation of
his new government, said portfolios of foreign affairs, defense,
budget, planning, foreign trade and agriculture were reserved for
the rebel alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels have said they would not negotiate with
Tshisekedi as prime minister and would only deal directly with
Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Tshisekedi today praised Laurent Kabila, whose rebels have
seized a quarter of Zaire and are targeting mainstay mining
centers after taking up arms to fight from the Rwandan border in
October.
</P>
<P>
``Kabila has contributed to the return of legality. He merits
the acclaim of our people,'' Tshisekedi said, trying to lure
kabila into making contact with him.
</P>
<P>
But he said the civil war now had to stop.
</P>
<P>
Nghenda and Karaha later left for South Africa for the first
face-to-face negotiations with an eight-member Zairean government
delegation led by Honore Ngbanda, Mobutu's security adviser.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 14.8 million U.S. dollar credit to help finance
the Sri Lanka government's Environmental Action I Project.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to support the government's efforts to
strengthen its institutional and policy framework for
environmental management and take immediate measures to reverse
the southern Asian country's trend of environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
The project will support the restructuring of the Environment
Department within Sri Lanka's Ministry of Transport, Environment
and Women's Affairs so it can play a central role in environmental
policy, planning, and coordination at the national level. It will
also help develop a policy action plan which will broadly define
the legal and policy changes necessary for sound environmental
management.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is estimated at 20.7 million dollars. In
addition to the World Bank's credit which will be channeled
through the International Development Association (IDA)--- the
World Bank's concessional lending wing, the government of Sri
Lanka will provide 3.4 million dollars and local communities 2.5
million dollars which will be mainly provided in labor and
material.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An inter-sectoral committee
comprising government, employers and trade unions has formulated
a national code of practice on AIDS and employment which, among
other things, forbids HIV testing for employment purposes.
</P>
<P>
The code, which is now before the Attorney General, is to
cover all public and private sector work places, including export
processing zones and diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
According to the preamble of the code, released at a meeting
of the inter-sectoral committee on AIDS today, an employee with
HIV should be treated the same way as any other healthy employee
while a worker with AIDS had to be treated as any other with a
life threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
The code forbids compulsory HIV testing in work places while
direct pre-employment testing would also not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
The code is a result of over two years of consultations
between the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare,
the Employers Confederation of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe Congress
of Trade Unions and will be incorporated into the Labor Relations
Act.

The 100 reforms proposed to Germany's present securities laws
would among other things facilitate money raising by foreign
companies on the country's financial market, according to Juergen
Stark, state secretary for finance.
</P>
<P>
For example, foreign-language prospectuses would be allowed
under some circumstances according to the new rules, in comparison
with current provisions that demand German version of prospectuses
from all foreign issuers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new laws okay new derivatives including
interest-rate and foreign-exchange swaps.
</P>
<P>
The revisions raise the maximum penalty for issuing fraudulent
prospectuses to 1 million marks (600,000 US dollars) from the
current 100,000 marks, while easing the punishment for false
statements in company prospectuses and reports -- the court would
have three years instead of five years to charge offenders.

<HEADLINE> PAC Makes Disciplinary Decision Against Makwetu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) of South Africa today reached finality about possible
disciplinary steps against its former president Clarence Makwetu,
but PAC officials declined to reveal what the decision was.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at an internal disciplinary committee
hearing at PAC's Pretoria office earlier in the day without
attendance of Makwetu.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu is facing three charges relating to allegations that
he has divided the party, created factions, and has violated the
PAC's oath of allegiance which states that a member will accept
party leadership.
</P>
<P>
PAC insiders said it was believed the committee had
recommended that Makwetu, now national chairman, be expelled from
the organization.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials said, however, the finding of the
disciplinary hearing would be referred to the party's National
Executive Committee (NEC) for approval. The NEC was scheduled to
meet in Soweto on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu, who earlier confirmed he would attend the hearing,
did not show up at the hearing charging him of violating the
party's constitution. He spent the day in "his fields" in Eastern
Cape Province instead.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu lost the presidency to former Methodist Bishop Stanley
Mogoba at the PAC's national conference in December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu's supporters claim the elections were
unconstitutional and have refused to recognize the party's new
leadership, thus causing an internal strife and rival factions.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Infiltrated: Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- ZANU (PF) National Chairman Joseph
Msika today charged that Zimbabwe's ruling party has been
infiltrated by some agents bent on discrediting it with the
public.
</P>
<P>
Msika asserted here that the party's leadership is now in the
process of identifying and weeding out undesirable elements
tarnishing the image of ZANU (PF), which has ruled the country
since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
''There are people who tried to organize their own party to
oppose ZANU (PF) and when they found that ZANU (PF) was very
strong, they resorted to the expression that if you cannot defeat
them, then join them and fight them from within,'' Msika said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the infiltrators had used money to buy their
way into the party or employed some unscrupulous means to
hoodwink either the district or provincial leadership of ZANU
(PF).
</P>
<P>
Some, he went on, had even gained entry into the central
committee.
</P>
<P>
''Those that are found committing acts of indiscipline will be
severely dealt with by way of punishing them through suspension.
If they prove to be incorrigible, as a last resort it would be
expulsion from the party,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Rejects Turkey's Accusations Over Arson Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The German government today said it
was "astonished" and "disappointed" at the recent accusations by
Turkey that Germany tolerates human rights abuses against Muslims,
news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's ambassador to Germany, Volkan Vural, was summoned to
the German Foreign Ministry today and was given a letter as a
reaction to the accusations made by Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
"It is not acceptable that official Turkish positions take part
in prejudgement, unsubstantiated accusations and attacks on the
German government," the German news agency DPA quoted the letter
as saying.
</P>
<P>
After nine Turkish nationals were killed in arson attacks in
Germany and the Netherlands during the past week, Erbakan
reportedly accused Western European leaders of tolerating such
anti-Islamic activities.
</P>
<P>
"You take the people who perpetrate these horrors and release
them three days later so they can roam free as a bird again. That
is nothing less than condoning their behavior," one of them said.
</P>
<P>
So far, authorities in both Germany and the Netherlands have
failed to find out the motives behind the arson attacks.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out in a Turkish family's apartment early Monday
at the western German city of Krefeld, killing a 41-year-old
Turkish woman and her 19-year-old daughter when they jumped from a
third-floor window to escape. The woman's 17-year-old son died of
smoke inhalation inside the apartment.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish community in Germany has called for a quick
clarification of the incident while the Turkish ambassador in Bonn
said in an interview with a German television after the incident
that xenophobia and racist attacks are a "reality in Germany."

<HEADLINE> Britain Ranks Low in World Health Study: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain ranks 15th in a world
health survey of 27 countries and is among the unhealthiest places
to live in Western Europe, according to a latest world health
study.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by The Economist Intelligence Unit, uses
12 indicators of public health to judge each nation's physical
wellbeing, which included immunization rates, maternal mortality,
HIV, infant mortality, and rates of cancer, heart disease and
respiratory disease per head of population, as well as life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain has respectable figures for average life
expectancy, bad diet and a high number of deaths from cancer and
circulatory diseases put the country behind Mexico and Israel in
the league table.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that Sweden is the healthiest place in the
world and has the best medical practice. Israel is the second best
place to avoid being ill. South Africa is the least healthy place,
with India, Brazil and Russia in the places just above it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, health care in the United States, which is 13th in
the league table, is also at a low ebb. The study blamed this on
the increasing numbers in the US who no longer have any medical
insurance and cannot afford to pay for medical care.
</P>
<P>
It said that 45 million people, roughly 16 percent of the
country's population are expected to be uninsured by the turn of
the century.

<HEADLINE> EMU Timetable to Top EU Finance Ministers Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance ministers
and central bankers will meet this weekend in Noordwijk, the
Netherlands, to swap views on the different 1998 timetable seeking
to determine the list of countries that will be joining the single
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
"The main objective (of the informal meeting) will be to give
further impetus to the preparation of the third and final stage of
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)," the Dutch EU presidency said in
a statement today.
</P>
<P>
Disturbed by widespread speculation in recent weeks about a
delay in the starting date for the Euro, the EU finance ministers,
however, are expected to reaffirm their commitment to the 1999
deadline.
</P>
<P>
Even though a number of issues concerning the technical aspects
of EMU will be on the table at the weekend gathering, such details
are anticipated by some experts to be forced to take a back seat
to the more pressing concerns of sluggish EU growth, rising
unemployment and the battle that many EU governments are having in
meeting the precondition for EMU, scheduled to start on January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
More attention will be drawn on Germany, which is facing record
unemployment and doubts over the speed at which its economy will
expand in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Countries wishing to join EMU must meet various criteria set
out in the Maastricht treaty on deficits, debt, inflation,interest
rates and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Prior to March 1, 1998, each member state is required to
provide the European Commission with final information on the
country's 1997 budget performance.
</P>
<P>
The commission and the European Monetary Institute, the
forerunner of the future European Central Bank, will then have
roughly two weeks to come up with their convergence reports.
</P>
<P>
After the evaluation, there is a six-week consultation period
with the European Parliament, before a qualified majority decision
will be taken, at a meeting of heads of state and government of
the EU countries, to adopt the list of countries due to join the
Euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
While a precise date might not be set in Noordwijk, the
logistics of the EU decision-making process suggests a late-April
timetable, a commission official said.
</P>
<P>
In the seaside town of Noordwijk, the ministers will also
receive an update on negotiations to put a stability and growth
pact into a legal context.
</P>
<P>
The pact, which seeks to penalize governments running excessive
budget deficit -- above 3 percent of GDP -- inside EMU, was agreed
last December after lengthy and often tense negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The group will also take stock of negotiations on a revamped
Exchange Rate Mechanism, dubbed ERM 2, and designed to link
countries outside EMU to the Euro.

<HEADLINE> Unclear Rules Dog European Tender Process: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Rules for tendering maintenance
contracts in the European Union are often unclear and interpreted
in different ways, according to a recent research carried out for
the Dutch state building service Rijksgebouwdienst.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said either the European Commission should
clarify the rules or European jurisprudence should be adapted as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, EU member states have to tender out
maintenance projects whenever the cost goes over a given limit.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Netherlands, they said, this has meant that
114 contracts with a total value of almost 10.5 million US dollars
a year have been put out to tender.
</P>
<P>
However, various contractors' organizations in the Netherlands
have protested about the strict, and complicated, way the EU
directives have been interpreted.

<HEADLINE> Major Blames IRA for Bombs on British Motorway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- British police found a suspect
package of explosives today which was planted on one of the
country's major motorways.
</P>
<P>
Although no group claimed responsibility for the attempted
bombing, Prime Minister John Major blamed the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) for the incident.
</P>
<P>
"It was intended deliberately to cause trouble, and it looks as
though it was the IRA playing silly games," Major told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I think most people know what the IRA are and see them for
what they are," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters news agency quoted a local police spokesman as
saying the advice they have from bomb disposal experts "is that
the device was a viable bomb which, if it had gone off, could have
caused considerable damage and possible loss of life as well."
</P>
<P>
At the height of the morning rush hour, police received coded
telephone calls warning of bombs in various sections of motorways
in central England. A Defense Ministry's bomb squad was sent
immediately to a motorway bridge where a suspect package was
found.
</P>
<P>
Mo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland spokeswoman for the opposition
Labor party, also blamed the IRA.
</P>
<P>
"Labor deplores this action by the IRA. The IRA... must
understand a new Labor government would oppose tooth and nail the
use of violent and terrorist methods for political ends," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Four Parties Meet in Athens to Discuss Albania Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece, Albania, the European Union
(EU) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) today agreed in their talks here that the international
community will coordinate their actions in restoring peace and
stability in the strife-ridden Albania.
</P>
<P>
The talks were attended by visiting Albanian Prime Minister
Bashkim Fino, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, Dutch
Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo, whose country is currently
holding the rotating EU presidency, and OSCE special envoy for
Albania Franz Vranitsky, former Austrian chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the talks, Foreign
Minister Pangalos said that the solidarity of the international
community in restoring peace and stability in Tirana was
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Vranitsky set out three aspects of action
planned by the international community. These were the
distribution of humanitarian and economic aid, to be directed by
the EU; the establishment and protection of democracy and human
rights, including the June elections, to be coordinated by the
OSCE; and the international peace force, to be undertaken by
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Fino emphasized during the talks that the June elections would
be fair and democratic and would be held with the support of the
OSCE and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that Albania had requested during the talks that
the multinational force to be dispatched to Albania not be divided
into national contingents but rather be composed of mixed units,
and the Greek side had agreed to Tirana's position.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the "interlocutor" of the international
community in Tirana was of course the Albanian government.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that during Wednesday's talks, Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis proposed and Fino accepted the
strengthening of the international community's "institutional pole
of action in Albania."
</P>
<P>
As for the deployment of the multinational force in Albania, he
said that Athens did not insist that the 700 Greek contingent be
stationed in southern Albania, where about 300,000 ethnic Greek
minority live, because Athens was exercising a policy of
friendship and cooperation which took into consideration the
entire Albanian people, Pangalos said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece was implementing the same policy in the
Balkans in general, aimed at creating relations "which look
forward not backwards."
</P>
<P>
The primary aspiration of Greek foreign policy was to safeguard
the inviolability of borders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the target was "not to go beyond the end
of next week." He was referring to the date of the multinational
force to be sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Fino, Hans van Mierlo and Vranitsky arrived here Wednesday for
talks with the Greek government to discuss ways of solving the
crisis in Albania, particularly in the deployment of the
multinational force and the economic assistance to be given to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Fino is expected to leave here for Tirana later today.

<HEADLINE> OIC: Jerusalem Core of Arab-Israeli Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem, the holy city to
Muslims, Jews and Christians alike, is the core of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, Secretary General of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) Abdel Aziz Ghoush said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in a telephone interview
with the Egypt's Voice of the Arab, he said the Islamic world can
not accept anything which impairs their right in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Any solution that does not secure rights in Jerusalem is
deficient and unacceptable on the Islamic level," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of
killing the Mideast peace process by sending bulldozers to Jabal
Abu Ghneim, or Har Homa, to build the 6,500-unit Jewish
neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The major resolutions issued by the Islamabad Islamic summit,
the Jerusalem Committee of the OIC and the Arab League Council
meetings are natural reactions against Israel's policy that aims
at imposing a status quo in the Holy city, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. to play its role as main sponsor of the
peace process and spare the area the violence which is not in the
interests of any party.
</P>
<P>
"This is possible through making Israel implement the principle
of land for peace and the international legitimacy resolutions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the U.S. double veto last month in the U.N. Security
Council of moves to condemn Israel's settlement project, the
Islamic and Arab countries launched an intensive campaign to halt
what they view the Judaization attempt on Jerusalem by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs decided to stop normal relations with Israel, revive
economic boycott, close down Israeli missions and withdraw from
Mideast multilateral talks in a resolution approved by the Arab
League Council meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, wanting to establish a capital in East
Jerusalem, accused Israel of sabotaging the peace process by
building a Jewish housing project on disputed Arab land and
tempering the Islamic features of the holy city.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting of the Bosnia
Peace Monitoring Committee ended today in Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Carl Bildt,
High Representative responsible for the implementation of Dayton
Agreement's civilian issues, said that "I believe that peace will
be installed gradually to the region."
</P>
<P>
Two decisions were taken at the Steering Committee meeting,

<HEADLINE> First Desalination Plant Inaugurated in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
today inaugurated the island's first desalination plant in a major
step to tackle the country's chronic fresh water shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
The desalination plant, constructed near the Dhekelia electric
power station on the island's southeastern coast, will meet the
increased demand for water in the country's burgeoning tourist
areas in the Famagusta District, eastern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
The plant is capable, at maximum capacity, of converting
40,000 cubic meters of sea water into drinking water, which meets
the strict European standards.
</P>
<P>
"This project takes on a heightened importance due to the
continual water shortage we face," Clerides said at the
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He added "the water problem is something that concerns all of
us, the public and the state. We are compelled to deal with this
problem diligently and insistently, because our economic and
social progress depends on it."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has suffered severe droughts throughout its history,
including this year's continuous drought, due to the lack of rain
and a shortage of rivers running all year-round.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the agricultural sector, as well as most villages
and towns, depend on the Cyprus' damming network which can hold
up to 300 million cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
"A strategic plan for water needs has been drawn up by the
government to cover the period up to the year 2010," the
president said, adding that the government plans, beyond
constructing new dams and desalination plants, are to engender a
public conscience for conserving water.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that when government measures kick into gear,
about 95 to 100 million cubic meters of water will be added to the
island's reserves.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Cypriot government adopted strict
measures to save fresh water as the island's water reserves
are currently at the lowest level since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Since January, water supply to the households in the country
has been reduced by 20 percent, with water supply provided only
three days a week. Water for farming purposes has also been
decreased by up to 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Angola Implements Self-Employment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,820 people in Angola's
Luanda Province have got jobs in 640 small enterprises since
November l995, when the Ministry of Public Administration and
Employment began to implement a self-employment program.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed to the press by Venceslau de Matos, an
official in the ministry, here today.
</P>
<P>
He said, the self-employment program is aimed at solving the
problem of unemployment in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the ministry provides tools to the
jobless people and allows them to run small enterprises to
employ themselves.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has provided 791 sets of tools to the jobless in
the province since November l995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The receivers of the tools must pay 75 percent of the tools'
cost in three and a half years after they start their business,
according to the program.
</P>
<P>
Matos said his ministry will provide raw materials and
equipment to the jobless in the near future to further solve
the problem of unemployment. enditem

<HEADLINE> Angolan New Govt to Inaugurate as Scheduled: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- UN envoy to Angola Blondin Beye
said here today that the Angolan government of national unity and
reconciliation will inaugurate on April 11 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members from the former rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) will assume office
on the set date of April 9, Beye added when meeting with Brazil
Ambassador to Angola Alexandre Addor.
</P>
<P>
An old dispute has re-emerged between the Angolan government
and UNITA over the special political status of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi in the postwar period after the Joint Committee on
Angola's Peace Process fixed the dates on Monday, posing a threat
to the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government insists that the bill on Savimbi's
status should be discussed and voted by all parliament members,
while UNITA says that its lawmakers will not take office
before the bill gets through.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Beye, Addor said he believes that the
peace process in the southern African country will go forward
normally.
</P>
<P>
The current problems in the peace process will be solved and
the inauguration timetable will be obeyed by the parties
concerned, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will dispatch delegates to attend the inauguration
ceremony of the new Angolan government, Addor added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Against Turkish Violation of Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Ministry has
protested to the United Nations over the recent violations of
the Cypriot air space by Turkish military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here today, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides cited Cyprus National Guard
information as saying that one reconnaissance plane and
squadrons of Turkish fighters have violated Cyprus' sovereign air
space and the Nicosia Flight Information Region (FIR) on five
different occasions in the past ten days.
</P>
<P>
On March 27, he noted, a reconnaissance aircraft, RF-4,
approached the island's northern coast, violating the Nicosia
FIR. He added that on March 31 there were two violations of the
Republic's air space and Nicosia's FIR, and another two
violations on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military aircraft also entered the Cyprus'
northern air space and flew over the Turkish-occupied northern
areas, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"These facts constitute a violation of international law and
are accordingly protested to the U.N. by the Foreign Ministry,"
Cassoulides said, adding that "they are not conducive to the
climate which should exist in the on-going negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that despite these violations "our side
will continue its constructive stance during the proximity
talks." But he noted that President Glafcos Clerides will raise
the issue during his meeting Friday with U.N. Resident
Representative Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led proximity talks, during which Feissel has
bi-weekly separate meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos
clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, have entered
into their third week.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at breaking the current deadlock on
Cyprus problem and paving the way for the U.N. proposed direct
negotiations between the leaders of the two community during the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has indicated that it wants to see both sides make
"goodwill gestures" to improve the climate for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an Athens-backed
coup.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Chief's special
representative for Cyprus Han Sung Joo will begin a week-long
visit to Cyprus on April 12 in a bid to help start face-to-face
negotiations between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here
today that the Cypriot government welcomes Han's visit to Cyprus
aimed at breaking the deadlock in efforts to reach a solution to
the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
announced that the U.N. representative will then visit Ankara and
Athens for talks on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, the Cypriot spokesman
said that Han is expected "at a crucial period in the proximity
talks" between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides conducted by
U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
He added that "it is logical that after three to four weeks of
talks the time would be appropriate for the U.N. to review the
situation and redirect their course accordingly."
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored proximity talks, during which Feissel has
bi-weekly separate meetings with Clerides and Denktash, have
entered into their third week. However, nothing has been revealed
about the talks which began on March 10.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two communities have not met since October
1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is stepping up efforts so that direct negotiations
for a solution to the Cyprus problem could begin by the middle
of this year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Annan will meet Denktash in Geneva,
Switzerland, on April 9, prior to Han's visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Teach Kiswahili in Schools to Enhance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has planned to teach
Kiswahili language in schools to enhance the East African
Co-operation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
According the official Daily News, visiting Prime Minister of
Uganda Kintu Musoke said here today that in his country's new
education curriculum Kiswahili would be included as a medium of
instruction in schools.
</P>
<P>
Musoke, who was speaking during a luncheon hosted by the local
business community at the Hotel Agip in the city, said he was sure
that within 10 to 20 years there would be enough Kiswahili speakers
in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to that while we wait the EAC to mature,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the three EAC member states -- Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda -- had announced Kiswahili as a national language since
independence, the development of the lauguage is quite different
in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan prime minister evoked laughter when he cracked a joke
from Uganda that they say Kiswahili was born in Zanzibar, grew up in
Tanganyika, died in Kenya and buried in Uganda and that his ghost is
in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Musoke, who was flanked by his Tanzanian counterpart Frederick
Sumaye, said the language and other bilateral efforts in enhancing the
co-operation were crucial.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the need to ensure an ever lasting unity among
the three East African states with a view to strenghening and
sustaining the region's internal and external economy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania should form
an economic intergration, saying it was the only way forward to
rapid progress. enditem

DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Great Lakes region
summit on Burundi, scheduled to be held in Arusha, northern
Tanzania, next Tuesday, has been postponed to August 14.
</P>
<P>
An official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation said today the delay was due to most
of the heads of state in the region have other arrangements
including a meeting of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) in Lusaka, Zambia, next week.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to review political developments in
Burundi which is under economic sanctions since last July.
</P>
<P>
It would be the fourth summit since sanctions were imposed on
the central African country after a military junta led by retired
Major Pierre Buyoya overthrew a civilian government in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
The last summit was held on October 12 when leaders in the

ATHENS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino pledged here today to take measures to protect Greek
businessmen in his country.
</P>
<P>
Fino met with a delegation of the newly-formed Committee of
Greek Business Owers in Albania who presented him with a petition
calling for protection by Tirana of their investments there.
</P>
<P>
Fino told the delegation that his country would take security
measures within the framework of more general steps to restore
order.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to have a more detailed discussion with the
group in Tirana next month.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also requested compensation for the damages they
suffered while promising to return to Albania and increase their
investments once the situation had settled down in the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which represents around 70 enterprises with a
total investment of about 40 million dollars, claimed that at
least factories in which Greek companies had an interest had been
destroyed and looted.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of pyramid investment schemes triggered nationwide
protests in Albania which later spilled over into armed conflicts.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A Muslim-Croat joint police will
start patroling central Mostar Friday after both sides agreed on
the law enforcement formation, an international official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The first shift of the joint police will begin at 4:00 am local
time, with 10 policemen from each side and under the supervision
of the UN International Police Task Force (IPTF), said Alexander
Ivanko, spokesman for the IPTF.
</P>
<P>
The agreed joint force for the central district of Mostar will
consist of 100 police officers, 50 from each side, and is part of
the initiative to unify police forces in the Herzegovina-Neretva
canton of the Muslim-Croat federation by the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the joint force have been difficult, especially
after the February 10 incident in which Croat policemen were
accused of killing one Muslim and wounding 20 others who were
visiting family graveyards in the Croat-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
Although both sides finally agreed on joint patrols in the
central district of Mostar, there still exist some minor
differences and the agreement has not been signed by both sides,
the IPTF said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has the right to be a full
member of the European Union (EU) like other candidate countries,
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said here
today.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Turkey has to abide by economic, political and
human rights criterions to realize this.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt made the remarks after French Foreign Minister
Herve De Charette met with Turkish Parliament Speaker Mustafa
Kalemli, Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi and other
political party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was greatly angered by a March 4 statement by the EU
Christian Democrats who called Turkey's membership application
unacceptable due to its religious culture.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Turkish main opposition Motherland Party
(ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz, De Charette said that his visit took
place at a very important time regarding projects between Turkey
and France and Turkish-European ties.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who arrived here Wednesday evening for a two-day
official visit to Turkey, also told Bulent Ecevit, chairman of the
Democratic Left Party (DSP), that "Turkey and France are the two
important powers in the Mediterranean and called for joint efforts
to be extended to turn Mediterranean basin into a region of peace
and stability."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during his meeting with De Charette Wednesday,
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Europe can not be
thought without Turkey and Turkey can not be thought without
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Demirel also expressed gratitude to France for its support for
Turkey's bid to be admitted into the EU.
</P>
<P>
Before her official talks with De Charette Wednesday, Turkish
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
reiterated that she wanted Turkey to be judged on equal terms
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
For his part, De Charette said "France clearly believes that
Turkey has potential to take part in the building of Europe."

<HEADLINE> Britain's GEC to Make Sole Bid for French Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's General Electric Company
(GEC) has registered its intention to make an independent bid for
the French defense electronics company Thomson-CSF which is due to
be privatized next month by the French government.
</P>
<P>
The diversified British defense industrial group last Friday
submitted its surprise 1.2 billion-pound (about 2 billion U.S.
dollar) offer for Thomson-CSF to the French government, according
to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The French conglomerate Alcatel and Lagarere Group are expected
to have submitted separate bids for acquiring the 58 percent
Thomson stake.
</P>
<P>
Defense analysts in London said that GEC's chances of winning
the bidding were slim as the French government has made it clear
that non-French groups were welcome only as subordinates.
</P>
<P>
The French government is likely to announce later this week
which company will be the final bidder for the Thomson-CSF with
final bids due in by May 7.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Thomson privatization is seen as crucial to
the restructuring of the European defense industry, which is under
growing pressure from American defense industry giants, defense
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Irish Government Likely to Call Early Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's three-party coalition
government is likely to call an early election in mid-May as its
popularity gap with opposition parties narrowed, according to
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The MRBI poll, carried in today's Irish Times newspaper,
revealed that Prime Minister John Bruton's coalition, including
Fine Gael, Labor and Democratic Left, was trailing opposition
parties by six percentage points in comparison with a 12-point gap
in a similar poll conducted in January.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 43 percent of those questioned would
prefer a Fianna Fail and Progressive Democrat coalition and 37
percent the current ruling group compared to 44 and 32 percent
respectively in the January survey.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that this latest opinion poll was
likely to encourage Bruton to call an early election in a bid to
profit from a tax reduction budget in January and a wave of job
creation, although the general election is not due until November.
</P>
<P>
Bruton is expected to call a cabinet meeting next Tuesday to
discuss the exact polling date and election experts predicted that
the election would probably be held towards the end of May or in
early June.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey showed that Irish voters were
becoming more and more concerned with crimes, which have overtaken
unemployment as the main election issue.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that there had been a sharp worrying
increase in organized crime and worsening drug problems as drug
abuse increased dramatically across the country.

LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial

futures and options contracts in the first quarter of this year,
an increase of 10 percent over the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE, Europe's leading futures and options exchange and the
third largest exchange of its type in the world, traded 16.57
million contracts in March, a rise of 18 percent on the same month

LIFFE has confirmed its leadership in European money market
instruments. It now has 81 percent market share of European

<HEADLINE> European Shares down on Weak Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
sustained their recent decline and ended sharply lower Thursday,
depressed by Wall Street's retreat, fresh worries about higher
interest rates and the dollar's weakness.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London, although suffered heavy losses early
in the day following the Dow's overnight drop, stood up well in
later trading, with the FTSE 100 index ending 22.0 points lower at
4,214.6.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that gains in utility stocks and hopes that UK
gilts will outperform their US counterparts helped drag the market
back up from its early lows.
</P>
<P>
However, there was little doubt that stocks were vulnerable to
moves in New York.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed the day with heavy losses
after Wall Street jitters undermined the market and traders said
that share prices will continue to take their cue from New York
ahead of the release of all-important US jobs figures on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index finished the session down 86.67 points at
3,215.24.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse closed weaker for the third day running, with
the CAC-40 index 15.76 points lower at 2,514.52, undermined by
fresh losses on Wall Street, lower domestic bonds and weaker
dollar.
</P>

London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended down

<HEADLINE> Stock Fraud Uncovered in New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A stock fraud has been uncovered
in New York City with 18 residents of five states charged on
Wednesday with operating a scheme that bilked investors out of
millions of U.S. dollars, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A ring, made up largely of Russian emigres from the states of
</P>
<P>
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Florida, used
high-pressure sales tactics and gross misrepresentations in
pitching the stock of a company called Globus Group Inc. through
telephone calls to people across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Persuaded by such pitches, at least 800 investors bought Globus
shares between January and September of last year, pushing the
price up 8 dollars a share from 25 cents, and members of the ring
sold, at the higher prices, thousands of shares they secretly
held, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investors lost five million to eight million U.S. dollars in
the fraud. With at least 800 people having been bilked, the
average would be 6,000 to 10,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The indictment was the latest action by law enforcement
officials and securities regulators against stock fraud.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun: Parliamentary Seats to Be Redistributed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun will redistribute
parliamentary seats and create some new constituencies.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a number of presidential decrees
signed here today, local radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the decrees, ahead of the May 17 legislative
elections, new divisions have been given their respective number of
parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
Under the decrees, parliamentary seats will be redistributed
in some constituencies in North, Far North, Litteral,
North West, and South West provinces.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, sources from the Territorial Administration
Ministry say some 18 political parties have so far deposited the
lists of constituencies in which they intend to present
candidates in the forthcoming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued last week by Vice Prime Minister in
charge of territorial administration Gilbert Andze Tsoungui asked
political parties intending to run for the upcoming legislative
elections to deposit by today the lists of constituencies
in which they will run.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the territorial administration say the reason why
political parties are called upon to indicate their constituencies
is to facilitate organizational procedures and ease the distribution
of electorial materials.
</P>
<P>
The former parliament has 180 seats. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international
forum is held at United Nations headquarters to identify concrete
targets and specific measurements of progress for addressing the
urgent global problem of the loss of biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, known as the Global Biodiversity Forum beginning
today, involved about 100 participants from over 30 countries,
United Nations Environment Program, the United Nations Development
Program and the World Bank, leading non-governmental organizations
and scientific institutions.
</P>
<P>
UN reported that the earth's biodiversity is being lost at a
rate unprecedented in human history, due to an onslaught of human
activities leading to the loss, degradation and fragmentation of
natural habitats and the over-exploitation of living resources,
among other threats.
</P>
<P>
To respond to this crisis, the Convention on Biological
Diversity was signed by most of the world's governments at the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The forum will focus on a range of biodiversity indicators and
targets that could be used to develop more effective national
implementation reports and to measure and achieve tangible
progress in implementing the Convention.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Still Threatens Arab World, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Arab world needs 10 billion
U.S. dollars annually to fill the gap between food production and
consumption, according to a Tunisian official here today.
</P>
<P>
At today's inaugural session of a regional symposium on the
investment and agricultural development, Mohamed Channouchi,
Tunisian Minister of International Cooperation and Investment,
said that food deficiency in the Arab world is expected to
deteriorate in view of the growth of population and scarcity of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that per capita water supply by the year
2025 will stand at some 667 cubic meters as compared to 3,430
cubic meters in 1960, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for Arab unity to realize the optimum use of human
and natural resources to check the food problem.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian minister noted the Arab states have intensified
their efforts to develop agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arab Authority of Investment and Agricultural
Development, founded in 1977 with the object of promoting
agricultural resources in member states, will help improve
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The organization will do so by specifying investment
opportunities, encouraging partnership and feasibility studies and
finance of increasing numbers of agricultural and food projects,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Abdul Latif Al Sarkal, chairman of the Arab Authority
of Investment and Agricultural Development, urged the Arab states
to improve economic integration, investment and joint Arab
production capabilities in the agricultural field.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the volume of investment in the
agricultural sector is still humble, not exceeding nine per cent
of the total investments.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition, attended by Tunisia, Morocco, the United Arab
Emirates, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
Kuwait and Jordan, is being held on the sideline of this
symposium.

<HEADLINE> Envoy to Submit Report on Cyprus to UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Resident Representative
Gustave Feissel said here today that he will soon submit a report
on the situation in Cyprus with an assessment of his talks
with the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Feissel made the statement after a meeting with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides on the preparatory work for direct
negotiations between the two Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
He said his report is expected to be submitted in the next few
days prior to Annan's scheduled meeting with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash in Geneva on April 9. Feissel is expected to
be present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the forthcoming visit to Cyprus of U.N. Chief's
special representative for Cyprus, Han Sung Joo, Feissel said the
purpose of Han's visit is "to have a look at the situation and to
focus on certain things, to give it an extra push to move it
along."
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. announcement, Han will arrive in Cyprus
on April 12 for a week-long visit, and will then visit
Ankara and Athens for talks on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Han's visit comes amid an ongoing U.N.-sponsored proximity
talks, during which Feissel has held separate bi-weekly meetings
with President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash for
the past three weeks to set the ground for the face-to-face
negotiations between the two community leaders for a solution to
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Chief Annan has expressed his determination to bring the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on the island into a direct
negotiation to discuss the solution to the Cyprus problem before
the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two communities have not met since
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of
an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> British Motorways Reopened After Bombs Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- After clear-up of the bombs, three
motorway routes which were closed Thursday morning after bombing
threats were reopened today with a loss of millions of pounds in
the country's transport industry.
</P>
<P>
The police, after receiving telephoned bomb warnings, went to
the spots immediately Thursday and found two bombs suspected to
have been planted by the IRA (Irish Republican Army).
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were evacuated from homes and business
places alongside the M1 and M6 routes, and bomb-disposal experts
removed three controlled explosions of suspect packages.
</P>
<P>
The M1 north-south artery reopened Thursday night and the M5
and M6 reopened today, after the police cleared up the area.
</P>
<P>
However, the shutdown of the motorways has affected the
journeys of hundreds of thousands of motorists.
</P>
<P>
Security experts said the IRA had embarked on a pre-election
terror campaign designed to undermine Britain's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major has condemned the bombing threat and
blamed the IRA for the two bombs that police discovered although
no group has claimed responsibility so far.
</P>
<P>
"It was intended deliberately to cause trouble...It looks as
though it was the IRA playing silly games," Major said Thursday
after the two bombs were found.
</P>
<P>
Last week, two bombs exploded at the important rail junction in
the northwestern town of Wilmslow, and the IRA was blamed for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The recent bomb threats are likely to heighten the business
community's concern about the economic cost of the deadlock in the
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Transport industry officials said the closure of the two major
motorways between the southeast and the industrial northwest has
caused a loss of around 2.3 million pounds (3.7 million
U.S. dollars) an hour to the haulage industry and also snarled up
central England's minor roads with heavy trucks.

</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks when meeting visiting Australian Deputy
Prime Minister Tim Fischer who arrived here Wednesday for a
five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed matters pertaining to promotion and expansion
of business and trade links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also briefed Fischer about the main points of the
agricultural package and tariff reforms announced by his
government recently.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Australia wanted to increase trade with Pakistan
and was eager for a bilateral agreement with Pakistan on promotion
and protection of investment.

Australia was also willing to cooperate in agriculture, dairy
products and mining which were highly developed sectors in
Australia, he added.

<HEADLINE> Turk Arrested for Blaze That Killed His Wife, Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish man was arrested today in
the German city of Krefeld as a suspect of an arson attack that
killed his Turkish wife and two of his children on Monday,
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Menden, spokesman for the prosecutors' office in
Krefeld, said the Turkish man, 42, has not yet been charged. The
Turkish man earlier claimed that he was at a local bar when the
fire broke out in the family's third-floor flat around 2:00
a.m. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, investigators found flammable liquid on both sides of
the apartment door leading to the common hallway, suggesting the
attacker had gained access to the apartment. The spokesman could
not immediately disclose details about why the Turk is suspected.
</P>
<P>
The Turk's wife and his 19-year-old daughter died after jumping
out of a third-floor window to escape the fire. His 17-year-old
son remaining in the flat died of smoke inhalation. The
15-year-old twin daughters following her in the jump were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The incident has soured ties between Germany and Turkey for
what the Turkish government charged racist motives behind
it. Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has accused German
authorities of being too lenient with neo-Nazis after arsons in
Germany and the Netherlands that killed nine Turks over the past
seven days.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Turkish ambassador was summoned to the German
Foreign Ministry to receive a letter from the Bonn government
refuting the charges.

HONG KONG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Although the full implementation
of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) will not begin until after the establishment of the SAR on
July 1 this year, the Law has played a very important role in
ensuring the smooth transition of Hong Kong and the establishment
of the SAR, a Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
 Branch, made the comment at a gathering here today to mark the
seventh anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to support, after the handover, the SAR
government in its administration and the implementation of the
principle of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a "high degree of autonomy" to ensure
Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong SAR, said the Basic Law is the guideline for the
policies and provisions to be worked out by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law has laid down the principles of "one country, two
 systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a "high
degree of autonomy" in legal form. It also provides the political
framework concerning the relationship between the SAR and the
central government, and all other aspects of Hong Kong's social
life, he continued.
</P>
<P>
With just 88 days left before the handover, the preparatory
work for the establishment of the SAR government is in procession
on due schedule, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm fully confident of Hong Kong's future," the SAR Chief
Executive added.
</P>
<P>
Among other speakers were Wang Fengchao, deputy chief of the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, Gu
Yongjiang, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises
Association, Major General Xiong Ziren, political commissar of the
 People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in Hong Kong, and Rita
Fan, president of the Provisional legislature of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Wang gave a detailed explanation on issues of the nationality
and the right of abode of Hong Kong people, which has attracted
attention from various quarters.
</P>
<P>
Gu stated his views on the prospects of the Hong Kong economy
and the development of the Chinese-invested enterprises in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Xiong said that the PLA garrison will be mainly responsible for
the defense of the HKSAR and, when needed, will assist the SAR
government in maintaining law and order and provide disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the PLA garrison shall act as ordinary members
of the Hong Kong society and abide by the HKSAR laws as well as
military disciplines.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Rita Fan said that the election of a Hong Kong
resident as head of the HKSAR is a democratic procedure made
possible by the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Provisional Legislature is the only
way to avoid a legal vacuum after the British side implemented its
"reform package," thus derailing the through-train mechanism of
the current Legislative Council. It is also consistent with the
principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislature needs to start work before July 1,
1997 as there is a lot of preparatory work to be done. The
Provisional Legislature will be dissolved upon the formation of
the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR at a date no later than
June 30, 1998, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (U.N.) and the
European Union (EU) today called for free access for humanitarian
aid for the refugees in Zaire as Zairean parties gathered in South
Africa to begin negotiations to bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the participants in the talks to fully consider
the urgent humanitarian needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees
and displaced Zaireans stranded in the war zone," said a joint
statement by leaders of U.N. and EU aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Zairean government led by President Mobutu
Sese Seko today arrived at Pretoria, South Africa, for
U.N.-brokered peace talks on this weekend with the rebel force,
the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, vowing to bring Seko down from power, has
controlled a quarter of the country's territory after six months
of fighting with government troops.
</P>
<P>
The officials called on the parties to respect humanitarian
principles and allow relief workers and supplies free access to
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Aid agencies should be able to work without any restrictions
to save many thousands of refugees and displaced persons... whose
lives are currently hanging by a thread," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the
World Food Program (WFP) and other aid agencies have been trying
to send food and other life necessities to more than 100,000
refugees who have re-emerged from the forest.
</P>
<P>
However, many Rwandan and Burundi refugees and displaced
Zaireans were still out of reach.
</P>
<P>
The agencies also urged the international community to help
with aid delivery and the repatriation of those who wish to return
home.

Premier of the State Council Jiang Chunyun here today to discuss
how to strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Government Rejects British Bidding for Thomson CSF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The French government today rejected
a bidding by the British company GEC-Marconi for buying its
majority stake in the electronics-defense company Thomson CSF,
saying it would harm France's national security.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economy and Finance said in a communique that
two French groups, the merger of Alcatel Asthom and Dassault
Industrie, and the Lagardere Media-Defense Group, are acceptable
as the bidders for Thomson CSF.
</P>
<P>
"The transfer of more than 50 percent of the capital of Thomson
CSF (to a foreign company) is contrary to the essential interests
of the national security," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The French government, expected to announce on April 7 which
bidder for the company complies with its conditions for the sale,
said that it encourages all the candidates to tell which French or
European companies they would like to be their partners in the
take-over.
</P>
<P>
It also said Paris hopes the privatization of Thomson CSF would
bring about the restructuring of the company, which failed to make
any profits for years until 1996, when it earned a net profit of
745 million francs (135 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government refused to confirm until today the candidacy by
GEC-Marconi, as that would be a highly sensitive issue considering
the high defense technology owned by Thomson CSF.
</P>
<P>
The French government intends to build Thomson CSF into one of
the world's largest defense groups allying numerous European
companies to compete with U.S. defense companies.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project May Cause Less Damage to Ecology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Scientists can play an
indispensable role in minimizing adverse effects that might result
from the Three Gorges Project, said a senior academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Just how the gigantic project will affect the ecology and
environment in the Three Gorges areas has concerned scientists
both at home and broad, and is a major topic of discussion for
Chinese scientists and technicians in the last stage of the
project's feasibility study, said Chen Yiyu, vice-president of CAS.
</P>
<P>
The major ecological problems caused by the project can be
found in the uncontrollable amount of silt, landslides,
earthquakes, the influx of resettled residents, and the protection
of renowned natural and historical sites and aquatic animals,
especially rare species, said Chen, who has been studying the
aquatic animals in the Yangtze River for many years.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the opinions of some foreign scientists that
silt-control will be an unsolvable problem for the Three Gorges
Project, Chen said that the reservoirs in the Three Gorges areas
will be able to maintain most of their water storage capacity by
stocking clear water and draining the water with heavy silt
content.
</P>
<P>
Using statistics from the hydrometric stations along the upper
and lower reaches of the Three Gorges areas, Chinese scientists
have already worked out the average amount of silt the river
carries through the Three Gorges each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some areas in the upper reaches which have serious silt
problems have been listed as the key spots for State water and
soil conservation efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the protection efforts which started in 1995,
involving land animals and the rescuing of flooded species of both
animals and plants in the area, will be finished by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The work includes building an experimental center to introduce
the varieties of cash plants, two natural reserves and two on-site
protection centers for 200 rare ancient trees.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project May Cause Less Damage to Ecology (2) </HEADLINE>

<P>
He said that scientists from CAS's Institute of Aquatic Animals
have conducted extensive surveys on the aquatic species in the
Yangtze River and accumulated a vast amount of material. To a
large extent, they are ready to protect the aquatic resources, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Reserves for some rare species of fish are under construction
and artificial breeding of some species reportedly has been
successful, said Chen, who added that the loss of the aquatic
resources can be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
In response to some people's concern that earthquakes may
damage the dams and cause flooding, Chen explained that the
project is built as far away as possible from the epicenters of
quakes measuring above five points on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
Quakes that may be caused by flooding and the construction of
dams cannot reach six on the Richter Scale, he said, and thus will
not affect the quake-proof dam and major structures.
</P>
<P>
The project is famed for its large-scale resettlement of
residents in the area, which started in 1984. The State has taken
steps to head off potential problems that might arise, including
raising the output in low-yielding farmland, developing the
township enterprises and the tertiary industry and controlling the
industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
No outbreak of diseases has been reported among the 60,000
resettled people, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chen said some of the natural and historical sites may be
affected by the project, but many have been preserved, such as
Baidicheng, a famous historical spot and the Minor Three
Gorges.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sailor Questioned in Sex Assault in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police questioned a
U.S. Navy sailor Wednesday on suspicion of assaulting and
molesting a young Japanese woman at the Yokosuka naval base in
Kanagawa Prefecture, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese police, assuming full jurisdiction in the case,
questioned the detained 26-year-old petty officer third class with
the assistance of the U.S. Navy criminal investigators, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The sailor, who was assigned to a naval computer and
telecommunications station at the base, was taken into custody
Wednesday by the U.S. Navy authorities after the base security
forces responded to a report on a disturbance at the servicemen's
barracks, where they found a 21-year-old local woman.
</P>
<P>
The woman said that she had been sexually assaulted and taken
to a local hospital afterwards where she was treated for "a broken
clavicle, abrasions and contusions," the U.S. Navy officials was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on the eve of U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen's first official visit to Japan next week. Observers
said it could intensify the bitter dispute between the United
States and Japan over U.S. military bases in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The September 1995 rape of an Okinawa schoolgirl by three
U.S. servicemen has spurred a strong opposition in the prefecture
to the U.S. military presence in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Basic Law Warrants "One Country, Two Systems", HK Newspapers Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Basic Law provides a legal
guarantee for materializing the principles of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and for
maintaining the territory's long-term stability and prosperity,
Hong Kong newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po, Ta Kung Pao, and some other major local newspapers
today rolled out editorials, commentaries and signed articles to
mark the seventh anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "One country, Two Systems Soon to
become Reality", Wen Wei Po said that the Basic Law warrants
"one country, two systems" in a concrete and legal form, and
provides a strong guarantee for Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of the Basic Law coincided with Hong Kong's
entry into the later years of the transition period. During the
crucial years, Britain changed its Hong Kong policy, making
troubles and obstacles in the way of the smooth transition, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government and Hong Kong people have been
adhering firmly to the Basic Law, and Britain's plans to stir up
chaos were foiled, the paper said. The situation in Hong Kong is
now becoming ever encouraging.
</P>
<P>
A lot of preparations for the formation of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have been completed, and
now the Chief Executive-elect, the Provisional Legislative
Council and the Executive Council are carrying out their work in
an orderly and highly effective way, it said.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the
HKSAR will operate smoothly in accordance with the Basic Law, the
paper concluded.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao's editorial pointed out that the Basic Law, which
turns the principle of "one country, two systems" into specific
clauses, illustrates the wisdom and efforts of the
people in both Hong Kong and the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that with its implementation after Hong Kong's
return, the law will become more influential.
</P>
<P>
An editorial in the Hong Kong Commercial Daily called the Basic
Law a "magic pearl" calming down stormy waves in the sea and a
"lighthouse" guiding Hong Kong people through the transition
period.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all the trials and hardships, thanks to the Basic
Law, Hong Kong people have always been confident about the
territory's future and foreign investors also see good prospects
for Hong Kong, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, the Basic Law has been deeply rooted
in the minds and hearts of Hong Kong people, and it has been an
unswerving consensus of Hong Kong people to support, implement and
uphold the law, it said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Economic Times said in an editorial that the whole
process of working out the law -- drafting, advice-seeking,
revision and promulgation -- stretched as long as five years, and
that it has won the backing of Hong Kong people and the respect of
the international community.

TUNIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Secretary for Foreign Liaison
and International Cooperation Omar Mustafa Al Muntasser is
visiting Malta today for talks with Prime Minister Alfred Sant.
</P>
<P>
It is the first high level meeting between the two countries
since the Labor Party in Malta assumed power last October.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here say that Muntasser will also hold talks
with Maltese Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister George Vella.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are taking place one week before the convocation
of the second Euro-Mediterranean conference at foreign ministerial
level on October 15 and 16 in the Maltese capital city of
Valletta.
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled that foreign ministers of EU countries as well
as the Arab states on the southern coast of the Mediterranean will
participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese Prime Minister said last week that Malta regretted
Libya was not invited to the conference. However, he did not
clarify what to do to placate Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear if the issue would be brought up at the meetings
between the two countries' officials.

<HEADLINE> Taikang Insurance Company Bids for More Market Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Taikang Life Insurance Co., Ltd, a
newly-created Chinese insurer headquartered in Beijing, will open
four branch companies in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing and
Shenyang within the year.
</P>
<P>
The fledgling company aims to seize more shares of the booming
life insurance market of China, and to compete with other life
insurance companies, said Zhong Min, a senior official of the
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
She said that the company generated a total of 150 million yuan
in premium income after four months' operation since it was
permitted to start businesses last year. And the figure has
continued to rise, ever since the beginning of this year, she
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, newly-built nationwide insurance companies can open
a branch in other Chinese cities when their premium income has
increased by 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company's income will exceed at least 400 million yuan this
year, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
But the total income generated from China's life insurance
market has long remained about 0.3 percent of the country's gross
national product, and average per capita spending on life
insurance services by Chinese people was no more than 1.4 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the total output of China's life insurance
industry will reach 120 billion yuan by the year 2000, however,
there are still a lot of Chinese people who don't know much about
life insurance.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are five major players in China's life insurance
market, namely PICC Life, the Pacific Ocean Insurance Company,
Ping'an Insurance Company, New China Life Insurance Co., Ltd, and
Taikang.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that the number of Chinese insurance
companies will increase sharply in the coming year, and Chinese
people will benefit from fierce competition among the Chinese
insurers.

<HEADLINE> Movie About Tibetans Well Received </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese movie which depicts
Tibetans and Hans and their show of patriotism when fighting
against British invaders in the late 19th century has received
public acclaim.
</P>
<P>
Film circles consider "Red River Valley", produced by the
Shanghai Film Studio at a cost of 15 million yuan, the best of the
films that reflect the Tibetan life. And China's film critics are
saying the movie can compete with imported foreign films on the
market.
</P>
<P>
The drama takes place 100 years ago in Tibet, focusing on a
group of British explorers in the region who were treated kindly
by local people. However, both the Hans and Tibetans united to
defend their homeland against British colonists hoping to claim
the exotic area as their own.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the film, Jose, a war reporter in the British
army, kneels on a snow-covered mountain and asks, "Why do we try
to use our world to change their world? This is a nationality
which will never give in or disappear, behind which is the East, a
piece of land we can never conquer!"
</P>
<P>
Award-winning director Feng Xiaoning said: "Invasions can only
bring disasters or destroy. Equality, kindness and friendship are
bridges between different nationalities and cultures."
</P>
<P>
Feng said the movie's theme is patriotism, adding that
"patriotism is very important to a nation whenever it is in danger
or stepping toward prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Movie-goers will get a hefty dose of Tibet's blue skies, clear
rivers and snow-capped plateau, and also be exposed to the unique
customs of the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
Feng and his production company set a world record by shooting
on a mountain 6,000 meters above sea level.

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Says Labor's Manifesto "Flaky" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
today criticized the opposition Labor Party's manifesto,
describing its spending plans as "flaky."
</P>
<P>
"Tony (Blair) hasn't yet to face any of the difficult
decisions. When he is tackled on detail and policy, it seems to me
they are rather flaky," Major told local media.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Tony Blair Thursday unveiled his policy blueprint
for the May 1 general election, offering a "10-commitment covenant
with the people" in which he pledged no increase of income tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
In the manifesto, Blair also promised to give top priority to
education and provide job opportunities for about 250,000 young
unemployed people if he wins the election.
</P>
<P>
However, Major said the Labor's pledge had a gap of at least
1.5 billion pounds (2.46 billion U.S. dollars) between its tax and
spending plans.
</P>
<P>
Major's Conservative Party has been ruling the country for the
past 18 years since Margaret Thatcher took power in 1979. Despite
the fact that the Conservatives were now trailing the Labor by up
to 24 points in the latest opinion polls, Major said he was still
confident in the upcoming election, adding he would win victory as
he did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In the previous election, the opinion polls showed the
Conservatives were lagging behind the Labor, while the voting
turned out that Major's Conservative Party led the Labor by 21
seats in the parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China and Indonesia today pledged
to strengthen their bilateral relations which have developed
satisfactorily since the restoration of diplomatic ties between
the two countries six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by Indonesian President Soeharto and
visiting Chinese State Councilor and Secretary-General of the
State Council Luo Gan during their meeting at the Merdeka Place
here.
</P>
<P>
Both sides held that the consolidation and development of the
relations is not only beneficial to the peoples of the two
countries, but is also helpful to peace, stability and prosperity
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said Indonesia and China should expand their economic
and trade relations, especially the exchange of technology and
culture.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan spoke highly of Indonesia's policy on developing
Indonesian-China relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is satisfied with the
good-neighborly relations based on the five principles of peaceful
coexistence and the principles of the Bandung (Asia-Africa)
Conference.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to make common efforts with Indonesia to push
their 21st century-oriented relations towards a new stage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Luo arrived in Indonesia's tourist island of Bali on Tuesday
and in the capital of Jakarta on Thursday for a six-day visit at
the invitation of Sinister/State Secretary Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Vice President Try Sutrisno, acting foreign
minister Edi Sudrajat and Moerdiono this morning.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono told Luo that Indonesia will always stick to its "one
China" policy and will continue to support China on the human
rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Luo and his party will leave here on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bank on Ties between Shanghai, Hong Kong as Financial Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior bank official said that
Shanghai's bid to become a regional financial center will not
undermine Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub
after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yingliang, director of the Shanghai branch of the People's
Bank of China, said Hong Kong will be able to develop itself into
a leading international financial center like New York and London,
backed by China's booming economy and vast market in general.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the country's sizable economy can
support two financial centers at the same time, and Shanghai's
drive, instead of challenging Hong Kong's status quo, will only
help propel the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region forward.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will benefit a lot from such a partnership with
Shanghai, particularly in furthering involvement in mainland
projects," Mao said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Shanghai, being the country's largest trade and
financial city, will become a stepping-stone for Hong Kong to
further increase its investment in the inland parts of China after
its return on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Mao said that Shanghai is qualified to help Hong Kong investors
deal with businesses in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its strong demand for more overseas
investment for a long time to come, and this will generate more
business opportunities for Hong Kong investors, who have always
been one of the most important sources of overseas investment over
the past years.
</P>
<P>
There is also a great potential to be tapped between Hong Kong
and Shanghai, which can function as an outlet of cash outflows
from Hong Kong, and help Hong Kong investors to understand the
fiscal laws and administration on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"The wholesale capital from Hong Kong can flow into the inland
market via Shanghai, since the city has become a nationwide market
of many investment instruments, such as foreign exchange,
inter-bank loans, and securities," Mao noted.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Unified Treasury Bond System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Besides developing the over-the-counter government bond market,
China this year will gradually establish a united national bond
registration, custody, settlement, and clearance system, Gao Jian,
director of the ministry's State Debt Mangement Department, said
at an international seminar on social guarantee funds management,
which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
"At present, treasury bond clearance, settlement, and custody
are carried out in the respective exchanges while the transfer of
custody of government bonds is simply impossible, which is
detrimental to the development of the bond market," Gao said,
</P>
<P>
The director said that also this year the process of making
government bonds paperless will be accelerated and the
non-mobility of paper bonds will be realized.
</P>
<P>
To help further improve the central bank's ability to regulate
the money supply and implement its monetary policy more
effectively, the MOF will continue to issue short-term treasury
bonds, maintaining a relatively fixed timetable, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Medium-term bonds should be floated when old bonds are
redeemed, in order to stabilize the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the practice of issuing treasury bonds in 1981
and its annual issue expanded rapidly in recent years, hitting a
record 196 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had issued over 660 billion
yuan-worth of government bonds, with the outstanding volume
standing at 440 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's treasury bond issue this year is budgeted at 248.596
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar was co-sponsored by the Ministry of
Finance and Lincoln National Corporation of the United States and
attended by officials and experts from China, the United States,
the World Bank, Chile, Singapore, Canada and some countries in
East Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is stepping up its
efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the country, and it
launched a comprehensive program today with an aim to rid the
republic of the disease in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The program, called the Singapore Tuberculosis Elimination
Program, or STEP, is said to be the only such national program in
the world currently.
</P>
<P>
Launching the program, Health Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said that
such a program was necessary because there are some 1,500 new
cases of TB every year in the country, although prevention methods
are available.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the incidence of TB has not declined since
1987, the minister said, noting that in Singapore, the rate of TB
in the population stood at 55 per 100,000, comparing poorly with
the rates in the developed countries which range between five and
10 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said the program's priority is to detect all infectious TB
cases through systematic screening of high risk persons.

<HEADLINE> UK Bank Chief Calls for Higher Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank of England Governor Eddie
George said Thursday that he would press any new government after
the general election for higher interest rates to slow the upswing
and guard against inflation, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual meeting of the Foreign Bankers'
Association in Amsterdam, the British central bank head admitted
that a rise in interest rates would hurt British exporters with
the pound so strong, but argued that the decision had to be made
in the light of economic conditions generally, not just the
situation faced by exporters.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot reasonably expose the economy as a whole to
inflationary risks in order to protect the tradeable sectors," he
added.
</P>
<P>
His view was hardened by the results of two separate surveys.
</P>
<P>
The latest distributive trades survey of the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) confirmed Thursday that a positive balance
of 33 percent of retailers enjoyed sales growth in March, compared
with 24 percent in February and 27 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of retailers expecting sales to improve
in April also rose to 40 percent from 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another survey, The Report on Service, the first of its kind
relies on evidence from 500 companies involved in a wide range of
service sector activities, also revealed buoyant conditions across
the sector and suggested that the pace of activity was
accelerating.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published Thursday by the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply, provided a warning about inflationary
pressures building up in the economy.
</P>
<P>
It said prices charged by purchasing managers had risen for the
fifth consecutive month and further pressure on prices was
expected because of a significant increase in service sector
wages, particularly among the highly skilled.
</P>
<P>
However, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has stood
firm for several months against pressures for higher interest
rates, arguing that the strength of the pound is hurting
manufacturing industry and has proved a powerful deflationary
force.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Washing Machine Meets Quality Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that 92 percent of
domestically-made washing machines met state quality standards.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey of washing machines from 25 firms showed that
23 varieties are qualified, said today's "Market News."
</P>
<P>
Of the total surveyed, 100 percent of turbined, 66 percent of
cylinder, and 91 percent of double-tube models are up to standard.
</P>
<P>
Name-brand products are of higher quality, the survey said,
adding that some firms still need to raise their awareness of
quality.
</P>
<P>
China produced 11 million washing machines in a year. With the
improvement of living standards, 50 percent of rural families will
purchase washing machines in the coming few years, according to
the "Market News."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large majority of the current 85 percent of urban
residents who own the machine need to "upgrade," since most of the
machines were purchased about ten years ago, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Employment Pattern Changes in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The pattern in east China's
Jiangsu province has changed from state units to several sectors
now predominantly employing labor.
</P>
<P>
The non-state sectors employ more labor force in the province,
said the local government.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province reported a 2.2 percent of unemployment
rate, lower than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
The employment structure has witnessed changes. Some 90 percent
of newly employed population are in the industrial and service
sectors.
</P>
<P>
People are now competing for their posts rather than relying on
distribution by the government as in previous years.
</P>
<P>
The local government has paid close attention to employment,
noting that low unemployment rate is of great importance to social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, with its large population, is faced with heavy
employment pressure. To provide lay-offs with basic living
conditions, the local government last year granted relief funds of
154 million yuan, and provided new jobs for 243,000 or 50 percent
of the unemployed.

<HEADLINE> New Energy Source for Rural Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Rural northern China has been
successful in developing clean energy by constructing
methane-generating pits in courtyards of farmers' homes.
</P>
<P>
This not only has helped boost rural economy but also has
effectively protected the environment, according to
a two-day meeting on experiments with energy development in
rural northern China, which ended today here in Dalian, an
open port city of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
With the colder climate in northern China, many rural areas
have started a comprehensive project that cover a vegetable
greenhouse, a methane-generating pit, a pig pen, and a toilet in
the courtyard of a rural home.
</P>
<P>
The model has been introduced in provinces of Liaoning, Jilin,
Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Hebei, Henan and Inner
Mongolia and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions, and good economic,
social, and ecological benefits have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Hong Fuzeng, Chinese vice-minister of agriculture, said the
model has closely connected breeding and plantation and formed a
complete production cycling system.
</P>
<P>
Hong praised the model as an effective way to boost farm
production in poor areas to help get rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister disclosed that his ministry would encourage
to spread this important model in 1997, the year for popularizing
of agro-techniques in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, this rural energy development model
will have been spread among 30 to 40 percent of rural households
of 18 provinces and autonomous regions in northern China, the
vice-ministry said, adding that it would be a great but arduous
task.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province of northeast China had over 110,000 rural
households that had tried the method of developing courtyard
economy by building small methane-generating pits by 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sample surveys show that average rural household income of the
province can reach 5,000 yuan a year, accounting for 50 percent of
a household's entire income.
</P>
<P>
Through energy construction in rural areas, Liaoning has formed
a capacity of developing and saving energy equivalent to 3.19
million tons of standard coal, and is able to supply the market
with 100 million kg of pollution-free vegetables and provide 1.12
million live hogs a year.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shiji, a research worker with the Rural Economic Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, hailed the
comprehensive energy development method as a "breakthrough," as
the method can help save crop stalks from burning and can help
increase the fertility of the soil by returning the stalks back to
the fields and eventually improve the reserve strength of
agricultural production.

</P>
<P>
The business traveler will also stand to benefit. Hong
Kong-based Cathay Pacific, for instance, currently operates only
five non-stop services per week between Hong Kong and Auckland.
Under the new arrangements, however, the company could plan to
gradually increase this to a daily flight by early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific, together with Air New Zealand, carried a total
of 200,000 passengers in 1996, an increase of 23 percent over
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Tourist Association, 32,900 Hong
Kong residents visited New Zealand in 1996, up 12 percent over
1995, while 58,000 New Zealand residents visited the territory in
1996, up 16 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The new arrangements were negotiated under the umbrella of the
Hong Kong/New Zealand Air Services Agreement signed in February
1991, with the talks stretching over four years.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Economy Expected to Get Extra Impulse from EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch economy will get an
extra impulse for growth in 1998 if the European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) proceeds without significant problems, a
senior Dutch official said today.
</P>
<P>
However, if the EMU is in danger, economic growth in the
Netherlands will fall below the estimate by the Central Planning
Bureau (CPB) in its Central Economic Plan (CEP) published on
Thursday, said Henk Don, CPB director of the Netherlands, to the
newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of EMU is a major uncertainty in our economy, in
both the positive and negative sense," he added.
</P>
<P>
Don added that a smooth transition to EMU on January 1, 1999,
is a guarantee for further strengthening of both consumer and
producer confidence in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"But if EMU fails to take place then, the economy will lose its
force," he warned.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEP, the Dutch gross domestic product for this
year and 1988 is projected to grow at 3 percent and 3.25 percent
respectively, higher than in any other countries in the European
Union whose average growth is between 2.3-2.5 percent.

TIRANA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Albania is going to form a special
force to escort, together with the multinational troops, emergency
aid materials coming into the country, Albanian Vice Defense
Minister Algred Moisiu said today.
</P>
<P>
Moisiu told reporters that the special troop would be made up
of 3,000 well-equipped soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The troop's function would be different from that of the
special force under the Interior Ministry, said the vice
minister. With its main task being the protection of vital
highways, crossroads and warehouses, it will also escort
transportation and distribution of aid materials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the multinational troops headed by the Italians may
enter Albania on April 12, according to Italian Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. African Transport Services to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African Transport
Department has started a program to commercialize and privatize
all its services around the country, local daily "The Star"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The program will include all modes of transport and will be
completed over a period of four to seven years, Director-General
Ketso Gordhan of the Transport Department was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the long-term plan, airlines, ports and railways around
the country will be operated independently. This will include the
possibility that South African Airways will be privatized, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's decision to loosen its grip on
transportation, Gordhan said this has become necessary because of
the changing role of the government.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is reportedly the biggest
transport operator in the country, responsible for between 70 and
80 percent of all transport.
</P>
<P>
Local informed sources said the transport reform will possibly
bring about a reduction in the Transport Department's staff from
1,053 to 270.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a series of agencies will be set up and run by the
private sector. Each will employ its own staff, who will not be
public servants and have chief executive officers to run them,
the sources said.

<HEADLINE> China's National Economy on Steady, Healthy Growth in 1996 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's national economy
registered a moderately fast growth in 1996, with inflation under
control, and the overheated economy slowed to a normal growth
rate, said the Statistical Communique on the 1996 National
Economics and Social Development released by State Statistical
Bureau (SSB) today.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics indicated that the gross domestic
product of China in 1996 was 6,779.5 billion yuan, a real growth
of 9.7 percent over the previous year. Though somewhat slower as
compared with the growth rate during earlier years, the current
economic growth still fell into the range of high growth, and was
in conformity with the availability of resources and demands of
the market.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same months in 1995, the momentum of increase
of market retail prices slowed down month by month in 1996. The
annual increase in the price index was 6.1 percent, well below the
control target of the central government.
</P>
<P>
It is preliminarily estimated that the aggregate supply of the
society in 1996 was 8,021.2 billion yuan while the aggregate
demand was 8,350.1 billion yuan, with a gap of 328.9 billion, or a
balance rate of -4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's agriculture sector generated a sharp increase of
1,355 billion yuan in its added value, up by 5.1 percent over
1995, while the grain output hit a historical high, reaching 490
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production kept steady growth in a country-wide
enterprise adjustment. In 1996, the total value-added of the
industrial sector was 2,858 billion yuan, up by 12.7 percent over
the previous year. Meanwhile, the service industry created an
added value of 2,109.7 billion yuan, a rise of eight percent.

<HEADLINE> China's National Economy on Steady, Healthy Growth in 1996 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the communique, the completed investment in fixed
assets of the country stood at 2,366 billion yuan last year,
representing a real increase margin of 12.7 percent over that of
1995, if price increase is excluded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, steady growth was found in foreign investment, 55.27
billion US dollars in 1996, up 14.2 percent over the previous
year. Of this total, 42.35 billion dollars was in the form of
foreign direct investment, a yearly increase of 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the country further expand its foreign trade
scale, with the total volume of export and import reached 289.9
billion US dollars, up 3.2 percent over the 1995 figure. The trade
surplus continued in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Further improvement was also made in the livelihood of the
Chinese people. The annual per-capita income of urban households
was 4,377 yuan last year, up 12.4 percent over 1995, or a real
growth of 3.3 percent if price hikes was excluded. The per capita
net income of rural households was 1,926 yuan, up 22 percent, and
the real growth stood at nine percent at the 1995 prices.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today, Zhang Sai, director
of SSB, said that such a "healthy development" of the economy in
1996 signals a good start for the country's ambitious Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Thus, the national economy will continue to grow in a stable
and harmonious manner throughout the year 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the statistical methods for the communique, the
director said that the SSB has established statistical indicator
systems which are based on the strict data processing technologies
and the well-organized sampling mechanism. In case there is any
figure exaggerated or deliberately reduced by local governments,
the state-level statistical body is able to make corrections in
time, so as to safeguard the bureau's correctness and authority.

The United States has expressed concern that Japan's trade
surplus may show an uptrend again due to rising exports as the yen

<P>
WELLINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Highly lucrative international
smuggling rings dealing in endangered birds and native animals
species are using New Zealand in bird smuggling, the World Wide
Fund for Nature said today.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association quoted Chris Laidlaw,
executive director of WWF in New Zealand, as saying that the trade
in endangered species was huge.
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw said New Zealand was being used as an international
staging post where eggs were illegally smuggled in, and hatched
into birds which were then used to produce legal offspring for the
international export market.
</P>
<P>
It was the bird equivalent of international money laundering,
he charged.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very, very lively trade at work. There are birds
coming in and out of Australia and New Zealand."
</P>
<P>
"The trade involves mainly Australian birds, mainly parrots but
it also involves a variety of New Zealand species as well,"
Laidlaw said.

PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The bank employees of France were called to stop working
Friday to protest the government's plan of adopting a flexibility
system for working weeks. They are the last group to join the
social discontent movement of the spring which was joined earlier
by workers of the Renault automaker, staff of the Air France
Europe, medical interns, postmen and teachers.
</P>
<P>
-- British Labor leader Tony Blair Thursday presented his
manifesto for the legislative elections on May 1, which "does not
promise a moon" but advocates modest and realistic politics of
strict centralism. The Labor Party is 27 points ahead of the
Conservative Party, according to the latest poll.
</P>
<P>
-- Declaring himself as "super-well," German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl chose his 67th birthday Thursday to announce his decision to
run again for the chancellor's seat in the legislative elections
scheduled for October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Christian Prouteau, former chief of the anti-terrorist
cellular of the French Presidential Palace, was summoned
Thursday by a court over the "tapping" case by the presidential
office between 1982-1988, in which the role of former President
Francois Mitterrand has become more and more controversial.
</P>
<P>
Several documents obtained from a garage rented by Prouteau
showed that Mitterrand was behind the tapping operation aimed at
collecting information on the country's top judges, intellectuals,
politicians and journalists.
</P>
<P>
-- British Labor Party leader Tony Blair fixed the focus of his
May 1 legislative election program on education and a rigid
economic management, while minimizing his promises for labor
rights. He said that he does not plan to undermine the reforms by
the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher since the late
1970s, which had considerably limited the power of Britain's trade
unions.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Civil Servants to Get Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands' 106,000 civil
servants are to receive a 2.8 percent structural pay rise from
May 1 this year, followed by a 2.4 percent hike on July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the local reports today, the pay-and-condition
(CAO) pact was agreed Wednesday by Vice Prime Minister and
Interior Minister Hans Dijkstal and the trade unions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, government employees' year-end bonus will be
topped up by 0.5 percent of their gross annual salaries. State
employees will also be able to cash in three to four holiday days
each year under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The CAO is more expensive than Dijkstal had expected. "I have
mixed feelings about the financial consequences of the deal. It's
higher than I had wanted and it goes a bit further than we
possibly should have done."
</P>
<P>
Dijkstal now has to negotiate new CAOs for the country's
190,000 municipal employees, 8,000 water board workers and 40,000
police officers.

<P>
--Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources in Jerusalem said that the formation of a
national unity government would be announced soon in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The announcement may come within a week before or after Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu meet US president Clinton at the White
House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would ask Netanyahu to halt settlement construction in
Abu Ghneim for six months, while Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said he was ready to meet Netanyahu if the settlement drive is
stopped.
</P>
<P>
--Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Chief Esmat Abdul Maguid said Thursday that he
expected more Arab countries to shut offices in Israel in response
to a call to freeze normalization with the Jewish states.
</P>
<P>
The call, made by Arab foreign ministers last week, affects
Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia which have swapped low-level
offices with Israel since 1994. Qatar and Oman have also hosted
Israeli trade missions.
</P>
<P>
--Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
The European Union was seeking a greater role in the Middle
East, but a lasting settlement to the regional problem was a
matter for Israelis and Palestinians, a EU official said.
</P>
<P>
Jose Coll Carbo, aide to Manuel Marin, the European
Commissioner for Middle East affairs, said:"It would be useful and
acceptable for our role to be enhanced, but so far only one side
has asked for it."
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility for peace lies with the partners and the
sponsors (the United States and Russia)," he said, adding "We
can't take the place of either of them."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel will visit Cairo later this
month to sign a cooperation and friendship accord between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Opposes Internationalization of Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia (SPS) today denounced a U.S. political organ for its
intention to internationalize the Kosovo issue of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivica Dacic, spokesman for the SPS, said that his party will
not send representatives to the New York roundtable talks --
"Kosovo Serbian-Albanian Ethnics Dialogue" -- sponsored by the
U.S. organization known as "Project on National Relations."
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo is an inalienable part of Serbia, and the ethnic
problem there is Serbia's internal affair," Dacic said.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to internationalize the Kosovo issue is
unnecessary and harmful, and the issue could only be settled on
the basis of respects of Serbia's independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SPS executive committee in Kosovo Province also
declared on Thursday that "no one can take advantage of the Kosovo
issue" and its internationalization could only "lead to civil war
in Serbia."
</P>
<P>
Serbia has been troubled by the demand of the ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo for independence since the beginning of 1980s.

<P>
TAIYUAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- With the aid of foreign funds the
forestry sector in north China's Shanxi province has reaped
significant economic and ecological gains.
</P>
<P>
To date, 23.76 million US dollars of foreign donations and
loans from Germany, Italy and other countries have been used in
the province's afforestation efforts and forest products
production.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-German forestry technological cooperation project,
which was started 12 years ago, has contributed greatly to the
establishment of China's biggest gene base for poplar, which
collects approximately 1,000 poplar strains from both China and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the forestry technological cooperation between
China and Germany, 35 selected poplar strains have been spread to
12 provinces or autonomous regions in China, and their techniques
also increased the survival rate of poplars by 10 to 20 percent
and cut the planting cost by some 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wang Fengchao on Nationality, Right of Abode of HK People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official talked
about some principles concerning the nationality and the right of
abode of Hong Kong residents in connection with the provisions of
the Basic Law here today at a seminar marking the 7th anniversary
of the promulgation of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fengchao, Deputy Chief of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office under the Chinese State Council, said that the Chinese
Nationality Law will go into effect in Hong Kong beginning from
July 1, 1997. The Law shall determine who among Hong Kong
residents will be Chinese citizens and who will not be.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a major manifestation of the resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the Chinese Government
and will also be the power due to a sovereign country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the requirements for acquiring the
identity of permanent residents in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) will be based on the Chinese
Nationality Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained to participants of the seminar the efforts the
Chinese Government has made in this respect and some specific
solutions to issues that might crop up in the implementation of
the relevant provisions of the Basic Law concerning the Right of
Abode.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to both legal and historical reasons, the
question of nationality and the right of abode of Hong Kong people
is a fairly complicated one.
</P>
<P>
"In the past seven years since the Basic Law was adopted, the
Chinese Government has consistently attached great importance to
this question and stressed time and again that in handling
relevant questions in this connection, it is necessary to respect
history and respect the reality, and settle them in a liberal,
flexible and practical way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now there are only 88 days left before the Basic Law goes into
effect. I believe, when that day comes, the HKSAR will provide
perfect legal guarantee on the question of the nationality and the
right of abode of the Hong Kong people," he stated.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Increase Steel Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to bring its total
steel production up to 2-2.2 million tons by the year 2000 and
7-7.5 million tons by 2010 to meet the increasing domestic demand,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The demand for steel in Vietnam is estimated to rise 20 percent
annually to the year 2000 and 14-15 percent in the following ten
years.
</P>
<P>
All the existing steel factories, even at full capacity, can
only meet 60 percent of the requirements, the VNA said.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Ministry planned to concentrate on intensive
investment to raise production and reduce costs and give priority
to foreign investment in producing billets, sheet steel and other
steel products to substitute imports.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for production of one million tons of steel
billets a year up to 2000 and import of about 2.1 million tons of
other kinds of steel.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Today is the seventh anniversary
of the promulgation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
It is an accurate and complete embodiment of the great concept
of "one country, two systems" in the form of a national law. As a
legal code, it is of fundamental importance in maintaining the
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after it returns to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
In order to help readers become better acquainted with the
Basic Law, the Xinhua News Agency will publish the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region both in
Chinese and English in a question-and-answer format beginning
today.
</P>
<P>
The following are the ABCs of the Basic Law (1-2):
</P>
<P>
Question: Why was a Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR enacted?
When does its implementation begin?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Sino-British Joint Declaration, apart from
specifying the Chinese government's basic policies regarding Hong
Kong, contains this provision: "The above-stated basic policies of
the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong and the
elaboration of them in Annex 1 to this Joint Declaration will be
stipulated, in a Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China, by the National People's
Congress of the People's Republic of China, and they will remain
unchanged for 50 years." Annex 1 to the Joint Declaration has a
similar provision.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government systematically states its basic policies
regarding Hong Kong in the Joint Declaration. It is far from
sufficient, however, to have these policies represented in
diplomatic documents only. They must be enshrined in a state law
so as to be legally binding over a long period of time. In
addition, enactment of a Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR is a
commitment made by the Chinese government in the Joint
Declaration. On the day when the Sino-British Joint Declaration
took effect, Hong Kong entered its transitional period. The
drafting and enactment of a Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR became
a work of the greatest importance within this transitional period.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, 1990, the Third Session of the Seventh National
People's Congress adopted the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, and
decided that the Basic Law shall take effect as of July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Question: How did the Basic Law come into being?
</P>
<P>
Answer: On April 10, 1985, the Sixth National People's Congress
decided to establish a Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong SAR. On June 18 of the same year, the NPC Standing
Committee adopted a list of members for the committee. The
committee was composed of 59 personages from various social
circles and specialists, including 23 Hong Kongers. (By the ninth
meeting of the committee, membership had decreased to 51,
including 18 from Hong Kong, as four had died, two resigned, and
two been removed for conduct that was incompatible with their
capacity).
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1985, the Drafting Committee was officially
established and began its work. During the four years and eight
months after its formation, the committee held nine plenary
sessions and 73 group meetings dealing with special issues. In the
meantime, a Basic Law Consultation Committee, composed of 180
representatives from social circles in Hong Kong, was established
to act as a bridge of communication between Hong Kong residents
and the Drafting Committee and a channel for Hong Kong people to
express their opinions and suggestions.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a draft of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR was
completed and circulated to solicit views extensively in Hong Kong
and the inland areas for revision. At the end of 1988 and in early
1989, after examination by the NPC Standing Committee, the Hong
Kong Basic Law (Draft) was made public in an effort to solicit
more opinions and make further revisions. The final draft of the
law was submitted to the NPC in April 1990 and was adopted and
officially promulgated.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law is an embodiment of the collective wisdom,
creativity and hard work of many people in Hong Kong and the
inland areas. Its drafting process is one of full and extensive
democratic consultations.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said today that the monetary and price situation
in the Philippines continues to be generally stable.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to President Fidel Ramos, Singson said
that based on the auction conducted on March 24, the interest
rates of treasury bills for all tenors dropped for the fifth
consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
The auction, he said, was marked by over-subscription in all
tenors as average yields for all maturities dropped by 12.7 basis
points to settle at 10.158 percent from the previous week's 10.285
percent.
</P>
<P>
The bellwether 91-day T-bill rate remained at a single digit
level settling at 9.724 percent, lower by 8 basis points than the
previous week's, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the 90-day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) of
5.62 percent for March 17-21, the gap between the 91-day T-bill
rate and LIBOR narrowed further to 4.104 percentage points from
the previous week's 4.244 percentage points, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 182-day and 364-day T-bill yields, meanwhile,
contracted further by 16.5 basis points and 12.1 basis points,
respectively, to reach 9.969 percent and 10.517 percent from the
previous week's 10.134 percent and 10.638 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the peso weakened slightly against the dollar during
the week of March 17-21, with average exchange rate recorded at
26.335 pesos against the dollar from the previous week's 26.3222
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the average exchange rate from January 2
to the current week stood at 26.3282 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Singson told President Ramos that the central
bank will remain vigilant in monitoring domestic and international
economic developments to ensure the implementation of timely and
appropriate policy responses.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that by publishing Singson's report, the
government intends to dismiss rumours that a monetary crisis could
possibly hit the Philippines.

LUSAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 Zairean refugees
have arrived in Zambia's Luapula Province, according to a report
received here today.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are fleeing the continued armed conflicts in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, the report quoted Luapula Province Minister Norman
Chibamba as saying yesterday in the provincial capital Mansa that
out of the 200 refugees who had been kept in a refugee camp in
the province earlier, 100 had returned to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba said that although refugees kept criss-crossing the
border, the situation was under control.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that there was need for more logistics to
help officers monitoring the situation. "We need more vehicles
and boats for those patrolling the Luapula River but we are doing
our best with the limited resources," the province minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Luapula River is a border river between Zambia and Zaire.

<HEADLINE> China-Invested Enterprises Optimistic About HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China-invested enterprises in
Hong Kong are quite optimistic about the future of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said Gu Yongjiang, chairman
 of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association, at a seminar
held here today to mark the 7th anniversary of the promulgation of
 the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that the promotion of the prosperity of Hong Kong and
service to its community are the fundamental principles of the
China-invested enterprises in Hong Kong, who are active in
integrating into the Hong Kong society and contributing to the
economic prosperity and development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the development of China-invested
enterprises in Hong Kong, the economic linkage between Hong Kong
and the inland areas has been strengthened, and the "China factor"
in Hong Kong's economic activities has become more important than
ever.
</P>
<P>
He said reasons behind their optimism about the future of the
HKSAR are that the Basic Law provides a fundamental safeguard to
the social stability and economic prosperity of the HKSAR; the
economic development of the inland areas will inject a major
impetus to Hong Kong's continued economic development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong has well developed infrastructure, with
the gradual opening up of the financial and service markets of the
 inland areas, Hong Kong will enjoy tremendous economic
opportunities; as a major trade, aviation and financial service
center in the Asia-Pacific Region, Hong Kong will continue to
attract more foreign capitals and further develop foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, after Hong Kong returns to the motherland,
China-invested enterprises in Hong Kong will enter into a new
phase of development.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, these enterprises will not enjoy any privileges,
 nor will they seek to dominate the economic activities of Hong
Kong," he said. "Rather, they will continue to observe the laws
and market regulations of Hong Kong, and positively participate in
 the competitions on an equal basis in the Hong Kong market."
</P>
<P>
He said China-invested enterprises will continue to explore
development opportunities through fair and healthy competition,
and will join efforts with foreign enterprises to further develop
Hong Kong and to build a better future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's financial situation was
stable during the first two months this year, according to an
analytical report by the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remained at bay, with the retail price index edging
up 3.3 percent in January, and 2.9 percent in February. The
consumer price index went up 5.9 and 5.6 percent, respectively,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The money supply was on the downward trend during the two-month
period, due to a small increase in central bank investment, slower
growth in foreign exchange reserves, and redoubled efforts to
recover the central bank loans from the commercial banks. The
growth in money supply in February dropped to its lowest level
since 1994, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The growth in fixed-term deposits of enterprises has
slowed down this year, with the current deposits for the two-month
period dropping by more than 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the recent issue of government voucher
bonds impacted individual savings deposits, the growth of which
also slowed down compared with the 1996 period.
</P>

All financial markets had smooth operation and active trading
in the first two months this year, with the supply and demand of
short-term funds in near balance and a stable yuan, said the

<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting with Ernesto Maceda, president of the Senate of the
Philippines, in Beijing today, said that China is willing to make
a concerted effort along with the Philippines for closer relations
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China treasures its friendship with the Philippines, he said,
and establishing long-term and stable bilateral ties is in accord
with the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled his talks with Maceda during his visit last year
to the Philippines, and the exchange of opinions with President
Fidel Ramos on good neighbourliness and co-operation and other
issues of common concern. He said that at that time they reached
"consensus" on an extensive range of issues.
</P>
<P>
China and the Philippines, both developing countries, are faced
with the same task of developing the economy and improving the
standard of living, Jiang said, and that both need a stable
neighborly relationship and sound international environment.
</P>
<P>
The President expressed his appreciation and thanks for the
Philippines' support of China in human rights and its adherence to
the "One China" policy as concerns Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Friendship between the two countries can be traced back to
ancient times, Jiang noted, and since the establishment of
diplomatic ties, bilateral relations have seen smooth progress,
and exchanges of high-level visits have been frequent.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in recent years, bilateral economic and
trade co-operation have grown rapidly, and communication in other
sectors has been quite active.
</P>
<P>
The President also briefed the Filipino guests on the two major
issues facing China this year, the 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party, and Hong Kong returning to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked Maceda to convey his best regards to President
Ramos, and Maceda conveyed President Ramos' greetings to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Maceda said Jiang's visit to the Philippines last year
contributed much to the safeguarding of peace and stability of the
region and to promoting good-neighborliness and co-operation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino Senate plays an important role in the country's
foreign policy, and the Philippines will stick to the "One China"
policy and agrees with China in its stand on the human rights
issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and the Philippines have a long-standing traditional
friendship, Maceda said, and that he is happy to see that
bilateral ties have seen new progress in many important fields.

<HEADLINE> India's Trade Deficit Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit during the
April-February period of the fiscal year of 1996-97 reached 5.256
billion U.S. dollars, representing an increase of 2.2 billion
dollars over the corresponding period of the previous year, The
Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
According to latest trade data released by the Indian Commerce
Ministry, the widening of the trade gap was a result of the sharp
slowdown in export growth to 5.61 percent during the period under
review.
</P>
<P>
During April-February, 1995-96, India's exports had notched up
a growth of 21.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import growth, which too had decelerated during the earlier
months of 1996-97, bounced back to record a 26.87 percent increase
in February over the same month of the previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
The pick up in import growth also aided the widening of trade
gap.

<HEADLINE> China Moves to Protect Rubber Seedlings Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Measures are expected to be taken
to ensure the survival of a rubber seedling bank in suburban
Jinghong of Yunnan Province, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The rubber seedling plantation, in the Yunnan Tropical Plants
Scientific Research Institute, is one of the country's largest
rubber seedling resource bases.
</P>
<P>
Set up in the 1960s, the bank had a collection of more than
4,000 new species from South American countries. Scientific
personnel have developed a series of them suitable for growth in
China.
</P>
<P>
But large areas of the seedlings are beginning to die due to
the foul smoke and fumes from surrounding brickyards. By last
year, more than 267 hectares and been infected, nearly half of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government, and scientific and environmental
protection departments have paid immense attention to the
deteriorating situation and are determined to effectively protect
the rubber seedlings.
</P>
<P>
They called for taking effective measures to protect the rubber
seedlings.
</P>
<P>
The Land Reclamation Bureau, under the Ministry of Agriculture,
has urged its local bureaux to cooperate with local authorities
and solve the problem as quick as possible.
</P>
<P>
Local environment protection authorities in January ordered the
brickyards to pay 500,000 yuan (60,000 US dollars) and put their
fluoride discharge under control.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has more than 147,000 hectares of rubber tree
plantations, and rubber has become the province's fourth largest
economic pillar after cigarettes, sugar and tea.

<HEADLINE> More Ports of Entry Facilitate Trade and Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China has opened a total of 235
land, railway and air ports of entry to foreign passengers and
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Among these outlets, classified as Category One, six were newly
opened in 1996, including an airport in Mudianjiang City of
Heilongjiang Province, a railway outlet for cargo in Harbin,
capital of Heilongjiang, a sea port in Zhejiang Province, two sea
ports in Shandong Province, and a river port in Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
There are also 350 Category Two ports of entry catering to
Chinese foreign trade vehicles and border trade.
</P>
<P>
"These ports of entry are contributing increasingly to the
growing foreign trade, tourism, and international exchanges", an
official of the State Port of Entry Office reported at a meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the ports of entry in China handled a total of 369
million tons of foreign trade goods, about the same as the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sea and river ports played a main role, accounting for 314
million tons of the goods handled; highway cargo totalled 43.95
million tons; railway cargo reached 9.55 million tons; and 515,000
tons were handled by airports.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ports of entry dealt with a total of 118.59
million passengers coming in or going out of the country, a rise
of 8.98 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 92.54 million people passed through land outlets,
13.72 million through airports, and 12.33 million through sea and
river ports.
</P>
<P>
As China has shifted its efforts from increasing the number of
ports of entry to improving the service of the existing ones, the
customs, frontier inspection, commodity inspection, and
quarantine--the sectors involved in a port of entry--have all
improved their work by simplifying procedures and standardizing
management, according to a work report distributed at the
meeting.

for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries.
</P>
<P>
The declaration will be presented on behalf of the seven
countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan
and Maldives) at the June meeting in New York of the United
Nations' general assembly to review progress on the decisions
taken at the U.N. meeting on the environment at Rio, Brazil, in
1991.
</P>
<P>
In the "New Delhi Declaration," the SAARC ministers reiterated
that actions should be taken to check toxic waste imports, protect
biodiversity, manage marine pollution and resource-sustainability.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that developed nations transfer regularly far
more funds for the protection of environment than they have ever
been wont to.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to a proposal from the Economic
Development Institution of the World Bank to organize a
"high-level" policy training program among SAARC countries on
mainstream environmentally sustainable programs.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: No Compromise on Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- With three days ahead of his
visit to the United States, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu vowed not to bow to any pressure on the issue of
settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Thursday night to a meeting of the ruling Likud
Party's chiefs, Netanyahu said the construction of the
controversial Har Homa housing project in East Jerusalem would
proceed as planned, and so would work in other settlements in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He also gave a tough message to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) that he would take "non-diplomatic alternatives"
if the PNA failed to halt the terrorist attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate, but adding that he "will not act rashly."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said Netanyahu would give the
messages to U.S. President Bill Clinton when they meet
Monday. Netanyahu would stress that there would be no peace
process unless the PNA cracked down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians have also made it clear that the
Israelis must stop settlement construction before peace talks
could be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is reportedly considering requesting Netanyahu to halt
the Har Homa construction for six months as a good-will gesture
to rescue the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu continued accusing PNA President Yasser Arafat of
giving a green light to terrorism. He said Arafat not only gave
the green light, but also "is issuing demands for switching it
off." The Palestinian leader has rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of pressure will make Israel veer from its policy
that terror cannot be considered a legitimate tool of
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will absolutely not capitulate to terror or to threats of
terror and will continue construction in Jerusalem and Judea and
Samaria (West Bank)," he added.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, the PA strongly denounced Netanyahu for "issuing a
new declaration to cancel the peace process." Senior Palestinian
negotiator Hasan Asfour described Netanyahu's statements as "a
new stone on the grave of the political process."
</P>
<P>
"It is a message to the U.S. that it has become necessary for
the U.S. administration to react to these rude demands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat slammed Israel for threatening to torpedo the peace
process with continued confiscation of Palestinian land for
expanding Jewish settlements. Arafat convened top PNA officials
in Gaza Thursday night to discuss the stalemate in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu plans to travel Sunday to the United States. He is
to hold a meeting with Jordanian King Hussein, who is currently
visiting the U.S. while undergoing a prostate surgery in
Rochester of Minnesota. Then he will hold talks with President
Clinton in Washington on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rita Fan on Future Political System of HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- It is both prudent and pragmatic
 to develop a democratic political system in Hong Kong in a
gradual and orderly way, said Rita Fan, president of the
Provisional Legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), today at a seminar marking the 7th anniversary of
the promulgation of the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
She said that the concept of "one country, two systems" and the
 policy of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" outlined in the
Basic Law clearly represents the Central Government's high degree
of confidence in Hong Kong people's ability and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the existing and future political structures of
Hong Kong are fundamentally different. For example, the Chief
Executive of the SAR is elected by a Selection Committee composed
of 400 Hong Kong permanent residents, while throughout the 150
years of British rule in Hong Kong, the governor was invariably
appointed by the British Government without any consultation with
the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Under the future political system of Hong Kong, the fundamental
 policy of "the legislature lending cooperation to and also acting
 as checks and balances on the executive-led government" will be
given expression. The Legislature of the HKSAR possesses more
power than the current Legislative Council. The former possesses
the authority to impeach the Chief Executive, while the latter
cannot challenge the status of the Governor of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She said that when the British side implemented its "reform
package" and hence derailed the through train mechanism of the
current Legislative Council, the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) is the only way to avoid the emergence
of the legal vacuum and it is also consistent with the principle
of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Before July 1, 1997, the PLC will scrutinize and pass
legislation needed for the proper establishment and functioning of
 the Hong Kong SAR. As the legislative powers and legal bases of
the PLC and the current Legislative Council stem from different
legal systems and constitutions, their scopes of work are
different, there is no question of their roles overlapping, she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"In 88 days, Hong Kong returns to the motherland, the SAR is
born and the Basic Law goes into effect. The political system
outlined in the Basic Law offers true democracy and higher degree
of participation for Hong Kong people. I have full reason to
believe that Hong Kong people are able to manage Hong Kong well,"
she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- As macro-economic environment
improved and enterprise reform proceeded, the structure of assets
and liabilities for enterprises improved in 1996 and the value of
industrial capital was preserved and increased.
</P>
<P>
A communique released by the State Statistics Bureau
today shows that the debt ratio of industrial
enterprises was 65.2 percent, of which, that of state-owned
enterprises was 65.6 percent, both dropping to some extent as
compared with that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Capital value of industrial enterprises at the end of the year
was 119.6 percent as compared with that at the beginning of the
year, of which that of state-owned enterprises was 118.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prominent problems existing in the industrial production
were the irrational structure and the difficulty in the management
and the production of some of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The communique explained that though the production
and marketing situation improved quarter by quarter, the sales
ratio of the whole year was still one to two percentage points
lower than the normal year.
</P>
<P>
The stock of products and the arrears among enterprises were
not alleviated. By the end of 1996, the stock of manufactured
goods increased by over 75 billion yuan over that the beginning
of the year.

<P>
The net volume of debts outstanding increased by 120 billion
yuan. The losses incurred to some enterprises were serious, and
the proportion of loss-making enterprises was 23 percent, up by

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Foreign Investment Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China is going to make an effort
to put more foreign investment into infrastructure, basic
industries, high technology, value-added industries, and large key
projects, according to the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
It expects to look for direct foreign investment of 230 billion
to 270 billion US dollars during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000). So far, China has used 177 billion dollars worth of
foreing investment since it adopted the reform and opening up
policy in the late 1970s, ranking first among the developing
countries in terms of the scale of using foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Departments will take steps to use foreign investment in
industrial structure and economic layout adjustments, and to give
foreign-funded enterprises equal treatment as their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
China will further reduce import tariffs, reform its import and
export controls, revise its Guiding Directory on Industries Open
to Foreign Investment items, and expand the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) investment scheme.
</P>
<P>
Areas that are open to foreign investment include agricultural
new technology, opening up land, water conservation, energy,
transportation, raw and processed materials, machinery,
electronics, and mining.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the service trade will be done in a
planned way, and an effort will be made to focus on residential
housing and tighten real estate controls.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be developed to improve the foreign investment
structure. Of the foreign investment in the past, half went to the
ordinary processing industry, 30 percent to hotels and real
estate, and only 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent to agriculture and
transportation, respectively. Less than 10 percent went to the
basic industries like electric power and petroleum.

JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's leading arms
manufacturer Denel denied on Thursday that the proposed purchase
of eight Rooivalk attack helicopters by Malaysia had been
finalized.
</P>

Speaking to reporters at a maritime defense exhibition at the
Simonstown Navy Base, Denel Chief Executive Johan Alberts said
his company was still persuading Malaysia to buy the Rooivalks
but no deal had been signed yet, reported a local daily "The

</P>
<P>
Alberts said: "We know that the Malaysians are interested, we
know they have made positive sounds, but there are still a lot of
things we must do."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Malaysia was negotiating with Denel to
buy eight Rooivalks, and the first two helicopters were expected
to be delivered soon.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama last month quoted
Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar as saying that the proposed
Rooivalk deal, the first to be sold outside South Africa, would
be the core for future expansion of the Rooivalk fleet in the
country's armed forces.
</P>

Malaysia was reportedly planning to buy 30 Rooivalks from
South Africa.
</P>

The Simonstown defense exhibition is being held as part of
celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the South African

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's southern border town
Birgunj is on the edge of a public panic after a series of child
kidnapping cases occurred since last month, the local press here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The criminal wave has caused terror among local wealthy parents
who these days fear that their children might be kidnapped for
ransom on their way home from school, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The latest victim was a 12-year-old boy who disappeared on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police have started a search operation in the area around the
town on Nepal-India border, about 80 km south of Kathmandu, but
so far the son of a local businessman has not yet been traced.
</P>
<P>
Two similar kidnapping cases took place last month in the area
with one kidnapped boy finally being tracked down by local police
with the help from Indian police in a nearby Indian town, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen of the Nepali border town have urged the
government to take strict measures against the crime of child
abduction and threatened to shut down the market if police fail to
arrest the criminals.
</P>
<P>
A local police officer said that the crime of child kidnapping
was on the rise mainly due to the absence of strong anti-abduction
laws in the country.

development.

In a joint statement, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (MCCI) and Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and

SANTIAGO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has agreed to give exports
from Chile the same exemptions from its recently-imposed import
restrictions as other members of the Mercosur trade bloc, Chilean
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said today.
</P>
<P>
He said a partial agreement has been reached to exempt Chile,
an associate member of the four-nation Mercosur bloc, from
Brazil's new regulations which demand that imports be paid for in
cash by importers as soon as goods enter the country.

Brazil, a member of Mercosur, announced yesterday that it had
reached a temporary deal with Argentina over exemptions from the
new requirements, which would also cover Uruguay and Paraguay, the
other members of Mercosur.

<P>
The restrictions were announced last week as part of Brazil's
attempt to cut its trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with Chile, between 10,000 and 40,000
U.S. dollars of Chilean products will be exempt from restrictions
on payment terms.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be in force for 120 days, when an evaluation
will be made to decide on additional measures.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia and Juan Gabriel
Valdes, director of international economic relations of the
Foreign Ministry, left for Brazil today to hammer out the details.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is Chile's third largest trading partner.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Alert on Coconut Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's coconut plantations
are threatened by the arrival of an exotic plant disease already
detected in Honduras, as reported by the local press.
</P>
<P>
The rust, that attacks the coconut palms, called "lethal
yellowing of the coconut," could propagate in Nicaragua and
exterminate the coconut plantations, mainly in the Atlantic
region, where the fruits of this plant are used for the
manufacture of vegetable oil.
</P>
<P>
The virus has already exterminated some coconut plantations in
Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, and other Caribbean
countries, and was detected recently in the Honduran island of
Roatan.
</P>
<P>
Specialists in plant diseases say the plague advances 100
kilometers per year, which means that the Nicaraguan authorities
and owners of coconut plantations should right away start thinking
of the way to save or substitute the coconut palms.
</P>
<P>
According to the specialists, the lethal yellowing of the
coconut palm is transmitted by a kind of insects that jump from
leaf to leaf. Another way of propagation of the disease is by the
transportation of sick plants or coconut products.
</P>
<P>
This situation has prompted the Nicaraguan Agriculture and
Livestock Ministry to request agriculturists, merchants, and the
public in general, not to bring to Nicaragua coconut plants from
other countries without the sanitary authorization of the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Reduce Imports of Oil Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's energy industry plans to
slash imports of oil equipment from abroad to shake off its
dependence on foreign deliveries, Vladimir Kurashov, an official
from the Fuel Ministry, said today.
</P>
<P>
Russian energy companies import between six and seven billion
U.S. dollars of equipment a year. But Kurashov said some of the
imports could be substituted with domestic goods, as many defense
companies have now turned to making equipment for the oil and gas
industry.
</P>
<P>
Kurashov was speaking at a news conference ahead of the
international "Oil and Gas '97" exhibition which starts in Moscow
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kurashov told reporters the ministry has worked out a
program to reduce fuel exports by a third -- from the
current 30 percent to 20 percent. The figure should eventually
fall to 10-15 percent, he added.

BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to allow more
foreign holdings in new finance firms emerging after mergers in a
bid to promote mergers in the ailing finance sector.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan recently has said
that the new firms of this kind are an exception, but foreign
holdings in local commercial banks and other financial
institutions will remain limited up to five percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign stake in the new firms may not exceed 25
percent, stressed Amnuay, who also serves as finance minister.

The Finance Ministry will consider allowing foreign financial
institutions to merge with Thai finance companies on a

</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that foreign financial institutions may not
be keen in merging business in Thailand as they are focusing on

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Plans to Promote Non-oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
continue to encourage the country's non-oil/non-gas exports which
have been going down lately, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"Our non-oil exports have declined as a consequence of smaller
need of importing countries, the emergence of competitors and an
appreciation of the rupiah against the US dollar," Industry and
Trade Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said Thursday after meeting
President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's non-oil and gas export growth was only 9 percent a
year, less than the 15 percent to 19 percent targeted in the
current five-year development plan, official sources of the
Industry and Trade Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
They quoted Tunky as saying that the government was formulating
steps to boost the growth of non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government would provide financial
support to exporters.
</P>
<P>
The government was also planning to increase the number of
trade promotion centers abroad from 13 to 23 and the number of
trade attaches from 25 to 33, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tunky also disclosed that Indonesia posted a trade surplus of
575.4 million US dollars in January, 37.2 percent lower than in
December last year, but 38.1 percent higher compared to a year
earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Albania's government for national
reconciliation is the country's last hope of keeping the Balkan
country united, Prime Minister Bashkim Fino said today after a
two-day visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government is a government for national
reconciliation not for hatred, Fino said following his return from
a tour of Albanian refugee camps in Greece where some 300,000
people are estimated to be living.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister met leaders of Greece, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union
(EU) to secure much-needed support for the country which has been
gripped by near anarchy over the last month.
</P>
<P>
EU, OSCE and Greek officials are believed to have assured Fino
that his all-party unity government would get economic,
organizational and humanitarian aid, as well as the peacekeepers
needed to distribute it.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Albanians have fled to Italy and Greece over the
past three weeks as violence escalated in the country and armed
rebels took over several southern towns demanding the resignation
of President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
The troubles were sparked by last December's collapse of
pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost
their life savings.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Steady Economic Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's national economy
registered a sustained and rapid development in the year 1996,
with the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) hitting 9.7
percent, a relatively high level in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau (SSB) today released the
"Statistical Communique of the People's Republic of China on 1996
National Economic and Social Development," saying that the Chinese
economy grew in a steady manner and the targets of major
macro-economic control were achieved last year.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, Zhang Sai, director of the SSB,
said that in 1996 the GDP of the country reached 6,779.5 billion
yuan, up 9.7 percent from that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, the value-added of the primary industry was
1,355 billion yuan, up 5.1 percent; that of the secondary industry
3,314.8 billion yuan, up 12.3 percent; and that of the tertiary
industry 2,109.7 billion yuan, up eight percent.

</P>
<P>
However, the problems of irrational economic structure and
difficulties in management and operation encountered by some
enterprises were still prominent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that such a robust growth in the national economy
reflected the vitality of market mechanism as well as an enhanced
macro-control capacity of the central government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
will issue 200 million US dollars of floating bond in Hong Kong
today.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be listed in the Hong Kong United Stock Exchange
on April 14, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The bank, a long-time lending institution for the country's
capital construction projects, would invest funds from the issue
in eight large domestic projects, including a 300,000-ton ethylene
project in Maoming, Guangdong Province, and the Shanghai Yangcheng
Power Station, a bank official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bank also intended to reinforce its ties with investors in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The issue enjoys a favorable climate because the price of
Chinese bonds has been growing since last year as the country's
economic conditions improved, the official said, adding that Asian
investors are very interested in Chinese bonds.
</P>
<P>
The floating rate notes issued this time have a five-year
maturity and carry a coupon of 30 basic points over the London
Interbank Offered Rate, a gauge for international interest rates.
</P>
<P>
CCB began to take part in the international capital market in
1988. By the end of last year, it has raised more than seven
billion US dollars in external funds, including more than 600
million US dollars of bonds.

<HEADLINE> Crash Pilots Barred from Leaving Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Two United States pilots who
survived the crash of a U.S. Air Force cargo plane on Tuesday at
the Toncotin International Airport, in Tegucigalpa, were
prohibited from leaving Honduras pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
The pilots could not leave before reports on the accident were
known because they might be required by the courts to make
statements, said executive judge Dagoberto Aspra Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
One requirement was the examination of blood and urine samples
of survivors to determine whether they had consumed alcohol or
psychotropic substances before the accident.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and another seven injured when the
Hercules C-130 plane crashed in flames Tuesday morning after
over-running a landing strip at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the court said Judge Iglesias wanted to question
the pilots this morning at the military hospital where they are
being cared for. But U.S. agents in charge of the pilots did not
permit the judge to talk to them, and mentioned bilateral
migratory agreements between the United States and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
"That is an abuse, because the accident occurred in Honduran
territory and they must respect the laws of the country," said the
judge.
</P>
<P>
It was rumoured that the two injured pilots could be sent back
to the United States today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Southern Command, with headquarters in Panama,
sent 25 people to Honduras, with agents and medical personnel
among them, to start preliminary investigations.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reviews Human Rights Position on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada is reconsidering its
long-standing support of human-rights resolutions criticizing
China at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva,
Canadian leading newspaper the Globe and Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Such resolutions have been backed by Canada every year at the
commission's annual review since 1989. Now, Canadian government
sources say Canada is reassessing its position, reported the
newspaper in its special dispatch from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
France has decided it will no longer co-sponsor the resolution,
saying China has made progress in some areas of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the French decision really throws any possibility of
a resolution being passed into real doubt," Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy told reporters in Beijing
Wednesday, saying "we have to make an assessment. I just found out
about the French decision this morning."
</P>
<P>
However, one Canadian government official close to the
situation told the newspaer that Germany, Italy and Spain were
already thinking of joining France on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to reassess the situation," the official said.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian decision to end backing for the resolution would be
in keeping with Canada's evolving, soft-sell approach to the
status of human rights in China, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Pressure doesn't work, Axworthy declared, after several
hours of meetings with top Chinese leaders during his one-day
blitz of Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 artillery shells
have been fired to disperse hailstorms in Pingliang City in
northwest China's Gansu Province, protecting about 1,300 ha of
farmland from hail in the past ten years, according to the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The city, located in a mountainous area, is prone to
hailstorms, and the Lanzhou Plateau Atmosphere Research Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been entrusted with
disaster relief since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The institute has succeeded in dispersing hailstorms by
shelling clouds, with a total success rate of 94 percent. It has
done this for 178 times. Each bombardment used about 58 shells.
</P>
<P>
According to the evaluations of the local agricultural and
statistics departments, the shelling on average saved grain
production worth 2.7 million yuan (about 310,000 US dollars) each
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Control on Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China will shift its focus to the
administration of existing ports from opening new ones in the
past, the country's Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said at an annual
national conference on port administration Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The focus for 1997 will be placed on realizing a reasonable
layout of ports and improving port management, Zou was quoted as
saying in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Since China started to carry out the policy of reform and
opening up policy in 1978, remarkable achievements have been made
in port facilities, said Zou.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has 235 state-level ports and 350
provincial ones.
</P>
<P>
Although China has enough ports, their comprehensive functions
have not been brought into full play due to unreasonable lay outs
and backward management, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to resolve the situation by regulating approval
procedures for new ports and reorganizing existing ones.
</P>
<P>
The state will merge some small ports which are close to each
other and close some ports which handle too little business, and
have poor economic returns.
</P>
<P>
As for improving port management, the state will concentrate on
completing trial port reforms in Shenzhen and introducing better
management in 30 ports where the annual handing volume makes up 80
percent of the total national amount.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan today called on
Afghanistan's conflicting parties to stop militant action
immediately and start a peacemaking process to restore national
unity and get governmental system working.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released here by Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry, said
Kazakhstan believed the resolution for Afghanistan's civil war
depended on ensuring the integrity of the country's sovereignty,
territory and independence.
</P>
<P>
It depended on establishing a government representing interests
of all parties and nationalities, and securing agreement by
conflicting parties that peace negotiation was the only way to
resolve the conflict, it noted
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued as Afghanistan's conflict spread
towards the north region which Kazakhstan borders.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's foreign minister K. Tokayev is expected to visit
Tajikistan's capital of Dushanbe on April 4 for talks with the foreign
ministers of Central Asian countries and Russia to discuss the

<HEADLINE> Italy Sets up Task Force to Cope With Albanian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government set up a task
force Thursday to deal with the 13,000 Albanians who have fled to
Italy since civil unrest broke out in the neighboring Balkan state
in February.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement that it had agreed to
proposals by the Association of Italian Town Councils (ANCI) to
"spread the refugee burden more evenly across Italy."
</P>
<P>
The ANCI said almost 6,000 of the refugees are in the southern
Puglia region, where more Albanians are still arriving despite
last Friday's shipwreck of an Albanian refugee boat in which more
than 80 were feared drowned after a collision with an Italian navy
ship.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the task force will be formed by
representatives from city and provincial governments as well as
interior ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Among the mayors pledging their cities' support to the task
force was Rome's Francesco Rutelli. But several northern city
councils, notably Milan's administration, have refused to accept
any of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Milan's Mayor Marco Formentini said his "total blockade"
against Albanians was still in force.
</P>
<P>
In other government moves, Education Minister Luigi Berlinguer
said the ministry was preparing classes for refugee children and
planning to step up a cultural exchange program to help equip and
upgrade schools in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has issued orders that the Albanian
refugees should only be allowed to stay for at most two months.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Association of South

find solutions to problems in inter-regional trade, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
"We did not discuss specific themes. We spoke, in general
terms, about the way to advance toward a commercial agreement
between the two blocs," said Singh.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Banks to Set Up Joint Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- More and more foreign banks, which
have opened representative offices in Myanmar, are planning to set
up joint venture banks with its counterparts in the country in the
wake of Myanmar's entry into the second phase of its financial
reform.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, five foreign banks have signed memorandums of
understanding with local private banks to form joint ventures
including the latest one -- Cambodia's Global Commercial Bank
which reached a MOU on Thursday with Myanmar's Livestock and
Fisheries Development Bank, a state-private joint investment bank,
according to today's official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The other four foreign banks, which signed MOUs earlier with
Myanmar, are Thailand's Farmers Bank and Siam City Bank, and
Malaysia's May Bank and Public Bank.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd formally entered into contract in January
this year with Myanmar's Yoma Bank, a private one, to jointly
operate banking business under the name of Fuji Yoma Bank, thus
becoming the first Myanmar-foreign joint venture bank in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to six state-owned banks and some state-private
banks, there are 25 private banks in Myanmar now.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of foreign banks that have
representative offices in the country have reached 44. They are
from 16 countries and regions and most of them are from Japan,
Thailand, France, Singapore and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Greater EU Role in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Italy today called for its European
Union (EU) partners to give "serious reflection" to mounting
tensions in the Middle East in hope of finding a way to push
forward the stalled peace process there.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said that with the situation
deteriorating and violence escalating, the EU must find "new
diplomatic initiatives to be undertaken with the United States, to
help defuse the crisis and restart dialogue between the Israelis
and Palestinians".
</P>
<P>
Italy has asked the Netherlands, which holds the rotating
six-month presidency of the 15-member bloc, to call a special
meeting of EU foreign ministers to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
They said the first step toward saving the peace process was to
restore trust between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Italy has made numerous efforts to increase the EU's role in
the peace process. They include the measure leading to the naming
of the EU's special envoy to the region, visits to the region by
Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini,
and visits to Italy by Israeli Prime Mimister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arab-Israeli relations have plummeted since late February when
Israel decided to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem, a move that triggered a spate of violent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League on Monday agreed to freeze relations with
Israel. Netanyahu's visit to Rome next week has been seen as an
important starting point on its road to recovering lost ground,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's influence is underpinned by the fact that it accounts
for about 53 percent of foreign aid to the Palestinian National
Authority, and is Israel's biggest trading partner.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airways Plans for Hike in Domestic Flight Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Airways International
(Thai) is planning for hikes in domestic flight fares, it is
confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the fare hike plan, Thai senior vice-president Pisit
Kusalasaiyanon said the fare increase has been prompted by rising
oil prices, which have risen by 10 percent, and the weaker baht
against the yen and European currencies.
</P>
<P>
The national airline wants to increase fares by 200-300 baht
(8-12 US dollars) per flight because it expects to face higher
losses from domestic services this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Thai lost 40-50 million baht (1.6-2 million dollars)
from domestic flights and the amount is expected to jump to
300-400 million baht (12-16 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Transport and Communications Minister Suwat
Liptapallop said that his ministry will not consider a fare hike
now as Thai still enjoys 4,000-5,000 million baht (160-200 million
dollars) of annual profits from international routes.
</P>
<P>
In business terms, the Thai is still profitable, he added.

<P>
WUHAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Jinzhou, in central China's Hubei
Province, is waging a war against termites as the rainy season
draws closer.
</P>
<P>
The city on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
is in an area that gets plenty of rain. The low-lying land and
moist environment are ideal for the propagation of termites, and
37 percent of the urban area is infested with termites that
threaten river dykes as well as the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government put extermination of termites on its
agenda years ago, and construction work units must include termite
prevention as part of infrastructure plans when applying for
permits.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, termite researchers cleared two million
sq m of building space of termites, and thanks to these efforts,
the city remained intact when it was hit by severe floods last
year.

LHASA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region's

This is the first time Tibet's economy has increased by double
digits.

<HEADLINE> Flow in Upper Reaches of Yellow River Hits Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The flow on the upper reaches of
the Yellow River has hit a record low point, according to an
expert of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee.
</P>
<P>
The expert cited historical data to explain that the flow of
the river's section flowing through Lanzhou, capital of northwest
China's Gansu Province, decreased by nearly 33 percent in
comparison with the average level in the past.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall accounts for over 70 percent of the flow on the upper
stream of the Yellow River, which originates in the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau. The droughts on the plateau for several years running
have caused the river flow to remain relatively low since 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun Meizhai, a senior engineer of the committee,
flow from the upper reaches of the river decreased by over
one-fourth in comparison with last year.
</P>
<P>
The Longyangxia Reservoir on the upper reaches of the river is
a major indicator of the flow from the upper stream. In the past
three months, the incoming flow was some 33 cubic m per second
less than the average level, reaching a record low.
</P>
<P>
The drop in water sources also caused the capacities of
Longyangxia Reservoir and Liujiaxia Reservoir, another reservoir
on the upper reaches of the river, to shrink drastically. The
designed capacity of the two reservoirs are 24.7 billion cubic m
and 5.7 billion cubic m respectively. Their present capacity is
2.49 cubic m less than that of 1954, a record low.
</P>
<P>
The river's section in east China's Shandong Province dried up
on February 7, seven days earlier than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River is the second largest river in China. But its
flow is less than five percent of the Yangtze River. The Chinese
Government is planning to divert the water from the Yangtze River
into the Yellow River to solve the water shortage.

<P>
ROME, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona, runners-up at last year's
EuroLeague basketball, swept past hosts Bologna of Italy 87-62 to
reach the Final Four championship on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, who lost the first encounter 70-65, beat the
Italians 75-73 in the second match after the British referee blew
time as Bologna's Dan Gay netted a tie-winning three-pointer.
</P>
<P>
There was no argument on Thursday as Barcelona outclassed their
tired and less experienced rivals. Ramon Rivas was Barcelona's
top scorer with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
Gay showed a modest performance with only 10 points behind
Carlton Myers on 21 thanks to four three-pointers and Eric Murdock
on 19 with three.

WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- World number-one Martina Hingis
of Switzerland advanced into the quarter-finals with a 6-3 and 6-3
victory over Austria's Barbara Schett in a WTA tour event in
Hilton Head, South Carolina on Thursday.

Conchita Martinez. Martinez beat American Jennifer Capriati 6-0,
5-7, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The Coetzer-Martinez winner would face either Monica Seles or
Anke Huber for a place in the final.
</P>
<P>
Huber advanced Thursday with a 3-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 win over Iva
Majoli of Croatia.
</P>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Navy helicopter warship USS
Nassau, with 1,338 marines aboard, is in position off the coast of
Zaire, ready to assist in an evacuation of Americans from Zaire,
if necessary, Pentagon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We're there in case an evacuation is necessary," Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters at a briefing. "The USS Nassau
is currently on station about 220 miles off the coast of Africa,
about the confluence of Congo, Zaire and Angola."
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said there are believed to be more than 500
Americans in Zaire, including some 470 private citizens.
</P>
<P>
Bacon stressed there had been no request from the U.S. Embassy
in the capital of Kinshasa for a rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
However, the USS Nassau, an amphibious vessel, could move
farther in if the situation warrants, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Army forces were also sent into the region several weeks
ago to establish communications and basic security in the event an
evacuation was ordered by vessel, helicopter or military transport
plane.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
arranging a high-powered bipartisan gathering of supporters on
Friday to press Senate approval of the treaty banning all chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Congressmen, arms experts, and military leaders, including
retired Army General Colin Powell and other prominent figures will
join the rally.
</P>
<P>
"The president in very strong terms will call upon the Senate
to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention by the end of April when
the deadline for original adherence to the convention expires,"
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said today.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the U.S. role in the enforcement and
implementation of the treaty will be severely restricted if the
Senate does not ratify the treaty by April 29.
</P>
<P>
"That would put us at a real loss of a leadership role as we
assure that other countries fully comply with the convention
itself, as we figure out ways to monitor and verify implementation
of the convention," McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if the Senate failed to ratify the treaty before the
deadline, the U.S. would not be an original member in the
consultative committee that actually implements and monitors the
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Apple Is Seeking Friendly Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The troubled Apple Computer Inc.
of the U.S. is actively looking for a friendly merger candidate,
according to local press here.
</P>
<P>
Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia announced Wednesday that
he had paid 115 million U.S. dollars acquire slightly more than 5
percent of Apple during the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The news stirred some speculation about the fate of the
computer giant, which the prince believed to be able to recover
its past glory. The prince has become the company's largest
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
For Apple, Oracle Corporation's chairman, Larry Ellison, said
last week that he was considering, along with its partners,
spending more than 1 billion U.S. dollars to acquire Apple.
</P>
<P>
Apple, however, has a long and tangled history of failed merger
negotiations with other companies ranging from I.B.M. to the AT&AMP;T
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the company was probably in talks again with the
Sun Microsystems Inc., the California based work station maker
that came close to acquiring Apple last year.
</P>
<P>
Apple has lost 9.36 million U.S. dollars over the last five
quarters, and does not expect to make money again untile the fall
quarter, it is reported. The company chairman, Gilbert Amelio,
said that better times are only several quarters away since he
took the post a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the company laid off 4,100 employees, for which
it will take a 155 million U.S. dollar restructuring charge.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai Attacks Palestinians for Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai on Thursday laid blames on the Palestinians for
the recent violent clashes on the West Bank while deliberately
ignoring the fact that his government's violation of
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements have caused a series of
protests staged by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting with U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, Mordechai demanded Palestinian leader
yasser Arafat to take steps to "fight against terrorism," saying
that is "necessary" to push forward the peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have accused Arafat of giving a green light
to Palestinians' protests against the Israeli government's
decision to build 6,500 Jewish homes in east Jerusalem, which have
been evolving into violent clashes with Israeli soldiers rushing
to suppress.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's remarks were a veiled repetition of those
officials' accusation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister appeared to rule out any temporary
halt by the Israeli government of housing construction in east
Jerusalem, saying that Israel has its right to do so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed not
to relinquish the right to settle Jews in occupied lands when he
meet U.S. President Bill Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister will make clear in Washington that Israel
stands by its right to build in Jerusalem and in settlements, and
included in that the building will continue at Har Homa (on the
east Jerusalem hilltop)," Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is in Washington to discuss with his U.S. counterpart
strategic cooperation and anti-terrorist measures, including the
Arrow missile program, which Israeli has twice tested successfully,
and a high-energy laser, which could defend against Katyusha
rockets.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun: Dusk to Dawn Curfew Strictly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A dusk to dawn curfew has
strictly been implemented in six towns of North West Province of
Cameroun, the local paper "Cameroun Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The curfew was declared by Governor
Fai Yengo Francis on March 29, 1997 following armed attacks on
a number of military and civilian targets on March 27, 28 and 29
by armed individuals. The curfew prohibites the movement of people,
the holding of meetings and gatherings and the ban on fire arms at
funeral and other ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Five days after the dusk to dawn curfew was imposed, the
residents in the six towns --Jakiri, Kumbo, Oku, Mbengwi, Bafut
and Bamenda -- are undertaking their daily activities unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
As from 5 p.m., people start rushing home after the day's
activities. Law enforcement officials then take to the streets to
enforce the curfew and search for the pepertrators of the
incidents on March 27, 28 and 29.
</P>
<P>
Movement in and out of Bamenda continues but not after 7 p.m.
when the gateway into the town from Bafoussam, the capital of
West Province, is closed to all vehicles. Travellers coming into
the town after that time spend the night at the gateway and can
only get into town the next day. Drivers who used to ply at night
from Bamenda to Douala, the economic capital of Cameroun and
Yaounde have ceased undertaking the late journey.
</P>
<P>
Social activities have been cut down to the barest minimum.
Most drinking spots no longer function at night.
</P>
<P>
Governor Francis has promised to lift the curfew as soon as
total calm returns to the province. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Big-name technology shares rose
on Wall Street today despite another downward turning of the broad
market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 39.66 points to 6,477.35,
with little gains left for the years.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaled 495.47
million shares as against 478.14 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list and the Nasdaq composite
index rose into positive territory.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 0.21 to 750.32, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 0.97 to 394.40.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 12.77 to 1,213.77, but is still
down about 6 percent for the year and off 12.5 percent from its
January high.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.37 to
557.82, and the Russell 2000 list of smaller companies fell 1.41
to 336.38.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's loss over the past five sessions amounted to about
400 points. Less than a month ago, the blue-chip barometer was
sporting a robust gain of about 637 points, or nearly 10 percent,
for the year.
</P>
<P>
Stocks remained under pressure from the bond market, where
long-term interest rates continued to rise to another six-month
high.
</P>
<P>
In a worrisome prelude to Friday's key report on U.S. payroll
and wage levels.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to slow economic activity and keep inflation under
control, Federal Reserve last week raised one of the central
bank's key lending rates higher for the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
But if the strong economic data continued to be strong, the Fed
may decide to raise rates several times, potentially cutting into
company profits.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Pentagon announced on Thursday
that the United States has offered to provide more financial aid
to Israel's anti-missile defense program, including extra funds
for the joint U.S.-Israeli Arrow 2 anti-missile program and a new
laser weapon.
</P>
<P>
"The details aren't totally worked out, but we will increase
our investment in the Arrow missile program and will help with
testing and other aspects of it," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
said shortly after talks between visiting Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said current U.S. aid for the Arrow program, which stands
at about 200 million U.S. dollars over five years, might be
increased by as much as 25 percent after consultation with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He gave no additional financial figures, but said the United
States had also offered to provide more money for joint work on
the U.S. "Nautilus" high-energy laser, which Israel intends to
use against Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently developing the Arrow to shoot down Scud
and other missiles and Bacon said that Israel considered the
weapon very important to its defense.

<HEADLINE> Outlook for World Wheat Production in 1997/98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production is forecast
at 583 million tons, or 3 million tons more than in 1996, on the
basis of information currently available, International Grains
Council(IGC) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Larger crops are expected in China, EC and Ukraine, but reduced
sowings will probably curtail output in Canada and the United
States, IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Record harvests are unlikely to recur in Argentina and
Australia, but producers will again be influenced by international
prices over the next few months, it added.
</P>
<P>
International Grains Council emphasized that these forecasts
assume that normal weather will prevail throughout the growing
season.
</P>
<P>
Given the low volume of world stocks, weather news and its
effects on the production outlook, will remain an important factor
in determining the direction and stability of world prices, the
Council said.

MOGADISHU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's Representative to Somalia Felix Mosha arrived here today
with his deputy Femi Radejo and a senior U.N. delegation for a
one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
They met with north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and south Mogadishu faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the headquarters of the two leaders said that
the delegation has delivered a message from Annan to them,
expressing his concern about finding a solution for Somalia's
crises.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi told reporters the U.N. has expressed its readiness
to help Somalis in an effort to promote peace and
reconciliation, pledging it will never abandon Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. has also promised their support to the
currently continuing peace meeting between Mogadishu's opposing
sides.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, focusing on pacifying the city and broadening
itself for larger participation, went into a third day today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides attending the meeting are hopeful of making
progress in the stalemated political stance of Somalia, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. will offer all possible encouragements to
make Somalia stand on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said he suggested the U.N. to move its Somali
Affairs Office in Nairobi to Mogadishu but the U.N. delegation
has expressed reluctance in doing so.
</P>
<P>
He said he was told by the delegation that "It's yet too soon
to make such decisions."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a U.N. delegation to visit
Mogadishu since Annan took office early this year. enditem

LUANDA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has

Angola so far this year, compared with a total of 103 million
Dollars in 1996.
</P>

southern African country, the Angolan News Agency today quoted
Nicholas Jenks, a U.S. diplomat in Angola, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. maintains close cooperation with Angola's ministries

<HEADLINE> UK's Consumer Borrowing Shows An Overheating Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Excessive credit card use pushed
net consumer borrowing in Britain to a record 1.22 billion pounds
(1.952 billion US dollars) in February, according to Bank of
England figures released today.
</P>
<P>
Net consumer credit in the month rose 17.5 percent on
year-on-year bases, the fastest rise since May 1989, the Bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jeffrey, group economist at Charter-house Bank, said
the figures were "truly staggering" -- similar to the growth in
consumer credit during the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"You have to worry that consumer confidence is turning into
over-confidence," he added. "This has the makings of a highly
inflationary environment led by consumer spending."
</P>
<P>
Some economists in the City said that the rise was above market
forecasts and heightened expectations that interest rates would
need to rise to tackle an overheating economy.
</P>
<P>
The growth in consumer credit followed growth in earnings and
falling unemployment, which have boosted consumer confidence, they
added.
</P>
<P>
February saw the third-largest monthly fall in unemployment on
record, while the jobless rate fell to 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the latest wages figures showed a tightening labor
market and a 5 percent annual increase in earnings.
</P>
<P>
Don Smith, a economist at HSBC, said the increase in consumer
credit hardened the case for a rise in interest rates after the
general election on May 1.

<HEADLINE> Greek Consulate in Southern Albania Attacked Once Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Greek consulate in Gjirokaster,
southern Albania, was attacked once again by armed insurgents
today, according to a report released by the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
A number of men, armed with guns and grenades, managed to
disarm the consulate's police guards and enter the building,
demanding consular staff issue them visas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Threats to use the grenades and to shoot forced police to clear
the surrounding area of the thousands of Albanians who had
gathered to apply for visas.
</P>
<P>
The consulate was forced to close shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The incident came almost a week after a similar incident in
which armed men broke through the main entrance, firing tear gas
cannisters and shots into the crowded building.
</P>
<P>
The Greek consulate reopened only after local authorities
promised that the building would be guarded.

<HEADLINE> US Scientists Find Trigger of Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have found that
inflammation that smolders for years inside the arteries appears
to be a powerful trigger of heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
The new study, being published today in the New England Journal
of Medicine, is reported to be the first to show that the
inflammation is simmering, contributing to clogged arteries, while
those suffering from it appears to be healthy. Early study had
found signs of this inflammation at the time people suffered heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Although the cause of the inflammation is still unknown, a
leading theory is that chronic infection with common germs might
be the the reason, the New York Times said in a report. If so, the
report added, the study raised the possibility that antibiotics
and vaccines, along with stronger anti-inflammatory drugs, might
someday be added to the medicines routinely used to treat heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
The research also helps explain why aspirin is so good for the
heart. For years, experts thought aspirin's main benefit was
prevention of blood clotting. But the new study suggests that it
also works by fighting inflammation inside the blood vessels.
