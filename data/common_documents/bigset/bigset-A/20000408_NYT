<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are few people more identified with the soul
of jazz than the pianist Thelonious Monk, so it seemed a powerful
statement about this city's coming of age as a modern jazz center
when the prestigious education institute started by his heirs moved
from Boston to the University of Southern California last year.
</P>
<P>
   The university wore the arrival of the Thelonious Monk Institute
of Jazz Performance as a badge of honor, trumpeting it as a new
start for the program, which had been operating at the New England
Conservatory of Music. The best young jazz musicians, university
officials said, would now come to Los Angeles for instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Monk program moves to the end of its first academic
year here, the picture has changed considerably. The entire first
crop of graduate fellows, eight unusually talented musicians who
began last fall, left the program within months _ a fact that the
university only reluctantly acknowledged. The institute frantically
recruited five new fellows in January and effectively started over.
</P>
<P>
   The students who left cited a range of problems, from
personality clashes to an emphasis on academic training over
performance. Some of the people who run the program said the
fellows were, for the most part, too young and inexperienced in the
ways of this sprawling city.
</P>
<P>
   But what people on both sides generally agree on is the gulf
that still separates the jazz cultures on the West Coast and the
East Coast, a divide that the move here had supposedly bridged.
</P>
<P>
   Because Los Angeles is the capital of the entertainment
industry, it gets top musicians and composers to work and perform
here, but the culture is far more geographically diffuse and
infused with a commercial sensibility than it is in the East, say
many of those involved. Most of the first group of fellows were
from the East Coast, or at least identified with the atmosphere
there, where life revolves around a vibrant and highly focused club
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much I was into the East Coast vibe until
I started the program,'' said Damion Reid, a drummer in the first
group of fellows. He grew up in Los Angeles but had studied at the
New England Conservatory of Music. ``Because the program was so
prestigious and had a good rap, it seemed perfect,'' he said. ``But
when the institute moved, the agenda moved. It felt different.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Monk Institute has had to not only re-evaluate
the program's approach but also contemplate the persistently
nettlesome question of how subject matter relates to the
environment _ in this case, how the geography of Los Angeles
affects culture. This is particularly true of jazz, which has
always drawn its improvisational strength from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do a good job of getting the students prepared for
the kind of work they'd be doing on the West Coast,'' conceded
Ronald C. McCurdy, a trumpeter who last fall became director of the
Monk Institute, which is technically separate from the university's
highly rated music school. ``It was pretty painful for a lot of
people. It was not the start we'd prepared for, I can tell you
that. We just hadn't really understood the extent of the adjustment
from one coast to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton Berg, a pianist and chairman of the jazz department at
USC's Thornton School of Music, said he was sympathetic about some
of the problems encountered by the first group of fellows, but said
he still felt the institute's move was wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all ripped out of one scene and brought to a
different one,'' Berg said of the first class. ``They hadn't been
well prepared for the differences. But the scenes each have their
advantages. L.A. has the whole entertainment industry and all those
opportunities.'' The East Coast, like Boston and New York, he
explained, has a more concentrated jazz scene and a deeper pool of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Monk was a largely self-taught innovator whose imaginative
flights at the keyboard were credited with opening whole new areas
for musical exploration, including the bebop school, which he
helped originate in the early postwar years.
</P>
<P>
   After he died in 1982, his family and others in the music world
decided to hold a benefit concert to raise money for music
education. The benefit, held in 1986, was such a success that it
evolved into the idea of forming an institute, based in Washington,
that would focus on jazz education.
</P>
<P>
   The main offices of the institute are still in Washington, and
it has thrived with the support of President Clinton, as well as
that of Tipper Gore, who is a drummer. In addition to the
fellowship program, the institute runs programs in public schools
and a summer program in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carter, the Monk Institute's president, said that it was
hard to find a home for the fellowship program. The University of
Southern California initially rejected the program because it
seemed an untested idea.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed. When the program ran into financial
problems recently in Boston and began looking for a new home, the
University of Southern California leaped at the idea, said the
music school's dean, Larry J. Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   The music school had been shifting toward a more pragmatic
approach, teaching its students not just about music but also about
how to survive and thrive in the music business. Moving the
institute here was a way to diversify the range of talented young
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monk Institute wants to recenter jazz in the American
voice, and I think you can do that better here, where you have the
entertainment industry,'' Livingston said.

</P>
<P>
   Still, many things are different in Los Angeles. For one, the
number of jazz clubs is modest, and they are spread out over the
city's vast geographical area, from the Jazz Spot near Hollywood,
where McCurdy and some of the fellows have regular jam sessions, to
Steamers Cafe, over an hour away in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here only three months, it was shocking at first,'' said
Bryan Lipps, a trumpeter and a current fellow at the institute.
``In New York you walk out the door and everything is right there.
The cats are all there. Maybe it's all here in L.A., but honestly I
kind of haven't figured the scene out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Terry, one of jazz's most respected trumpeters, who gives
a master class at the institute, said the problem was not the
talent of the students but their fit with the program and the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they had problem with the faculty and I think they
felt far away from the scene,'' said Terry, who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan, a bass player who started last fall and then left
with the others, said another problem was that there were more
academic requirements after the program moved, and that left less
time for performance. The dearth of clubs only made that worse, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not as performance oriented,'' said Sullivan, whose
group, the John Sullivan Quintet, plays occasionally at the
Cornelia Street Cafe in New York. ``I wish I'd known what we were
in for. I think I'm a reasonable guy, and they treated us well. But
it looked kind of grim after a while. That's why we all split.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy said, ``I can say I'm a lot smarter now than I was eight
months ago.''

ARTHUR RUGE, 94, INVENTOR OF VITAL STRESS GAUGE

<P>
   Arthur C. Ruge, who invented a fingernail-sized gauge that
helped the United States win World War II and revolutionized the
way things are weighed and tested for stress, died Monday at his
home in Lexington, Mass., according to his daughter, Claire
Bertucci. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Ruge (pronounced ROO-gee) was an assistant professor of
engineering and an earthquake specialist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1938 when he created what he called the
SR-4 strain gauge. Ruge came up with the invention to help a
graduate student complete a thesis on the stresses experienced by
model water towers that had been tested on a tabletop earthquake
simulator that Ruge designed.
</P>
<P>
   The SR-4 was a deceptively simple invention composed of four
thin tungsten filaments similar to those used in light bulbs, glued
together in the shape of a diamond. When an electrical current is
run across the wires, no voltage can be measured as long as they
remain perfectly aligned. But if some force disturbs the symmetry,
and thus the resistance in the wires, the gauge puts out a voltage
proportional to the force.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since humans began weighing objects _ an
activity that started before recorded history _ mankind now had a
method that did not rely on balancing the force exerted by the
object being weighed against some other weight or force.
</P>
<P>
   The invention soon proved vital to the Allied war effort in
designing aircraft, gun barrels and other machinery of destruction.
Descendants of the SR-4, which are often called load cells, are
crucial components in electronic scales from supermarket checkout
stands to truck weighing stations. The first signal received from
the moon was a reading from a strain gauge on the leg of the lunar
lander as it touched down.
</P>
<P>
   The commercialization of the strain gauge brought a shock for
Ruge _ he soon discovered that Edward E. Simmons, a professor at
the California Institute of Technology, had pieced together the
same invention in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   But Simmons and Caltech failed to recognize the significance of
the gauge until Ruge began popularizing it. MIT's patent committee
was equally shortsighted and gave Ruge its rights to the gauge
technology, which it characterized as ``interesting'' but not
likely to be commercially valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until Ruge reinvented it that the world realized
what had been done,'' said Peter K. Stein, an engineering
consultant and historian of metrology in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ruge, widely known to friends and colleagues as Prof, linked up
within months of the invention with Alfred V. de Forest, an MIT
colleague, to create Ruge-de Forest Inc., the first company to make
strain gauges. He resigned his position at MIT to work full time at
the company in 1947. The company was sold to Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton,
its main distributor, in 1955 and today is part of BLH Electronics
in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Claude Ruge was born in Tomah, Wis., on July 28, 1905,
the son of the Rev. C.A. Ferdinand Ruge, an Episcopal minister, and
Rosa March Ruge. He received a bachelor of science degree in civil
engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   After short stints at manufacturing companies in Pennsylvania
and Michigan, he moved to Consolidated Steel Corp. in Los Angeles,
where his responsibilities included designing structural steel
capable of handling earthquakes. He entered MIT in 1931 and began
teaching and seismological research there while completing his
Master of Science degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prof had an informal, often messy, lab in the basement,''
recalled Frank Hines, an assistant who followed Ruge to Ruge-de
Forest as its first employee. ``The only person called Mr. was the
janitor.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Ruge-de Forest in 1955, Ruge set up Arthur C. Ruge
Associates to make temperature gauges. That company was sold to
Hines and others in 1974 and it does business today as RdF Inc.,
based in Hudson, N.H. Ruge's business career also included serving
as chairman of Space and Tactical Systems and MKS Instruments Inc.,
both of which are based in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Ruge married Florence Brenner in 1932. She died in 1975. In
addition to their daughter, Claire, who lives in Lexington, he is
survived by two granddaughters.

ROBERT GAGE, ART DIRECTOR FOR WELL-KNOWN ADS, DIES AT 78

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Gage, an influential art director with the DDB
Worldwide advertising agency and a director of well-known
television ads, died Tuesday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 78
and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a staphylococcus infection, said his son, Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Gage's advertising career began at the Abbott Kimball Co. and
continued at Grey Advertising under its creative director, Bill
Bernbach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, when Bernbach and Ned Doyle teamed up with Maxwell Dane
to form Doyle Dane Bernbach, now DDB Worldwide, Gage joined the New
York firm as art director. He quickly made a name for himself and
won numerous industry awards for print advertising with a bold,
inventive use of typography.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would probably have to look to Toulouse-Lautrec's posters
to find another artist with as wide an influence on the printed
advertising message,'' said Phyllis Robinson, Gage's copywriter
partner for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Gage was equally skilled with photography and television,
specializing in filming commercials with characteristic quick cuts.
He directed well-known characters like Mikey and his brothers for
Life cereal, and actors like Jack Gilford, who appeared in Cracker
Jack commercials, and Laurence Olivier, in commercials for the
Polaroid SX70 camera. Another well-known campaign Gage worked on
was for the Polaroid One-Step camera; it featured commercials with
James Garner and Mariette Hartley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any single person was responsible for the creative
excellence in the early years of advertising, the years after World
War II, it was Bob Gage,'' said Roy Grace, chairman of Grace &AMP;
Rothschild, an advertising agency in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gage also hired art directors who themselves became giants in
the field: George Lois, Helmut Krone, Bill Taubin and Gene
Federico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, when the Art Directors Hall of Fame was established,
Gage was the first art director in advertising to be inducted. He
retired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gage was born on May 30, 1921, in Providence, R.I. He studied
art and design as a young man while working in a bank.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Fay, died in 1992. Besides his son, Gage is survived
by a sister, Gerry Ash of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and a grandson.

BOTTENFIELD FOCUSED, NOT FAZED BY BIG-TIME FOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kent Bottenfield is at the getting-to-know-you
stage with his new Anaheim Angels teammates, having joined the team
just a few days before it broke camp in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, acquired with Adam Kennedy from the Cardinals in
the trade for Jim Edmonds, also is getting to know the American
League, having spent his entire career before the trade in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   One perception of the AL is that there is little pitching. But
don't tell that to Bottenfield. In his first start last Tuesday, he
was matched up against the Yankees' Roger Clemens. On Sunday he
goes up against the Red Sox's Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Bottenfield said about facing Clemens and
Martinez to start his Angels career. ``I'm not pitching against
them, I'm pitching against that team's lineup. And our team can
score runs off anybody. My job is to keep the team in the game.
Those kinds of variables (the opposing pitcher) I've learned to
eliminate from my thinking so as not to affect me on game day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield admits he knew almost nothing about the Angels
before the trade, other than what he heard through the media _ no
pitching, projected for last place, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team has gotten a lot of bad press,'' he said.
``You can't go on what happened last year because of all the
injuries they had. I see a lot of good things. There's no reason
this team can't compete for the division.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ortiz ready: One day after going six innings and throwing 91
pitches in a rehab start at Lake Elsinore, Ramon Ortiz pronounced
himself fit and ready to go. Ortiz, who was diagnosed with a small
tear in his right shoulder on March 14, will start Tuesday's game
against the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy, my arm feels great,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz gave up two runs and eight hits against Single-A Rancho
Cucamonga. Why all the hits? ``Those guys swing at every pitch,''
Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Old ties: It's been more than a year since Mo Vaughn left his
hometown Boston Red Sox to sign with the Angels, but he still gets
a certain feeling playing against his old teammates. During batting
practice Friday, Vaughn got a hug from Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra and the two chatted and joked with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-area writers waited for Vaughn in the Angels
clubhouse to talk to him before the game. One of their questions
was: ``Is this home now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Home is) all over, wherever the flow is,'' said Vaughn, who
owns houses in North Easton, Mass., and Newport Beach. ``In Boston,
I have too many ties there, too many things going on. I definitely
have to be in Boston for Thanksgiving, and in Virginia (where his
parents now live) for Christmas. After that, who knows? As long as
I arrive in Arizona by February (for spring training).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Edgard Clemente, acquired in a trade from the Rockies
for two minor-leaguers March 29, got his first start Friday as the
DH. . . . Friday was GM Bill Stoneman's 56th birthday.

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ We wondered aloud what David Duval, a taciturn
guy and terrific golfer, found more difficult: staring down a
vipery Augusta National Golf Course or facing the meddlesome media
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The question seemed innocuous enough. Obvious, even. Duval
appeared to have barely broken a sweat Friday on his way to a
second-round 65 at the Masters. He blistered the back nine in a
six-under-par 30 to take a one shot lead over an illustrious field,
looking for all the world like a champion in transit.
</P>
<P>
   But a few minutes later, as he sat in front of some three dozen
reporters, Duval had the wary air of someone looking down a
pitch-black alley.
</P>
<P>
   Then came our question. The way Duval stared at us, you would
have thought we had asked if it was his child Madonna is carrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that question,'' he asked, his posture
stiffening until he was sitting dagger straight. ``What do you
mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Between his body language and his balky reaction, Duval had let
slip his answer well before the supercilious Augusta National
member acting as the moderator rephrased our question and the
golfer spit out, ``I'm sorry I don't give you a highlight reel all
the time. It's my job to give you an answer, not a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the highlight reel, we'd settle for a snippet of
civility. What Duval is too bullheaded to see is an answer and a
story become one and the same when a golfer of his talent and
determination refuses to look beyond his own discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   That Duval, 28, is an introverted person who carefully guards
his privacy is neither a shortcoming nor a big deal. Not everybody
is armed with a personality that can commandeer a room like a Tiger
Woods, an Arnold Palmer or a Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Nicklaus, 60, had nearly as fine a front nine as Duval
did a final nine. The six-time Masters champion made the turn in a
3-under 33, pulling along with him a crowd so sweeping and sonorous
it must have scared Nicklaus's putter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final nine holes, Nicklaus, by his own accounting,
missed seven makeable birdie or par putts and had to settle for a
36-hole score of even par.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus preceded Duval into the interview room and garrulously
recounted the good (four birdies), the bad (two bogeys) and the
ugly (a handful of missed putts inside five feet) of his round.
</P>
<P>
   The man who remains _ remarkably, almost incomprehensibly _ in
the hunt for his 19th professional major gave thoughtful answers to
routine questions.
</P>
<P>
   When his time was up, Nicklaus continued the interview session
out in the hallway, regaling reporters while Duval sat on the other
side of the double doors, serving up one clipped response after
another.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget, but in Duval's defense we must remember
Nicklaus wasn't always so glib. Before he joined Arnold Palmer and
Gary Player as the game's greatest ambassadors, Nicklaus was a
serious, insular 20-something locked in on greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He was not unlike Duval, warily circling a press corps that,
mirroring the public, took a while to warm to the chunky, self-
contained, supremely skilled challenger to Palmer's throne.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus wore the first of his Masters jackets, in 1963, more
comfortably than he did the spotlight that came along as an
accessory. It took time, Nicklaus said, to grow into his public
persona. ``And there wasn't as much media then as there is today,''
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was known early in his career for giving curt responses
to questions he deemed stupid. The relaxed riffs with reporters
would come later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cooperative,'' said Ron Green Sr., who covered Nicklaus
in the 1960s for The Charlotte Observer, ``but he didn't go on and
on and on. You can't hush him up now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what transcendent athletes do: They lure you to their
sport with their performance, then hook you with their
personalities. Or they lure you to their sport with their
personalities, then hook you with their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it works.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we should have to explain this to Duval. After all, he
is an avid fisherman. He said so after recovering from our
question. Fishing ``tends to relax'' him, he revealed in what was
intended, we suppose, to be an olive branch of insight.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Duval is deeper than that. He must be. Because if
he was shallow, he'd pretend to be personable and we'd be none the
wiser. &QL;

ELIAN'S REUNION WITH FATHER COULD COME NEXT WEEK, RENO SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
FIRST LEDE WRITE-THRU (to correct number of people on boat with
Elian's mother) By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno announced Friday that
Elian Gonzalez would be reunited with his father as early as next
week as she sought to put an end to a four-month political and
custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for more than an hour with Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
Reno ordered that a letter be sent to Gonzalez's Miami relatives
revoking their temporary custody of Elian. The Justice Department
would also instruct them to meet on Monday with a team of medical
experts to determine how to transfer Elian to his father's keeping
with as little disruption as possible.
</P>
<P>
   She said the meeting with two psychiatrists and a psychologist
in Miami would help determine where and when the custody transfer
would take place. But Reno indicated that she wants to see Elian in
the arms of his father within a few days of the Monday meeting,
adding that the two have been kept apart long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for this little boy, who has been through so much,
to be with his father,'' Reno declared at a news conference. She
stressed that she is confident that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is a good
father who ``obviously loves this little boy'' and is not acting as
a pawn of Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general acknowledged that once the reunion takes
place, Gonzalez will be free to take his son home to Cuba
immediately if he chooses. But she indicated that she might try to
persuade him to remain in the United States until a court appeals
process launched in the case by his Miami family has run its
course.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has captured national
and international attention since he was rescued at sea last
November. The boat he and his mother were on sank during a crossing
from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Elisabeth Brotons, who was divorced from his father,
drowned along with 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief hospital stay, Elian was placed in the temporary
custody of his Miami relatives at his father's request. But a
battle over his custody erupted when Gonzalez told immigration
officials that he wanted his son returned to him as soon as
possible. His Miami family refused to comply with immigration laws
requiring that they give him up and have since sought through
negotiations and court appeals to retain custody.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the case might drag on for months more, but
things changed dramatically on Thursday when Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
accompanied by his second wife, Nercy, and their 6-month-old baby
boy, Hianny, flew from Havana to Washington to reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from his meeting Friday with Reno and Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
Gonzalez looked relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that I will soon have my son with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the Washington attorney representing Gonzalez,
said his client was at times very emotional in the meeting as he
sought to ``convey ... the depth of his pain and his feelings, and
his love for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she was touched by Gonzalez's emotional plea, and she
sought to dispel any notion the Miami relatives may harbor that
Gonzalez can be persuaded to remain in the United States with his
son. Noting that no Cuban officials were present at the meeting,
she said Gonzalez was emphatic about his desire to return to his
homeland and bring up his family there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and respect with all my heart the deep-seated
beliefs which the Cuban exile community feels on this subject,''
she said, referring to Castro's repressive regime. ``I
wholeheartedly reject Cuba's system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general called on the Miami relatives to end their
resistance to the transfer and cooperate voluntarily and
peacefully. But she made it clear that the government would act to
enforce the immigration laws if they refuse, possibly by seeking a
federal court order to facilitate the return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A federal court ruled last month that Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle who has been taking care of Elian, must relinquish
custody. But the uncle is appealing that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his attorneys signaled Friday that he would likely comply
if he is ordered to turn over Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Linda Osberg-Braun, however, said the Miami family is
still hoping that a face-to-face meeting can be arranged with Juan
Miguel Gonzalez in ``a natural setting'' free of lawyers,
government officials and politicians so they can discuss what is in
the best interest of the child. She said Lazaro Gonzalez is not
opposed to reuniting Elian with his father; he simply wants to make
sure it is handled with as little trauma to the boy as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be done right, not fast,'' Osberg-Braun said on
NBC's ``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of establishing some sort of familial contact, two of
Juan Miguel Gonzalez's Florida relatives flew to Washington Friday
in an effort to talk with him. But they were turned away outside
the Bethesda, Md., home where Gonzalez is staying.
</P>
<P>
   Delphin Gonzalez, an uncle, told reporters through an
interpreter that he couldn't understand ``why Juan won't meet with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The two relatives said they also planned to lobby members of

Elian and his father permanent residency in the United States. The
bill would in effect give the boy and his father political asylum
and prevent their return to Cuba.

FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT NIGHT, EWING IS THE KNICKS' LIFELINE
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ All around him, Patrick Ewing's younger
teammates were fraying beneath the chaos caused by the Orlando
Magic's intensity. Although it did not seem fair to the
37-year-old, the New York Knicks grabbed onto him for the second
time in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Ewing may have looked as tattered and drenched as a
survivor crawling on the shore, but he was the perfect life
preserver for the Knicks. He held up for another 24 hours. A night
after scoring 30 points, Ewing delivered 28 points and 18 rebounds
_ including a key 3-point play with 22.3 seconds left _ to give the
Knicks an impressive road victory, 96-89.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like that Patrick was mentally tough when things were
going wrong in the fourth quarter,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy,
whose team had 21 turnovers. ``This is one of the best wins we've
had all year.''
</P>
<P>
   It came against an intense Magic team that had won seven in a
row and 11 straight at the Orlando Arena. The Knicks were able to
stay two games behind the Miami Heat, whom they will face on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing put the Knicks in position to threaten the Heat with a
10-point fourth quarter. With the Magic within 89-86, Ewing
pump-faked Pat Garrity, leaned in for a 6-foot jumper and drew the
foul.
</P>
<P>
   The instant the whistle blew, Ewing swaggered over in the
direction of Orlando coach Doc Rivers. The Knicks' center knew he
had just put an end to the Magic's fourth-quarter comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just messing with him,'' said Ewing, who was given a
long break in the third quarter to rest for the fourth-quarter
push. ``Jeff took me out. I was missing shots I wouldn't normally
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was not the only one who was struggling. In foul trouble
and out of sync, Allan Houston was 2 for 10 until the fourth
quarter, when he came up with two jumpers to help the Knicks gain a
nine-point cushion.
</P>
<P>
   That lead quickly evaporated under a 10-4 run by the Magic.
Orlando was as close as 87-86 when Latrell Sprewell, who also
struggled under relentless double teams, came up with two free
throws with 46 seconds left. Ewing did the rest. Houston finished
with 10 points and Sprewell also scored 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great admiration and respect for the way the Magic
play with heart and desire,'' Van Gundy said. ``They have good
players who play extremely hard. We knew how well we had to play to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' energy threshold for back-to-back games this season
has been dreadfully low. Just the thought of a playing the second
night in a row has been exhausting for the Knicks, who began the
night 5-11 in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it has grown to epic proportions,'' Van Gundy said.
``Just the words `back to back' means you can't practice, can't
move, can't speak and can barely breathe. Mentally, everyone is
convinced that it's harder than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic Magic was the last team the Knicks wanted to
face under the circumstances. Rivers has his band of league misfits
believing that relentless effort can trump a team of complacent
superstars on any night.
</P>
<P>
   For teams that handle the ball as carelessly as the Knicks _
with the turnover-prone Houston, Sprewell and Ewing _ the Magic's
ability to swarm the ball can be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic came out just as expected. It double-teamed and
pressed and harassed the Knicks into 12 first-half turnovers.
Darrell Armstrong irritated Charlie Ward and players like Monty
Williams and Corey Maggette shut down Sprewell and Houston.
Flustered, the Knicks' star duo combined to score just seven
first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   With their guards getting nowhere, the Knicks had no choice but
to turn to their big men. Just 24 hours after scoring 30 points to
bail the Knicks out against the Wizards, Ewing dragged his old
bones out on the floor to save his team again.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 14 first-half points, while Kurt Thomas added 10 to
give the Knicks a 47-39 halftime lead. That lead was brief. Under
the Magic's pressure, the Knicks could not get off a clean shot and
were beaten badly down the floor on the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   After surviving a 7-0 run by the Magic, the Knicks' inability to
recover in transition resulted in a lead change with 5:09 left in
the third quarter. After a miss by Ewing, the Magic pushed the ball
down the floor and Armstrong pulled up for an open 3-pointer to
give his team a 56-55 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Marcus Camby came through in the last three minutes of
the third to put the Knicks ahead, 66-63, entering the fourth
quarter. Left alone by a Magic defense focused on the Knicks'
scorers, Ward stepped up to provide some calm by hitting a
3-pointer with 2:35 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   After Ward missed on a 3-pointer the next time down the floor,
Camby popped up in the middle of a hoard of white jerseys with a
tip-in and then delivered on a runner to put the Knicks back up.

DODGERS' FRUSTRATION CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darren Dreifort walked eight, Shawn Green had the
Shea Stadium wind play him and it led to both Mets runs, and Devon
White was ejected for arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mets righty Rick Reed struck out seven in 7 innings in a
2-1 win against the Dodgers on Friday despite nearly missing the
start with a stiff neck, then pitching in pain from the fifth
inning on after he aggravated it during an at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Shall we continue? Dreifort and two relievers allowed just two
hits: Mike Piazza's windblown double and a fourth-inning single by
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   More? OK, there's the game's last play in which Dodgers catcher
Todd Hundley, still a hero in these parts, dribbled a 2-0 sinker
from Armando Benitez down the first-base line. Hundley thought the
ball crossed into foul territory before first baseman Todd Zeile
fielded it, but home-plate umpire Mike Everett thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Third out. Game over. Three-game losing streak for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it foul,'' Hundley said. ``Reed pitched a good game, but
man, it's frustrating. He just frustrates you, and then at the end
of the game (Everett) calls it fair. . . . Frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   So after two wins, 20 runs and rays of optimism everywhere,
again the Dodgers' clubhouse is solemn.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, they have dropped three in a row, and the need for
Kevin Brown to drag the Dodgers out of this minislide today is
important if they are to survive this 10-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   And Hundley, who admitted to being surprised at the quality of
Benitez's sinker, leads the frustration march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even tried to move at the last minute in case I was blocking
him (from seeing the ball),'' Hundley said. ``That ball was foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dreifort allowed just the two runs on two hits, the
walks took their toll. He was nearly untouchable when he got the
ball near the plate, but his lack of control forced him to throw 92
pitches in five innings and chased him before Matt Herges and Terry
Adams added solid relief.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort walked three batters in the first, two of whom scored,
walked a pair in the third and hit Derek Bell, walked two more in
the fourth and one in the fifth. He got out of a bases-loaded jam
in the fourth when Edgardo Alfonzo lined into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed to be out of whack and every adjustment I
made was an overadjustment,'' said Dreifort, who walked nine in a
game against Atlanta last season. ``I don't know how many guys they
had on base, but I was lucky to get out of it. It's called timely
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   This one was strange from the start for the Dodgers. Dreifort
didn't have have control problems in the spring, but he walked Jon
Nunnally to lead off the game and Alfonzo with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza hit a high fly to the warning track in right field. Green
ran parallel in front of the fence but never caught up to it. One
run scored and Robin Ventura followed with a run-scoring grounder
to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like (the wind) was blowing left to right, and the ball
went the other way,'' Green said. ``I went to where I thought it
was going to end up and it kept floating. I couldn't get to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' lone run came on Gary Sheffield's homer in the
fourth, two batters after White was ejected by Everett. It was the
first of four hits for the Dodgers. Green followed with a double,
but Eric Karros, 0 for his last 14, grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Dodgers had another chance with back-to-back
singles from Adrian Beltre and Jose Vizcaino, but Dreifort and Todd
Hollandsworth flew out to end the inning. Reed (1-0) left the game
by retiring 10 of the last 11 guys he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reed) hit his spots. He's crafty,'' Green said. ``We couldn't
get any rallies going. Nothing. Not that we had that many hits. But
every time we got somebody on, it was with two outs. The situations
weren't ideal.''

JAILED VIETNAM PROTESTER
 HOWARD MECHANIC MAIN
 TAINS INNOCENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY DENNIS WAGNER 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Florence, Ariz.) - In the first news paper interview since he
surrendered to federal agents in February, con victed Vietnam war
protester How ard Mechanic maintained his innocence and said he
does not regret spending the past 28 years as a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be let loose,'' Mechanic said today. ``There's no
doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in prison khakis, the 51-year-old inmate spoke with two
reporters at a private prison in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   He asked forgiveness from friends and political allies he
deceived in Scottsdale. He discussed a book he's writing on his
life as Gary Tredway, the Phoenix area political activist and
entrepreneur. He talked about a possible presidential pardon, and
what he'll do once he's free again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to stop working for causes I believe in,'' he
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic was convicted in connec tion of hurling a cherry bomb
at firefighters during a a May 5, 1970, anti-war demonstration at
Washing ton University, in St. Louis, Mo. When appeals failed in
1972, he was ordered to surrender for a five-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mechanic says he boarded a bus in a small Missouri town
and headed for the Southwest. He stopped in Albuquerque, but it was
so cold he climbed on another bus and continued on to Tempe, where
he began building a new life as Gary Tredway.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic worked in a Tempe natural foods store, developed a
health food business of his own, founded an automotive recycling
business and operated an apartment-motel in Scottsdale. He also
married and had a son.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic says he avoided police officers and was hounded by bad
dreams during his 28 years of hiding: ``The nightmares never really
stopped. Being hunted down and caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those fears, Mechanic said, he could not resist his
compulsion for environmentalism and political activism. Over the
years, he emerged as a leader in Scottsdale, fighting development
plans at Los Arcos Mall, writing op-ed pieces for the local
newspaper, spearheading a ``Clean Elections'' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last year, Mechanic decided to run for City Council.
</P>
<P>
   He admits it was a huge mistake seeking public office, and
issued an apology to those who supported him: ``I'm sorry I let
those people down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Mechanic said he feels bad about claiming he had
leukemia as an excuse for backing out of the council campaign when
he began to fear his identity would be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a definite mistake,'' he said. ``But I was in a corner
at that time, and felt I had to withdraw from the race. . . . I'm
sorry. I wasn't looking to get sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic said his fraudulent identity and background did not
amount to a life of lies: Instead, he portrayed himself as a
principled idealist caught in a tangled web. He begged those who
judge him to keep in mind the times and circumstances of his
criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,000 people joined the 1970 protest at Washington
Univer sity after National Guard troops killed four students at
Kent State University, and U.S. warplanes began bombing Cambodia.
Someone set fire to the ROTC building. Rocks and at least one
cherry bomb were hurled at firefighters who arrived to fight the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, a single witness claimed that he had seen a
cherry bomb fly from Mechanic's direction, and later observed
Mechanic loading a cherry bomb into a slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic, a student at Washington University, said he attended
the demonstration but did not see or touch any explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been involved in violence at all,'' he added. ``The
government perpetrated all the violence, drop ping those 500-pound
bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic was convicted anyway, and sentenced to five years in
prison. Another defendant received a sen tence of just three
months. Mechanic says he was given an ``outrageous'' punishment
because authorities wanted to use him as an example. In the
process, Mechanic said, he be came ``another victim'' of the Viet
nam war.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he regrets running from the law, Mechanic said,
``Never did. Still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he admitted there is a sense of relief now
that his charade has ended: ``That's the silver lining behind this:
I'm not going to have to tell anymore lies.''

TOURISTS BOOST ARIZONA RE
 TAILERS' BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 BY PETER CORBETT  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - A yellow bill board near Hermosillo,
Sonora, beckons motorists to cross the bor der and 250 miles of
desert to shop at Scottsdale Fashion Square.
</P>
<P>
   Mall owner Westcor pays $200 a month for the sign, but it's
money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   Well-heeled Mexican shoppers are a retailer's dream, according
to Dana Christensen, Westcor tourism direc tor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay in cash, and they don't return things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Westcor, Arizona Mills outlet mall and Biltmore Fashion Park all
are cashing in on across-the-border shopping trips. Like other U.S.
retail ers, they're recognizing the boost tourists bring to the
bottom line and are marketing their malls to foreign and domestic
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist revenue not only keeps retail ers in business but also
broadens the choices of stores for local shoppers, said Stacy
Strombeck, Arizona Mills tourism director.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe outlet mall, Biltmore and Westcor have marketing
specialists whose sole job is to lure tourists. The reason is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   When a nation of shoppers goes on vacation, it shops.
</P>
<P>
   A third of domestic travelers list shopping as their top
vacation activ ity, according to a Travel Industry Association of
America survey. That's nearly double outdoor activi ties, which is
the next highest cate gory at 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retail is starting to understand that tourism is a big part of
their business,'' Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   A LEISURE EXPERIENCE
</P>
<P>
   Retailers know travelers have more time and shopping has become
a universal leisure experience, said Da vid Fick, a retail analyst
with Legg Mason in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Mall of America in Minnesota is the most visited destination for
U.S. travelers, according to a study by the National Park Service
and ``Road Smart'' magazine. About 40 percent of its 42.5 million
annual visitors are travelers who live 150 miles or more from the
4.2 million-square-foot mall.
</P>
<P>
   Is anybody sightseeing or reading a good book on their vacation?
</P>
<P>
   Mall tourism directors say that for most tourists, shopping is a
second ary travel activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little scared of seeing this happen,'' Fick said of the
shopping craze. ``When I'm on vacation, I want to be cruising the
Mediterra nean in a sailboat.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are content cruising mall aisles and crashing through
waves of shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   `EAT, SHOP, LIE IN SUN'
</P>
<P>
   Carol Morin, a high school secretary from Norwich, Conn., came
to Phoe nix ``to eat and shop and lie in the sun,'' she said after
five hours of shopping at Arizona Mills on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Within less than 24 hours, she had lightened her wallet by about
$400 on five pairs of shoes, some shorts and Krispy Kreme
doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the time of year, Arizona Mills retailers estimate
that tourists account for 30 percent to 60 percent of their
business, Strombeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of the Fashion Park's business is from tourists,
said Bonny Ruscetti, the center's tourism market ing specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Biltmore's research shows that 84 percent of its tourist
shoppers make at least one purchase and 66 percent eat at a
restaurant, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Mills gets mosts of its non-resident visitors from
Tucson, Flagstaff and Yuma. Big out-of-state markets include
California, New York, Texas and Illinois, Strombeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign visitors flock to the Phoenix area from Canada,
Britain, Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican shoppers include those driv ing from Sonora and others
flying from Mexico City on America West and Aeromexico. Many of the
Sono ran visitors shop in Tucson, but some come to the Phoenix area
for its broader offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy travelers from southern Mexico who used to fly to
Houston and San Antonio to shop are coming to Phoenix, said Larry
Martin, sales director at Scottsdale Quality Inn &AMP; Suites.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel joined with Scottsdale Fashion Square and Arizona
Mills for a fashion show in Hermosillo in October. Shopping and
travel pack ages generated hotel business almost immediately, and
it has continued for the past seven months, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The mall tourism directors work closely with Phoenix area hotels
and resorts. They also do business with travel agents and tour
operators to offer incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are offered coupon books, mall brochures _ available in
seven languages _ and gifts like carry-on travel bags, luggage tags
and per fume samples.
</P>
<P>
   PROGRAMS FOR SPOUSES
</P>
<P>
   The malls offer spouse programs for convention travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Women traveling with their hus bands can shop while their spouse
attends a conference or plays golf. Few men show up for the
shopping excursions, Westcor's Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Westcor operates Fashion Square, Paradise Valley, Superstition
Springs, Desert Sky, Arrowhead Towne Cen ter and Flagstaff malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prime customer is female in a target age of 35 to 54,''
Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Square's shoppers overall spend an average of 1 hour, 40
minutes in the mall, visit 2.4 stores and spend an average of $81,
accord ing to Christensen.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite tourist package is a spa treatment at Nordstrom or
Dillards' day spas, lunch and shopping, she added. &QL;

   NRA SPENDING SOARS
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been pouring huge amounts of
money into the Republican Party to help it retain control of
Congress and counter new gun control legislation _ so much money
that the association now ranks as one of the party's top five
sources of so-called soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of 1999, the association has given more than
$550,000 to the Republican National Committee and to the party's
House and Senate fund-raising arms, according to a report prepared
for The Los Angeles Times by the Campaign Study Group.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that the association had donated money to
Democratic candidates and state Democratic parties in the current
campaign, but none to national Democratic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Powers, an association spokesman, said the heavy donations
were possible because of a flood of new members and money. &QL;

   VENTURA TO MEET GORE
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to meet next Wednesday in Washington with Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota. Gore, who is eagerly courting the kind of
independent voters who put Ventura in office, told the governor in
a visit to Minneapolis last month that he wanted to schedule a
second meeting in Washington and that an invitation would follow _
and it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the governor, it's obviously an opportunity to talk to the
vice president about federal priorities for the state of
Minnesota,'' said John Wodele, Ventura's spokesman, on Thursday.
Wodele demurred, however, when asked to discuss ``the politics''
that might be involved in a second meeting, if any. &QL;

benefits reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which Congress passed last month without a single
dissenting vote, repeals federal rules covering how much money
workers age 65 to 69 may receive in Social Security benefits. Under
current law these beneficiaries had their Social Security benefits
reduced by $1 for every $3 they earned over $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   In signing the measure, Clinton said that the limit placed on
earnings ``made some sense in the Great Depression when the nation
was desperate to find jobs for young workers with families and the
unemployment rate in our nation was 25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions today could hardly be more different,'' Clinton
said. ``The economy is booming, the unemployment rate is at its
lowest point in 30 years, companies desperately need more workers.
Older Americans have the skills and the experience that businesses
need.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law is retroactive to Jan. 1. It will affect some
800,000 elderly workers or beneficiaries of elderly workers this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, these workers would have forfeited more than $6
billion in benefits this year. Eliminating the ceiling on earnings
will allow beneficiaries to receive an additional $6,700 on average
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Social Security Administration said that
about 415,000 of these workers have each already earned more than
$17,000 or had officially said that they intended to earn more than
that this year.
</P>
<P>
   People who have said they expected to earn more than the $17,000
ceiling this year have already had their monthly Social Security
benefit checks reduced. Under the new law, they will have their
full benefits restored in June, and they will be sent a check in
May paying them their retroactive benefits.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 8:
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The House is preparing to vote on a bill that would permit
independent physicians to bargain collectively with health plans _
in effect to form a union _ even though they do not work for a
common employer or work together in any other way. This is a
terrible idea.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would invite doctors to form cartels, jack up prices,
boycott health plans and exploit consumers in ways that are
permitted to no other independent businessmen in the economy. The
legislation may induce physicians to pour contributions into the
campaign chests of politicians during an election year, but
patients would suffer the nasty consequences. That is why the
Consumer Federation of America, the Department of Justice, the
Federal Trade Commission and many leading antitrust authorities
oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, proposed by Tom Campbell, a California
Republican, has already sailed through the Judiciary Committee. It
would permit independent doctors to bargain collectively to
negotiate fees and working conditions with health plans. The
purpose of the bill, says Campbell, is to put doctors in a better
position to negotiate better deals when they go up against huge
health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors do not need the artificial help. Individual health plans
rarely dominate regional markets. In urban areas, a single health
plan typically accounts for less than 10 percent of patients.
Doctors can avoid doing business with a plan they do not like.
</P>
<P>
   Salaried physicians are already allowed to form unions, and tens
of thousands have already done so. What is new, and dangerous,
about the Campbell bill is that it would extend this right to
independent doctors. That would give doctors the ability to
conspire to fix prices and engage in other types of
anti-competitive behavior, such as collectively refusing to provide
services to a health plan that tries to drive a hard bargain. That
could force the health plan to succumb and guarantee that patients
would pay substantially higher prices for medical services.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious consequence will be to raise insurance premiums.
Physician unions could also be used to stymie health plans that try
to weed out doctors who practice bad medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Current laws already permit physicians to act cooperatively when
it benefits patients. Doctors can, for example, coordinate efforts
to raise standards of medical care and form networks to improve
care. By contrast, the cartels envisioned by Campbell would
victimize consumers.

EDITORIAL: PAKISTAN'S QUESTIONABLE VERDICT  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 8:
</P>
<P>
   Ousted from power in a military coup last October, former Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan has now been convicted of
hijacking a commercial airliner and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Apparently recognizing the dubious nature of the charges, a
Pakistani judge has at least spared Sharif the death penalty. His
leniency may also have been a response to President Clinton's
appeal last month to Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the coup leader, not to
execute the former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial of Sharif was itself of dubious legitimacy. It
only underscores the need for Pakistan to move more quickly to
restore democracy and rescue the integrity of its justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The trial did nothing to clear up the sequence of events leading
to the coup. Sharif was charged with barring Musharraf's plane from
landing in Pakistan when it was low on fuel, jeopardizing his life
and the lives of other passengers. But the former prime minister
denied direct involvement in the order. He also argued that, far
from trying to hurt the general, he was simply trying to block him
from plotting a military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trial judge was a civilian, he was required to take
an oath of allegiance to the military authorities before handling
the case. An earlier judge withdrew, charging that security agents
in the courtroom were trying to intimidate him. In addition, one of
the defense lawyers was mysteriously shot and killed in the streets
while the trial was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has promised an eventual restoration of democracy, but
his steps have been slow. His aim seems to be to allow elections
only after he has destroyed the leadership of Pakistan's two major
political parties. Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League, is
in disarray after the coup, and the Pakistan People's Party of
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is also in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   This is a moment of extreme volatility in Pakistan. A potential
of nuclear confrontation with India is aggravated by doubts about
the Pakistani military's relationship with terrorist groups and
insurgents in the disputed Indian state of Kashmir. Musharraf must
recognize that Pakistan's grievances against India are undercut by
continued military rule and ill-advised actions like the
prosecution of Sharif.

EDITORIAL: PEACEKEEPING IN SIERRA LEONE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 8:
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past decade the West African nation of Sierra
Leone has been riven by a vicious civil war as rebel groups
terrorized the country. Last fall the United Nations sent a
peacekeeping force to carry out a tenuous peace accord and disarm
the combatants. But in recent months rebels have ambushed and
disarmed some of the peacekeepers. In February the Security Council
nearly doubled the force, from 6,000 to 11,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The move is clearly needed, but it will benefit no one and could
damage the credibility of U.N. peacekeeping efforts elsewhere if
the troops continue to be ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council first authorized a peacekeeping force for
Sierra Leone in October to help institute a peace agreement signed
last July between the elected government of President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah and rebel forces, chiefly the Revolutionary United Front,
led by an erratic warlord named Foday Sankoh. But the rebels still
control more than a third of the countryside and frequently attack
civilians. The Security Council belatedly ordered U.N. troops to
use their weapons against the rebels to protect themselves and
civilians in their vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   One troubling element of last July's peace agreement was a broad
amnesty granted to rebel fighters for crimes committed during the
war. It allowed rebel leaders, including Sankoh, to assume
positions in government even as their followers continued to
plunder the countryside and refused to lay down their arms pending
an election scheduled for next year. The amnesty reinforces a
destructive culture of impunity and undercuts U.N. efforts in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia to hold parties to armed conflicts
accountable for war crimes. A truth commission is planned as part
of the peace accord that would at least document abuses. It
deserves Western support.
</P>
<P>
   None of the U.N.'s efforts will bring peace to Sierra Leone if
they do not also address its booming illicit trade in diamonds. As
in Angola and Congo, capturing diamond-rich regions and
participating in the black-market diamond trade are main objectives
of Sierra Leone's war. Sankoh now heads the government agency that
oversees the diamond trade, and his rebels control the diamond-rich
regions, trading diamonds for arms.
</P>
<P>
   An important dimension of the problem is neighboring Liberia.
President Charles Taylor, who helped trigger Sierra Leone's war and
backs Sankoh, has turned Liberia into a laundering site for illicit
diamonds as well as a transit corridor for weapons purchased in
exchange. By accepting Liberian diamond exports as legitimate, the
diamond industry supports this destructive trade. Unless legitimate
businesses cooperate to stop the illicit diamond trade from arming
West Africa's rebels and warlords, the best efforts of peacekeepers
are bound to fail.

EDITORIAL: DON'T VICTIMIZE THE CONSTITUTION  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 8:
</P>
<P>
   Some bad ideas keep recycling back. The latest version of the
so-called ``victims' rights amendment'' to the Constitution, a
pandering and potentially disruptive measure, is being readied for
a full Senate vote by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that victims of violent crime deserve
respect and sympathy in the criminal process, and programs to help
them recover from their trauma. But adding this amendment to the
nation's bedrock charter could alter the Constitution's delicate
balance between accuser and accused, and even end up subverting the
victims' main interest _ timely and fair prosecution and conviction
of their assailants.
</P>
<P>
   To protect victims from insensitive treatment as their cases
move through the criminal system, the amendment would establish a
new constitutional mandate that victims be notified and allowed to
participate in prosecutorial decisions and judicial proceedings.
There is widespread concern among the defense bar, the law
enforcement community and even some victims' rights groups that the
amendment would undermine defendants' rights, give rise to
litigation that delays trials and interfere with legitimate plea
bargain deals and other aspects of prosecutorial discretion. States
are already experimenting to find practical ways to address
victims' complaints, consistent with the demands on prosecutors and
constitutional protections for defendants. To the extent
improvements are needed, the answer is to pass laws to fine-tune
the system, not clutter the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's two main sponsors _ Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. _ have been busily rounding up new
co-sponsors. All are supporting an amendment that could inflict
unintended consequences on victims, the justice system and the Bill
of Rights.

immediate Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. No matter how
fractured the body politic, the collective line was consistent:
Israel must go. Now Israel appears poised to withdraw, 15 years

a race to some of the richest mineral deposits in North America.
But the boom is being felt all over the country as the search for

about this city's coming-of-age as a jazz center when the

Urban legends can travel the world by word of mouth or in print

NEWBORN ABDUCTED FROM HOSPITAL ROOM IS RESCUED HOURS LATER
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES thruout with motive and details; CHANGES byline.) 
By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 2-day-old baby girl was abducted from a bassinet in
her mother's room at University Hospital at the Downstate Medical
Center in Brooklyn Friday afternoon, but was found hours later
after an intense search by the police, who said the infant had been
taken by a 17-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   The police identified the teen-ager as Angelica Lawrence, and
said that charges of kidnapping and endangerment were being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who is severely overweight, had told friends she was
going into the hospital to have a baby. In fact, she went to the
hospital for surgery, to have her ovaries removed.
</P>
<P>
   After her surgery, she grabbed the infant and carried her out of
the hospital in a box, the police said, and displayed the baby as
her own to neighbors and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was reported missing from the mother's room shortly
before noon. The room was semiprivate, but the other bed was
unoccupied, and the mother left the infant alone while she took a
shower. When she returned, the baby was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's parents, Mitchelle Shaw Knight, 28, and her husband,
Eric Knight, 32, were distraught, said Inspector James Albert, as
the police conducted a room-to-room search through the hospital, at
445 Lenox Avenue in East New York. The police flooded the area with
officers, using bloodhounds and helicopters to aid in the search.
But it was a tip that someone wearing leopard-print leggings had
been seen carrying a baby from the hospital that led to Lawrence's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   At approximately 6:40 p.m., Lawrence returned to the hospital to
get medication she needed for her own recovery, still wearing the
leggings and her patient identification bracelet. Detective Vincent
Didonato recognized her and made the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence then directed the police to an apartment at 282 E. 35th
Street in East Flatbush, where they found the baby, Melanie. She
was taken to Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn for evaluation. The
police said she was in good health, and returned her to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   At an emotional news conference at 10 p.m. outside the pediatric
emergency room of Kings County Hospital Center, the Shaws _ who
also have a 3-year-old son _ cradled Melanie and thanked God and
the police for her safe return. ``We're basically emotionally
drained right now,'' said the father. ``We're just happy that we
have our Melanie back.'' Didonato said, ``It's a nice story with a
happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the child capped a frantic day that saw the
police and hospital officials mobilizing scores of people to carry
out the search. The baby was described as weighing 6 pounds 8
ounces and measuring 23 inches at her birth on Wednesday. She was
wearing a white diaper and a white long-sleeved shirt with buttons
and was wrapped in a blue and turquoise blanket. The parents had
not yet had a picture taken of her.
</P>
<P>
   When the mother discovered the baby was missing shortly before
noon, she notified the nurses' station. At the same time, an alarm
device activated by a sensor attached to the infant's umbilical
cord went off, sending a signal to the nurses' station on the
maternity ward and the hospital's main security office, said Brian
Kell, a spokesman for SUNY Downstate Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital guards at the building's four primary exits were
notified by radio around noon, Kell said, and hospital officers
began searching the building, and nurses on the floor checked to
see if the baby had been taken for a bath or treatment by a
pediatrician. Then, at 12:30 p.m., a telephone call was placed to
911.
</P>
<P>
   Kell could not explain how someone had gotten out of the
hospital with the baby, even though the guards had been immediately
notified and were supposed to check all people leaving the building
with an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, a woman abducted a newborn from another Brooklyn
hospital and was arrested two days later as she walked down a
street carrying the 3-day-old boy. In that case, the woman
convinced a nurse in the eighth-floor nursery of St. John's
Episcopal Hospital that she was the baby's mother.

DICKSON GIVES CRITICS PAUSE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The residents of Chatham, New Brunswick,
Canada have little access to news on the Anaheim Angels. Anaheim
pitcher Jason Dickson was one of those in the dark. And even when
he was able to find something written about the team, he never saw
his name. Talk about the team's possible starting rotation centered
on washed-up veterans and unproven rookies, but not him.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, in his first start since Aug. 8, 1998, Dickson let
his pitching speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander gave up two runs and four hits in 6 innings to
earn the win as the Angels beat the Red Sox 7-3 before 30,412 at
Edison Field. It was Dickson's first major-league win since July
12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson was supported by an offense that included a three-run
homer by Garret Anderson, a two-run double by Gary DiSarcina and a
solo homer by Troy Glaus. Heck, even Mo Vaughn stole a base, his
second steal of the season, which equals the most he's had in any
season since he got 11 in his 1995 MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   For Dickson, the win justified manager Mike Scioscia's decision
to put him in the starting rotation. But before Dickson could win
that spot, he had to show Scioscia that he had recovered from the
shoulder surgery that put him out for all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a forgotten man,'' Dickson said during spring training.
``There were a lot of articles this winter and it was like I was
nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   By no means was Dickson dominating Friday, but he made pitches
when he needed to and got the Red Sox to hit the ball at people.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson walked Trot Nixon in the first inning, but Carl Everett
hit into a double play. Troy O'Leary doubled with one out in the
second inning, but was stranded. And after Nixon led off the fourth
with a double, Dickson retired nine consecutive hitters, taking him
into the seventh with a two-hit shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson gave up a homer to Carl Everett leading off the seventh,
then two outs later gave up a double to Mike Stanley and was
replaced by Kent Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit .303 last season, but when he batted with two out
and runners in scoring position, he was hitting only .217. In the
first inning Friday, he got his first chance to hit in such a
situation and delivered with a three-run homer to right-center
field on the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Anderson had one three-run homer (Aug. 30 at
Cleveland) all season. His 21 homers in 1999 were a career-high,
and he feels he can hit more as his career advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes with maturity,'' Anderson said. ``I'm
reacting to things instead of thinking about 'em. I'm not trying to
muscle the ball out, my technique has to be there. I have a
line-drive swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm getting stronger, I don't have warning-track power
anymore. The ball is carrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had another chance to do some damage in the fifth
inning after the Angels mounted a rally. The Angels had runners on
second and third with one out, but Mo Vaughn was caught looking at
a third strike for the second out. After an intentional walk to Tim
Salmon, Anderson stepped to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who did not have a hit with the bases loaded all last
season, popped out to left field to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added to their lead in the sixth inning when Gary
DiSarcina doubled in two runs. Later in the inning, the Angels had
runners on second and third with Adam Kennedy up, and the Red Sox
decided to walk the rookie to face Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who had struck twice already, fell behind in the count
0-2 before grounding out to second and driving in the third run of
the inning for a 6-0 Angels lead.

   LOS ANGELES _ Rob who?
</P>
<P>
   No, that's Not exactly the case. But Los Angeles Kings captain
Rob Blake has missed the past three games with a bruised left knee
and defenseman Jaroslav Modry has stepped in with goals in the last
two.
</P>
<P>
   Modry, who has played just 25 games this season, gave the Kings
an early lead Friday against Dallas, scoring from the slot on the
power play after a pass by Glen Murray at the 7:06 mark of the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   Modry, who has played parts of four seasons with the Kings, also
scored the club's only goal in Thursday's 1-1 tie with the
Vancouver Canucks. Modry began his career in 1993-94 with New
Jersey and played 54 games with Ottawa in 1995-96 before joining
the Kings at the end of that season.
</P>
<P>
   He entered this season with nine career goals has five already.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great training camp but was inconsistent earlier this
year,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``He is showing us a lot during
this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: As for Blake, he hopes to play in Sunday's
regular-season finale against the Ducks in Anaheim. Blake reported
improvement skating before Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy, who has missed three weeks with a sprained right
shoulder, also is better. He also expects to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our hope,'' Murray said. ``They both want to get in
there before the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk developed back spasms between the
first and second periods and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   __ False alarm: Ninety minutes before Friday's game, Los Angeles
police and firefighters were called to the northwest parking lot at
Staples Center to check out a possible bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
   A package that eventually was found only to contain soda cans
and a T-shirt caught the attention of a Staples Center employee.
Supervisors were notified, then the fire department, who called the
bomb squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Democratic Convention here this summer, we are
trained not to take any precautions,'' said Lee Zeidman, vice
president for building operations. ``Neither are the police and
fire department. It was nothing, but it is important to check
everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ticket talk: Group and individual tickets for Kings playoff
games are available.
</P>
<P>
   The first two games of the opening round will be played in the
opponent's city. Game 3 will be played at the Staples Center,
presumably a week from Monday because the Lakers have a home game
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,200 tickets available for Game 3 and 2,000 for Game
4. Ticket info: (888) KINGS LA.

MARINERS HIT PETTITTE HARD,   THEN HOLD OFF YANKS' RALLY
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At his best, Andy Pettitte has tunnel vision, his cap
lowered to block out any glimpse of the stands, his concentration
fixed on rapidly and instinctively making his next pitch, without
reflection or review.
</P>
<P>
   When he is pitching badly, as he was Friday night, Pettitte will
seem distracted by the decisions he must make, like a tourist
debating which way to turn at an intersection. The only way
Pettitte could have appeared more confused was if he had worn a
flowered shirt and brown socks and carried a tattered map.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners, who lost 9 of 10 against the Yankees last
year, won the game, 7-5. But this year they have a patient and
efficient lineup, with good starting pitching and a good bullpen;
they are, in a sense, a poorer market's version of the Yankees, and
they played and ran aggressively Friday night, pressuring Pettitte,
who allowed seven hits, four walks and five runs in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-1) has not missed Ken Griffey Jr. yet. His
replacement in center field, Mike Cameron, scaled and reached over
the wall to take a home run away from Derek Jeter in the eighth
inning. The play, so reminiscent of Griffey, earned Cameron a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer's ninth-inning two-run homer _ his third home run
in four games _ made the final score respectable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, has lauded Jorge Posada for his
improved communication with the pitchers, but it was obvious Friday
night that the Yankees' catcher is not fully trusted by Pettitte,
who possesses perhaps the most delicate psyche of any starter on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte would sometimes pitch entire games to Joe Girardi
without shaking off any signs, nodding robotically to anything
Girardi suggested. But Pettitte struggled with his command from the
outset, and as he prepared to throw to David Bell with the count at
no balls and two strikes in the first inning, he shook off Posada
five times.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte shook off more signs and began stepping off the mound,
slowing the pace of his work; he had increased his tempo in spring
training dramatically and felt this was an important part of his
success. At one point while pitching to John Olerud in the second
inning, Pettitte shook off a sign, then stepped away from the
rubber to meet with Posada in front of the mound. When the catcher
returned to his position and signaled again, Pettitte shook him off
again. The left-hander threw 12 pitches in the third inning, and
shook off signs before nine of those.
</P>
<P>
   His control problems, and not his problems with Posada, had a
more direct effect on his performance. Placing his left fist
against his mouth for warmth before each pitch on this chilly
evening, Pettitte needed 53 pitches to get through the first two
innings, throwing about half of his pitches for strikes. Alex
Rodriguez mashed an opposite-field home run in the first inning,
and Pettitte balked home a run in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's labors, however, appeared to have an unintended
impact on John Halama, the Seattle starter. Halama threw expertly
in the first two innings, his breaking ball sharp and his control
uncanny as he fired first-pitch strikes to seven of eight batters.
</P>
<P>
   But Halama had to wait through Pettitte's miserable 28-pitch
second inning, and when he came out for the third, the crispness in
his work had disappeared. Halama threw a first-pitch ball to the
next 10 hitters. Chuck Knoblauch doubled with one out and Jeter
unloaded a two-run home run to left-center, Jeter's first home run
of the year to tie the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger, replacing the injured Scott Brosius at third,
led off the fifth by pulling a line drive into the left-field
corner for a double. Knoblauch grounded to shortstop for the first
out, failing to advance Bellinger to third, and when Jeter lined to
deep right, Bellinger tagged up and moved to third. But Bell, the
Seattle second baseman, nonchalantly took the throw from right
field and dropped the ball, and Bellinger scampered homeward and
scored with a headfirst slide, giving the Yankees a 3-2 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte collapsed in the bottom half of the inning, walking
Rodriguez and surrendering a run-scoring double to Jay Buhner. Two
batters later, Joe Oliver walloped a two-run homer to right-center.
Rodriguez drove in Seattle's sixth run with sacrifice fly, against
reliever Ramiro Mendoza.

KINGS KEEP KILLER INSTINCT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dallas Stars played it loose Friday night, but
the Los Angeles Kings had no such luxury.
</P>
<P>
   There still was the matter of a playoff opponent to determine,
even if winning means playing the mighty Detroit Red Wings in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings know maintaining momentum from an impressive
regular season might be just as important, so they took nothing for
granted in beating the Dallas Stars 3-2 in front of a sellout crowd
of 18,118 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by their first victory in 25 games against the Stars
in their last meeting, the Kings did not show the effects of
playing without Rob Blake and Ziggy Palffy, who hope to return for
Sunday's regular-season finale in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   That game also could have meant a lot since the Kings entered
Friday's action just one point ahead of Phoenix (90-89) for the
fifth spot in the Western Conference. But the Coyotes lost to San
Jose, meaning they will play Colorado in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ducks won 5-1 in Nashville on Friday, they were
eliminated when No. 8 Edmonton tied Vancouver. Now the Kings know
they are going to Anaheim with a date Thursday night in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's game sounded closer than it was. The Stars pulled their
goaltender with 1:55 left in the third period and Kirk Muller
scored his second goal of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kings coach Andy Murray had a premonition. The fiery
first-year coach allowed Fox television to put a microphone on him
during the game. In this one, there was little need for profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Murray also rested starting goaltender Stephane Fiset, who has
been spectacular in the past two weeks since returning from a groin
injury. Jamie Storr took over, but didn't get much work. He faced
just 13 shots in the first period and did not allow a goal until
Muller scored on the power play in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Murray even got the chance to use Pierre Boucher for the first
time this season. Boucher has been sidelined all year after two
foot operations. He had played the past few weeks for minor league
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings actually made it look kind of easy against the Stars,
who are winless in their last four while tuning up for their
defense of the Stanley Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jaroslav Modry, playing in place of the injured
Blake, opened the scoring with his second goal in two games. He
also had the Kings' only goal in Thursday's 1-1 tie against
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came on the power play at 7:08 of the first period on a
pass to the slot by Glen Murray with Richard Matvichuk off for
holding.
</P>
<P>
   Modry beat Stars backup goaltender Manny Fernandez, who was
playing in place of starter Ed Belfour, low to the stick side for
his fifth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made it 2-0 at the 17:13 mark of the first when Ian
Laperriere scored his ninth. Laperriere, who was elevated to the
second line when Bryan Smolinski went down with a knee injury
Monday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere, usually an enforcer with the Kings' third unit, was
parked in front when Luc Robitaille intercepted a pass from the
Stars Jamie Pushor. Robitaille fired on net and Laperriere poked it
in.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four minutes into the second period, the Kings made it
a three-goal lead with their second power-play goal of the night.
Grant Marshall was off for roughing when Karalahti scored on a
rebound shot from Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time in 17 games the Kings had two power
play goals, dating back to Feb. 23 at Calgary.

DUVAL (65) MASTERS AUGUSTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ This was billed as a major golf championship,
which the scalpers confirmed. Still, some were wondering how we
ended up with a Hooters event, then the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   But after two rounds, this Masters finally makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Someone cut off Dennis Paulson's bar tab. Someone else asked to
see Jack Nicklaus' ID.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this chaos Friday, David Duval and a star-studded
leaderboard emerged, promising a stimulating weekend of golf. Of
the 57 players who made the cut, 20 have won majors, including six
of the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is not one of those with all the hardware, but he could be
soon. He knows how to spot an opening when he sees one. Friday, the
Florida native snuck into the lead while the rest of Augusta
National was watching Nicklaus, 60, attempt to recapture his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Closing hard and fast, Duval had four birdies and an eagle over
his final seven holes. He shot the tournament's low round, a
7-under-par 65, giving him a 138 total and one-stroke lead over
three players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more comfortable,'' Duval warned.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson were one stroke back,
and Tom Lehman and Steve Jones just three behind. Of that quintet,
only Mickelson hasn't won a major, but he's an 11-time tour winner
and a considerable threat.
</P>
<P>
   Before teeing it up this week, the taciturn Duval practically
guaranteed he would be there at the end. He wasn't kidding. He was
sixth last year, runner-up the year before. He wears earth-tone
colors, but green would agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seems to be asking players what their goals are, so
I just told everybody that tournament champion is what mine is,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the group playing ahead of Duval was the 60-year-old
Nicklaus, who pulled within two shots of the lead midway through
the round. People scrambled to watch the Golden Bear play the back
nine, remembering his unlikely Masters title run in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Had his putter been more kind _ he missed what he said were
seven makeable putts over the final eight holes _ Nicklaus would
have had retirement homes emptying across the nation. Still, he
finished with a 70, good for a 144 total, leaving him six behind
Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Some players might be chortling about Nicklaus' chances at
winning a seventh Masters, but not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can beat anybody right now,'' said Jeff Sluman, who
is four shots behind Duval. ``Any time you underestimate your
opponents, that's a terrible thing to do. You can never
underestimate Jack Nicklaus.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lehman, ``That's pretty spectacular. It really shows,
besides the talent of the man, he just knows how to play this golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Still getting acquainted with Augusta National is Paulson, who
went from first-round leader to tied with Nicklaus and five others.
</P>
<P>
   The former career mini-tour player, long-drive champion and
self-professed wild man shot 76 Friday, eight strokes higher than
his first round. He bogeyed his first two holes, finding a bunker
and hitting a tree. At least he kept his anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   With a million stories to tell while reveling in the first-day
Masters spotlight, Paulson was cautioned that he might become
famous _ or at least interrupted during dinner, something his PGA
Tour peers routinely battle. By his own choosing, nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go anywhere,'' he said. ``I had a pizza and a few
beers and a bath day with my kids. I just had a regular day at the
golf course and regular night at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson probably has nothing to worry about during the rest of
his Augusta stay.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tiger Woods is still hanging around. The Masters did its
best to run him off, but he shot 72, leaving him at 147, nine
strokes behind Duval.
</P>
<P>
   He can't get his putter working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to try and play solid, and if it happens, it
happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a sprint to the finish, bet on Duval. He's become such a
fitness freak, he jogged 6{ miles after a practice round the other
day. Friday, he planned to hit the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Duval sees an advantage to this exercise overload.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Sunday afternoon, the fact I believe I'm in good shape
can pay off,'' he said. ``I'll be more refreshed than other people,
and my strength will still be high. That's the focus of why I'm
doing this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it's not the Hooters Tour or Senior circuit. How does the
Masters Ironman Triathlon sound?

VICTORIOUS DUCKS LEFT WITH HOLLOW FEELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Knowing full well they had backed themselves
into a corner, the Mighty Ducks took out some of their frustrations
on the Nashville Predators. Anaheim ruined the second-year
franchise's ``Fangtastic'' celebration with a 5-1 victory Friday
night that kept its slim playoff hopes alive _ but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ducks were flying back to Southern California, the
Vancouver Canucks outducked the Ducks. The Canucks needed a victory
in regulation to extend the suspense for themselves and the Ducks
but blew a 3-1 third- period lead and lost to Edmonton 5-4 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that has seen the Ducks blow their share of leads,
it seemed a fitting way for the Oilers to clinch a playoff spot and
turn Anaheim's season finale against the Kings on Sunday into a
meaningless exhibition for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had departed the Gaylord Entertainment Center with
hope, but at the same time they seemed to be realistic about their
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good feeling to sit around and wait for somebody
else to do your job for you,'' said Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg,
who knows the Ducks have nobody else to blame but themselves for
being in such a position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 81 games to control our own destiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nobody's fault but our own if we don't get in,'' said
Paul Kariya, who registered his third 40-goal season by scoring his
40th and 41st goals in a four-point performance that turned out to
be too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya almost seemed resigned to what was going to happen, even
moments after the game had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we showed our true colors,'' he said of a game
in which the Ducks outshot the Predators 39-29 and easily could
have scored nine or 10 times if not for some spectacular saves by
Mike Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real frustrating because you know the talent level is
there to do some good things in this league,'' Kariya added. ``But
the work effort and commitment wasn't consistently there. The scary
thing is that when it was, we beat a lot of good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they also lost to a lot of bad teams, games that
came back to haunt them Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After losing 5-2 in Chicago on Wednesday, the only way the Ducks
could even give themselves a glimmer of hope was to defeat
Nashville for the fourth consecutive time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't look good in the first 10 minutes, when the
Predators, playing their last game of the season, came out strong
and scored when Greg Johnson skated 1 laps around the Ducks'
defense before shoving a centering pass to Tom Fitzgerald, who
scored at 6:03.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly the Ducks' money players took over. Steve Rucchin
tied the game with the first of his two goals _ a one-timer on the
power at 11:33.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen seconds into the second, Kariya turned the game around
for good by scoring a shorthanded breakaway to give the Ducks a 2-1
lead. Antti Aalto gave Anaheim a 3-1 lead at 6:16 before Rucchin
scored again at 11:41. Kariya finished off the scoring with a goal
at 2:57 of the third period.

PROSECUTOR DENIES STALLING
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The prosecutor handpicked by L.A. District
Attorney Gil Garcetti to lead the LAPD corruption probe has denied
that he stalled efforts to indict rogue cops to benefit Garcetti
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a Daily News article, Head Deputy District
Attorney Dan Murphy said Friday that the decision not to indict at
least four officers in February as prosecutors had urged was his,
and not Garcetti's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the head of the prosecution team ... I will determine
when cases are ready to prosecute,'' Murphy said when questioned by
reporters after a luncheon at a downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti, who has refused repeated requests for interviews for
more than a month on how his office has handled early warnings of
police corruption and prosecution against officers, walked past the
reporters and would not respond to questions.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Daily News reported comments made by Deputy
District Attorney George Rosenstock that he and at least one other
prosecutor were thwarted in efforts to indict Rampart Division
officers after Garcetti put Murphy in charge of the task force.
Rosenstock said, when he objected, Murphy kicked him off the team
and he was assigned a lesser post in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer came a month before Garcetti was forced into a
November runoff in the primary election. Rosenstock accused Murphy
of being ``a political operative with one agenda -- to avoid any
action which might damage Mr. Garcetti's re-election chances -- not
as a professional prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Murphy said indictments will be handled
``in a professional, timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy insisted there is no truth to allegations that politics
resulted in Rosenstock's removal from the task force or were
factored into the timing of indictments.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain why Rosenstock's charges echo recent
complaints from LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks, the Public Defender's
Office, and other deputy district attorneys, Murphy said he would
not comment on the task force's prosecutorial strategies. He also
refused to predict when indictments may come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be rushed by the police chief or the Daily
News,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy added that his decision to transfer Rosenstock off the
team was based upon ``sound management decisions,'' nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy made his comments in a hallway of the Wilshire Grand
Hotel downtown where Garcetti was appearing at an awards ceremony
honoring citizen heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Following the ceremony, a spokeswoman for Garcetti indicated he
would speak to reporters after he posed for pictures with some of
the honorees.
</P>
<P>
   But when the camera shots were finished, Garcetti huddled
briefly with Murphy and Victoria Pipkin, the spokeswoman. With
Pipkin at his side and Murphy nearby, Garcetti walked by reporters,
ignoring repeated questions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rosenstock and other sources, Garcetti's political
ambitions led to a policy to delay filing charges against ``dirty
cops'' until this summer. The time was designed to allow Garcetti
to gain credit for the indictments without running the risk that
the cases would reach trial before the November election against
Head Deputy District Attorney Steve Cooley.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley, who narrowly beat Garcetti in the March 7 primary, said
Rosenstock's allegations raised serious questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garcetti, with a reputation as a passive prosecutor, tends to
see the criminal justice system through a political prism for his
own advantage,'' Cooley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any perceived attempt to obstruct the speedy administration of
justice through political manipulation, given the worst police
corruption scandal in the city's history, will backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   No officers, other than dirty-cop-turned-key-informant Rafael
Perez, have been indicted. Perez was sentenced to five years in
prison Feb. 25 for stealing about $1 million worth of cocaine from
an LAPD evidence room.

L.A. MADAM CONVICTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jody ``Babydol'' Gibson, accused of running a
call-girl ring that catered to entertainers, star athletes and
politicians, was convicted Friday on three counts of pimping, but a
jury deadlocked on four pandering charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bailiffs immediately took a visibly surprised Gibson into
custody after the judge set bail at $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys Superior Court jury deadlocked 11-1 for conviction
on three pandering counts and 10-2 on the fourth. Prosecutors
expect to announce at Gibson's sentencing on April 28 whether they
will retry her on the charges of procuring women to work for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something strong, showing she was coercing,
convincing,'' said Ronnie Berkovics, 42, of North Hollywood, a
juror who voted for acquittal on the four pandering counts. ``I
didn't see her manipulating or encouraging anything other than what
would be normal business practices in other careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, 41, faces a minimum three-year prison sentence. The
maximum is eight years, four months.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said they think the penalty is harsh, and some even
questioned whether prostitution should be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have been contributing a lot of money to the Board
of Equalization if what she had been doing was legalized,''
Berkovics said.
</P>
<P>
   But jury foreman Russell Breeding, 43, of Mission Hills, said
jurors based their deliberations on the law and the evidence before
them, not their feelings about prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the books and evidence. They sent her money. We agreed
they were all prostitutes,'' said Breeding. ``The harshness of the
penalty -- we didn't really consider that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the jury might have considered conviction on a lesser
offense if it had had that option.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's partial verdict came after nearly eight days of
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had been free on bail during the four weeks of trial and
jury deliberation, but Superior Court Judge Lloyd Nash ordered her
remanded to custody after the verdict and set bail at $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard nothing regarding any community ties. She has
every opportunity to flee the jurisdiction,'' Nash said. He also
cited the mandatory prison sentence as a reason for not letting her
go home.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting the verdicts, Gibson joked with her attorney,
Gerald Scotti, then licked her red, lipsticked lips and sat
impassively in a blue blazer, crisp white blouse and slacks while
they were read.
</P>
<P>
   She and Scotti showed no emotion, although she looked surprised
when she realized she was being taken to jail. Bailiffs handed her
watch and hair barrettes to supporters outside; they had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Scotti lashed out at the laws against
prostitution and said he might appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no real crime here,'' Scotti said. ``Everybody got
what they wanted. Everybody went away happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are draconian laws. You're putting that in the category
of serious, heinous crimes,'' he said of the verdicts and the
impending sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed dismay that none of Gibson's clients, whose
names jurors said included entertainers, political figures and at
least one professional athlete, were called to testify or have been
charged with anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a railroad case. Those customers should have been
brought in. But they can sit back safely now,'' he said. ``Why do
they all get free passes?''
</P>
<P>
   Because soliciting prostitution is a misdemeanor, Los Angeles
County Deputy District Attorney Richard Walmark said it would be up
to the City Attorney's Office to charge the men.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Gibson, an aspiring pop singer, at the Century
Plaza Hotel on June 8. They said she ran a prostitution ring by
telephone and the Internet from her home in Palo Verde near the
California-Arizona border, and also from a Van Nuys hotel, charging
up to $3,000 per encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the 10-month police investigation included Officer
Cynthia Neff posing as a woman named Taylor seeking to work for
Gibson as a prostitute. She surreptitiously recorded several
conversations with Gibson over several months. The other hold-out
juror, Tony Holguin, 54, of Studio City, said he didn't believe
Neff's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In building his case, Walmark also offered testimony from three
women who said they worked for Gibson as prostitutes. They were
given immunity for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the jury reached verdicts on three counts of
pimping, saying Gibson was employing prostitutes. But Nash sealed
those verdicts while jurors continued deliberating on the four
charges of pandering -- that she was influencing people to be
prostitutes.

MATTHEWS STUDIO GROUP IN CHAPTER 11
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Matthews Studio Equipment Group, the once-high
flying entertainment equipment supplier, has announced that it
filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court late Thursday, the
Burbank-based firm said it has assets of $55 million and debts of
$80.3 million. Other subsidiaries of the company also filed for
Chapter 11 protection Thursday, including Matthews Studio Group
Centers Inc. and Hollywood Rental Company, LLC.
</P>
<P>
   The Chapter 11 filing follows a series of blows to the firm,
including losses at its Duke City Video unit and its March 29
delisting from the Nasdaq Small-Cap Market.
</P>
<P>
   But company officials, while admitting they made mistakes in
recent months, said they remain optimistic about the company's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great company, which is very strong on cash flow and
earning potential, but our balance sheet was a little off and we
had too much debt,'' said Carlos D. DeMattos, the company's
chairman and chief executive officer. ``Through reorganization, we
hope to get those things solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews Studio stock is frozen at 94 cents a share; less than a
year ago, the stock hit an all-time high of $10.88 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old firm specializes in renting lighting, cameras
and other equipment to the entertainment industry. It went public
in 1989 and began purchasing rival firms, eventually emerging as
one of the giants in the theatrical equipment rental industry. The
company's stock rose quickly in late 1998 and early 1999, driven
largely by its launch of the ShowbizMart.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But officials say losses and heavy capital investment at Duke
City Video, a unit that Matthews Group purchased for its broadcast
equipment rental operations, has hurt the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, the company announced it was having liquidity
problems and was considering a Chapter 11 filing.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Peter Cardillo, director of research for New York-based
Westfalia Investments, said the company still has strong assets and
could do well after a reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they're going to try and survive and there's a shot
at that happening,'' Cardillo said. ``Obviously, management needs
to be changed, and I think that will come about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardillo -- who last year estimated Matthews Studio stock could
rise as high as $18 a share -- blamed the company's troubles on its
rapid expansion beyond equipment leasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost sight of their core business, which was a good
business,'' he said. ``They got in over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bret Weeks, the company's investor relations spokesman, said
the firm should recover soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a hiccup in the company's history,'' he said.
``Right now we expect to come out of Chapter 11 relatively
quickly.''

KINGS BEAT STARS
</HEADLINE>
 ... WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sometime in the third period Friday night, the
playoff tumblers started to click and the Los Angeles Kings' 3-2
victory over the Dallas Stars no longer seemed so important.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Kings still had a game to play, but they also learned
they will open the postseason Thursday night in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars, the defending Stanley Cup champions who now are
winless in four consecutive, finally got out of their lounge chairs
to make it close after pulling their goaltender with less than two
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we were watching what was happening on the scoreboard,''
Glen Murray said. ``The game kind of lost its importance out there.
Even after the first goal, they seemed to let up. It's good to
finally know where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings (38-31-12), won and Phoenix lost to San Jose, the
fifth seed was secured no matter what happens Sunday in the
regular-season finale against the Mighty Ducks in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Ducks won in Nashville, they were
eliminated, as were the Vancouver Canucks, who blew a two-goal lead
and lost in overtime to Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Kings, who could finish the season with 94 points,
this was an important game vs. a team that had a five-year unbeaten
streak against them until their last meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also scored two goals on the power play for the first
time in 17 games. And they maintained their momentum, which might
be just as important, even though most think they have little
chance against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings made the playoffs two years ago, they struggled
at the end of the regular season and were swept in four games by
St. Louis in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Now, playing well and getting players healthy is big. Captain
Rob Blake, out the past three games with a bruised left knee, and
Ziggy Palffy, sidelined three weeks with a right shoulder sprain,
will play Sunday against the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also think the play of our goaltenders is a big
difference between now and two years ago,'' Luc Robitaille said.
``(Stephane Fiset) had the night off and Jamie (Storr) stepped in
and gave us a great game. There is no substitute for hot
goaltending in the playoffs. It can change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr's only two mistakes came on goals by Kirk Muller. The
first came on the power play, the second with a six-on-five
situation after Dallas pulled its goaltender in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what Jamie did out there,'' said Kings coach Andy
Murray, who will start Fiset on Sunday and in the playoffs. ``I
think this is the first time since the beginning of the season that
we've had both guys healthy. You never know what can happen in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray might have had a premonition about Friday when the fiery
first-year coach allowed Fox television to put a microphone on him
during the game. In this one, there was little need for profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Murray even got the chance to use Pierre Boucher for the first
time this season. Boucher has been sidelined all year after two
foot operations. He had played the past few weeks for minor-league
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings actually made it look kind of easy against the Stars,
who are winless in their last four while tuning up for their
defense of the Stanley Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jaroslav Modry, playing in place of the injured
Blake, opened the scoring with his second goal in two games. He
also had the Kings' only goal in Thursday's 1-1 tie against
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made it 2-0 at the 17:13 mark of the first when Ian
Laperriere scored his ninth. Laperriere, who was elevated to the
second line when Bryan Smolinski went down with a knee injury
Monday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure feels good,'' Laperriere said. ``We're ready.''

MARINERS SHOW YANKEES ALL WITH CLUTCH HITS, PLAYS, PITCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The times, they are a-changing.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe it, then you haven't watched the Seattle
Mariners during the first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners dusted off the Boston Red Sox twice in three games
to begin the season, then came back and opened a set with New York
with a powerful performance in a 7-5 victory Friday night that
showed the breadth of the M's ability to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new year and a new season,'' winning pitcher John
Halama said. ``We're anxious to get on a roll and get some sense of
ourselves as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to realize what everybody's capable of, and
we're starting to jell.''
</P>
<P>
   The win, the third in a row for the M's, contained some of the
key elements of the two earlier wins.
</P>
<P>
   There was the usual classically inspired relief pitching from
Kazuhiro Sasaki _ when's the last time a Mariners team could take
that as a given? _ and one seriously clutch tie-breaking homer from
Joe Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a homer-stealing catch from center fielder Mike
Cameron in the eighth inning that helped blunt the Yankees'
comeback effort. The leaping catch was such a winner that much of
the crowd of 40,827 gave Cameron a standing ovation in the bottom
of the eighth inning _ after he'd struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, these aren't the
lay-down-and-lose-when-the-Beasts-of-the-East-come-calling
Mariners. Seattle lost 16 of 20 games to the Red Sox and Yankees
last year, but you can consider it a done deal that two of the best
teams in baseball have had all they can handle from the Safeco
samurai.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans have been voting with their voices, making an
impact with the sheer volume of their cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are into it,'' manager Lou Piniella said, simply.
``It's just four games, but they've been into the four games. It's
been electric, and when you're playing New York it's always going
to be a little more electric.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver provided the biggest offensive infusion of energy with a
first-pitch, two-run homer that came moments after a game-tying
fifth-inning double by Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's cannonade into the right-field seats broke the backs of
the Yankees, who had erased an early 2-0 Seattle lead to take a 3-2
lead in the top of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver is a take-it-as-it-comes guy, but he showed real emotion
while the crowd was doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping for a double,'' Oliver said. ``When it went
over the fence, that was special. I don't think I've ever shown
that kind of emotion on a homer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Oliver, it was vindication of a long winter of work that got
him back to the major leagues after an agonizing season at Triple-A
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners, the night was vindication of the moves that
the club made to shore up the 1999 product.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the holdover Mariners didn't have their
moments on center stage Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez hit his 150th career homer, tying the Mickey
Mantle for the fourth-youngest player to get to 150 home runs.
Halama pitched six strong innings, didn't walk anyone and allowed
three runs, just two of them earned. Jose Paniagua and Paul Abbott
each threw a strong inning of relief.
</P>
<P>
   But the new kids on the block, led by Oliver, stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Mark McLemore entered the game late and engineered two
rallies that pushed the lead to four runs at one point, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki took over after a Shane Spencer homer in the ninth cut
the Yankees' deficit to 7-5 and got three quick outs for his second
consecutive save.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Cameron who made what he called ``maybe my
best catch ever'' to take away Derek Jeter's bid for a homer.
</P>
<P>
   The center fielder, who has heard so much about how Ken Griffey
Jr. played center, dropped a defensive bomb on the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron did an Sir Edmund Hillary vs. Mount Everest thing to
bring back Jeter's blast, scaling the wall to pull the ball back
into play for the inning's second out, showing a little snowcone as
he held up evidence of his handiwork for the umpire's _ and the
crowd's _ inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made it the best was the standing ovation,'' Cameron
said. ``It was so loud I couldn't hear myself think.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said Cameron's catch was
``Junior-esque stuff out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still the catch didn't end the game. Spencer's homer showed the
Yankees' determination to get back in the game. But not this time.
The Mariners are playing the final few innings of games with a
confidence unknown to recent Seattle clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The glue has been Sasaki, who was pitching for the third time in
three nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to have to use him again,'' Piniella said. ``But
he came in and did the same thing he's done every time we've used
him. He gets outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The last one, a swinging strike by Ricky Ledee, moved the
Mariners to 3-1, the best record in the West less than a week into
the season.
</P>
<P>
   That may not seem like much, but that record has been carved out
against teams that victimized the Mariners repeatedly a year ago.

BUSH REJECTS GOV. WILSON'S POLITICS
</HEADLINE>

By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reaching out for California's growing Latino vote,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush repudiated Proposition 187 and the wedge
politics of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the National Hispanic Women's Conference in Los
Angeles &UR;  &LR; on Friday, Bush never mentioned Wilson by name but said
issues such as Proposition 187, which would have curtailed most of
California's social services for illegal immigrants and their
children, were divisive and destructive.
</P>
<P>
   '`It's so important to have leadership that tears down barriers,
leadership that offers a future hopeful for everybody, leaders who
reject the politics of pitting one group of people against each
other,'' Bush told the meeting at the Biltmore Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not use our children, the children of immigrants, as a
political issue. There are no second-rate children in my vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was unavailable for comment, but his spokesman, Sean
Walsh, said the former governor has much in common with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Wilson shares Gov. Bush's sentiments and agrees with the
comment about why illegal aliens come to this country,'' Walsh
said. ``But we make no apologies for seeking to have the federal
government reimburse California for the costs of illegal aliens.
There, we have a legitimate policy disagreement with Gov. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to face Democrat
Vice President Al Gore, spent most of his speech emphasizing the
need for accountability in education through testing and for
national reforms to make the educational system respond to the
needs of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of government is not to create wealth, it's to create
opportunity,'' Bush said, occasionally addressing the crowd of some
1,000 women in Spanish. ``We don't want people to feel left behind
... in the pursuit of the American dream. This country belongs to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made it clear he intends to campaign vigorously in
California and believes he has a chance to carry the state in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Critical to his strategy is the mending of GOP's relations with
Latino voters and others who saw Wilson's support for Proposition
187 in 1994 as a direct attack on the state's large immigrant
population.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 187, which won 60 percent of the vote in 1994, was
intended to limit public education, welfare and health services to
illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer ruled
most of the initiative was unconstitutional, in part because it
entered the jurisdiction of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis abandoned the legal battle in
negotiating a settlement with opponents that left in little more
than provisions that had become federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush talked briefly about immigration issues,
saying the United States has to work to promote the economy of
Mexico and other Latin American countries to reduce people's need
to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River,'' Bush
said. ``If you're a mother or dad and you're worried about feeding
your children and you can't find work close to home and you hear of
opportunities somewhere else and you're worth your salt, you're
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Texas governor's second major address to Latinos in
California. Earlier in his campaign, Bush made his first major
policy address before a Latino business group.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference and in a meeting with California political
reporters, Bush said he intends to win the state and its 54
electoral votes by attracting new voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a rumor going around that somehow I'm not going
to compete in California,'' Bush said. ``That's wishful thinking on
the part of Al Gore. I plan to campaign in California, and I think
we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will return to the state in May and June and plans
an extensive campaign in the state during the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be making the mistakes of 1992 or 1996,'' Bush
said, referring to the lackluster campaigns in the state by his
father, former President Bush, and by former Sen. Robert Dole, the
GOP's '96 nominee.
</P>
<P>
   California has gone Democratic in the past eight years, a trend
capped last year by a near sweep of statewide offices. President
Clinton and Gore have spent a great deal of their time in the state
to try to solidify Democratic support. The party will hold its
national convention in Los Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged his party's problems in the state, thanks to
its positions on such divisive issues as illegal immigration,
affirmative action and bilingual education, as well as the
difficulty of convincing GOP regulars of the need to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in politics, you have to alienate people to
expand,'' Bush said. ``If some people are alienated by me reaching
out to new voters, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   While not rejecting the support of Wilson -- ``I welcome
everyone's support,'' Bush said -- he indicated he would be taking
a different approach to California politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican Party has somehow gotten the image we
are not mindful of the concerns of new Americans,'' Bush said.
``We've got to do a better job. Our party -- our candidate, me --
has to do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been running an independent advertising campaign for
Bush, which the likely nominee said he has not seen and is not sure
is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had someone in Texas running some independent ads and I
think they hurt more than they helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Bush continued to say that the case of Elian
Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who has been the subject of
international attention, should be decided in family court in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach angers many in the Mexican-American community
who have seen their own families deported or the issuance of green
cards delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he understood the difficulty, but that the Gonzalez
case was a unique situation and needed to be handled differently.

WAIT-AND-SEE MARINERS FANS ARE SEEING VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When you think of the most famous play in the most
intense Mariners-Yankees contest, when a runner scored all the way
from first base on a smash double, what do you think of?
</P>
<P>
   Right: Ken Griffey Jr. hitting the afterburners on Edgar
Martinez's double into the left-field corner in Game 5 of the
American League Division Series in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to history buffs, but that doesn't quite cut it
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A new era is being built at Safeco Field during this already
heady opening homestand week. Four games in, and the Mariners are
putting a new spin on things.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to start a new tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Mariners downloaded a 2000 version of the old
Yankee killer.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fifth, Jay Buhner rapped a double down the
left-field line, and a new Mariner king _ Alex Rodriguez _ went
flying around the bases to score, tying the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The good ol' Mighty Mariner karma was up and running. Joe Oliver
followed Buhner's RBI double with a two-run homer, giving the
Mariners a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the strangest thing in Mariner history took place.
</P>
<P>
   All across the Puget Sound, all across the state of Washington,
up into Alaska and over into Idaho and down past the Columbia River
into Oregon, Mariner fans started looking forward to seeing
Seattle's bullpen get into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Please bring back Arthur Rhodes and Kazuhiro Sasaki. Pretty
please?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lou Piniella called on Sasaki, after Paul Abbott
gave up a two-run homer in the ninth, and all was saved in the 7-5
win as Sasaki's Daimajin ``evil spirit-killer'' aura was elevated
yet another level.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even touched upon the snow-cone grab by Mike
Cameron _ the one that pulled back a Derek Jeter bomb over the
center-field wall and gave Cameron the ear-ringing welcome he
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Did that play look familiar or what? A speed demon getting on
his horse, racing to the warning track and scaling the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Cameron said after the game, pointing down to his
cleats. ``Those are Ken Griffey Jr. ``Swingman'' shoes I was
wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The number on Cameron's back is different, 44 instead of 24, but
the heart, the desire and the athletic ability can't be
second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' whopping opening homestand was supposed to be a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to start off with the heavy hitters from Boston and
New York. Bring in the fans. Give Safeco Field a
center-of-the-universe feel.
</P>
<P>
   But something funny happened at the ballpark Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz created by two impressive victories over the Red Sox
has already jump-started those wait-and-see fans to stand up and
take notice of these 2000 Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance Friday was 40,827, with about 3,000 of those walk-up
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if the Sonics would have liked that kind of last-minute
interest?
</P>
<P>
   The odd consequence of this encouraging start is that it seems
less important that this is a Mariners-Yankees series.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a case could be made that a Mariners-Yankees series at
Safeco would have been better in May or early June, so that by
then, if these winning Mariners continue in this fashion, Seattle
fans will be drooling in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Marinerville is playing catch-up. It's getting a
crash course in how the new Howard Lincoln/Pat Gillick,
win-in-Safeco with pitching, defense and hit-and-runs team really
works.
</P>
<P>
   More important than renewing the Yankee rivalry is the work that
citizens of Marinerville have to do to crystallize this team in our
collective baseball consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   People are catching on. Players are making an impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't hear myself thinking,'' Cameron said after the
standing ovation continued through his at-bat in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a few goosebumps, but I'll tell you what, it's nice to
be rewarded for something you work hard on every day. I just tried
to get up as high as I can and get it. I knew it was coming down
into the tip of my glove, and I tried to snatch it before it went
back over the fence,'' Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that a team with so many new parts can come
together so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why not,'' Mark McLemore said. ``Why wait until
June?''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who was 0-for-4 in his first game as a Mariner, has
now reached base in nine of his past 11 at-bats. That included a
walk and a single Friday after McLemore replaced Charles Gipson in
the sixth. McLemore scored both times, proving he knows how to find
home plate.
</P>
<P>
   This is why McLemore is a catalyst. This is why McLemore is
here. This is why Gillick took a plane ride to talk to the former
Texas Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore won three AL West Division titles with Texas, or should
we say: McLemore was a big reason why the Rangers won, since he was
on base for all those Juan Gonzalez RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come to a team that had a chance to win,''
McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win. That's what this team is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about winning _ and winning back the wait-and-see citizens
of Marinerville, who don't have much reason to wait any longer.

THE BEATINGS GO ON FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Michael Vega
</P>
<P>
   Globe Staff
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting that, in game No. 76 of this torture test of
a season, the Celtics ran their losing streak to 10 with an
abominable 102-97 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers Friday. Maybe
Celtics fans should start calling the NBA team from Philly the
``Deep Sixers'' for the myriad ways it has buried Boston this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Before a FleetCenter crowd of 18,342, the playoff-bound Sixers _
er, Deep Sixers _ allowed Boston to get off to a sizzling start. In
the first half, the Celtics scored 60 points on 24-for-48 shooting
from the field, 4 of 7 from 3-point range, while holding Allen
Iverson to just 7 points on 3-for-5 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But, like in so many other games the Celtics have lost during
this skein, Boston's hopes for a victory were dashed in the second
half, particularly the fourth quarter. The Celtics led by as many
as 11 in the second quarter before settling for a 60-55 halftime
lead. Thrice in the third they increased that margin to 9 (74-65,
76-67, and 78-69) before squandering it by scoring just 37 points
on a putrid 14-for-44 shooting performance in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds ticked away, a pair of loud fans tried to
take out their frustration on coach Rick Pitino with derisive
taunts of ``We love you, Rick! We hope you come back, Rick!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's very frustrating,'' Pitino surmised. ``There are
a lot of things that I like that I see, so I can look at the
negative or I can look at the postive. And, at times like these,
you have to look at the positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Celtic fans, you knew he would say that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only salvation you have,'' Pitino said. ``I do want
to thank the fans again. The fans have been wonderful to us. As you
look around the league, you don't see the support we are getting
for a team that's not winning. And that's wonderful from the
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, the Celtics failed to send their fans home feeling
warm and fuzzy, instead subjecting them to another numbing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson, though, did his best to put a halt to the
mounting losses. He scored a game-high 28 points on 8-for-16
shooting from the field and 8 of 8 from the foul line. He also had
6 assists, 5 rebounds, and 3 steals. Paul Pierce added 18 (6 for
13) and Antoine Walker had 16 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3
blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the losing has begun to wear on the team, Walker said,
``To be honest, it does wear on us. It wears on you mentally as
well as physically, because it's very hard to get your body ready
to play each game emotionally and to understand the game plan. You
play good for three quarters and things don't work out, that's part
of being a professional. You've got to somehow find a way to get a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite hitting just 8 of 24 field goals in the third, the
Celtics still managed to control an 80-78 lead. Matt Geiger, who
came off the bench to lead the Sixers with 20 points, shaved a
6-point Boston lead to 2 with a 4-point tear in the final 55.3
seconds of the third when he threw down a slam dunk and hit a
7-foot lane jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geiger has hurt us in two games,'' Pitino said. ``We do a very
good job on Iverson (who had been held to a mere 2 points on
1-for-5 shooting through three quarters), but you get hurt a bit in
the frontcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiger hit a foul-line jumper to tie it, 80-80, with 11:43 left,
but Dana Barros answered with a jumper and Danny Fortson followed
with a strong layup in the lane to make it 84-80. Philly came back
to tie it on an Aaron McKie jumper and a pair of free throws by
Toni Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
   McKie then gave the Sixers their first lead since 10-9 when he
scored a foul-inducing basket underneath to make it 86-84, but
missed the accompanying free throw. Kukoc missed a technical called
against Walker, but McKie atoned when he hit a jumper to make it a
4-point game. Walker responded with a timely trey that pulled the
Celtics within 1, 88-87, with 6:54 left.
</P>
<P>
   That's as close as Boston got. The Sixers twice went on to lead
by 9, the last time at 100-91. And referee Ken Mauer teed up his
fourth player of the game when he got Anderson with 3:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, it was apparent the Celtics had been deep-sixed
again.

THIRD RED SOX LOSS BRINGS THOUGHTS OF PEDRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angels 7 Red Sox 3
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Nation no doubt is restless. Four games into this
season of great expectation, the Red Sox are wounded, wobbling, and
waiting for Pedro Martinez to provide some emotional rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox dropped their third straight Friday, a 7-3 decision to
the Anaheim Angels. It's way too early to worry, but that won't
stop the Nation from wondering when someone other than Pedro will
win a game for the wild-card wonders of 1999. Brian Rose gets the
ball Saturday. Pedro Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going to get better, gentlemen,'' Sox manager Jimy
Williams promised after the game. ``They really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran first baseman Mike Stanley said, ``A hundred and
fifty-eight to go. We need to get our game back on track. You can't
keep saying it's a long season forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, who's struggling at .188, said, ``We're just
not in synch. We've got to go out and get some runs so pitchers
feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is all about the long haul, and it's nutty to draw
conclusions from four games, but the Sox find themselves in search
of better pitching (21 runs, 21 walks, and 7 homers yielded in the
last three games), more timely hitting, and tighter defense than
they've shown since Pedro's impressive opener.
</P>
<P>
   Boston got homers from Carl Everett and Brian Daubach in Game 4,
but it couldn't offset the two-homer, nine-hit barrage off Pete
Schourek and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek gave the Sox five serviceable innings, yielding three
runs on four hits and four walks while striking out four. He threw
74 pitches, 45 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I threw all right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Schourek's first Sox start since the infamous fourth game
of the 1998 Division Series when Red Sox manager Jimy Williams
defied logic and went with the journeyman lefty over Pedro (who
would have been working on three days rest) when the Sox were on
the brink of elimination. Schourek made Jimy look good that night,
spinning 5.1 innings of two-hit, shutout ball, but the Red Sox lost
anyway and Pedro went home mad.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Schourek surrendered a first-inning, one-out double to
Adam Kennedy, then walked cleanup man Tim Salmon after fanning Mo
Vaughn for the second out. Center fielder Garret Anderson turned on
the next pitch and drove it over the wall in right-center for a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'd like to have that pitch back,'' said Schourek.
``After that I felt I threw better. I didn't throw poorly in the
first, I just made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek settled down after the three-run bomb, but it was
pretty clear he needs work on his slide step. Kennedy stole third
without drawing a throw in the first, and Vaughn stole second in
the same manner in the third. It was Vaughn's second steal of the
season. He did not steal a base in 1998 or 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, continued to struggle at the plate.
Boston scored only seven runs in three games in Seattle (four on
solo homers), and the immortal Jason Dickson had them in knots
early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had Trot Nixon batting second in place of John Valentin
(sore left knee). Stanley was designated hitter, Daubach played
first, Scott Hatteberg made his first start behind the plate, and
Jeff Frye started at third in place of Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' first good chance to score came when Nixon led with a
double in the fifth and went to third on a right-side ground out by
Everett. With Nixon on third and one out, Garciaparra popped up,
failing to get the run home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy on third, one out, that's not our team,'' said a disgusted
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary flied out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   It got a little ugly in the bottom of the sixth. Rich Garces
came on for Schourek and quickly surrendered two singles and a
two-run double to Billerica's Gary DiSarcina. The Sox infield
continued to struggle and a Vaughn grounder to Jose Offerman drove
home the third run of the inning to make it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox fought back with three in the seventh. Everett started
the rally with a solo homer on an 0-and-2 pitch to start the
inning. After a double by Stanley, old friend Kent Mercker relieved
Dickson, and Daubach greeted Mercker with a long homer to right to
cut the lead to 6-3. It was Daubach's third homer of the young
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield came on to pitch the bottom of the seventh and
surrendered a solo homer to Troy Glaus on a 1-and-2 pitch. That was
the end of the scoring for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be OK,'' said Garciaparra. ``We've just got to create
more opportunities and capitalize on 'em.''

   TOKYO _ For all the attention that has surrounded the stroke
that toppled Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi from power, the change at
the nominal helm of the country with the world's second-largest
economy has little real import.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese people have long been aware of that. ``Whoever
becomes prime minister, it doesn't change anything,'' said Junko
Ota, a 39-year-old housewife shopping in Ginza the other day.
``That's what's sad about Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Her observation contains a truth that the rest of the world has
yet to acknowledge about Japan, despite the efforts of many
scholars and observers to explain it: political leadership in Japan
has always been more irrelevant than in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been suffering from the fact that there is no one
ultimately responsible to the people at large and to foreign
governments and leaders and international organizations,'' said
Hidekazu Kawai, a professor at Gakushuin University. ``The nominal
leader is not always the strongest man, and no one man is strong
enough to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, how poorly the economy has been managed in
the last decade. The buck does not stop at the prime minister's
desk, nor on any one person's desk. Decisions are made by a
consortium of business associations, government bureaucracies and
groups of politicians. No individual can be held responsible nor
can any one take credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders do not matter in modern Japan, where situations are
managed collectively, not by an individual,'' said William R.
Farrell, head of a business consultancy, Dynamic Strategies Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many political figures wield power in Japan, like
former Prime Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa, Yasuhiro Nakasone and even
Noboru Takeshita, who has been bed-ridden with undisclosed medical
problems for almost a year. Obuchi, as head of the largest faction
in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was powerful. And Hiromu
Nonaka, now No. 2 in the new government, is considered by many to
be Japan's most powerful man.
</P>
<P>
   But in the West, that very phrase _ ``Japan's most powerful
man'' _ more often clouds an understanding of Japan's power
structure than clarifies it. None of these men has the power to
make decisions or prescribe policy on his own, and as Japan is
increasingly forced to stitch itself into the global economy, that
is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state, whatever definition you use, has a core to its
identity,'' said Karel Van Wolferen, author of ``The Enigma of
Japanese Power,'' perhaps the seminal book on the Japanese power
structure. ``Here you have federations of bureaucratic bodies, both
business and government, determining policy, and groups of
politicians play a role in that. But there is no such thing as a
center of political accountability.``
</P>
<P>
   So the question arises: who is the opposite number to the U.S.
president or the British prime minister? To whom should concerns
and requests be addressed? From whom can commitments be extracted?
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties manifest themselves in several ways. Most
recently, the United States and Japan have squared off over the
deregulation of Japan's telecommunications market. No one denies
that in 1998 Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto promised President
Clinton that Japan would dramatically lower the fees the former
government telephone monopoly charges competitors for connecting
their customers to its customers. But the government has simply
ignored the promise, illustrating how little power a prime minister
really has here.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a home health care program for the elderly that was
one of Obuchi's biggest accomplishments was watered down by
Parliament at the demand of a group of politicians led by Shizuka
Kamei, who heads the second-largest faction within the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmented nature of the ruling party, which is really a
confederation of five or more factions, is partly responsible for
the prime minister's weakness. Unlike the British prime minister,
the Japanese prime minister must horse trade to win as much support
from various factions as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Yoshiro Mori, the new prime minister, was chosen by party
elders who valued his good relationship with the ruling party's
coalition partner, the Komei Party, rather than his leadership
skills or vision.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister ``is not strong enough to control the whole
party,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political science professor at
Tokyo University. ``He controls the party in cooperation with the
leaders of the factions and the party elders, but not on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Many suggest that a colorless figurehead is all the Japanese
people want, and that a real leader would mesh poorly with the
country's desire for stability and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of laws were adopted last year with the intention
of giving more power to the prime minister and his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   One was a freedom of information law that, although weak by U.S.
standards, greatly enhances transparency here.
</P>
<P>
   The public has also been treated to a somewhat stiff version of
prime minister's question time, during which for the first time
cabinet officials have been forced to stand up in Parliament and
submit to questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of things tend to keep people focused on the prime
minister as the person in charge, the person who's responsible, and
that's a big change,'' Kawai said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, people who live in Tokyo have begun confessing a
liking for Shintaro Ishihara, the capital's governor, who has
implemented several policies to improve the city's badly ailing
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Abrasive, outspoken and opinionated, Ishihara is precisely the
kind of politician urbanized Japanese voters have long shunned. Yet
last week, several people wished aloud that someone like him were
on hand to replace Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Yoichi Masozue, a political commentator who ran against Ishihara
in the gubernatorial election, suggests one reason for his rival's
popularity: ``The governors of the prefectures, like Ishihara, are
directly elected by the people. They thus enjoy a more powerful
leadership and legitimacy that way, and in a time of globalization,
we need strong leaders with quick responses.''

   TOKYO _ For all the attention that has surrounded the stroke
that toppled Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi from power, the change at
the nominal helm of the country with the world's second-largest
economy has little real import.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese people have long been aware of that. ``Whoever

   PARIS _ On both sides of the English channel the treachery made
the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   Barely six months after she was chosen as the model for the bust
of Marianne, France's curvaceous national symbol, Laetitia Casta
was rhapsodizing about the benefits of living in London.
</P>
<P>
   The young supermodel talked of a diverse, lively city. But
everyone else suspected tax benefits, setting off a political
fistfight among French politicians and a cross-channel flow of
snide remarks that are so often the stuff of French-British
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The British press made sure to mention that Casta was only one
of 150,000 French citizens who had moved to Britain since 1995 _
presumably lured by less red tape and a tax rate that at 37.6
percent is the lowest in the European Union after Spain and
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The French, however, let it be known that the London subway was
crowded and dirty, apartment rents were high, and should the
21-year-old Casta fall ill, British hospitals would not be nearly
as fine as the French ones.
</P>
<P>
   The French newspaper Le Monde wondered why _ apart from money _
any sensible French person would ever move to England. The health
system is a disaster, the trains are barely any better, the unions
cannot protect their workers, and the poor are paid peanuts.
England is an exquisite paradise indeed, huffed the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could one doubt the fury of the Association of French
Mayors, which choose Casta to be Marianne, facing down a barrage of
criticism that the mostly male group was simply running a beauty
contest. Some critics had suggested that a more accomplished woman
should be chosen to represent the modern Marianne, a figure that
emerged from the French Revolution to symbolize the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Marianne _ a kind of Uncle Sam figure _ has
evolved from a 1794 version in which she is helmeted like a Greek
goddess to the flag-waving, rifle-toting revolutionary of 1830
depicted in Delacroix's ``Liberty Leading the People,'' to busts
modeled on Catherine Deneuve and Brigitte Bardot.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, Casta appeared at the unveiling of the bust
based on her pouty good looks. But the news of her flirtation with
London had some French mayors swearing that her statue would never
appear in their city halls.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Delevoye, the president of the 36,000-member mayors'
association, lashed out at her defection. ``All we can say is that
we hope everyone who has been formed in France, supported by
France, educated in France, will also decide to pay their taxes in
France,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With tax reform an issue before Parliament now, Casta's rented
apartment near Covent Gardens offered a soap box opposition
politicians could not resist. ``This symbolizes magnificently the
failure of socialism, which succeeds in chasing away all talented
people,'' proclaimed Patrick Devedjian, the spokesman for France's
Rally for the Republic party. ``The tax burden in France is
suffocating.''
</P>
<P>
   After several days of silence, Casta on Tuesday denied that she
was making London her primary residence, though tax experts
estimated that she could cut her tax bill by 30 percent to 40
percent by doing so. France taxes models much more than other
countries because they are classified as salaried employees of
modeling agencies rather than freelancers.
</P>
<P>
   Her agent issued a statement saying: ``In reply to the false
information that has appeared in certain European media this
weekend, we are keen to re-establish the truth over a certain
number of errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement added that Casta ``does not plan to buy an
apartment in London'' and ``has not decided to settle there for tax
reasons.''

LITTLE HAVANA: CUBA'S EXILES FROM BOTH SIDES OF A GREAT DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:
47-42-80-44). Latin American points: contact the Los Angeles office

 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This city of Cuban exiles has never been known for
restraint and moderation; there are too many people drinking too
much Cuban coffee, too many conspiracies to untangle, too much
frustration bottled up for too many years.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Cuban exodus started 40 years ago, Miami has been
a place apart, a city floating in some sort of ether, removed from
the rest of the country. Where else do people trade rumors of Fidel
Castro's impending death _ ``Did you notice how gaunt he looks? Did
you hear he had a stroke?'' _ the way others swap stock tips? Where
else are 4-year-olds spooked not by the bogyman in the closet but
by a bearded giant in olive green fatigues living across the
Florida Straits?
</P>
<P>
   I knew all of this long before I set foot outside the house of
Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle in Little Havana, a notebook in my
back pocket, a couple of weeks ago. I was born here, to
credentialed anti-communist parents; my father was a pilot who flew
missions into the Congo for the CIA to root out leftist insurgents
in the '60s; my mother has not set foot back on Cuban soil since
1961, when she and my siblings left Havana. She won't go back, not
while the ``devil'' remains alive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even I was unprepared for the fervor outside of Lazaro
Gonzalez's home, four months after little Elian was picked up at
sea. Maybe I had been gone too long. You grow up, you leave Miami
and you begin to see that things are not always so black and white.
That in places like Iowa, people can go years without even thinking
about Cuba, unless they like cigars. Or that they can question the
wisdom of the United States trying to overthrow Fidel Castro, even
though they share the Cuban exiles' contempt for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly midnight when I arrived in Little Havana, and the
block of modest, concrete houses, awash in television lights, was
teeming with people standing behind the barricades that separate
the crowd from the house. People waved signs with Elian's picture.
They likened him to baby Jesus. One man chanted the rosary into a
megaphone, leading a small group in prayer. Several women stood on
the front lines, waiting to steal a glance of the little boy behind
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was edgy, suspicious. The word was that a federal SWAT
team was ready to swoop in and steal Elian away, and that his Cuban
exile ``protectors'' were girding for confrontation. So when a
group of college students showed up to snap photographs and shout
down the demonstrators, the crowd went berserk, and somehow I (my
press pass buried deep inside my purse) got pegged as one of the
provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comunista,'' they shouted, spit flying, fingers jabbing at my
face. The group started looking more like a mob, and for a minute,
I thought about calling over one of the cops, who was attending to
the college students. ``There is another one here,'' one woman
yelled, motioning the rest of the crowd over my way. Spying my
close-cropped hair, another woman shouted, ``lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   I found myself cringing, not out of fear but out of exasperation
and embarrassment _ for them, not myself. After I finally dug out
my press pass and got down to the business of interviewing people,
I couldn't help but think, ``Is it any wonder the rest of America
thinks that Cubans in Miami are zealots?''
</P>
<P>
   As an outsider, who is also an insider, I could understand why
they would think so. Most Americans, polls show, think that Elian
belongs with his father _ that blood is thicker than Marxism. Most
Americans also seem to think that Cubans in Miami, who are not
known for their tolerance, have received enough largesse. Haven't
they reshaped Miami in their own image?
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans, I know from my own experience, do not

are still waiting for someone to do something. A small group of
exiles, many of them aged now, haven't given up plotting and
preparing. They plop onto their stomachs in the tall grass near the
Everglades, their rifles at the ready, practicing for that fateful
day.

down two Cuban exile planes just a few years ago.

<P>
   MIAMI _ This city of Cuban exiles has never been known for
restraint and moderation; there are too many people drinking too
much Cuban coffee, too many conspiracies to untangle, too much
frustration bottled up for too many years.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Cuban exodus started 40 years ago, Miami has been
a place apart, a city floating in some sort of ether, removed from
the rest of the country. Where else do people trade rumors of Fidel
Castro's impending death _ ``Did you notice how gaunt he looks? Did
you hear he had a stroke?'' _ the way others swap stock tips? Where
else are 4-year-olds spooked not by the bogyman in the closet but
by a bearded giant in olive green fatigues living across the
Florida Straits?
</P>
<P>
   I knew all of this long before I set foot outside the house of
Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle in Little Havana, a notebook in my
back pocket, a couple of weeks ago. I was born here, to
credentialed anti-communist parents; my father was a pilot who flew
missions into the Congo for the CIA to root out leftist insurgents
in the '60s; my mother has not set foot back on Cuban soil since
1961, when she and my siblings left Havana. She won't go back, not
while the ``devil'' remains alive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even I was unprepared for the fervor outside of Lazaro
Gonzalez's home, four months after little Elian was picked up at
sea. Maybe I had been gone too long. You grow up, you leave Miami
and you begin to see that things are not always so black and white.
That in places like Iowa, people can go years without even thinking
about Cuba, unless they like cigars. Or that they can question the
wisdom of the United States trying to overthrow Fidel Castro, even
though they share the Cuban exiles' contempt for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly midnight when I arrived in Little Havana, and the
block of modest, concrete houses, awash in television lights, was
teeming with people standing behind the barricades that separate
the crowd from the house. People waved signs with Elian's picture.
They likened him to baby Jesus. One man chanted the rosary into a
megaphone, leading a small group in prayer. Several women stood on
the front lines, waiting to steal a glance of the little boy behind
the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was edgy, suspicious. The word was that a federal SWAT
team was ready to swoop in and steal Elian away, and that his Cuban
exile ``protectors'' were girding for confrontation. So when a
group of college students showed up to snap photographs and shout
down the demonstrators, the crowd went berserk, and somehow I (my
press pass buried deep inside my purse) got pegged as one of the
provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comunista,'' they shouted, spit flying, fingers jabbing at my
face. The group started looking more like a mob, and for a minute,
I thought about calling over one of the cops, who was attending to
the college students. ``There is another one here,'' one woman
yelled, motioning the rest of the crowd over my way. Spying my
close-cropped hair, another woman shouted, ``lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   I found myself cringing, not out of fear but out of exasperation
and embarrassment _ for them, not myself. After I finally dug out
my press pass and got down to the business of interviewing people,
I couldn't help but think, ``Is it any wonder the rest of America
thinks that Cubans in Miami are zealots?''
</P>
<P>
   As an outsider, who is also an insider, I could understand why
they would think so. Most Americans, polls show, think that Elian
belongs with his father _ that blood is thicker than Marxism. Most
Americans also seem to think that Cubans in Miami, who are not
known for their tolerance, have received enough largesse. Haven't
they reshaped Miami in their own image?
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans, I know from my own experience, do not
understand that Cuban exiles see the world through a different
prism. Here the cold war is not a distant memory and Elian is not
just a little boy. He is the embodiment of 40 interminable years of
rancor and bitterness toward Fidel Castro _ and toward the U.S.
government, for failing to depose him or take a harder line.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even the terminology is different. Cubans are exiles,
refugees who were forced to choose between country and liberty, not
immigrants seeking the proverbial pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   You grow up hearing angry words from people who think the United
States never did enough to free Cuba from Castro. The Bay of Pigs
fiasco, something most Americans don't even remember until that
Kennedy documentary runs on the History Channel, is talked about

</P>
<P>
   Here, politicians are judged first and foremost by how much they
despise Fidel and communism, not by where they stand on education
and Social Security. You grow up meeting former political prisoners
who spent 15 years in Cuban jails for showing their disillusionment
with the revolution, and thousands of others who broke Cuban law
and jumped on teeny, tottering rafts just to get away. You know
lots of cousins here who hate cousins there because they are
communist believers, and you hear endless sorrowful tales from
mothers who can't get their children out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   You swim in nostalgia here, some of it air-brushed by time. As
kids, we would laugh at our parents' descriptions of Cuba, where
the sand on the beaches was as fine and as white as sugar and where
everyone lived in perfect harmony.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Fidel Castro is not an irrelevant dictator. He is not a
curious relic.
</P>
<P>
   Now I find that in Elian, exiles are venting about all this and
more: about how they placed their hope in a young, bearded
revolutionary who later betrayed them without a hint of remorse;
how they lost their homes, crammed with photographs accumulated
through generations; how they said goodbye to family members they
expected to see again soon, in a matter of months, maybe a few
years; and in the end, how they lost their country, the place where
they expected to marry, have children, grow old and die.
</P>
<P>
   But now I am also an outsider looking in, and it is easy to see
why Cuban exiles have drawn the ire of many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Their television screen has shown them people in Miami who want
to reshape the law to fit their endgame. It has shown them a mayor
who has said his police officers will not cooperate with the
federal government. It has shown people who are protesting in the
name of freedom chasing away other people who are also protesting
in the name of freedom. And, for the xenophobes, it has shown them
people unfurling Cuban flags, speaking staccato Spanish and pining
for the old country while casting aspersions on the new.
</P>
<P>
   For some outside Miami, it is difficult to understand why people
who have heaped scorn on Castro for so long for wrenching families
apart appear to be doing that very thing.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, it makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, exiles have felt helpless. Then came Elian.

   Discrimination Is Painful. It Can Also Be Agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   A study titled ``We Don't Carry That'' suggests that people who
need medication for severe pain may have trouble getting it if they
live in neighborhoods that are mostly black, Hispanic or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 347 pharmacies in New York City, conducted by the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, found that in nonwhite
neighborhoods only 25 percent of pharmacies carried enough morphine
or morphine-like drugs to treat severe pain; in white
neighborhoods, 72 percent did. Interviews with doctors and
pharmacists in Los Angeles and the Midwest suggested similar
problems there.
</P>
<P>
   Half the druggists blamed low demand, saying they could not
afford to stock items that customers did not buy. Some also cited
onerous narcotics laws and fear of theft in high-crime
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some pharmacies who are very anxious about armed
robberies and will have signs saying that they don't carry
narcotics,'' one pharmacist said.
</P>
<P>
   If demand is truly lower, no one knows why. Minorities are no
less likely than whites to suffer from illnesses that cause great
pain. Blacks, in fact, have higher cancer rates than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Some pharmacists suggested that demand was lower in poor
neighborhoods because they had higher proportions of uninsured
people who could not afford to fill prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who reviewed the survey said racial bias might be at
work because the results fit into a wider pattern of inequality in
health care, revealed by recent studies showing that blacks are
less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants or
surgery for early-stage cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study comes on the heels of many other studies that have
documented a disparity in treatment in which racial and ethnic
factors seem to be the predominant factor,'' said Dr. Richard
Payne, chief of the pain and palliative care service at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ``And that's quite disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors are less likely to prescribe painkillers
for blacks and Hispanics with broken bones or postoperative pain,
perhaps because of the false perception that they are more likely
to be addicts or less likely to need treatment for pain.

   Forget robins, equinoxes and daylight saving time: spring has
begun. On Monday, after a peculiar road trip, during which several
teams played their first league games in Japan, baseball really got
under way again.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre has seen
more than three decades of opening days, but he awoke on Monday
thinking baseball. ``I found myself craving it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre wasn't alone. As the Yankees waited to play their
West Coast opener against the Anaheim Angels, about a dozen players
gathered in the clubhouse more than three hours before their own
game, to watch televised highlights from other games that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Andres Galarraga, who sat out last year with cancer,
bashed a home run in Atlanta and the Yankees cheered. Vladimir
Guerrero, of the Montreal Expos, hit two home runs, the second a
mammoth shot that awed the Yankee couch potatoes. And when Derek
Bell, the Mets' new outfielder, hit a pivotal home run in Shea
Stadium, the Yankees grunted as one, urging him on as he swung.

   NATO Finally Catches One
</P>
<P>
   The accused war criminal Momcilo Krajisnik was arrested at his
parents' Bosnian home by French NATO troops and flown to the
international tribunal in The Hague, where he pleaded not guilty to
war crimes for his role in Serbia's ethnic cleansing campaign in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik, a close ally of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, is considered the most important war crimes suspect yet
captured by NATO, which has been criticized for not pursuing more
aggressively those responsible for the atrocities committed in the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said of Krajisnik's capture, ``This is possibly the most important
day since the Dayton agreement on Bosnia,'' which ended the war in
1995. Krajisnik, 55, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

   The Incredible Is Testable, But in Another Dimension
</P>
<P>
   Superstring theorists have a problem: You can't test a theory
that posits that all matter consists of ``notes'' produced by tiny
strings vibrating in nine-dimensional space. We aware of only three
dimensions because the rest are curled up into extremely tiny
balls, a hundred million trillion times smaller than a proton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Randall of Princeton University, Raman Sundrum of
Stanford University and Joseph Lykken of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory have proposed that at least one of the extra
dimensions is actually a four-dimensional megaverse inside which
the universe floats like a bubble. They believe that energy might
occasionally leak into the fourth dimension _ and that idea might
be testable.
</P>
<P>
   When two particles are slammed together in an accelerator, the
amount of energy going into the reaction should equal the amount
coming out.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, energy could be leaking into the fourth
dimension. Scientists are searching records of past accelerator
experiments for signs of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a discovery of extra dimensions is already sitting on a
tape in some data bank,'' Lykken said.

   A Friend of Ours Writes
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine was renowned for attempting to verify
every fact it published. In a recent book on the magazine, however,
onetime staff writer Renata Adler announced without proof that the
late Judge John Sirica was ``corrupt,'' ``dishonest'' and had
``clear ties to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirica, who presided over the Watergate burglary trial, which
ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in
1974, was widely regarded as a scrupulously honest jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Adler told a New York Times reporter that she would publish
proof of her charge when she pleased. Meanwhile, John Dean, former
Nixon counsel, suggested Adler might have been misled by G. Gordon
Liddy, whom Sirica sentenced to prison for his role in Watergate.

State Department officials. The material, found in 10 lead
containers about the size of a thick briefcase, was being tested by
officials in neighboring Kazakhstan, where it originated, to see if
it could have been used to make a nuclear weapon. Pakistan has a
history of smuggling nuclear components, and is believed to have
built about a dozen warheads.

   No one should be forced to be a parent, according to a ruling by
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concerning the fate of
frozen embryos created by a couple with fertility problems. After
the couple divorced, the 44-year-old former wife wanted to use the
embryos for one last try at getting pregnant, but the ex-husband
objected, though he had earlier signed consent forms saying she
could have the embryos.
</P>
<P>
   In the third such dispute over embryos to reach a state supreme
court _ and likely not the last, given the estimated 150,000 frozen
embryos nationwide _ the Massachusetts court said that, despite the
contract, it would be bad public policy to coerce parenthood.

   The Coup That Fell to Earth
</P>
<P>
   Nawaz Sharif, ousted by a military coup last October from his
position as Pakistan's prime minister, was convicted of hijacking a
commercial airliner. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and
ordered to forfeit all his personal property. Six co-defendants
were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's hijacking was a peculiar one in that he didn't take
over an airplane. Rather, he ordered that a Karachi-bound plane be
refused permission to land, even though it was running low on fuel.
The plane carried 198 passengers, including Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
who would depose Sharif later in the same day.

   The U.S. Army, already battered in recent years by sexual
misconduct scandals, was jolted again with the disclosure that a
general accused of sexual harassment by the Army's highest-ranking
woman was appointed last August to be the service's deputy
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the officer, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith,
prompted Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the Army's first woman to earn
three stars, to lodge a formal complaint against him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said she was concerned that he would be responsible
for investigating accusations of wrongdoing, including sexual
harassment.

   NATO Finally Catches One
</P>
<P>
   The accused war criminal Momcilo Krajisnik was arrested at his
parents' Bosnian home by French NATO troops and flown to the
international tribunal in The Hague, where he pleaded not guilty to
war crimes for his role in Serbia's ethnic cleansing campaign in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik, a close ally of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, is considered the most important war crimes suspect yet
captured by NATO, which has been criticized for not pursuing more
aggressively those responsible for the atrocities committed in the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said of Krajisnik's capture, ``This is possibly the most important
day since the Dayton agreement on Bosnia,'' which ended the war in
1995. Krajisnik, 55, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Incredible Is Testable, But in Another Dimension
</P>
<P>
   Superstring theorists have a problem: You can't test a theory
that posits that all matter consists of ``notes'' produced by tiny
strings vibrating in nine-dimensional space. We aware of only three
dimensions because the rest are curled up into extremely tiny
balls, a hundred million trillion times smaller than a proton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Randall of Princeton University, Raman Sundrum of
Stanford University and Joseph Lykken of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory have proposed that at least one of the extra
dimensions is actually a four-dimensional megaverse inside which
the universe floats like a bubble. They believe that energy might
occasionally leak into the fourth dimension _ and that idea might
be testable.
</P>
<P>
   When two particles are slammed together in an accelerator, the
amount of energy going into the reaction should equal the amount
coming out.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, energy could be leaking into the fourth
dimension. Scientists are searching records of past accelerator
experiments for signs of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a discovery of extra dimensions is already sitting on a
tape in some data bank,'' Lykken said.

   A Friend of Ours Writes
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine was renowned for attempting to verify
every fact it published. In a recent book on the magazine, however,
onetime staff writer Renata Adler announced without proof that the
late Judge John Sirica was ``corrupt,'' ``dishonest'' and had
``clear ties to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirica, who presided over the Watergate burglary trial, which
ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in
1974, was widely regarded as a scrupulously honest jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Adler told a New York Times reporter that she would publish
proof of her charge when she pleased. Meanwhile, John Dean, former
Nixon counsel, suggested Adler might have been misled by G. Gordon
Liddy, whom Sirica sentenced to prison for his role in Watergate.

   NEW YORK _ In the spring of 1928, when the Federal Reserve was
trying to restrain stock market speculation by tightening credit, a
visitor to the office of Roy Young, a Fed governor, found him
chuckling as he stared at the news ticker, which was reporting that
stock prices had risen sharply that day.
</P>
<P>
   Young explained, ``I am laughing at myself sitting here and
trying to keep 125 million people from doing what they want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   What they wanted to do was buy stocks and get rich, and they
were borrowing more and more money to do so. So it has been over
the past year, as share prices have soared. Last week, as Wall
Street briefly plunged and then recovered, some of the selling came
from investors who had borrowed money to buy stocks and now had to
raise cash to pay their loans. But new money came into the market,
and prices soon stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   When Young was laughing, the volume of such stock market loans
was up 67 percent in less than two years. Many analysts feared that
a crash would ensue if a fall in prices forced many of those
speculators to sell their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1929, however, The New York Times was taking note
of the fact that even larger increases in such loans no longer
alarmed people. ``One of the most striking features of the present
chapter in stock market history,'' The Times reported on Sept. 1,
``is the failure of the trading community to take serious alarm at
portents which once threw Wall Street into a state of alarm
bordering on demoralization. In particular, the recent disregard of
the succession of `smashed high records' for brokers' loans
astonishes the older school of market operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowed money unquestionably played a role in the speculation
of the late 1920s, and after the 1929 crash Congress set out to
enact limits on it. Whereas speculators in 1929 could put down as
little as 10 percent of the purchase price to buy stocks, the new
law left it to the Federal Reserve to set limits. For decades the
Fed diligently raised the borrowing requirement when it thought
speculation was on the rise and cut it when it perceived less need
for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But the last adjustment _ a reduction in the down payment for
stocks from 65 percent of the purchase price to 50 percent _ came
in 1974, in the midst of a severe bear market when few wanted to
take the risk anyway. Since then, the Fed has been on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with margin lending having risen sharply since last fall,
there are renewed worries about margin debt _ the money borrowed
from brokers to buy securities. Under current rules, if an
investor's stocks fall so far that he or she owes more than 75
percent of the value of his or her account, a margin call must go
out, forcing the investor to come up with more money or sell some
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokerage houses impose stiffer rules, typically pulling
the plug when the debt hits 70 percent of the value of the account.
To translate that into Wall Street jargon, the brokers require a
``maintenance margin'' of 30 percent. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has been quietly trying to persuade all brokerage firms
to set the level at least that high for investors who own the most
volatile stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the two eras _ the 1920s and now _ shows some
similarities and some great differences in the use of borrowed
money to buy stocks. Now, as then, the Fed has been trying to
tighten credit by raising interest rates but has seen stock prices
soar as more and more money has been borrowed to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lure of stock market profits had caught the public
imagination,'' the economist Benjamin Anderson wrote of the late
1920s in his 1949 book, ``Economics and the Public Welfare.'' ``And
the change in Federal Reserve policy, designed to restrict the
supply of money, met with an overpowering increase in the demand
for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Margin debt is now rising faster than it ever did in the 1920s,
when the peak annual increase was 56 percent. Over the 12 months
through the end of February 2000, the latest data available, the
increase was 75 percent, and most of that came after the Nasdaq
market began to take off in October 1999. The big runup in prices
that saw the Nasdaq average double from last summer through its
peak last month was fueled in part by borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the total volume of margin loans at last report was $252
billion, or just 1.7 percent of the value of stocks traded on the
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the two major stock markets. On
Sept. 1, 1929, by contrast, the $5.8 billion in brokers' loans, as
margin loans were then known, amounted to 9.5 percent of the value
of the stocks then traded.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to indicate there is far less leverage now, but
that may not be true. Today's investors have many more choices.
They can buy options and futures on stock indexes, each of which
allow a speculator to make a lot of money on a small investment _
if the market goes up. Those who want to borrow money to buy stocks
can take out a margin loan, or they can use their credit cards or
home equity loans. And, as everyone learned when the Long-Term
Capital Management hedge fund nearly failed in 1998, it is possible
for clever traders to borrow huge amounts of money to use in
playing the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has so far
resisted suggestions that the Fed raise the margin requirement from
the current level of 50 percent, arguing that such a move would not
affect the wealthier and more sophisticated investors who can use
the many other financial products now available.
</P>
<P>
   That means investors will be free to keep borrowing. And,
history shows, they will continue to do so if they remain confident
that stock prices are going to keep rising.

froze, whatever. Only, right at the end, I burst through the
surface of the water, all blue, because I've been holding my
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Well that sure is neat. What'd &UR; 12 &LR;  he say?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. He said it was stupid. My guru says just let it go. Inner
harmony, that's my thing now. You hungry?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Sure. We can get food here any time. What would you like?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. They've got me on this new diet. No dairy, no meat, no
carbonation. Apparently my chakras &UR; 13 &LR;  are blocked.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. I had that once. From heavy cream. Hey Bobby? Rustle up
some grub, would ya' &UR; 14 &LR;  son? A fruit plate for the King of the
World here and I'll have a couple of cheeseburgers and a pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Dude. Is the world getting warmer or what?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Well, Leo, that's a question of great concern to my
administration. In 1992, when I took office, I made a pledge to the
American people to place a ban on so-called CFC's &UR; 15 &LR; ,
chloroflourocarbons &UR; 16 &LR; . In that time, due to the work of a
bipartisan commission ...
</P>
<P>
   L.D. You know who's cool is that John McCann &UR; 17 &LR; . &UR; C &LR;
</P>
<P>
   B.C. McCain &UR; C &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. I guess. The Germans, they like tortured the guy for 20
years or something. B.C. I hadn't heard that.
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. I'm taking Tai &UR; 18 &LR;  Chi.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. That's nice.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. It's not just for old Chinese ladies, ya' &UR; 14 &LR;  know.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Is that so?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. I swear this room is round, not oval.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Hey! The food's here!
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Cool.
</P>
<P>
   (Long pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Okay, so last summer, right? I'm out in L.A. in, like,
August and it's, I don't know, like 95 degrees. I'm sitting by the
pool, just, like, reading this book on breathing and I just
couldn't believe how hot it was. And I got to thinking, ``Is this
what they mean by global warming? Or is this just the summer?''
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Leo, you bring up an important point. Global warming is
something that concerns many Americans, indeed, many people all
over the world. When I was at Oxford, I read Rachel Carson's 1962
best-seller ``Silent Spring'' and it moved me very deeply. Then, in
1989, I read Bill McKibben's &UR; 19C &LR;  ``The End of Nature.'' It warned
of a rise in global temperatures of three to nine degrees over the
coming decades, a rise in sea levels to dangerous heights, heat
waves the likes of which mankind has never experienced. Pie?
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Cool Whip? It's non-dairy &UR; 20 &LR; . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. D'you &UR; 21 &LR;  ever watch ``Blind Date?''
</P>
<P>
   B.C. I love that show. And ``MTV &UR; 22 &LR;  Spring Break 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   (Pause)
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Dude, what is up with the ozone? There's a club in New
York, Oh-Zone, in the meat-packing district, but that's completely
different, right? The thing they're talking about, that's a place
in, like, space.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. That's right, Leo. The ozone is a thin, membranous layer
that protects the earth from harmful _ and potentially deadly _
ultraviolet radiation. Without the ozone layer, life on Earth
simply couldn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Wow.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. And that's why, in 1996, I urged the G-7 nations to act
with the United States to implement a first-of-its-kind treaty to
reduce ozone emissions in the major industrialized nations by the
year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Is this the same office that John Kennedy was in?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. He was cool.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Why, yes, he was. I met him.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. No way. That was, like, a hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. It sure seems like it, but it was 1961.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. That's messed up. Was there global warming then?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Certainly the beginnings of it, yes. And that's why my
administration ...
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Here's the thing I don't understand. No one really likes
the winter, right? I mean, people love getting away. And, like,
home heating oil is, I've heard, expensive. So why is global
warming a bad thing if it's keeping us all warm?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. You bring up an excellent question. I believe that the ...
</P>
<P>
   L.D. So how much longer you going to be president?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. A little less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. So how come you're leaving?
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Well, a president can only serve for two four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Dude, that's lame.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   L.D. Well, listen. This has been great, but I'm meeting some
people in France. The Riviera &UR; 23 &LR; . Just chill for a few days in the
sun. Global warming, man. That's where it's at.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The news out of Uganda has been very bad, and
that nation's two daily newspapers have spared their readers none
of it. For three days running, the state-owned paper, The New
Vision, ran front-page, full-color photos of rotting corpses _ a
sad few of the perhaps 900 victims of a deadly cult, the Movement
for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures were so awful that investigators have now barred
cameras from any other grave sites they may find, a possibility
that is depressingly likely. The New Vision received many
complaints about the photos, perhaps loudest from government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thought the decision to publish them was wrong.
For Uganda has been groping for explanations for the mass killings,
and alongside sensationalism in the daily press there has been a
remarkably frank discussion of the roots of the problem _ most
interestingly, a tracing of the current religiosity and mysticism
associated with cults to the despair left by years of dictatorship,
poverty, AIDS and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion in the press, in both its liveliness and
thoughtfulness, mirrors a larger discussion taking place in Ugandan
society about the cult and the murders, and this reveals a great
deal about Uganda itself _ how far it has come in its tortured
passage of 38 years from independence, through a brutal
dictatorship and at last toward a society where open expression is
recognized as a tool for solving the nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to be shocked,'' said the Rev. John Mary Waliggo, a
Catholic priest who is one of Uganda's human rights commissioners
and a professor of African history, after the photos were
published. ``From this shock, we will be able to find out what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pictures were just part of the aggressive coverage
of the cult murders by Uganda's two papers, The New Vision and The
Monitor, and their coverage has mirrored Ugandans' general
reaction: shock, horror, a search for blame, along with an ample
measure of ``What will the world think of Uganda now?''
</P>
<P>
   That last thought is predictable. It has been only 21 years
since the dictator Idi Amin was deposed after a rule of brutality
and death that made Uganda a synonym for state-sponsored horror.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years since, Uganda has developed in a way that might
surprise most outsiders. It has become one of the brightest spots
of central Africa, with a growing economy and an intriguing leader,
a left-leaning former rebel, Yoweri Museveni, who talks loudly
about his ideas for everything from cattle-rearing to toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aware that it was a danger to Uganda's image abroad''
when the cult story broke, said William Pike, a Briton who is the
editor of The New Vision. ``But we didn't let that get in the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. In few African countries could a story headlined, ``Are
you in a cult?'' run next to another headlined, ``Why have I lost
my sex drive?'' This happened in the March 23 edition of The New
Vision. But while some of the coverage has been sensationalistic _
headlines like ``Another Grave!'' and speculation that the victims
may have actually been Muslim fundamentalists because some men were
circumcised _ most of it has been straight and has pulled few
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Both The Monitor (independent, with a circulation of 26,000) and
The New Vision (state owned but independent in its news coverage,
with a circulation of 35,000) have seriously posed the questions:
``Why this?'' and ``Why Uganda?''
</P>
<P>
   And so they have devoted much space to Uganda's history of
combining religion and violence (three rebel groups over the last
15 years have claimed religious inspiration). Over the years, the
papers have also spent much time looking into problems of poverty
and development and the spread of AIDS, which Waliggo said in an
interview is the chief culprit behind religious sects that have
healing and miracles as their hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have sought healing as a religion,'' he said. ``Western
medicine can't heal them, and many fear African traditional
medicine.'' When people have problems, he said, they will turn to
whatever looks most attractive _ and Uganda happens to have more
than its fair share of fringe religious groups, many bordering on
mystical cults.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, the difference between religion and magic is very
narrow,'' he said. ``You can pass from one to the other very
easily. It is like sanity and insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more thoughtful newspaper coverage in this vein has
come from the editor of The Monitor, Charles Onyango-Obbo, who in
his columns has stitched together politics, poverty and the
failings of established churches in his search for answers as deep
as the problems his people face.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the shortcomings of religion, he wrote: ``There is
reason therefore to fear that what has been burnt and buried in
Kanungu are only the bodies of the members of the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments. Its spirit remains very much
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the discussion here has been so somber or
speculative. Some of the newspaper coverage, in fact, has been
almost mythic, like a long piece in The New Vision about the rise
of cults of the Virgin Mary. This included a description of a
Rwandan beauty, Specioza Mukantabona, who had claimed visions of
the Virgin. She was, the article said, disgraced after skeptics
traced her ability to bleed divinely from the mouth to
blood-bloated ticks under her tongue. After that, the paper noted,
``She easily turned into one of the most expensive prostitutes of
modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers have also won some small victories. They questioned
why Uganda's security departments did not realize earlier that the
cult might be a threat. The government has since officially
apologized. And they questioned why most of the exhumation of
corpses has been carried out by prisoners, with bare hands. The
government suspended digging until it could buy gloves and masks.
</P>
<P>
   But Onyango-Obbo, the Monitor editor, has included the press in
his list of those who should shoulder some blame. Because Uganda
has suffered so much abuse at the hands of its government, he said
in an interview, the press has not been well equipped to ask the
probing questions that could help Ugandans understand the
desperation of people who would join a murderous cult and believe
so blindly in its empty promises. ``In this country,'' he said,
``it was always the government committing the crimes. So we didn't
have to do any soul-searching on a personal level.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crime scene was bare of clues. Even DNA fingerprinting
scored no hits in the databases. The police had no leads. As a last
resort, they sent a DNA sample to a private company _ which soon
supplied the surname of the man who had left it.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction as yet, but the company, Oxford Ancestors,
exists and has applied for a patent on the idea of deriving
surnames from DNA. Its founder, Dr. Bryan Sykes, is a geneticist at
the University of Oxford in England who has made an intriguing
discovery about English surnames: many of them once had a single
bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Surnames came into use in England between 1250 and 1450,
probably in connection with the development of inheritable property
rights and trades. ``The surname acted like documentation a time
when they didn't have forms,'' said Dr. George Redmonds, a
historian of place names and surnames. It is not known how many
people took the same surname, but those based on common trades,
like Smith, may have had many original owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, who analyzes DNA to track ancient population changes,
wondered if he could trace the origins of his own surname. The word
comes from a type of moorland stream used to mark land boundaries.
Genealogists expected that as a landscape feature it would have
been adopted by many people in search of surnames. Nearly 10,000
Sykeses are registered as voters in the United Kingdom, many near
the town of Huddersfield in Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sykes sent out letters to a random sample of his male
namesakes, asking them to send him cells brushed from the inside
cheek on a cotton swab. His interest lay in the subjects' Y
chromosomes, which of course are bequeathed from father to son in
the same pattern as surnames, except in the case of what
geneticists delicately refer to as a ``non-paternity event.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other chromosomes, the Y is transmitted unchanged and
would remain identical from the Adams of the human race to all of
their sons, except for the rare mutations or accidental changes
that accumulate over the centuries. Because each lineage of Y
chromosomes carries its own signature set of DNA changes, these
mutations provide a perfect system for tracking male genealogies,
and that is what Sykes looked for in the cotton swabs mailed back
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Only one DNA signature was common among his namesakes' Y
chromosomes, Sykes reports in the current issue of the American
Journal of Human Genetics. This means there was only one original
Mr. Sykes, at least as reflected in today's population. The first
Sykeses on record lived in the 13th century in Flockton,
Slaithwaite and Saddleworth, three villages close to Huddersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who do not carry the genetic signature have presumably
had a non-paternity event somewhere in their ancestry. In fact, 50
percent of the modern-day Sykeses did not have the genetic
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, this is a remarkable testimony to the
fidelity of the Mrs. Sykeses of past centuries, because it amounts
to a non-paternity rate of 1.3 percent per generation. The
non-paternity rate in the present English population is conjectured
to be between 2 percent and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From court records, it seems Dr. Sykes' ancestors, at least in
the 14th century, were ``quite a rough lot _ always being fined for
cutting down trees and stealing sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' Dr. Sykes said, ``their wives were faithful
through all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was a true Sykes or an out-of-wedlock Sykes, he
replied, ``I'm proud to say I have the aboriginal chromosome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who live in the United States would not necessarily bear
the original chromosome in the same proportion as their English
cousins because the emigrants might not have been a representative
sample, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   He has analyzed three other surnames in the same way and found
that, as with the Sykeses, all can be traced to a single bearer of
the family name. Even the ubiquitous Smiths and Clarks might trace
their surnames to just a handful of very prolific early ancestors,
not the hundreds that might be presumed, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests it would be feasible to construct a library of DNA
signatures linked with English family names. The library could be
used forensically to provide a surname that matched a DNA sample,
and for genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Redmonds said that a library of DNA matched to surnames would be
useful in connecting branches of a family that lacked historical
records to document their kinship. The library might be of
particular interest, he said, to Americans of English ancestry
seeking to identify their origins; their Y chromosomes might link
them directly to the villages where the first bearers of their
surnames once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan had no interest in genealogy whatsoever before this
started,'' Redmonds said of his geneticist friend. ``When I was
able to take him to the precise place in Yorkshire where his
ancestors came from, he was hooked.''

   The crime scene was bare of clues. Even DNA fingerprinting
scored no hits in the databases. The police had no leads. As a last
resort, they sent a DNA sample to a private company _ which soon
supplied the surname of the man who had left it.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction as yet, but the company, Oxford Ancestors,
exists and has applied for a patent on the idea of deriving
surnames from DNA. Its founder, Dr. Bryan Sykes, is a geneticist at
the University of Oxford in England who has made an intriguing
discovery about English surnames: many of them once had a single
bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Surnames came into use in England between 1250 and 1450,
probably in connection with the development of inheritable property
rights and trades. ``The surname acted like documentation a time
when they didn't have forms,'' said Dr. George Redmonds, a
historian of place names and surnames. It is not known how many
people took the same surname, but those based on common trades,
like Smith, may have had many original owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, who analyzes DNA to track ancient population changes,
wondered if he could trace the origins of his own surname. The word
comes from a type of moorland stream used to mark land boundaries.
Genealogists expected that as a landscape feature it would have
been adopted by many people in search of surnames. Nearly 10,000
Sykeses are registered as voters in the United Kingdom, many near
the town of Huddersfield in Yorkshire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sykes sent out letters to a random sample of his male
namesakes, asking them to send him cells brushed from the inside
cheek on a cotton swab. His interest lay in the subjects' Y
chromosomes, which of course are bequeathed from father to son in
the same pattern as surnames, except in the case of what
geneticists delicately refer to as a ``non-paternity event.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other chromosomes, the Y is transmitted unchanged and
would remain identical from the Adams of the human race to all of
their sons, except for the rare mutations or accidental changes
that accumulate over the centuries. Because each lineage of Y
chromosomes carries its own signature set of DNA changes, these
mutations provide a perfect system for tracking male genealogies,
and that is what Sykes looked for in the cotton swabs mailed back
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Only one DNA signature was common among his namesakes' Y
chromosomes, Sykes reports in the current issue of the American
Journal of Human Genetics. This means there was only one original
Mr. Sykes, at least as reflected in today's population. The first
Sykeses on record lived in the 13th century in Flockton,
Slaithwaite and Saddleworth, three villages close to Huddersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who do not carry the genetic signature have presumably
had a non-paternity event somewhere in their ancestry. In fact, 50
percent of the modern-day Sykeses did not have the genetic
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances, this is a remarkable testimony to the
fidelity of the Mrs. Sykeses of past centuries, because it amounts
to a non-paternity rate of 1.3 percent per generation. The
non-paternity rate in the present English population is conjectured
to be between 2 percent and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From court records, it seems Dr. Sykes' ancestors, at least in
the 14th century, were ``quite a rough lot _ always being fined for
cutting down trees and stealing sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' Dr. Sykes said, ``their wives were faithful
through all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was a true Sykes or an out-of-wedlock Sykes, he
replied, ``I'm proud to say I have the aboriginal chromosome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykeses who live in the United States would not necessarily bear
the original chromosome in the same proportion as their English
cousins because the emigrants might not have been a representative
sample, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   He has analyzed three other surnames in the same way and found
that, as with the Sykeses, all can be traced to a single bearer of
the family name. Even the ubiquitous Smiths and Clarks might trace
their surnames to just a handful of very prolific early ancestors,
not the hundreds that might be presumed, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests it would be feasible to construct a library of DNA
signatures linked with English family names. The library could be
used forensically to provide a surname that matched a DNA sample,
and for genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Redmonds said that a library of DNA matched to surnames would be
useful in connecting branches of a family that lacked historical
records to document their kinship. The library might be of
particular interest, he said, to Americans of English ancestry
seeking to identify their origins; their Y chromosomes might link
them directly to the villages where the first bearers of their
surnames once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan had no interest in genealogy whatsoever before this
started,'' Redmonds said of his geneticist friend. ``When I was
able to take him to the precise place in Yorkshire where his
ancestors came from, he was hooked.''

COMMENTARY: AMERICAN BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You've got to hand it to David Westin.
</P>
<P>
   The president of ABC News has achieved the impossible: He gave
the Clinton White House the moral high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton relished turning the tables on his press
tormentors. Now it was ABC that was guilty of parsing words and
shading truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC doesn't know whether Leo and I had an interview, a
walk-through, or a drive-by,'' Clinton joked at a press banquet.
``Don't you news people ever learn? It isn't the mistake that kills
you; it's the cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, an ABC News posse took Leonardo DiCaprio to talk to
the president about, like, global stuff for an Earth Day special.
</P>
<P>
   The heart throb worries about the planet. He can reel off 20
extinct species (not counting David Westin). He told Time: ``I
shouldn't be eating hamburgers, because the methane gas cows
release is the No. 1 contributor to the destruction of the ozone
layer; and the No. 1 reason they destroy the rain forest is to make
grazing ground for cattle. So it's very ironic that I eat beef,
being the environmentalist that I am. But then again, if I ordered
the tuna sandwich, I would be promoting the fact that they have
large tuna nets that capture innocent little dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sam Donaldson and Peter Jennings got upset, Westin sent the
staff an e-mail, explaining that it wasn't supposed to be an
interview, just a conversation while walking around the White House
_ a fine example of Clintonian casuistry.
</P>
<P>
   Westin wrote _ the parentheses are his _ that ``a sincere,
informed celebrity (Di Caprio) can play a role in that sort of news
special. But the role must be that of a sincere, informed
celebrity-not journalist. All roles of journalist must be played by
journalists (duh!)''
</P>
<P>
   Even in an era of celebrity journalism, it is jarring to see the
job of a journalist called a role to be played.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, ABC agonized over whether to air some or any of
the tape of Movie Star and Groupie.
</P>
<P>
   It never dawned on the White House that allowing the president
to be interviewed by a glossy overpaid Hollywood celebrity was any
different than allowing him to be interviewed by a glossy overpaid
network celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC asked Leo to play the role of a journalist,'' said a
Clinton aide. ``And he's a better actor than some of the people
they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton crowd, after all, has always worked to blur the line
between entertainment and reality.
</P>
<P>
   And Disney must thrill at the synergy of Leo starring on ABC,
starring in a movie for Miramax, starring on the cover of Talk
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little late for Westin's attacks of conscience as he
tries to lure ``the DiCaprio generation,'' as he calls it, so that
ABC can get some sponsors for the evening news other than
Preparation H and Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   He let ABC get sullied when Diane Sawyer stood on her head for
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Cuomo, the 29-year-old hired last year for ABC's
``20/20 Downtown,'' is the anchor of the Earth Day special. He is
part of the New York news magazine contingent that feels the
Washington fuddy-duddies are too starchy about ``credibility.''
This group thinks that, in the sprawling new media market, ABC
needs to race the engines and explore hip new ways to draw young
viewers, not slow down for outdated, stolid rules.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point. It takes a special reporter to lure you into
a discussion about insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Networks turned to pretty anchors. Then pretty reporters. (Cuomo
was named by People as one of the 50 most beautiful people.) Then
came pretty analysts. (George Stephanopoulos has a knockout Q
rating.)
</P>
<P>
   But they always had grizzled veterans calling the shots. When
Disney took over, ABC began to cast pretty executives. Suddenly,
the Suits looked like Talent. Remember the tousled Jamie Tarses?
Bob Iger looks like a matinee idol. And Westin could be Leo's big
brother, or a ``GMA'' weatherman.
</P>
<P>
   Given this inexorable arc, Westin should simply write an e-mail
telling all the pretty anchors and pretty reporters to interview
only pretty people. No more Alan Greenspans or Denny Hasterts. Just
babes and hunks. (duh!)
</P>
<P>
   As Faye Dunaway said in ``Network'' when she wanted to put Sibyl
the Soothsayer on the evening news: ``If you're going to hustle, at
least do it right.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: RIGHTS OF BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know anyone outside Seattle who is really pro-Microsoft.
But a lot of us are, at least mildly, anti-anti-Microsoft. That is,
we worry that the crusade against Bill Gates sets a bad, even
dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Let's admit the obvious: Microsoft has what amounts to a
monopoly position in the operating system market. You can argue
that potential competitors have always limited Microsoft's pricing
power, and anyway as we move from the wired to the wireless age
that monopoly is a rapidly wasting asset. But the dominance of
Microsoft's position is hard to dispute (and the company's efforts
to claim otherwise, by their very implausibility, did a lot of
damage to its case).
</P>
<P>
   Monopoly per se, however, is no sin in the tech sector. On the
contrary, the prospect or at least the hope of future market
dominance is what drives the whole enterprise. Consider Amazon.com:
It has been able to build a business only because people believe
that it will eventually have at least some monopoly power. If the
invisible hand works too well, and competition from other Internet
booksellers keeps Amazon's margins near zero forever, the
stockholders who have financed its growth will be sorely
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that we're not in Kansas anymore _ that is,
technology markets cannot function like the market for wheat, in
which many competing suppliers drive prices down to the cost of
producing one more bushel. High-tech competition naturally and
necessarily looks like a series of winner-take-all tournaments, in
which ``all'' means a temporary monopoly that lasts until something
dramatically better comes along.
</P>
<P>
   True, Microsoft was not content with winning one tournament; it
clearly used its operating-system dominance to get a head start in
other competitions. Microsoft didn't sabotage competing software _
I happen to be a Netscape surfer and a WordPerfect writer, and they
work just fine in Windows _ but it did make sure that the easiest
choice for consumers was to use the stuff bundled with Windows, and
most people did just that.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that any of this has inflicted any harm
on consumers so far. Microsoft does not charge high prices or sell
poor-quality products, and for most people the standardization of
icons, commands and so on has probably been a plus. This means that
the real dispute about Microsoft's role is about the putative
impact of its strategy on the future _ on innovation, on the range
and prices of products that will be available in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Microsoft case goes like this: Bill Gates and his
henchmen have created an environment in which innovators know that
they will not receive their just reward. Invent a better digital
mousetrap, and you know that either you sell out to Microsoft _
which puts a ceiling on your potential return _ or you will soon
find yourself facing competition from a free Microsoft mousetrap
bundled with Windows. So shackling or breaking up Microsoft _ and
making it clear that the same will happen to any company that tries
the same kind of power play _ will accelerate progress by ending
the climate of fear.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-anti-Microsoft case does not deny that there is some
truth to that story, but asserts that taking punitive action will
be the worse of two evils because it will create a different, and
worse, climate of fear _ fear that success itself will be punished.
Today Microsoft, tomorrow Intel and eventually (as soon as somebody
figures out what it does) Cisco. And oh yes, if Amazon ever does
start to justify investor expectations, the Justice Department will
step in to make sure that it doesn't. So slamming Microsoft will
actually place a chill on future progress.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these positions can be, and have been, defended by
reasonable people. I don't know of any objective, quantitative way
to decide which position is right; it's a matter of educated
guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   But when I see the extent to which judgment _ even, if I may say
so, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's judgment _ has been influenced
not by analysis but by Bill Gates' image problem; when I hear that
a coalition of states is demanding damages from Microsoft, as if
Windows caused lung cancer; well, my blood runs cold. I know that
there is an intellectually respectable case against Microsoft, but
I've got a bad feeling about where we are going.

SPORTS COLUMN: A CYBER FINAL FOUR MIGHT SETTLE EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that our forum is off and running at the mouth, just a click
away on your e-mail dial (TheLipsite(AT)aol.com), your only excuse
for not participating is the continuing confusion over college
sports: Is it professional, semiprofessional, amateur? Are these
labels without meaning? Why should we care?
</P>
<P>
   As more colleges go online with their courses, the ultimate
Final Four may be played among great cyberuniversities, several of
which will probably be spun out of the Microsoft breakup. When a
kid from Gates Tech who grew up in a home without a laptop wins
most valuable player, we'll know that the old-school values held.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Fogel Yeager, who was one of TheLipsite's first
respondents, is definitely old school. By e-mail, she says: ``In my
dreamworld students would go to college and then try out for the
team. Many high school students I know don't even know that Duke or
Georgetown are colleges _ they think that's just a team name.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeager identifies herself as ``an avid sports fan (except when
Dick Vitale is broadcasting),'' who thinks ``greedy players,
coaches, TV, sporting goods manufacturers, etc., are dominating the
system'' and the ``NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL, etc., need to take back the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   You're right, Ms. Y, but aren't those groups the ones who gave
(at least part of) the game away during their greedy snarfle at the
trough?
</P>
<P>
   A mailer called Pagresti writes: ``All the stories I read over
the past four weeks mentioned how good the basketball players were
and how exciting the games were, but I never read about how the
student-athletes keep up with their studies when they are on the
road playing basketball for several weeks at a time. Do they get
tutoring? When do they go to school to keep up with the other
students? Or do they even go to classes? What do the college
presidents say about going to school, or is schooling just another
annoyance that the basketball players have to tolerate when they
are playing these games?''
</P>
<P>
   This should encourage the Drake Group, that band of tenured
desperadoes who met in Des Moines last October in a remarkable
conference organized by Professor Jon Ericson of Drake University.
Among the many notable academics in attendance were William
Dowling, a founder of the Rutgers 1000, which is devoted to
de-emphasizing sports at the university; Andrew Zimbalist of Smith
College, the noted demystifier of sports economics; and Murray
Sperber, Indiana University's antidote to Coach Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest manifesto from the prairie, the Drake Group calls
for the end of athletic scholarships and the term
``student-athlete'' (it's one or the other). The group wants sports
controlled by the faculty senate rather than the athletic
department. It is demanding full disclosure of all academic aspects
_ tutors, course load, choice of major, graduation rates _ of a
team and of athletes, except for individual grades.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the Drakes (they are mostly males, after all)
is in their bold challenge to a corrupt system run by their bosses,
the college presidents. Coaches may make the headlines and the
shoe-contract money, but they are ultimately dependent on the
talents of teen-agers; meanwhile, the presidents perk on, whether
or not the athletes win, whether or not the students learn. The
Drakes are also bucking the sad complicity of their colleagues. Too
many teachers roll over for coaches. Some are intimidated, others
are fans, many just love to rub around in the testosterone pools of
the jock culture.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of testosterone, the social, cultural, political and
physical powers of that manly hormone were celebrated in an
absorbing article in The New York Times Magazine last Sunday by
Andrew Sullivan, who also poses questions for sports. How can women
consider competing in most games with men when that most profound
distinction, testosterone production, can never be equalized
without making women into men? Sullivan adds, ``Even more
unsettling is the racial gap in testosterone.'' He cites scientific
studies that show black men have 3 to 19 percent more testosterone
than white men. He wonders if that could be the reason black men
dominate certain sports.
</P>
<P>
   If white men can't jump, they can do androstenedione, a legal
supplement that boosts the hormone pumpers. Mark McGwire set the
home run record on andro in 1998, although he says he has stopped.
Lately, feeling righteous, McGwire criticized Major League Baseball
for opening the season in Japan. He said it was a money-grubbing
tactic not in the best interests of the pastime.
</P>
<P>
   A reader, Jothar, comments to TheLipsite: ``For Mark McGwire to
turn down a trip to Japan because it was just about money is
absurd. Since its inception, professional baseball was all about
money. This Japan trip is merely a new twist in the sport's
relentless pursuit of Mammon. Fifty years from now, we'll be waxing
nostalgic about the very first advertising patches to be featured
on major league uniforms, and it will involve our very own Mets.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE OLD MASTERS ASSESS TIGER WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ If the old masters of art include Michelangelo,
da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt, Rubens and Van Dyck, the old masters
of the Masters include Nicklaus, Palmer, Player, Snead, Nelson and
Watson. And as those old masters wandered Augusta National this
weekend, each was asked the same question:
</P>
<P>
   What is the one most impressive factor in the success of golf's
young master, Tiger Woods? ``His ability to make himself do
something when he needs to; that's the mark of a champion,'' Jack
Nicklaus said, alluding to Woods' flair for the theatrical. ``When
you have to do something, he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Saturday's third round of this Masters began, the
24-year-old Woods had to do something different, for him: get in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-over-par 147 for 36 holes, the world's No. 1 player
was nine strokes off the lead, the most he has trailed at the
halfway mark of a PGA Tour event this year. At the Nissan Open in
Los Angeles he was five strokes behind at the halfway mark before
finishing tied for 18th. In his six other tournaments, he won three
and finished second in three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way Tiger has played the last eight months is
better than I've ever played in a particular period,'' Nicklaus
said. ``If he continues to do what he's doing, he'll break all my
records; sure he will. But there's an awful lot of things that need
to happen that that depends on. His health. His desire to want to
play. And who else is going to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a couple more Tiger Woods that are about 15 years
old right now. You just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Player also warned that Woods' eventual rivals might be
mere youngsters somewhere now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're building bionic men,'' Player said. ``You'll find a
man like Michael Jordan who comes out with the same flair Tiger has
and hits it 50 yards past Tiger. We haven't seen the start of it.
There's never been a man out here built like Michael Jordan who has
a flair for the game. Watch out when that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But that man might not possess what Player describes as the
``passion'' Woods has for golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of guys have Tiger's ability, like Ernie Els,'' Player
said, referring to his fellow South African who has won two U.S.
Open titles. ``But they don't have that passion that Tiger has. And
if you watch Tiger playing these finesse shots over traps and out
of the rough, he's scoring because of his great short game and his
great putting, not just his long game.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer had a different perspective. ``I'll take Tiger's
length,'' Palmer said. ``What impresses me the most about Tiger is
his strength as he applies it to his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods applies that strength with a swing that's not much
different from the swing that Sam Snead, now 87, saw when he was
playing an exhibition in the Los Angeles area in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up walks Tiger, he was 6, and his dad, who asked if Tiger
could play two holes with me,'' Snead said. ``He had that swing
then. He gets that thing through there. When he first came out on
the tour, he had only one fault. From 135, 145, he'd hit it over
the green sometimes. Now he hits a knockdown shot there. He's by
far the best player today. And you watch him swing. That right arm
stays straight down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's the one most impressive thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny him any putt,'' Snead said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson preferred to cite an intangible aspect of Woods'
success in already winning 18 times on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``His desire to be the best ever,'' Watson said. ``That's there
and he backs it up.''
</P>
<P>
   With six consecutive victories on the PGA Tour recently, Woods
was linked to Byron Nelson's record 11 straight in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the champions dinner here every year, I'm the emcee,'' the
88-year-old Nelson said. ``When I got up to start it Tuesday night,
I said, `I want to thank Tiger Woods for making today's young
people know what I did 55 years ago.' He just looked up at me and
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to answer your question, what impresses me the most about
him is the fact that, as good as he is as the golfer who's
considered the best player in the world and maybe the best ever,
yet he's still not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all his wealth, he still has the drive, he still has the
desire to play golf as well as he can. I just admire the way he
carries himself, but in a way, I feel sorry for him. Back when I
played well, I had about one-thousandth of the attention he's
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if he doesn't win here this year, Tiger Woods will
still be getting that attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one Tiger Woods,'' Jack Nicklaus said. ``Not only
what he's done by his record but how he has handled himself and how
he's played and the way he overpowers a golf course. He has no
weaknesses in his golf game. He's an amazing young man.''
</P>
<P>
   As the old masters of the Masters agree.

NFL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Redskins Control Future of the NFL East
</P>
<P>
   When the Washington Redskins officials and scouts gather for
their draft meetings, there is almost a giddy feeling in the room.
That is because they know what every other team knows: The Redskins
will control the direction of the National Football League draft
next Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins own the second and third overall picks, which
almost guarantees that they will get a good player unless they make
a trade. The draft is an imprecise science, and it is possible the
Redskins could make a bad pick with one of those early selections.
But the chances of the Redskins _ especially with a skilled talent
evaluator like Vinny Cerrato running their draft _ picking two
consecutive busts are extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Redskins are in an enviable position. They already
have a team loaded with talent, and now they have the opportunity
to draft at least one of the Penn State stars in defensive lineman
Courtney Brown and linebacker LaVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   There are some in the league who believe that the Cleveland
Browns, who have the first pick, might still draft wide receiver
Peter Warrick of Florida State, despite their somewhat public
souring on the player. That would leave Washington the chance to
pick Arrington and Brown, a coup of major proportions and one that
could change the balance of power in the National Football
Conference East for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Washington does, whether they trade one of their picks,
or use both of them, will determine what the rest of us do in the
first round on draft day,'' one NFC general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is flirting with the idea of trading its third pick
to the Jets as part of a deal for wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.
Several personnel executives say that would be a mistake for the
Redskins because Johnson could potentially ruin their salary-cap
situation, and also because the team has a chance to get two
players who could help turn around the team's poor defense.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington has been compared to Lawrence Taylor, an overblown
parallel to be certain, but not completely outrageous since
Arrington has displayed the same kind of athleticism that Taylor
did. Brown might be the next Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   If the Redskins could somehow get both players, which is a
possibility, they would improve their defense dramatically. Johnson
could help an already explosive Redskins offense only so much.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not an easy decision. The Redskins definitely have
some tough choices to make. Surely, however, every team wishes they
had Washington's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Way a Giants' Concern
</P>
<P>
   Giants fullback Charles Way, one of the most professional
players in football, continues to have serious problems with his
injured right knee. In fact, the difficulties are so serious that
they could affect his career.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the Giants are almost certain to draft a running
back.
</P>
<P>
   Way recently had cartilage from a cadaver transplanted into his
knee to make it sturdier. While amateur athletes and nonathletes
have undergone this procedure, it has rarely been attempted with
professional football players.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was considered a success, but Way has been
experienced some difficulty, and he was scheduled to have
arthroscopic surgery this month to clean up other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Way is entering only his sixth NFL season, but according to a
league official he has been told by the team's medical staff that
his knee problems could significantly shorten his career. The
Giants are so concerned about Way that Coach Jim Fassel has been
told he must use Way sparingly in training camp and maybe during
the season. There is a small chance that Way could be forced to
retire after this coming season.
</P>
<P>
   If his knee does not hold up, the team will look to his backup,
Greg Comella.
</P>
<P>
   Blank Seeks New Pact
</P>
<P>
   Brad Blank, the agent for Giants guard Ron Stone, has contacted
the team about renegotiating the lineman's contract. Blank and
General Manager Ernie Accorsi will most likely speak after the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Stone has two years remaining on his contract, but he wants to
become the highest-paid guard in the league. That would mean that
the team would have to pay him around $4 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Stone will not hold out if he does not get a new deal before the
season because his agent and the Giants have a friendly
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Burress Upsets Eagles
</P>
<P>
   Teams are attempting to screen bad apples from their draft
boards and will continue to do so in the days leading to the draft.
The Denver Broncos have removed more than 10 players with troubled
pasts from their board, and other teams are believed to have done
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yet teams can go too far in this pursuit of the flawless athlete
_ there is no better example of this than what is happening to wide
receiver Plaxico Burress of Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Burress' stock has quietly, but rapidly, fallen in recent days.
Just last month he was projected by many teams as a top-10 pick.
Now, he could fall into the middle of the first round, or lower,
because of rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Burress claims the problem started with the Philadelphia Eagles.
He rescheduled a visit with the team once Michigan State made it to
the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball
championship game; Burress wanted to attend the game since some of
his close friends are on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Other NFL teams Burress was scheduled to visit around the same
time, including the Jets, simply made another appointment with
Burress. The Eagles, however, remained upset, and canceled the
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Burress claims, soon after that, a whispering campaign
began that he possessed a bad attitude. Other rumors followed _
which Burress claims are not true. In fact, one team executive
said, as far as he can tell, Burress has no documented off-field
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have I done to people for them to say this type of stuff
about me?'' Burress said. ``I have never had any on-the-field or
off-the-field problems. I don't hang around people that are
troublemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   His situation shows there may be some innocent victims who are
swept up in the league's attempt to clean up its image.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is telling the difference between a player like
Burress, and someone who is guilty of serious indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler Working Out
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hostetler, the former Oakland Raiders and Giants
quarterback, continues to work out in West Virginia awaiting
another chance to play professional football. Hostetler is still
good enough to play backup for a team, maybe even start, which
makes one wonder why teams pass on him, but continue to go for
longtime busts like Rick Mirer ... The XFL _ the World Wrestling
Federation's new league _ is successfully recruiting players from
the Canadian Football League and the Arena Football League. But
what will the quality of football be like? ... Look for Kent
Graham, the former Giants quarterback who is with Pittsburgh
backing up Kordell Stewart, to be starting by the fourth or fifth
game if Stewart has a slow start. The Steelers plan to have a quick
hook ... The National Football League Players Association continues
to build its strike war chest, just in case the amicable
relationship that exists between the owners and the players breaks
down when the collective-bargaining agreement expires four years
from now.

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Caruso, Javier Valentin and Brett Tomko spent the past two
seasons in the major leagues. All have started this season in the
minor leagues. So have Joe McEwing, Jason Johnson, Chad Allen and
Doug Mientkiewicz. All thought they had left the minors behind, but
it is back to buses and fast-food dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a very humbling game,'' McEwing said. ``It can come
up and bite you any time.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwing, who can play nearly anywhere on the field, spent seven
seasons all over the minors, then finally won a job with St. Louis
last season. He played 152 games and batted a respectable .275.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Cardinals traded him to the Mets during spring
training, it was a setback. The Mets needed a backup shortstop, and
they felt he was Kurt Abbott, not McEwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you can't control,'' McEwing said, speaking
on the telephone in the Norfolk Tides' clubhouse. The trade and the
results for him were among those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to worry about it because it's only negative
thoughts,'' the 27-year-old McEwing added. ``I was shocked in the
beginning, but that's because I spent nine years in the Cardinal
organization. But I'm happy to be a Met. Sometime during the year,
I want to be a piece of the puzzle and help that team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso was the Chicago White Sox' starting shortstop for two
years, vaulting to the majors from Class A at the age of 20. But he
played poorly defensively, and his offensive production plummeted
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple years ago, Ozzie Guillen had slipped and we didn't
have a shortstop ready,'' Ron Schueler, the White Sox general
manager, said. ``Mike played very well in spring training. We
pushed him and he responded and had a heck of a year. Like any
other 20-year-old kid, he went home and didn't do anything, didn't
get stronger. When he came back, he wasn't ready. He had a bad
year, and we had to go out and get someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Valentin, Javier's older brother, is the White Sox
shortstop now. Caruso is playing for the Charlotte Knights in Class
AAA, a level where Caruso had never played.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was a little angry, because I was told I had a
chance to compete for the spot,'' Caruso said. ``I prepared myself
for that during the winter. I felt I had a good spring. I did the
things I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso said he initially felt he was taking a step backward but
decided, ``I don't have time to think about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work hard here not just to get back to the big
leagues but to prove to myself that I can have a good year,'' he
said. ``I have to work on my skills and hope they get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Schueler hopes for a rapid return. ``If he went down with the
attitude he had this spring, he'll be back real quick,'' the
general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was in Baltimore's pitching rotation for 21 starts
last season (8-7, 5.46 earned run average), could also be back in
the majors before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a typical young pitcher,'' Syd Thrift, the Orioles' chief
of baseball operations, said of the 26-year-old right-hander. ``I'm
not sure if he was trying too hard or what he was really doing, but
he had one real good outing against the Mets and the rest of the
time he was erratic with his command.''
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson was doing in spring training was ``working on
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told I had a job as one of the starters so I was working
on stuff,'' he said from Scranton, Pa., where Rochester opened the
International League season. ``I was competing, but not as
intensely. I just took it too lightly. I plan on doing well my
first three or four starts and getting out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko, who went to Seattle when Ken Griffey Jr. moved to
Cincinnati, had already had experience returning to the minors. The
Reds sent him there for the first half of last year. He arrived in
camp this spring with an Achilles problem, could not get in enough
innings and wound up No. 6 in a five-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners very likely will bring him back if one of their
starters encounters a problem or they want to bolster their
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling when, or if, the Minnesota Twins' trio of
Allen, Mientkiewicz and Valentin will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some things happen here last year that looked like we
were progressing,'' Terry Ryan, the Twins' general manager, said.
``Then things fell apart in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was the team's starting left fielder last season,
Mientkiewicz the primary first baseman and Valentin a platooned
catcher who was in line to replace the retired Terry Steinbach as
the regular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I announced the first day of spring training that most of the
positions are open here,'' Manager Tom Kelly said. ``Out of
necessity last year a number of young players were given an
opportunity. That doesn't mean that same opportunity is there, that
we're going to hand you a job. Ryan brought in people to compete
for the positions. That's what it ended up, a pretty good
competition for us where we had to do some picking instead of
handing. I think a few of the fellows thought they were locked in
despite the warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Allen had a poor spring and was outplayed ``by every
outfielder we had in camp.'' Valentin and Mientkiewicz, he said,
probably should have been given more learning time in the minors
before being brought to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably did those fellows a disservice,'' Kelly said.
``But out of necessity, we did what we had to do. You feel a little
bad about it, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Homer Happy
</P>
<P>
   Looking for early signs of the season? How about the new trend
in home runs? In the first days of the season, hitters have not
been content with hitting one home run in a game; two seems to be a
better number.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five days of the season (not counting the two days
in Japan), 15 players hit a pair of home runs in a game. In the
corresponding period last season, only four players whacked two in
the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Those four players all did it in the National League; five
hitters performed the feat last week in the NL. The American League
last year had none in that time; this year 10 (through Friday
night) players have deposited the ball over the fence twice,
including two pairs of teammates, each pair doing it in the same
game and both pairs doing it on opening day: Tony Batista and
Shannon Stewart of Toronto and Ivan Rodriguez and Gabe Kapler of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to make realistic projections, but if hitters
keep lighting it up, the home run total will rise again this
season. Last year, home runs increased 9 percent _ from 5,064 to
5,528 _ over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   You Can Call Them Johnson
</P>
<P>
   The development will not make any record books, but for the
first time in major league history, three catchers named Johnson
started on opening day last week: Charles Johnson for Baltimore,
Brian Johnson for Kansas City and Mark Johnson for the Chicago
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   As common a name as Johnson is, very few Johnsons have been
major league catchers. Other than this season's three, baseball
encyclopedias show only six others who caught in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   One was Elmer, who caught in 11 games for the New York Giants in
1914; that was the extent of his major league career. Another was
Ron, who caught two games for Kansas City in 1983; he played in
only 20 other games over three seasons. Larry caught in nine games
for three teams in a 12-game career over five seasons in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby was a catcher in 81 games of his 98-game career in three
seasons with Texas in the early '80s. Darrell, who would manage the
Boston Red Sox to the 1975 World Series, played for seven teams in
six seasons in the '50s and '60s and caught in 124 games of his
134-game career.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Cliff, whose 179 games behind the plate were the
most any Johnson caught before Charles arrived in the majors. Cliff
is noteworthy this season for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees try to become the first team since the 1972-74
Oakland A's to win three successive World Series, it is recalled
that a major reason the Yankees did not get a chance for their
third straight 21 years ago was the clubhouse fight in April
between Johnson and Rich Gossage. Gossage, the Yankees'
irreplaceable closer, tore a ligament in his right thumb in the
fight and missed 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A Vote for Bagwell
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio, Houston's second baseman, bristles when he hears
people talk about how the National League Central has three great
home run hitters, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one,'' Biggio said. ``His name's Bagwell. Except his
name doesn't get mentioned with those guys because he hasn't hit 50
home runs. That's really the sad thing about it. People have this
criteria when you hit 50 home runs you're a power hitter. What
people don't understand or don't care about is the Astrodome is the
biggest ballpark in the league. Baggy would be hitting 55, 60 a
year if he played in some of the other parks. If Baggy had played
in Seattle, he'd have as many home runs as Junior. I've seen him
hit so many long balls that fell short at the Astrodome.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit 115 home runs the past three years compared
with 193 for McGwire, 165 for Sosa and 160 for Griffey. But Bagwell
no longer has to contend with the Astrodome. This weekend the
Astros began playing in Enron Field, which promises to be
friendlier to hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how many home runs he hits this year in the new
park,'' Biggio said. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He had hoped it would be different. But as the
forms roll in _ or, more accurately, do not roll in _ Kenneth
Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, is beginning to doubt that
he will meet his twin goals for the 2000 census: persuading 70
percent of Americans to return their forms, and sparking a new wave
of American civic engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we end up at 61 percent, I would give a very good grade to
the Census Bureau,'' Prewitt said last week. ``But not a good grade
_ maybe a C _ for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the census a fair measure of the country turning inward?
Or are there other explanations for what appears to be public
apathy toward the decennial head count?
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting response rate to the census over the years _ from
83 percent in 1970, the first year that forms were sent by mail, to
65 percent in 1990 _ parallels a well-documented trend of voter
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the purposes and procedures of voting are more clear;
the once-a-decade census is hardly habit-forming. Focus groups
conducted by the Census Bureau found that for most people, the
census is an obscure governmental function that they don't
understand. Nor do they have any sense that it benefits them.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Internet age, when the country is awash in anxiety
about the vulnerability of personal information, the census has
been caught in a web of privacy concerns. A vocal, mostly
conservative contingent has put forth sometimes Orwellian visions
of a government that cannot be trusted with any personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The main target of the criticism is the long form, with its 53
questions covering everything from income to plumbing, although
questions have arisen about the short form as well. About 48
percent of long forms have been returned so far this year, compared
with 57 percent by this time a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Robert
Smith of New Hampshire, a conservative Republican, that vowed
``that no American will be prosecuted, fined or in any way harassed
by the federal government or its agents for failure to respond to
any census questions which refer to an individual's race, national
origin, living conditions, personal habits or mental and/or
physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that citizens would be hauled into court in any
case. Still, the conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation has
offered to defend anyone prosecuted for such civil disobedience.
Its president, Matt Glavin, does not see the lack of participation
as a civic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise of concerns over privacy issues'' over the Internet
``and hackers getting into government and private databases _ that
in and of itself is an indication of civic involvement,'' Glavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the census were taking place in a more conducive
environment, some scholars of American culture say the bureau would
still have trouble gaining the participation of the public. After
all, return rates for the census had been declining for three
decades, well before concerns about the Internet and privacy had
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Putnam, a professor of public policy at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, places the
unwillingness to fill out census forms alongside the decline in
community bowling leagues, neighborhood bars and, of course, voting
_ all signs that Americans have become more alienated from, and
less caring about, one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story is not political alienation or worries about
privacy,'' said Putnam, author of the forthcoming book ``Bowling
Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster). ``We attend 60 percent fewer club meetings than we did a
generation ago. We go on 60 percent fewer picnics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of community connectedness that is the
strongest predictor of how people respond to the census,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, officials estimated that 61 percent of households
would return the forms this year. But Prewitt had hoped the the
Census Bureau's $102 million advertising campaign would push the
response rate up to 70 percent. Now that seems unlikely. Given the
trends in American civic life, and the news, it may be more
surprising that the response rate is as high as it is.

   But is the census a fair measure of the country turning inward?
Or are there other explanations for what appears to be public
apathy toward the decennial head count?
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting response rate to the census over the years _ from
83 percent in 1970, the first year that forms were sent by mail, to
65 percent in 1990 _ parallels a well-documented trend of voter
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the purposes and procedures of voting are more clear;
the once-a-decade census is hardly habit-forming. Focus groups
conducted by the Census Bureau found that for most people, the
census is an obscure governmental function that they don't
understand. Nor do they have any sense that it benefits them.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Internet age, when the country is awash in anxiety
about the vulnerability of personal information, the census has
been caught in a web of privacy concerns. A vocal, mostly
conservative contingent has put forth sometimes Orwellian visions
of a government that cannot be trusted with any personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The main target of the criticism is the long form, with its 53
questions covering everything from income to plumbing, although
questions have arisen about the short form as well. About 48
percent of long forms have been returned so far this year, compared
with 57 percent by this time a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Robert
Smith of New Hampshire, a conservative Republican, that vowed
``that no American will be prosecuted, fined or in any way harassed
by the federal government or its agents for failure to respond to
any census questions which refer to an individual's race, national
origin, living conditions, personal habits or mental and/or
physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that citizens would be hauled into court in any
case. Still, the conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation has
offered to defend anyone prosecuted for such civil disobedience.
Its president, Matt Glavin, does not see the lack of participation
as a civic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise of concerns over privacy issues'' over the Internet
``and hackers getting into government and private databases _ that
in and of itself is an indication of civic involvement,'' Glavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the census were taking place in a more conducive
environment, some scholars of American culture say the bureau would
still have trouble gaining the participation of the public. After
all, return rates for the census had been declining for three
decades, well before concerns about the Internet and privacy had
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Putnam, a professor of public policy at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, places the
unwillingness to fill out census forms alongside the decline in
community bowling leagues, neighborhood bars and, of course, voting
_ all signs that Americans have become more alienated from, and
less caring about, one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story is not political alienation or worries about
privacy,'' said Putnam, author of the forthcoming book ``Bowling
Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster). ``We attend 60 percent fewer club meetings than we did a
generation ago. We go on 60 percent fewer picnics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of community connectedness that is the
strongest predictor of how people respond to the census,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, officials estimated that 61 percent of households
would return the forms this year. But Prewitt had hoped the the
Census Bureau's $102 million advertising campaign would push the
response rate up to 70 percent. Now that seems unlikely. Given the
trends in American civic life, and the news, it may be more
surprising that the response rate is as high as it is.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-AMERICANISM (Paris) _ In Europe, experts say, there is a
growing backlash of anti-Americanism. More and more often,
Europeans talk about America as a menacing, even dangerous force
intent on remaking the world in its image. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   MONTENEGRO-AFTERSHOCKS (Rozaje, Yugoslavia) _ A year ago, the
people of this little town took in tens of thousands of refugees
from the Serbian rampage through Kosovo. Today, the folk of Rozaje
have received little thanks for their open-armed welcome of Kosovo
Albanians. In fact, at least 10 inhabitants _ who, though mostly
Muslim, are Slavs _ have lost their lives in revenge attacks by
Albanians in Kosovo just because they spoke Serbian, instead of
Albanian. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-ELECTION (Lima, Peru) _ For a decade, President Alberto
Fujimori has been Latin America's master of crisis management,
defeating terrorist insurrections, hyperinflation and drug
traffickers. But as 14 million voters decide on Sunday whether
these successes should translate into five more years in office,
Fujimori faces his most serious political crisis since he shut down
the Congress and Supreme Court at the height of the guerrilla war
in 1992. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-POLITICS (Maracaibo, Venezuela) _ For the second time
in two years, a former military officer vowing to dismantle a
corrupt and incompetent status quo has emerged to challenge
Venezuela's political establishment. This time, though, Hugo Chavez
is not the leader of the insurgency, but its main target _ and it
is one of his closest comrades in arms who is trying to drive him
from the presidency he has held for just 14 months. By Larry
Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ANGOLA-OIL (Luanda, Angola) _ For decades, reality in Angola has
been ruled by the paradox of plenty. Angola's oil wealth has helped
to pay for an endless war between President Eduardo dos Santos and
his bitter foe, Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita rebels. That, in
turn, has meant poverty for almost all Angolans. If the paradox
holds, Angola is ripe for even more misery. Recent offshore
discoveries have made it one of the hottest oil-producing countries
in the world. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-TRADE (Washington) _ The Clinton administration is opposing
a proposal that would boost exports from the world's poorest and
most indebted nations, for fear that it would inflame sentiments
against imports in Congress and threaten some of President
Clinton's other international economic initiatives. By David E.
Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-BANK-PROTESTS (Washington) _ Many of the people who
disrupted the Seattle meeting of the World Trade Organization are
reassembling in Washington this week, where they have identified as
their targets two older, richer and savvier agents of the global
economy: the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Students, church groups, environmentalists, and labor unions, a few
of them planning to scale buildings and block traffic to make their
point, say they want to disrupt the spring meetings at the bank and
the fund. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-TECHNOLOGY (Berlin) _ Underfunded, state-run German
universities have been very slow to adapt their traditional
curricula to reflect the explosive growth of Internet-related
industries. As a result, in a country with more than 4 million
unemployed, there are an estimated 75,000 to 100,000 jobs vacant in
the booming Internet sector, with few Germans apparently qualified
to fill them. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   GREECE-ELECTION (Athens, Greece) _ For Greeks, their economy,
their standing in Europe, and even their tense relationship with
Turkey are better now than at any time since World War II. And it
is this new confidence that could form Socialist Prime Minister
Costas Simitis' biggest liability in what has shaped up to be an
extremely close race for re-election on Sunday against his
challenger, Costas Karamanlis, leader of the center-right New
Democracy Party. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RAMPAGE-KILLERS (Undated) _ They are not drunk or high on drugs.
They are not racists or Satanists. Most are white men, but a
surprising number are women, Asians and blacks. Many have college
degrees, but most are unemployed. Many are military veterans. That
is the profile of the 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks examined
by The New York Times in a computer-assisted study looking back
more than 50 years. First in a four-part series. By Ford Fessenden.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-INFO (Undated) _ A growing number of companies are
making medical information services available to their employees to
help them navigate through the mass of medical information
available today. These companies believe that their employees will
get better care, and they hope their workers will be less inclined
to proceed with treatments deemed not appropriate. Many companies
also view the added services as a way to attract and retain
employees. But in the longer run, many employers that offer the
added advice are also trying to prepare their employees for a shift
the companies hope to make toward a system of vouchers for medical
care. By Milt Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-JANITORS-STRIKE (Los Angeles) _ In the 15 years Maria
Santania has worked as a janitor here, her pay has increased $2 an
hour, to $6.50. But her rent amounts to more than two weeks of her
salary before taxes. So on Friday, she joined thousands of striking
janitors _ police and union officials estimated a crowd of 3,000 _
marching down Wilshire Boulevard in search of a larger pay
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ADMISSIONS-POLICIES (Undated) _ The U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights plans this week to issue a harsh critique of policies in
Florida, Texas and California that have replaced affirmative action
with admission to public universities for the top graduates in
every high school in the state. A draft of the 10-page statement
notes that the programs' successes in bringing minorities to
campuses relies on the segregation of high schools, and that they
do nothing to diversify graduate and professional schools. By Jodi
Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   EARTH-DAY (Seattle) _ With 4,500 organizations planning events
in more than 180 countries, the 30th Earth Day is living up to its
name in a way that was not true for the first Earth Day, which was
largely a domestic affair. But if much has changed over the years
about Earth Day, one thing about this year's event is strikingly
similar to the original: Denis Hayes is leading the effort. By Sam
Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY (Washington) _ Developments in the Elian Gonzalez
case. By John Broder.
</P>
<P>
   SEQUOIA-PROTECT (Los Angeles) _ Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman has recommended that 355,000 acres of national forest be
given monument status to safeguard about half the giant sequoia
groves remaining in the United States. By Barbara Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-SPRING-BREAK (Port Aransas, Texas) _ Out on the back porch
of Woody's bait stand, off the Gulf of Mexico, Johnny Mathews, a
fishing guide, flicks the foam from a cold beer and weighs in on
the topic of students on spring break: ``It's not that they're bad
people. They just don't know how to act like normal people.'' By
Ross E. Milloy.

<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-CONVENTION (Los Angeles) _ This past winter, the Democratic
National Convention looked like a disaster in the making.
Fund-raising was behind schedule. The billionaire moguls who helped
lure the convention appeared to be bickering among themselves.
Finally, Mayor Richard J. Riordan ousted the head of the local host
committee and replaced her with a trusted deputy, then got on the
telephone and began dialing for dollars himself. Now, local and
Democratic Party officials say they are confident the convention
will be a worthy successor to the one that nominated John F.
Kennedy in 1960. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>

Crossing party lines and making enemies; A poll finds voters less

</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REPUBS (Washington) _ A year after House Republicans spoke
glowingly of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas as a life raft who would
carry them to victory, congressional leaders and Bush aides have
scotched talk of a common legislative agenda and are pursuing
distinct electoral strategies of their own. By Alison Mitchell.

<P>
   Are toddlers being plied with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful
drugs for behavior problems no more severe than sticking pennies
into the VCR, throwing peas at the dinner table or refusing to go
to bed on time?
</P>
<P>
   The hand-wringing in recent weeks over a study that documented
an acute increase in the prescription of psychiatric medications _
primarily stimulants and antidepressants _ for preschoolers over a
five-year period would suggest just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health professionals have painted young children as
the latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes and
disorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to condemn
the ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens. On March
20, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a major federal initiative to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as often happens when science goes to Washington, the
complexities that underlie the study's findings have been slighted
in the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   And while concern over the rise in prescriptions is warranted,
outrage may be premature. In fact, scientists know almost nothing
about the children who are receiving such drugs, or the
circumstances under which the medications are being prescribed. The
study in question, for example, published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, did not analyze information about the
children's diagnoses or the specialties of the physicians who wrote
the prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   What little researchers and clinicians do know suggests that the
increases cannot be solely attributed to reckless prescribing by
doctors hell-bent on tagging a psychiatric label on every child who
walks into the consulting room.
</P>
<P>
   While pressure on parents and the current popularity of
diagnoses like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
depression undoubtedly play a role, it is also clear that at least
some proportion of very young children taking psychiatric drugs
have severe troubles. And in many cases, the drugs are given as a
last resort, prescribed in the hope of protecting the child's
safety, ensuring the safety of others or offering relief to a
toddler whose life is being swallowed up by symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general public doesn't understand that we're not
talking about kids who won't stay in the grocery cart,'' said Dr.
Marsha D. Rappley, an associate professor in pediatrics and human
medicine at Michigan State University and the lead investigator in
a smaller 15-month study of medication use in preschoolers with
attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about very disturbed behavior,'' Rappley said.
``And these children need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rappley's study, which tracked 223 children under the age of 3
who were enrolled in a Michigan Medicaid program, has been cited in
the public debate as one more indication that very young children
are being drugged unnecessarily. Yet a closer look at the study,
one of the few to offer clues to who these young pill takers are,
does not entirely bear out that view.
</P>
<P>
   True, Rappley and her colleagues found that 57 percent of the
children were given psychiatric medications. And of that group,
45.7 percent were prescribed more than one drug. In all, 30
combinations of 22 psychiatric medications were observed.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers also found that almost half the preschoolers
in the study suffered from diabetes, asthma or other major chronic
illnesses in addition to the attention disorder. Almost half had
other psychiatric problems, including developmental or language
delays, emotional disturbance and autism. Five percent were victims
of child abuse or other traumas. And 40 percent were treated for an
injury during the study period, 12 percent on more than one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot really be dismissed as bad behavior on the part of
doctors who want to medicate children,'' Dr. Rappley said. ``It is
not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter S. Jensen, director of the Center for the Advancement
of Children's Mental Health at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute, said the level of severity found in the Michigan study
meshed with his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents are terribly frightened and loath to put a child
on medication, and it's the kind of thing they would do when
everything else has been tried,'' said Jensen, who added that
medication is usually combined with behavior therapy or parenting
advice. In one case he recalled, a 3-year-old showed an escalating
pattern of severe aggression, eventually wounding another child in
his day-care center with a butter knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that 6 to 9 percent of older kids have severe
emotional disturbances,'' Jensen said. ``Do we think it happens out
of the brow of Zeus? Where were these kids at the age of 3 or 4 or
5? To my mind, the crime is not that these children are being put
on medicine, but that we don't have the data to know what we are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, scientists' ignorance is at the core of the problem.
Investigators have no idea, for example, how prevalent severe
mental disorders are among the very young, what the best ways to
treat such illnesses might be or which children are most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And even when doctors prescribe medication in a last-ditch
attempt to help a very disturbed child, they are operating in a
data vacuum: little or nothing is known about the effects of
psychiatric drugs on the developing brain or the long-term impact
on social relations, academic achievement or personality in young
children who take such drugs. And most of the medications have not
been specifically tested or had their dosages calibrated for young
children.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Julie Magno Zito, an associate professor of pharmacy and
medicine at the University of Maryland and the lead author of the
recent journal study, commented when asked about the prescription
increases: ``We don't have any benchmarks to know if this is or is
not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the line between normality and clinical illness in
a 3-year-old is rarely clearly defined. Dr. Alison Gopnik, a
developmental psychologist at the University of California at
Berkeley, said many aspects of behavior _ like impulse control, the
ability to focus and empathy _ vary greatly from child to child,
and develop at different ages.
</P>
<P>
   Gopnik said she was disturbed by ``the idea of doing this in
preschoolers, where the medical evidence isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think parents always have a good idea of what just
normal preschooler behavior is,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Gopnik said, there is a ``mismatch between what
children are like just as children, what schools require from
children and the time and energy parents have to negotiate that
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists still know little, if anything, about diagnosing
specific mental disorders in preschoolers. Studies indicate that
such diagnoses are often fluid, changing as the child grows older,
though severe behavior problems often persist.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of hard data, few experts would dispute that the
sharp increase in prescriptions for toddlers is disturbing,
particularly over so brief a period. Nor would most deny that the
trend raises larger social and ethical questions. Zito, for
example, said that at some point, society must decide how far down
the age scale the medical model, which relies on diagnoses of
illness and is likely to see drugs as the appropriate treatment,
should be extended. ``We are generalizing from adults to school-age
children, and now from school-age children to very young
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, a former associate director for child and adolescent
research at the National Institute of Mental Health, said the
federal government shares much of the blame for the dearth of
knowledge about how to evaluate the use of drugs. Federal agencies,
he said, have not yet provided high levels of research funding to
study children's mental health.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. Responding to the outcry over Zito's
study, the National Institute of Mental Health said it would spend
$6 million over the next five years to study whether Ritalin is
safe and effective for children under 6. And the White House is
planning a conference next fall on mental illness in preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, scientists may learn whether the increase in drug
prescriptions charted by Zito and her colleagues represent
overmedication or appropriate _ in some cases, lifesaving _
treatment for young children.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage is easy; it is harder, and more expensive, to find real
answers.

<P>
   Are toddlers being plied with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful
drugs for behavior problems no more severe than sticking pennies
into the VCR, throwing peas at the dinner table or refusing to go
to bed on time?
</P>
<P>
   The hand-wringing in recent weeks over a study that documented
an acute increase in the prescription of psychiatric medications _
primarily stimulants and antidepressants _ for preschoolers over a
five-year period would suggest just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some mental health professionals have painted young children as
the latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes and
disorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to condemn
the ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens. On March
20, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a major federal initiative to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as often happens when science goes to Washington, the
complexities that underlie the study's findings have been slighted
in the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   And while concern over the rise in prescriptions is warranted,
outrage may be premature. In fact, scientists know almost nothing
about the children who are receiving such drugs, or the
circumstances under which the medications are being prescribed. The
study in question, for example, published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, did not analyze information about the
children's diagnoses or the specialties of the physicians who wrote
the prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   What little researchers and clinicians do know suggests that the
increases cannot be solely attributed to reckless prescribing by
doctors hell-bent on tagging a psychiatric label on every child who
walks into the consulting room.
</P>
<P>
   While pressure on parents and the current popularity of
diagnoses like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
depression undoubtedly play a role, it is also clear that at least
some proportion of very young children taking psychiatric drugs
have severe troubles. And in many cases, the drugs are given as a
last resort, prescribed in the hope of protecting the child's
safety, ensuring the safety of others or offering relief to a
toddler whose life is being swallowed up by symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general public doesn't understand that we're not
talking about kids who won't stay in the grocery cart,'' said Dr.
Marsha D. Rappley, an associate professor in pediatrics and human
medicine at Michigan State University and the lead investigator in
a smaller 15-month study of medication use in preschoolers with
attention disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about very disturbed behavior,'' Rappley said.
``And these children need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rappley's study, which tracked 223 children under the age of 3
who were enrolled in a Michigan Medicaid program, has been cited in
the public debate as one more indication that very young children
are being drugged unnecessarily. Yet a closer look at the study,
one of the few to offer clues to who these young pill takers are,
does not entirely bear out that view.
</P>
<P>
   True, Rappley and her colleagues found that 57 percent of the
children were given psychiatric medications. And of that group,
45.7 percent were prescribed more than one drug. In all, 30
combinations of 22 psychiatric medications were observed.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers also found that almost half the preschoolers
in the study suffered from diabetes, asthma or other major chronic
illnesses in addition to the attention disorder. Almost half had
other psychiatric problems, including developmental or language
delays, emotional disturbance and autism. Five percent were victims
of child abuse or other traumas. And 40 percent were treated for an
injury during the study period, 12 percent on more than one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot really be dismissed as bad behavior on the part of
doctors who want to medicate children,'' Dr. Rappley said. ``It is
not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter S. Jensen, director of the Center for the Advancement
of Children's Mental Health at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute, said the level of severity found in the Michigan study
meshed with his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents are terribly frightened and loath to put a child
on medication, and it's the kind of thing they would do when
everything else has been tried,'' said Jensen, who added that
medication is usually combined with behavior therapy or parenting
advice. In one case he recalled, a 3-year-old showed an escalating
pattern of severe aggression, eventually wounding another child in
his day-care center with a butter knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that 6 to 9 percent of older kids have severe
emotional disturbances,'' Jensen said. ``Do we think it happens out
of the brow of Zeus? Where were these kids at the age of 3 or 4 or
5? To my mind, the crime is not that these children are being put
on medicine, but that we don't have the data to know what we are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, scientists' ignorance is at the core of the problem.
Investigators have no idea, for example, how prevalent severe
mental disorders are among the very young, what the best ways to
treat such illnesses might be or which children are most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And even when doctors prescribe medication in a last-ditch
attempt to help a very disturbed child, they are operating in a
data vacuum: little or nothing is known about the effects of
psychiatric drugs on the developing brain or the long-term impact
on social relations, academic achievement or personality in young
children who take such drugs. And most of the medications have not
been specifically tested or had their dosages calibrated for young
children.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Julie Magno Zito, an associate professor of pharmacy and
medicine at the University of Maryland and the lead author of the
recent journal study, commented when asked about the prescription
increases: ``We don't have any benchmarks to know if this is or is
not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the line between normality and clinical illness in
a 3-year-old is rarely clearly defined. Dr. Alison Gopnik, a
developmental psychologist at the University of California at
Berkeley, said many aspects of behavior _ like impulse control, the
ability to focus and empathy _ vary greatly from child to child,
and develop at different ages.
</P>
<P>
   Gopnik said she was disturbed by ``the idea of doing this in
preschoolers, where the medical evidence isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think parents always have a good idea of what just
normal preschooler behavior is,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Gopnik said, there is a ``mismatch between what
children are like just as children, what schools require from
children and the time and energy parents have to negotiate that
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists still know little, if anything, about diagnosing
specific mental disorders in preschoolers. Studies indicate that
such diagnoses are often fluid, changing as the child grows older,
though severe behavior problems often persist.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of hard data, few experts would dispute that the
sharp increase in prescriptions for toddlers is disturbing,
particularly over so brief a period. Nor would most deny that the
trend raises larger social and ethical questions. Zito, for
example, said that at some point, society must decide how far down
the age scale the medical model, which relies on diagnoses of
illness and is likely to see drugs as the appropriate treatment,
should be extended. ``We are generalizing from adults to school-age
children, and now from school-age children to very young
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, a former associate director for child and adolescent
research at the National Institute of Mental Health, said the
federal government shares much of the blame for the dearth of
knowledge about how to evaluate the use of drugs. Federal agencies,
he said, have not yet provided high levels of research funding to
study children's mental health.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. Responding to the outcry over Zito's
study, the National Institute of Mental Health said it would spend
$6 million over the next five years to study whether Ritalin is
safe and effective for children under 6. And the White House is
planning a conference next fall on mental illness in preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, scientists may learn whether the increase in drug
prescriptions charted by Zito and her colleagues represent
overmedication or appropriate _ in some cases, lifesaving _
treatment for young children.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage is easy; it is harder, and more expensive, to find real
answers.

<P>
   The scorecard in the Microsoft case, according to Attorney
General Janet Reno, is simple: Microsoft lost and America's
consumers won.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge ruled last week that Microsoft was a
monopolistic predator that had repeatedly violated the nation's
antitrust laws, Reno declared, ``Thanks to this ruling, consumers
who have been harmed can now look forward to benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Justice Department and 19 states who sued Microsoft
will propose to the court what sanctions should be taken against
the company. Before that happens, however, consider how consumers
and the computing world have fared since 1995, when the government
case against Microsoft began.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a personal computer has dropped sharply,
while PCs have grown more powerful and versatile. The industry has
generated growth, jobs and wealth _ even created, some say, a New
Economy that is the envy of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   So why  &UR; was &LR;  this costly and sweeping antitrust suit filed
against Microsoft nearly two years ago? The answer, according to
the government and many antitrust experts, is twofold: to enforce
the law and to support innovation.
</P>
<P>
   That is a new rationale for antitrust action, one adapted to the
New Economy. In the Standard Oil era, monopoly-busting was about
price-fixing. Now, the government claims, monopolies constrain
technological change. So the Microsoft case marks what may be an
important step in how government and the courts deal with the
Internet economy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional half of the government case was simply a litany
of anti-competitive practices: that Microsoft illegally tied its
Internet browser to its industry-standard Windows operating system,
and then used exclusionary contracts and threats to force computer
makers and Internet service providers to shun the products of
rivals like Netscape Communications, the pioneer in Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   It was the economic theory underpinning the government's case
that was novel. That theory leaned heavily on new thinking about
how modern high-technology markets work. In traditional antitrust
cases, high prices typically signal a gouging monopolist. There
was, in fact, evidence presented that the price of Windows, which
runs the basic operations of nearly 90 percent of PCs, would be
lower if the company had competition. And industry analysts
estimate that the pretax profit on Microsoft's Windows business is
an astronomical 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Windows accounts for only about 5 percent of the total
price of most PCs sold today. So even if Windows prices are
slightly higher than they should be, it is not something that
consumers would notice. (Microsoft said it raised prices on Windows
because it has added all kinds of features in recent years.)
</P>
<P>
   But price seems a less reliable signal of monopolistic abuse
than it would be with, say, an oil producer or steel maker, because
the cost of producing copies of a software program is virtually
zero. Microsoft merely licenses its computer code to PC makers, who
then install it. Whether Microsoft sells 100 million or 200 million
copies, its costs are all in developing the code to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ground rules have changed economically in cases like this
and we realized that in bringing the Microsoft case,'' said Daniel
Rubinfeld, the chief economist of the Justice Department's
antitrust division until the end of 1998. ``And innovation, much
more than price, is what the Microsoft case is about.''
</P>
<P>
   The new economics of software, according to the government, mean
a dominant company like Microsoft can shape innovation and curb
competition with a new weapon _ its technology standard. Windows is
the gateway through which all the hardware and software used in the
vast majority of personal computers must pass. Microsoft, the
government charged, denied rivals early access to its technology,
while rewarding its industry friends with cooperation. That raised
the barrier to entry, in cost and difficulty, to challengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case, according to Rubinfeld, now a professor at
the University of California at Berkeley, marks the beginning of a
growing debate over government policy in markets that rely on
innovation, software and the Internet. These markets, he said, tend
to naturally evolve toward one or two dominant companies (think
Cisco in routers for Internet data or eBay in online auctions).
They control the technology standards in their markets. What
balance should be struck between protecting their intellectual
property and insuring that newcomers get a fair chance to compete?
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of policy,'' said Robert E. Hall, an economist at
Stanford University, ``is to make sure you hold the door open to
the next Netscape, to new entrants who bring innovation to the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the evidence in the antitrust case, Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson found last week that ``Microsoft mounted a
deliberate assault on entrepreneurial efforts that, left to rise or
fall on their own merits, could well have enabled the introduction
of competition'' to Microsoft's markets.
</P>
<P>
   In his fact-finding document last November, Jackson concluded
with an impassioned embrace of the innovation theory of consumer
harm. At the end of more than 200 pages examining Microsoft and its
conduct, he wrote, ``The ultimate result is that some innovations
that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason
that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self-interest.''

   Microsoft plans to appeal Jackson's ruling, and the company's

company. ``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers
know: that our software has helped make PCs accessible and more
affordable to millions of Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that the very acts the government claimed were
anti-competitive, like folding browsing software into Windows,
resulted in bringing the Internet to the PC-using masses. That was
real innovation, Microsoft believes, which deserves praise, not
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to speculate how things might have turned out
had Microsoft not, in Jackson's phrase, placed ``its oppressive
thumb on the scale of competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The most rapid innovation and most venture-capital investment in
recent years, experts note, have been in Internet computing,
outside Microsoft's stronghold in the personal computer business.
Innovation in Internet software, they note, might have gone even
faster had Microsoft's actions not hobbled Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the PC industry, they add, the most innovative company
recently has been the reinvigorated Apple Computer since its
cofounder Steven P. Jobs returned and took over in 1997. Again,
Apple is largely outside Microsoft's control because it uses its
own Macintosh operating system, instead of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hypothetical, but the argument is that sure things are
great in the high-tech economy, but they might have been even
better,'' observed David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard
Business School. ``All these things on the Internet would have
happened anyway, but they would have happened faster and the
quality would have been better without Microsoft's anti-competitive
acts.''

   Pitino Promises to Revive Celtics
</P>
<P>
   He shot back at venomous fans earlier this season, reminding the
Boston Celtics faithful that neither Larry Bird nor Kevin McHale
would be soon walking through the arena door, that those days live
only in memory. Some of his players openly feuded in front of him
during a game late last month, and he strongly considered
suspending them before deciding against the move.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight year, Rick Pitino maintains his passion
about returning a hallowed franchise to its former glory. And for
the third straight year, the Celtics are still a reclamation
project. They are not going to the playoffs again, fueling
speculation that Pitino will soon be working elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've found out anything, it's that the Celtics are the
Yankees of basketball,'' he said in a phone interview last
Thursday. ``The fans are not used to this. They should be unhappy.
I shouldn't be that surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, I look back, I had eight years in Kentucky where I
was treated better than most princes. I was coaching the Knicks and
we started selling out the Garden. In this business sometimes, you
just have to take the good with the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were making somewhat of a playoff push before
dropping nine straight games, a succession of last-second and
mostly competitive losses that took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   As the team president with final say on personnel matters,
Pitino insists he is not going anywhere until at least after next
season. Much of the reason stems from a belief that the team's
owner, Paul Gaston, refuses to buy out part of the $29 million
remaining on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three weeks ago, Pitino drove to Gaston's home and gave
him an alternative. ``I said, `Paul, if you feel at any point you
don't like the job we're doing, I'll go my own way and won't expect
to take your money with me,''' Pitino said he told Gaston.
``Instead of being negative, he was the direct opposite. Paul was
very excited about our future.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Celtics continue to falter next season, Pitino told
Gaston, he will surrender the balance of his seven-year, $50
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not turning the corner, I'd go to Paul and say, `You
have two choices,''' Pitino said. ```Blow up the team or you can
make a coaching change.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has done little but lose in the three weeks since his
meeting with Gaston. And while it appears Pitino will indeed remain
in charge, it would not be shocking if the Nets and other
franchises asked the Celtics for permission to speak with Pitino in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino attributes many of Boston's problems to an unlucky 1997
draft, in which the Celtics were nudged out for the first and
second picks in the lottery. Instead of Tim Duncan and Keith Van
Horn, they settled for Antoine Walker and Chauncey Billups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, unfortunately, the Ping-Pong balls determined my fate in
a way,'' Pitino said. ``You had a shot at 1-2. And you get 3 and 6.
But that's in the past. We've just had some unbelievably tough
losses lately. Buzzer-beater, buzzer-beater, double overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Pitino said he had no plans to return to
college, where he resurrected programs at Providence and Kentucky.
``I'm not packing in pro basketball,'' he said. ``If I'm done in
Boston, if it doesn't work out, I'll coach somewhere else. I have
not given up on the pro game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there are things I'm jaded about on the collegiate level.
The idea that kids are only staying for one and two years is
depressing. There are no stars at the collegiate level. They've all
gone to professional basketball. And the agents and AAU people are
infiltrating college ranks like you wouldn't believe.'' (The AAU is
the Amateur Athletic Union.)
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, 47, said he hoped to coach another six or seven years
and insisted that procuring another long-term multimillion-dollar
deal had nothing to do with his desire to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said, ``whoever said money can't buy you happiness
was a very wealthy man. But as coaches, winning is where we derive
our happiness. It's why most of us coach. This is not the way I
want to leave the Celtics, winning less than 40 games. We've still
got work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas in Demand to Coach
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas is at least several weeks away from becoming a
National Basketball Association coach. The former Pistons great,
who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for jobs in Atlanta,
Indiana and Dallas, is one of the most sought-after commodities on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC analyst since giving up his stake in the Toronto Raptors,
Thomas has been itching to get back in the league. But a potential
conflict of interest may derail his plans. Before he works for an
NBA team, league officials want him to sell the Continental
Basketball Association, which Thomas bought last year. They cite a
provision of NBA bylaws prohibiting an employee from owning any
portion of another basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine. But you wonder why no similar fuss was made when
Michael Jordan decided to take over the Washington Wizards and cut
a deal for part ownership. Jordan's footwear and apparel company,
the Jordan Brand, employs players like Ray Allen, Eddie Jones and
Vin Baker, who appear in television and print advertising for the
products and have endorsement deals through the company, a Nike
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Were Allen a free agent and the Wizards had salary-cap room,
wouldn't he consider signing on with a person with whom he already
has a business relationship?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not even comparable,'' Russ Granik, the league's
deputy commissioner, said. ``There is a clear provision regarding
employees owning pieces of other leagues. I just don't see a
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is staying mum on the issue, saying only, ``I think the
time is right for the NBA, the players association, the NCAA and
the CBA _ as the leaders in the basketball community _ come
together and help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Pacers and the Hawks seem more interested
than the Mavericks. Thomas bought property in Atlanta last year to
build a house, but said the decision had ``nothing to do with the
Atlanta Hawks or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think half the NBA lives in Atlanta,'' he said. ``Damon
Stoudamire just told me he was buying a place down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's Role
</P>
<P>
   It is not only Rasheed Wallace's fault. Many of his Portland
teammates are also to blame for the late-season meltdown of the
Trail Blazers, the league's most highly compensated and talented
team.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, as the Trail Blazers' lone All-Star, Wallace
inherits a leadership role. And on a relatively leaderless team,
you can't afford one of your most talented players to be the most
combustible.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Wallace earned two technical fouls milliseconds
apart, setting a record for technical fouls in a season with 34,
and an automatic ejection. Wallace surpassed the mark of 32
technicals by Charles Barkley in 1992-93 and 1994-95 with Phoenix
and tied by Dennis Rodman in 1993-94 with San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who has been ejected six times this season, earned his
35th technical on Thursday night in a dismal loss to Vancouver. He
has told teammates he will not lose his composure in the playoffs.
But he told some of them more than a month ago he would tone down
his incessant complaining.
</P>
<P>
   As the probable third-seeded team in the Western Conference,
Portland is looking at a first-round matchup with Minnesota or
perhaps San Antonio. On talent alone, the Blazers could get past
the Timberwolves and maybe the Spurs, wear down a possible
second-round opponent like Utah with their depth and meet the
Lakers in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   That would take mental toughness, a quality neither Wallace nor
his teammates possess at the moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Just read the title of his new book and you'll get an
idea of Noel Mamere's perspective: ``No Thanks, Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamere, an outspoken though hardly extreme member of the French
Parliament, has devoted an entire book to his argument that America
is a worrisome society these days. It has a record number of armed
citizens. It embraces the death penalty, turns the poor away when
they need medical care, and its legislators have failed to approve
a nuclear test ban. Yet, argues Mamere, the United States throws
its weight around and would have the entire world follow in its
steps.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, he says in his closing chapter, ``it is
appropriate to be downright anti-American.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, indeed in Europe, Mamere is by no means alone in his
criticism of the United States. Wander into a French bookstore
these days, and you will find any number of catchy titles (``The
World Is Not Merchandise,'' ``Who Is Killing France? The American
Strategy,'' ``American Totalitarianism'' to name a few) deploring
the American way _ from its creation of a society ruled by profit
motive to how the United States is now an unchecked force on its
way to ruling the world.
</P>
<P>
   The books are only one sign of what experts say is a growing
backlash of anti-Americanism. More and more often, Europeans talk
about America as a menacing, even dangerous force intent on
remaking the world in its image. And, like Mamere, many members of
Europe's political, cultural and intellectual elite are using a
kind of moral calculator to deplore the American model as severely
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Poking fun at America has always been a European pastime,
particularly among the French. In the past, Americans have been
ridiculed as Bermuda-shorts-wearing louts who call strangers by
their first names and know nothing about the good life. But today's
criticism is far from being an amusing rejection of food rituals.
Experts say that it has a virulence and an element of fear never
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the fall of the Berlin Wall, America was left as the only
superpower,'' said Stephane Rozes, the director general of CSA
Opinion, which conducts many surveys for news organizations. ``And
there is a great deal of fear out there that the strength of
America's economy will impose not only economic changes, but social
changes as well. What they see is an America that has the ability
to impose its values, and they are not values that the Europeans
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans read menace in a wide range of recent events. Far
from seeing U.S. involvement in Kosovo as a hand of support from
across the Atlantic, for instance, many Europeans saw it as a U.S.
manipulation of NATO. And the humiliating fact that the
intervention would not have been possible without U.S. air power
only rammed home the perception of America's military superiority,
and of European deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But suspicion runs high in other areas as well. The Clinton
administration's cheerleading _ for instance, its repeated
description of the United States as being the ``indispensable''
nation _ strikes a threatening chord here. And recent disputes such
as America's decision last year to impose an import tax on goods
like Roquefort cheese and foie gras because the Europeans would not
accept hormone-enhanced beef from the United States only fuels the
European sense that the United States is a bully.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, these days, the World Trade Organization _ which
sanctioned the U.S. action _ is routinely dismissed as a tool of
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the United States is already using its vast
satellite and spy networks for industrial espionage is readily
accepted here, as recent debate in the European Union on the
Echelon electronic surveillance system showed. The United States
denied the charges, but the European bloc is still mulling an
investigation. Again, the size and scope of the surveillance system
make Europe feel dwarfed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the recent debacle over picking a new managing director for
the International Monetary Fund fueled the sense among some
Europeans that the United States can do whatever it wants. In
Washington, government officials let it be known that they were
opposing the first German candidate because, they said, no one in
Europe wanted to do the dirty work of pointing out his
inadequacies. That version of events did not get much press here.
In Germany, the U.S. veto power provoked snide remarks about the
Superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discovered that the superpower sees its global role
not only in the military area but also in setting the rules of
globalization through the IMF,'' pronounced Michael Steiner, chief
diplomatic adviser to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in the middle
of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the average European is embracing much of what is
American. Its films, its music, its fashion and, even if no-one in
France particularly cares to admit it, its fast food. The weekly
best-seller list shows more than half the top selling novels in
France are translations of American books. There are frequent
complaints of a brain drain as young people flock to Silicon Valley
and elsewhere in America to get their start in life.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time the view of a belligerent United States is
growing too. Polls conducted by CSA in the last few years suggest
that Europeans have some extremely negative views of the United
States. In April last year, 68 percent of the French said they were
worried about America's status as a superpower. Only 30 percent
said there was anything to admire across the Atlantic. Sixty-three
percent said they did not feel close to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Another CSA poll in September 1998, which compared the attitudes
of the Germans, Spanish, French, Italian and British toward the
United States, found they had deep reservations too. The Italians
seemed to appreciate America the most. But they still showed
profound concern about the American model. Between 57 and 60
percent said America's democracy and economy were worth admiring.
But 56 to 62 percent said Italians should not look to America for
inspiration on their way of life or their culture.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that America has no more enemy,'' says
Michel Winock, a professor at the Institute d'Etudes Politiques de
Paris who often writes on the subject of anti-Americanism. ``It
does what it likes now when it wants. Through NATO it directs
European affairs. Before we could say we were on America's side.
Not now. There is no counterbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   On some social issues, the United States and Europe do seem to
be going in opposite directions. One that gets a lot of attention
is the death penalty, which has either been abolished or suspended
by all members of the European Union but is now legal in 38 states.
Coming executions are often carefully followed here as examples of
barbarism, and U.S. diplomats say they are bombarded with questions
about them. The fact that many recent executions have taken place
in Texas also colors _ negatively _ European commentators' views of
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But other aspects of America are deplored too. Essayists have a
field day with descriptions of the homeless on the streets, women
in jail forced to give birth in handcuffs, drugs, police violence,
racism and what they see as a puritanism that invades people's
private lives, the prime example being the reaction to the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has America been so loved and so hated,'' says the
novelist Pascal Bruckner, who has also written on anti-Americanism.
``But in some ways America should be glad. We are not condemning
the Russians for a lack of morality. We don't care. They don't
count.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to France, Felix Rohatyn, says he has felt
the change of attitude take place in the four years he has been in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-Americanism today encompasses not a specific policy
like Iranian sanctions but a feeling that globalization has an
American face on it and is a danger to the European and French view
of society,'' Rohatyn said in an interview. ``There is the sense
that America is such an extraordinary power that it can crush
everything in its way. It is more frustration and anxiety now than
plain anti-Americanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohatyn, like many others, says it is hard to measure the
consequences of this attitude, though there are no doubt many. ``It
impacts most things,'' he said. ``Not that it makes transactions
impossible, but it certainly puts a different slant on them. It
totally negates the notion that our interest is also in their
interest. It creates the totally opposite point of view _ that only
the weakening of America can be good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an attitude, for instance, fed a recent frenzy of concern
in France over the amount of American investment here. Newspaper
articles suggested that American pension fund investments in French
companies were promoting layoffs of French workers to benefit
American retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's just not the case,'' Rohatyn said. ``That is not
the way things work, but it is a perfect example of that
anti-American view at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans believe that part of the problem is that
globalization has meant an increase in Americans doing business
abroad with methods that do not sit well with Europeans. These
Americans say that Americans tend to try to cut short discussion
and value quick decisions. Europeans tend to take longer and look
for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   But the French, and other Europeans, often mention Americans'
lack of knowledge about anything European and their unwillingness
to learn as a major aggravating factor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner described how when he was living in San Diego his
landlady asked him about his queen, even though France has not had
one since the 19th century. Mamere begins his book with a story
about how Steve Forbes, at a recent Davos meeting, invoked the
image of a Charlemagne who unified Europe two centuries ago.
Charlemagne died more than 1,000 years ago and is usually billed as
a conqueror, not a unifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omnipotence and ignorance,'' Mamere concludes about America in
his first chapter. ``It is a questionable cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamere's book, written with Olivier Warin, has not been
published in America, nor does he expect it to be. ``It would be
great if they read some of what we write, but they do not,'' he
said. ``It would be great if they saw what they looked like from
over here. But they are not interested. The Americans are so sure
of themselves. They think they are the best in the world, that they
are way ahead of everyone and everyone needs to learn from them.''

   KIDS-PSYCHODRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Are toddlers being plied
with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful drugs for minor behavioral
problems? A recent study that documented an acute increase in the
prescription of psychiatric medications for preschoolers would
suggest that. Some mental health professionals have painted young
children as the latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes
and disorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to
condemn the ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens.
By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since 1995, when the
government chronicle of Microsoft's predatory war on Internet
innovators begins, PCs have become less expensive and more
sophisticated. The industry has generated growth, jobs and wealth.
So why was this costly and sweeping antitrust suit filed against
Microsoft? To enforce the law and to support innovation. And the
latter reason marks what may be an important step in how government
and courts deal with the Internet economy in the future. By Steve
Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-APATHY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Does the American public's
growing lack of responsiveness to census questionnaires, which
parallels the falling rate of voting, represent a decline in a
sense of community or civic engagement? Is it a sign that Americans
have become more alienated from and less caring about each other?
Is it a fair measure of the a country turning inward? And to what
extent is the privacy issue, in this first census of the Internet
age, a factor? By Steven Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI-CUBANS-REVIEW (Miami) _ A look at the Cuban diaspora: this
city of exiles has never been known for restraint and moderation;
there are too many people drinking too much Cuban coffee, too many
conspiracies to untangle, too much frustration bottled up for too
many years. Ever since the Cuban exodus started 40 years ago, Miami
has been a place apart, a city floating in some sort of ether,
removed from the rest of the country. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   GENEALOGY-DNA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Oxford Ancestors has applied
for a patent on the idea of deriving surnames from DNA. The
company's founder, Dr. Bryan Sykes, is a geneticist who has made an
intriguing discovery about English surnames: Many of them once had
a single bearer. Sykes, who analyzes DNA to track ancient
population changes, tries to trace the origins of his own surname.
By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   MARGIN-MANIA-REVIEW (New York) _ A comparison of stock market in
the 1920s and the present shows some similarities and some
differences. Now, as then, the Fed has been trying to tighten
credit by raising interest rates but has seen stock prices soar as
more and more money has been borrowed to buy shares. Margin debt is
now rising faster than it ever did in the 1920s. By Floyd Norris.

   DICAPRIO-CLINTON-REVIEW (Washington) _ What Leonardo DiCaprio's
interview with President Clinton about global warming might be

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   UGANDA-IMAGE-REVIEW (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Uganda has been groping
for explanations for the mass killings, and alongside
sensationalism in the press there has been a remarkably frank
discussion of the roots of the problem and a tracing of the current
religiosity and mysticism associated with cults to the despair left
by years of dictatorship, poverty, AIDS and other diseases. The
press discussion reveals much about how far Uganda has come in its
four tortured decades of independence, through a brutal
dictatorship and at last toward a society where open expression is
recognized as a tool for solving the nation's problems. By Ian
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POLITICS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ For all the attention
surrounding the stroke that toppled Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
the change at the nominal helm of the country has little real
import. The Japanese people have long been aware of a reality that
the rest of the world has yet to realize: Political leadership has
always been more irrelevant in Japan than in other countries. By
Stephanie Strom.

for Sunday, April 9, moved Saturday.

<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-PSYCHODRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Are toddlers being plied
with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful drugs for minor behavioral
problems? A recent study that documented an acute increase in the
prescription of psychiatric medications for preschoolers would
suggest that. Some mental health professionals have painted young
children as the latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes
and disorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to
condemn the ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens.
By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since 1995, when the
government chronicle of Microsoft's predatory war on Internet
innovators begins, PCs have become less expensive and more
sophisticated. The industry has generated growth, jobs and wealth.
So why was this costly and sweeping antitrust suit filed against
Microsoft? To enforce the law and to support innovation. And the
latter reason marks what may be an important step in how government
and courts deal with the Internet economy in the future. By Steve
Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-APATHY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Does the American public's
growing lack of responsiveness to census questionnaires, which
parallels the falling rate of voting, represent a decline in a
sense of community or civic engagement? Is it a sign that Americans
have become more alienated from and less caring about each other?
Is it a fair measure of the a country turning inward? And to what
extent is the privacy issue, in this first census of the Internet
age, a factor? By Steven Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI-CUBANS-REVIEW (Miami) _ A look at the Cuban diaspora: this
city of exiles has never been known for restraint and moderation;
there are too many people drinking too much Cuban coffee, too many
conspiracies to untangle, too much frustration bottled up for too
many years. Ever since the Cuban exodus started 40 years ago, Miami
has been a place apart, a city floating in some sort of ether,
removed from the rest of the country. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   GENEALOGY-DNA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Oxford Ancestors has applied
for a patent on the idea of deriving surnames from DNA. The
company's founder, Dr. Bryan Sykes, is a geneticist who has made an
intriguing discovery about English surnames: Many of them once had
a single bearer. Sykes, who analyzes DNA to track ancient
population changes, tries to trace the origins of his own surname.
By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   MARGIN-MANIA-REVIEW (New York) _ A comparison of stock market in
the 1920s and the present shows some similarities and some
differences. Now, as then, the Fed has been trying to tighten
credit by raising interest rates but has seen stock prices soar as
more and more money has been borrowed to buy shares. Margin debt is
now rising faster than it ever did in the 1920s. By Floyd Norris.
WITH GRAPHIC.

<P>
   DICAPRIO-CLINTON-REVIEW (Washington) _ What Leonardo DiCaprio's
interview with President Clinton about global warming might be
like. By John. B. Kenney.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   UGANDA-IMAGE-REVIEW (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Uganda has been groping
for explanations for the mass killings, and alongside
sensationalism in the press there has been a remarkably frank
discussion of the roots of the problem and a tracing of the current
religiosity and mysticism associated with cults to the despair left
by years of dictatorship, poverty, AIDS and other diseases. The
press discussion reveals much about how far Uganda has come in its
four tortured decades of independence, through a brutal
dictatorship and at last toward a society where open expression is
recognized as a tool for solving the nation's problems. By Ian
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POLITICS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ For all the attention
surrounding the stroke that toppled Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
the change at the nominal helm of the country has little real
import. The Japanese people have long been aware of a reality that
the rest of the world has yet to realize: Political leadership has
always been more irrelevant in Japan than in other countries. By
Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-FRANCE-REVIEW (Paris) _ On both sides of the English

SPRING 2000 IS MARRYING SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The busiest, most jam-packed wedding season began
this weekend, and renewed interest in tying the knot _ coupled with
a desire to marry in the first year of the millennium _ could make
this a record-breaking wedding year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is crazy. It's nuts. So many people are getting
married,'' said Kelli Koerner, an event planner who delayed her own
wedding until next year to avoid the rush. ``If people want to get
married this year, they are going to have a hard time coordinating
things.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the prospect of being a millennial bride has proved
irresistible. Brides say they like they way 2000 looks on the
invitations and napkins, while bridegrooms say it will just be
easier to remember the number of anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get married in 2000,'' said Mindy Herrera, a
20-year-old Burbank, Calif., resident. ``It sounded good. There's a
lot of stuff you can buy that says 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers aren't in yet, but experts like Antonia Van der
Meer, executive editor at Modern Bride magazine, are predicting a
record year for nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big year both for getting engaged and getting married
because it's the year 2000,'' said Van der Meer. ``It has a nice
ring to it. It makes a wonderful date to have on your wedding
invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wedding boutiques, reception halls, bakers and ministers
throughout the suburban San Fernando Valley are feeling the
pressure. They've been slammed with calls since the first week of
January. And, with the unpredictable weather of January through
March over, the season of love begins now.
</P>
<P>
   At the Church of the Valley in suburban Van Nuys, the schedule
for Minister Steve Borgard has gotten so crowded, he performed one
wedding last week on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been busy,'' said Borgard. ``There's no doubt about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrera is busy with last-minute details now that her wedding is
just two weeks away. She and her fiance, Chad Tewksbury, also 20,
started planning the ceremony seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was smart to plan before the major rush began, say wedding
planners at the Pickwick Center for events in Burbank. They can
schedule up to four weddings on Saturdays and are booked solid
until early October, said Koerner, who plans events at Pickwick
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Romero, who will have her reception at Pickwick in June,
started planning last summer, but it quickly turned into a
headache, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place I looked was already booked,'' said Romero, 27.
``I thought maybe it had to do with the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Margie Ann Taylor-Black, minister at the
nondenominational Encino Community Church says marriage is just
``back in vogue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone the full cycle and now it's back in,'' she said.
``It seems as though the new millennium is embracing some of the
old virtues.''
</P>
<P>
   It will, however, take more than a one-year surge to reverse the
declining marriage rate. Nationwide, marriage was at its lowest
point in recorded history last year, according to a 1999 Rutgers
University study. The National Marriage Project found that over the
last 40 years, marriage rates have dropped 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Young people who grew up in a ``divorce revolution era'' have
become pessimistic about marriage, said David Popenoe, professor of
sociology at Rutgers University and co-director of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men are stalling. The women can't wait,'' Popenoe said.
``You have this bad dating scene in the 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of those surveyed for the study said a happy,
healthy marriage is a priority. This could indicate marriage rates
could increase, the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger generations may decide that they want to have more of
a marriage culture than the baby boomers did,'' said Popenoe.
``There are some signs in the data that things are improving.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, the number of marriage licenses issued
was down in the first two months of this year compared with 1999.
But officials believe many of this season's brides haven't picked
up their marriage license yet because the documents are only valid
for 90 days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Taylor-Black said more people are interested in a deeper
commitment than couples of years past. Men are more involved with
the wedding plans, many want to write their own vows and they are
serious about having children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the guys who've been pushing to the weddings,'' said
Taylor-Black. ``There is a new breed of man who is at the marrying
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Men like Loren Thall, who was scheduled to be married by
Taylor-Black. The 29-year-old Los Angeles resident said he's always
looked for a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Thall and his bride, Holly Mociler, met nearly a decade ago on
Catalina Island. After dating briefly and breaking up, the couple
got back together a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found someone. I figured, here it is, right in front of me.
I've got to go for it,'' said Thall, a mortgage banker. ``She was a
friend and a lover. There was no reason to look any further.''
</P>
<P>
   After Helen Romero hoped for years that she would marry high
school sweetheart Lupe Sandoval, he finally proposed. Sandoval
surprised her with an evening at the Biltmore Hotel, where Romero
had always dreamed of staying.
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval guided a blindfolded Romero into a room, where she was
immediately overwhelmed by the smell of fresh flowers. He told her
everything he loved about her while she remained blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   As he was talking, Romero thought, ``This is it. This is the one
thing I've been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sandoval removed the blindfold, Romero found herself
surrounded by scores of white flowers. She looked at the glass
table in front of her, where Sandoval had written, ``Marry Me
Helen'' in white rose pedals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just cried,'' said Romero. ``I was in disbelief. That was
it.''

<P>
   ROZAJE, Yugoslavia _ A year ago, the people of this little town
took in tens of thousands of refugees from the Serbian rampage
through Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the folk of Rozaje find not only that they have received
little thanks for their open-armed welcome of Kosovo Albanians as
NATO bombed Yugoslavia. They feel battered, financially poorer and
still trapped by the pressures of war.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 of the inhabitants _ who, though mostly Muslim, are
Slavs _ have lost their lives in revenge attacks by Albanians in
Kosovo just because they spoke Serbian, and not Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into a far mountainous corner of Montenegro, near the
borders with Kosovo and with Serbia proper, Rozaje has always been
buffeted by wars and filled with refugees. But a year after the
worst calamity arrived on its doorstep, and months after most of
the refugees went home, Rozaje remains uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   On one part of the border, turbulence continues in Kosovo, the
Albanian-dominated southern province of Serbia now administered by
the United Nations and policed largely by NATO soldiers. Hatred for
the Serbs runs so strong in Kosovo that it is dangerous even for
the Muslims of Rozaje.
</P>
<P>
   On the other part of Montenegro's border, the Yugoslav army has
recently renewed its presence, raising tensions and reminding
Montenegrins of the misery and chaos of last spring, when they
found themselves at odds with their own Serbian-dominated Yugoslav
government. Of the two republics left in the Yugoslav federation,
Montenegro is a reluctant junior partner to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Two Rozaje families, in particular, are suspended in grief by
the aftershocks of the war. They are the relatives of two taxi
drivers, Halit Nurkovic, 62, and Dervis Muric, 59, who went
together to Kosovo last July 24, after the war ended, and never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not even suspect that anyone would harm him,'' said
Muric's wife, Vasvija. ``He was not scared, because he could speak
Albanian. He did not think he would get into any trouble. Everyone
was surprised it could happen to him, because he was so
good-natured.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men are among at least 10 people from the region who
have disappeared or been killed in Kosovo since the war, all but
one of them Muslims. Most were taxi or truck drivers, and one was a
Muslim cleric from Sjenica, a village 30 miles from Rozaje. The
bodies of the eight others have been found and returned, but the
two taxi drivers disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of the taxi drivers in town, the two missing men spent
last March through May driving up to the border with Kosovo to help
carry the wretched columns of refugees arriving on foot through the
snow and ice to safety. They both took refugee families into their
own homes, as did virtually everyone in Rozaje, because refugee
centers were overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't room to move here, there were so many people,''
Muric said as she gestured around her living room. ``We had up to
30 people at times. There wasn't room to lie down. They were wet,
tired and dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, her son, who was not in Rozaje then, opened up his
empty house to the needy from Kosovo. ``Anyone would do the same,''
she said. ``My son was abroad, but when he heard about the
refugees, he called his father and told him to let refugees use his
house too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurkovic, a widower with five daughters, also took in refugees.
He seemed to be the last person who might find himself in trouble,
said one of his daughters, Elsana Nurkovic, 23. ``He's quite old,''
she said. ``He's not rich. His car is old.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 24 he took an acquaintance, a Muslim woman, back to her
village in Kosovo. Muric asked if he could ride along to do an
errand.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping off their passenger, they stopped by the house of
Nurkovic's sister in the town of Pec. Tooting the horn, Nurkovic
shouted greetings up to the window, saying he would be back in 15
minutes. The two men set off for an outlying village on their
errand and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story common enough in Kosovo, where revenge killings of
Serbs and members of other minorities have overwhelmed the
international forces sent to restore peace. But for the people of
Rozaje, who did so much for the Albanians during the war, it seems
a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to accept that people did something like
this, especially when you know what they went through,'' Muric
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nurkovic said that by helping the Kosovo Albanians, the people
of Rozaje risked enraging the Serbs. ``The town was in danger from
Serbs,'' she said, ``and now this.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 85,000 refugees came through Rozaje, most of them
staying for the three months of the war, said Mayor Nusret Kalac.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of so many refugees left a lot of families much
poorer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo could now offer Rozaje lucrative trade opportunities, he
said, but he has had no official contacts with the international or
local authorities since the war. ``I would like contact with
them,'' he said, ``because then we could make a safer road and a
safer life.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the issue was sensitive. Montenegro,
despite the welcome it showed the thousands of refugees, and its
opposition to the Yugoslav government in Belgrade, is still
formally tied to the Yugoslav leadership, for Kosovo Albanians,
their implacable foes.
</P>
<P>
   So the Nurkovic and Muric families have had to pursue the search
for their men alone, as private individuals.
</P>
<P>
   They found that Muric's errand might have been the cause for the
men's disappearance. Begged by a Serb in Montenegro to seek news of
his son in Kosovo, a policeman who had been reported wounded, Muric
may have fallen under suspicion by people who had belonged to the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist Albanian rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   The many different leads have led the families on an apparently
endless quest. ``They won't even tell us where the bodies are,''
Muric said. ``We are in a situation where they say nothing to us.
No one says anything.'' And she said the peacekeepers in Kosovo
just say, ``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult not knowing where your husband is,'' she
added, quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Nurkovic's desperation for news of her father sent her into
Kosovo repeatedly, despite the dangers. ``I passed hell there,
doing things in the middle of the night, somewhere in an Albanian
village, digging up a grave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Following up a lead, she and a relative exhumed a body
themselves, inspecting the corpse by the light of an oil lamp for a
broken wrist bone like her father's or teeth that they could
recognize. But the body was not his. Three times she paid money to
people who promised information but never reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   She saved her harshest words for the international peacekeepers
and U.N. police who, she says, have failed to uncover the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not doing anything,'' she said bitterly. ``They are
just posing with their guns.''

AS BUSH AURA DIMS, HOUSE REPUBLICANS RUN ON THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year after House Republicans spoke glowingly of
Gov. George W. Bush as a life raft who would carry them to victory,
congressional leaders and Bush aides have scotched talk of a common
legislative agenda and are pursuing distinct electoral strategies
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans who once flocked to endorse the Texas
governor, sometimes sight unseen, now say that after the bitter
primary fight they have come to realize that Bush is a weaker
candidate than they once had hoped for. And they recognize that
they will have to run on their own accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the overwhelming 15 to 16 points ahead that he was,''
said Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who holds one of the most
historically competitive House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bilbray added that Bush, who is running neck and neck in
the polls with Vice President Al Gore, was far better at the top of
the ticket than recent Republican presidential contenders. ``Just
being able to break even is a great advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas M. Davis, III of Virginia, the chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, said: ``Our guys are
not afraid to run with Governor Bush. He's going to be far stronger
than Dole was and his dad was. Even if the polls are equal, that's
8 points better than Bob Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is hardly the kind of praise that Bush was hearing last
June when he journeyed to Washington to meet about 100 Republican
lawmakers. ``He's really got the magic,'' Rep. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington said then.
</P>
<P>
   Just as House Republicans are charting their own course, the
Bush campaign has made a tactical decision that it does not want to
march in lock step with the Republican-run Congress, trying to push
through a common legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say that this is partly because yoking Bush to
Congress would hamper his efforts to present himself as a different
kind of Republican. They also say it would be a recipe for failure,
since any Bush proposal that Republicans tried to enact as
legislation would become an inviting political target for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take Bush's education plan and introduce it into Congress
today is simply an invitation for every Democrat to vote no,'' said
an aide to Bush. ``Our focus is on developing an agenda that is
capable of being passed by the Congress on Jan. 1, 2001 because of
the mandate in the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the Bush campaign and congressional
Republicans have settled into an information-sharing relationship,
with each running on generally harmonious yet distinct platforms.
For instance, in contrast to Bush's sweeping tax-cut proposal,
Congress' tax cuts would be bite-sized and designed to be provide
popular relief for particular problems.
</P>
<P>
   There is frequent contact between senior Bush advisers and
senior Republicans. Bush's policy team often reaches out to
congressional experts. And the Republican National Committee has
recently started a weekly conference call between Bush aides and
Republican press secretaries across Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But this is far from the kind of direction and coordination that
many House Republicans, in particular, once envisioned when they
thought that their agenda would be shaped in Austin, Texas. ``We
are not coordinating,'' said Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chief
deputy House whip who is Bush's liaison in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's job for the next few months is to let
Americans know who he is as a person, the success he's had as the
governor of Texas and most importantly cast a vision of what he'd
like to do as president,'' Blunt said. ``Our job is to get our work
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say they are comfortable with the evolving
relationship, arguing that there is broad enough agreement on
general themes to allow Republicans to meld their messages come
autumn, when Congress is no longer in session.
</P>
<P>
   They say they also understand the advantage to keeping Bush free
from every controversy in Congress, particularly as the annual
battle over spending and tax cuts reaches its peak in September.
``A lot of what we have to deal with would be total baggage for
anybody running for president of the United States,'' said Sen.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., who is Bush's chief liaison in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But others say they are deeply troubled by the lack of stronger
coordination and consider the Austin-based Bush campaign too
insular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is pulling together what needs to be pulled together,''
said one Republican senator who spoke on condition that he not be
identified. ``The presidential and Republican congressional agendas
have to be bolted together here, and every day that goes by is a
squandered day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``You can't have a Republican nominee, a Republican
House, a Republican Senate and a Republican National Committee not
moving in the same way at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, too, have their own points of
divergence with their nominee. Gore drew the ire of numerous
Democrats when he broke with President Clinton on the case of Elian
Gonzalez. And whether to grant China normal trade relations sharply
divides the party, with many House Democrats opposed to Gore's free
trade stance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in contrast to the Republicans, House and Senate
Democrats have been working closely with Gore on a common agenda
and strategy for more than a year, ever since Rep. Dick Gephardt,
the minority leader from Missouri, dropped his own presidential bid
to fight for control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats have rarely missed an opportunity to try to
highlight differences between congressional Republicans and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday they forced a vote in the Senate on whether to enact
Bush's tax-cut plan as part of this budget cycle. The vote was 99-0
against it.

 WASHINGTON: against it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Bush campaign has had a delicate balancing
act to follow in its relations with the Congress. Last year Bush
aggressively sought to lock up endorsements from House and Senate
members as a way of diminishing primary challengers and adding to
his aura of the inevitable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he tried to maintain some distance, since his
theme of compassionate conservatism is implicitly a contrast to the
sharp-edged kind of conservatism practiced by former Speaker Newt
Gingrich. When Bush made his visit to Congress last June, he
managed to sidestep any picture with the House Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And he drew the ire of some Republicans last fall when he
criticized a Republican proposal to reduce tax credits for the
working poor as an example of balancing the budget ``on the backs
of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the anger that caused, one Bush adviser recently
noted that the governor's highest standing in the opinion polls
came just after that blowup. The adviser said it was better for
Bush to ``float above the fray'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger turnabout in attitude has come in Congress,
particularly in the House. The degree of coattails a presidential
candidate will carry is often overstated. But the early expectation
among House Republicans that they could rely on Bush underscores
how much they had pinned their hopes on his candidacy and how
uncertain they were about their own abilities to function with a
razor-thin majority.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Republicans say, they have more self-confidence, more faith
in their own leadership and they are more realistic about Bush's
ability to carry them into office.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House
Republican conference, showed colleagues a poll indicating that
Bush would not carry coattails for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the House have woken up to the fact that we have to
win these races on our own,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, an Ohio
Republican close to the Bush campaign. He called this a ``positive
evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republicans say that they decided on their own
agenda over the winter, even before the bitter primary battle
between Bush and Sen. John McCain was in full swing. They agreed to
focus their campaign on a series of smaller tax cuts, on shoring up
the Social Security system, improving national security, supporting
more local control of education and fighting crime and drugs. In
addition, lawmakers up for re-election are being urged to run
localized races, not to hope for a national wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coattail elections are pretty rare,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, the chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee. He said that even when Bush's poll numbers
were ``unrealistically high'' he had been telling candidates ``that
this didn't smell like any kind of coattail year to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been counseling our candidates that races were going to
be won or lost state by state,'' McConnell said. ``Senators who win
will be ones who custom craft their races the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Blunt, Bush's House liaison, was dismissive of some of the
Republican nervousness about how strongly their nominee will run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people in Washington spent all of last year
overestimating George W. Bush, and today they are underestimating
him as a candidate,'' Blunt said. ``In politics, it's always better
to be underestimated than overestimated.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a 15-minute office visit in February 1999, a cardiologist
told the parents of Dominic Fernandez, 3, that he needed open heart
surgery and a possible heart transplant _ ``right now, or he will
not survive through the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just overwhelmed,'' said Beverly Fernandez, a
warehouse manager for Honeywell. Her son was still recovering from
surgery he had undergone nine months earlier for congenital heart
problems. ``I wanted to know more about transplants'' and the
alternatives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called Consumer's Medical Resource Inc. in Duxbury, Mass., a
medical information service available through her employer. A
physician and a researcher listened to her account for an hour.
Within the week, she received packets of medical journal articles
and books on heart transplants, including success and failure
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved because she felt better informed, she got a second
opinion from another cardiologist who recommended monitoring
Dominic for six months. After additional repair surgery _ no
transplant _ eight weeks ago, her son, now 4, is ``doing
wonderfully,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of companies are adding specialized services
like Honeywell's to help their employees navigate through the mass
of medical information available today, from advertisements for
prescription medicine to pitches for doctors and hospitals in
magazines, books, television and online.
</P>
<P>
   These companies believe that their employees will get better
care, and they hope their workers will be less inclined to proceed
with treatments deemed not appropriate. Employers hope to save
money at a time when health costs are rising 9 percent or more a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies also view the added services as a way to attract
and retain employees at a time when workers are scarce. The new
services may reduce absenteeism as well. ``It is clear to us that
productivity is linked to good health,'' said Sue Nelson, a senior
benefits executive at Texas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer run, many employers that offer the added
advice are also trying to prepare their employees for a shift the
companies hope to make toward a system of vouchers for medical
care. In such a system, employees would receive a set amount of
money, rather than a promise of benefits, to cover their health
care needs, and they would need advice on selecting the best care
in order to manage for themselves. The new offerings are partly
designed to accustom employees to seeking out medical information
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The firms that provide information are careful to direct
questioners to consult their own doctors on new information they
obtain, thus avoiding legal liability. But health care legal
experts said lawsuits were always at least a remote possibility for
the companies _ and for the employers paying for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William M. Sage, a health law expert at the Columbia
University law school, said that providing information ``would be
pretty safe from a liability perspective'' in most cases. But he
said lawyers might try to pin liability on ``an employer or other
purveyor of information that has a financial interest in what the
recipient does with the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Altman, director of the Schneider Health Policy Institute
at Brandeis University, said: ``It can't be bad to provide more
information to people. Ultimately, most people would just ask their
doctors more intelligent and tougher questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``What it will do for the quality and cost of
health care is an open question. I think it will raise costs but
improve the quality by directing people to better quality providers
of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Some workers can get information from prestigious medical
centers. Employees of a dozen big companies can get feedback _
often advice to ``see your doctor'' or ``go immediately to a
hospital emergency room'' _ 24 hours a day, from doctors and nurses
at the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   At Consumer's Medical Resource, the company working with
Honeywell, the doctors, like many in the Boston area, are
affiliated with Harvard Medical School. ``We don't give advice, we
listen and summarize and send the most up-to-date medical and
practical information,'' said Dr. Maureen Tierney, the company's
medical director.
</P>
<P>
   Employers pay about $1.35 per employee per month to sign up with
Consumer's Medical Resource.
</P>
<P>
   But Brian Marcotte, vice president of benefits at Honeywell,
said the company had saved $2.80 for every $1 it spent on the
program. He said that of 41 Honeywell employees who had called
Consumer's Medical Resource, 10 had changed doctors; three had
identified incorrect diagnoses, including one misdiagnosis of
Parkinson's disease; three had halted questionable treatments; and
12 had eliminated or reduced side effects by changing a treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies offer rewards to employees who answer questions
about their health status in questionnaires that are processed by
outside firms. Companies like Staywell Inc., recently acquired by
Havas MediMedia, and Optum, a unit of the UnitedHealth Group, then
follow up by offering recommendations and reminders for those with
chronic conditions like diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic is testing the effectiveness of such
recommendations with 4,000 employees of Lucent, Texas Instruments
and Intel. Mayo also publishes an offshoot of its widely circulated
health newsletter for employees at these companies as well as
Dow-Corning and General Mills.
</P>
<P>
   In part, employers are contending with a managed care system
designed to hold down costs, in which many doctors see more
patients for shorter consultations. ``There doesn't appear to be
enough time in that office visit,'' said Nelson of Texas
Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the patient more involved is so critical right now,''
added Dr. Lawrence G. Shoner, vice president of health services at
Lucent. ``Physicians are running so hard and so fast now, that to
give the patient more information is a way to assure the best
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies that are offering the extra advice are also
planning for harder times ahead when employees may no longer be in
short supply. That is when these companies hope to introduce
``defined contributions,'' or vouchers, that employees would use to
purchase their own health care. The companies would like to stop
providing relatively open-ended coverage, which keeps getting more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Employees ``need to have more financial stake in it,'' Marcotte
of Honeywell said. ``If we can give employees the information,
tools'' and money, he said, ``they will make the right decisions''
about obtaining care.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Benefits managers at big companies like Honeywell and Lucent say
they would still provide employees with information to help them
select an appropriate health plan, and continue company-paid
insurance against the huge expenses of a catastrophic illness.
</P>
<P>
   But defined health benefits, or vouchers, are controversial.
When a Xerox executive seemed to be endorsing the idea last year,
irate employees and health care economists attacked it as a retreat
from employer-provided health care. Xerox quickly backed off. Many
large employers are ``champing at the bit to make the transition to
defined contributions, but reticent to move first,'' said Gary
Ahlquist, senior vice president of the Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton
consulting firm. ``The risk of alienating employees in a high
employment economy is just too high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those amenable to health care vouchers argue that consumers
need to be properly equipped for such a system. ``Who is going to
help consumers so they don't get raped and pillaged in the
process?'' asked Regina Herzlinger, a Harvard Business School
professor who studies the role of consumers in shaping health care.
She argues that government should require health care providers to
disclose information on their competency. Companies like Honeywell
are providing the added access to medical information themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are offering more than just simple information.
HealthAllies, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., negotiates discounts for
individuals for procedures like plastic surgery, fertility programs
and laser eye surgery that are often not covered by health plans.
CareCounsel, based in San Rafael, Calif., helps consumers clear up
administrative problems with their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are suspicious and mistrustful of managed care and
the health insurance industry,'' said Larry Gelb, president of
CareCounsel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to themselves, `Why would the insurance company
really care whether I make the best decision?' when the bottom line
is profit or cost containment,'' said David Hines, president of
Consumer's Medical Resource. (Services like his typically promise
confidentiality, so that employers do not know which employees are
seeking help.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry is well aware of such problems. A
number of HMOs are now adding programs to help consumers understand
their choices, said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American
Association of Health Plans, a managed care trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put the consumer at the center of the system and
empower her with information and access,'' said Dr. David Lawrence,
chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, the California-based
nonprofit HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser plans to spend $2 billion by 2003 on computerized and
Internet services for its 8 million members. Soon, they will be
able to sit next to their doctors in front of a computer display of
their personal health records and discuss them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blue Cross plans in Michigan, New Jersey and South Carolina are
testing an Internet service that will include medical advice and
support forums with health care experts. The project is being
developed by Franklin Health Inc. with collaboration from IBM and
units of Intel and Reuters. ``We know we need to do business
differently,'' said Maureen Sullivan, a senior vice president of
national Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers appear to be hungry for added medical advice. They are
eagerly responding to drug company advertising. And at least 60
million people visit Internet health sites each year, according to
Harris Interactive, a research firm. But ``many Web sites are a
mile wide and an inch deep,'' Herzlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, anyone can get a few facts about a doctor or health
plan on thehealthpages.com.
</P>
<P>
   But some 45 companies offer an enhanced version of what is
publicly available, providing information like the credentials of
doctors and hospitals in their networks.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee, consumers can also look for doctors' names on
BestDoctors.com, or on Guidetotopdoctors.org.
</P>
<P>
   A few employers pay so that their employees can have access to
those sites without charge. But such lists of recommended doctors
can be incomplete or biased by the physicians who help compile
them, said Dr. Jerome Groopman, a professor at the Harvard Medical
School.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola _ Measured by the abundance of its oil and the
paucity of its population, this is potentially the richest country
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Antonio Dodge Domingo would know.
</P>
<P>
   On the balcony of his second-floor apartment, human excrement
splatters day and night. His neighbors toss it by the bucketful
from above.
</P>
<P>
   In Angola's capital, Domingo, his wife, his seven children and
his hundreds of upstairs neighbors fill a 17-story building that
has no electricity, no telephones, no elevators, no windows, no
garbage pickup and no plumbing. A contractor abandoned the concrete
shell 25 years ago, fleeing to Lisbon upon Angola's independence
from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's children often have dysentery, probably from playing
on the balcony or from the brown water oozing down walls in the
kitchen. They also get malaria, from mosquitoes in a lagoon next to
the building. Garbage tossed from the building has carpeted the
lagoon. Three neighborhood children have wandered into the garbage
in the last two years and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not happy at all, but there is no way out,'' said
Domingo, 48, who has a doctorate in political science from the
University of Bombay, runs a private English language school and
has been living in the building for eight years. ``I have to live
according to the reality of my country now.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, reality in Angola has been ruled by the paradox of
plenty: oil wealth has helped to pay for an endless war between
President Eduardo dos Santos, who heads the government, and his
bitter foe, Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita rebels. That, in
turn, has increased poverty and ill health for almost all Angolans.
This country has the world's highest rate of citizens maimed by
land mines (one out of every 133). One third of children die before
age 5; life expectancy is just 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the paradox holds, Angola is ripe for even more misery.
Recent offshore discoveries have made it one of the hottest
oil-producing countries in the world. Production will probably
double in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States and other gasoline-hungry Western
countries, oil makes Angola more than merely another troubled
country in Africa. It already accounts for 7 percent of America's
annual petroleum consumption, and probably at least 10 percent by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's stinking apartment tower in downtown Luanda is
anything but exceptional. The capital has 4 million residents but
only about 20,000 of them have running water or modern toilets. At
low tide along the Marginale, the walkway that curves along
Luanda's bay on the Atlantic, the smell of sewage is so
overpowering it is hard to walk without becoming nauseated.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the government could easily afford to build a sewage
treatment plant and pipe drinking water into the city. There are
two rivers nearby and the war is far from the capital. By default,
millions of poor people in Luanda pay up to 10,000 times more for
drinking water than the elite, who can turn on the tap.
</P>
<P>
   Every night, police and soldiers seal off the center of the
capital, home to the ruling elite of about 30 families. The
government does not want angry people invading the better
neighborhoods after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Across this Texas-sized, mineral-rich and immensely fertile
country, the government offers its 12 million citizens social
inequity and repression. More than two-thirds of Angolan children
reach adulthood with four years of schooling or less. Illiteracy
rates _ 50 percent for men, 70 percent for women _ are high by
African standards and rising. The children of elite families in the
government, meanwhile, study abroad on state scholarships, which in
recent years have consumed up to 36 percent of all government
spending on education.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to U.S. government officials, Angola's
rulers spent about half of a $900 million windfall in oil earnings
on weapons, many of which were purchased purely for kickback
potential. These officials say that Angola's leaders apparently
stole a substantial part of what they did not spend on weapons.
International banking officials say the $900 million was not
recorded in the country's published budget.
</P>
<P>
   American oil company executives joke bitterly that they pay for
Angola's main community development program: the transfer of money
to banks in Zurich and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and 24 other oil companies are
planning to invest about $19 billion here over the next decade in
deep-water offshore drilling rigs. There is widespread nervousness
among publicly held multinational companies that bad publicity
about corruption, social injustice and human rights abuse in Angola
could threaten these investments.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives remember the consumer boycott that stung Shell
when it was linked in the early 1990s to the human rights abuses of
Nigeria's military rulers and the hanging of a prominent dissident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we are going to be under huge scrutiny,'' said David
Rice, a senior political adviser in London for BP Amoco, which last
year joined three other oil companies in paying a $350 million
``signing bonus'' for rights to an offshore field. ``This is a
wonderful cocktail for global public attention: oil, diamonds,
civil war and land mines. If we are seen to be part of the problem,
we have lost it. We have to be seen as part of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the International Monetary Fund are
pushing Angola to carry out reforms that would open up the economy
and spend far more oil money on social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a decision that they are going to have to make,'' an
administration official said. ``If they are serious about wanting
to reconstruct their country, they are going to have play by a
different set of rules than they have in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Angolan government pointed to the civil war as
an excuse for all failings. The war with Unita, which began before
Angola's independence in 1975, soaked up most of the oil money
while ruining the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government, though, finally seems to be winning. Unita has
been pushed out of the diamond-rich Cuango River valley. Military
analysts say rebels no longer have the diamond revenue necessary to
pay for major ground operations.
</P>
<P>
   As oil production ramps up and fighting ramps down, war is no
longer an all-purpose excuse for bad government, as dos Santos
himself acknowledged in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   The government has announced $250 million in new programs to
rebuild infrastructure and grant loans to small businesses. For the
first time, it has promised the IMF that it will allow outside
auditors to examine the way it spends oil money.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and the United States government are prepared to accept
a deal that would ignore past corruption and insist only on
openness in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs Angola's oil, and U.S. officials concede
that this need dampens their willingness to criticize the
government or demand too much, too fast. ``That is realism,'' a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, Angola seems impervious to the greater
openness now seen across much of Africa. When a few people
assembled in the streets of Luanda in February to protest a
government-ordered, 1,600-percent increase in gas prices, the
police beat them with clubs. (An Angolan journalist and human
rights campaigner, Rafael Marques, was sentenced the end of March
to six months in jail for writing an article accusing Angola's
president of corruption.)
</P>
<P>
   The change in oil accounting, if it happens, will reduce
corruption, but will not affect arms deals and other business, said
Gerald J. Bender, an associate professor of international relations
at the University of Southern California and an expert on Angola.
``I don't think there is ever going to be transparency in that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies, including Chevron, Exxon Mobil and BP
Amoco, have built schools, orphanages and health clinics in Angola.
But they are scarcely in a position to demand social reforms from
the government as a condition for expanding oil production.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, consumers are more interested in gasoline than
Angola's social problems, said an American oil executive who has
worked in Luanda for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot expect oil to hit our shores at a reasonable cost
with conditions placed on what the equity holders must do to
extract that oil,'' he said. ``Angola will say `forget it,' and
take their oil elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In his high-rise slum in downtown Luanda, Domingo, too, is
reluctant to say anything remotely critical about the government.
As a squatter, he could be ordered out of his building at any time.
``Now,'' he said, ``is the time to keep quiet.''

<P>
   They are not drunk or high on drugs. They are not racists or
Satanists, or addicted to violent video games, movies or music.
</P>
<P>
   Most are white men, but a surprising number are women, Asians
and blacks. Many have college degrees, but most are unemployed.
Many are military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what
they plan to do. They carry semiautomatic weapons they have
obtained easily and, in most cases, legally.
</P>
<P>
   They do not try to get away. In the end, half turn their guns on
themselves or are shot dead by others. They not only want to kill,
they also want to die.
</P>
<P>
   That is the profile of the 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks
examined by The New York Times in a computer-assisted study looking
back more than 50 years and including the shootings in 1999 at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and one by a World War
II veteran on a residential street in Camden, N.J., in 1949. Four
hundred twenty-five people were killed and 510 people were injured
in the attacks. The database, which primarily focused on cases in
the last decade, is believed to be the largest ever compiled on
this phenomenon in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though the attacks are rare when compared with other American
murders, they have provoked an intense national discussion about
crime, education and American culture. The Times found, however,
that the debate may have largely overlooked a critical issue: At
least half of the killers showed signs of serious mental health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was most intense last year, which began with echoes
of gunfire in a Salt Lake City television station in January and
ended with seven Honolulu office workers dead in November. In
between there was a berserk rampage by an Atlanta day trader that
left 12 dead and 13 injured. A self-styled fascist attacked a Los
Angeles day care center. Seven people died as a hymn ended in a
Fort Worth church.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most shocking were the shootings by two students at
Columbine High School who burst into suburban classrooms and killed
13 and wounded 23. The teen-age killers were much like the adults
The Times studied, but with important distinctions that may bring a
better understanding to the problem. As the anniversary of that
crime, April 20, approaches, the questions about crime and culture
will inevitably reverberate again.
</P>
<P>
   The Times set out to examine as many of these killings as
possible in an effort to learn what factors they and the people who
carried them out shared. For while many possible causes have been
cited, including violent video games, a decline in moral values and
the easy availability of guns, there has been little serious study
of this explosive violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Times included only rampage homicides _ multiple-victim
killings that were not primarily domestic or connected to a robbery
or gang. Serial killers were not included, nor were those whose
primary motives were political.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ While the killings have caused many people to point to the
violent aspects of the culture, a closer look shows little evidence
that video games, movies or television encouraged many of the
attacks. In only six of the 100 cases did the killers have a known
interest in violent video games. Seven other killers showed an
interest in violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a decade that had a sharp decrease in almost all kinds of
homicides, the incidence of these rampage killings appears to have
increased, according to a separate computer analysis by The Times
of nearly 25 years of homicide data from the FBI. Still, these
killings remain extremely rare, much less than 1 percent of all
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Society has turned to law enforcement to resolve the rampage
killings that have become almost a staple of the nightly news.
There has been an increasing call for greater security in schools
and in the workplace. But a closer look shows that these cases may
have more to do with society's lack of knowledge of mental health
issues, rather than a lack of security. In case after case, family
members, teachers and mental health professionals missed or
dismissed signs of deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they happen in a school, in a mall, in a crowded train
or in a workplace, these crimes have been characterized in a
language of incomprehension _ ``senseless,'' ``random,''
``sudden,'' ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, murder in the heat of domestic passion or a tavern
argument, in the desperation of armed robbery or in the cold
calculation of gang competition, seems to make ``sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reviewing court records and interviewing police, victims
and sometimes the killers themselves, The Times found that these
killings, too, have their own logic, and are anything but random or
sudden.
</P>
<P>
   The rage that boiled over into homicide was clearly building in
many. Of the 100 cases reviewed by The Times, 63 involved people
who made threats of violence before the event, including 54 who
threatened specific violence to specific people.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farley, for example, who was fired in 1987 for harassing
a female co-worker, told acquaintances he was going to kill the
people who had come between him and her before storming into his
former workplace, killing seven. James Calvin Brady told
psychiatrists he wanted to kill people, just days before he went on
a rampage in an Atlanta shopping mall in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not impulsive acts,'' said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic
psychologist at the University of California at San Diego. ``They
are not acts of affective violence, where they drink a lot and go
kill someone. There's a planning and purpose, and an emotional
detachment that's very long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was often a precipitating event in addition to
histories of failure and mental illness _ a spark that set off the
tinder, and gave the crime the appearance of being at the same time
deliberate and impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see someone who is morbidly depressed for a long time,
and they have a suicide plan in place, but the timing is determined
by impulse,'' said Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry
at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and author of ``Night Falls
Fast: Understanding Suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By far the most common precipitator was the loss of a job, which
was mentioned as a potential precipitator in 47 cases. A romantic
issue _ a divorce or breakup _ was present in 22 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men see the loss of a job, or the loss of a mate, as
irrevocable and catastrophic, something they can't get back or
attain again,'' said David Buss, author of ``The Dangerous Passion:
Why Jealousy Is as Necessary as Love and Sex'' and a professor of
psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. ``They set out on
a course to inflict the maximum cost on their rivals, even
sometimes killing the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the database found several recurring elements in
rampage killings, including some that surprised the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the aspect that most set these crimes apart, aside from
their spectacular nature, was this: Regular criminals try to get
away with their crimes. More than a third of regular homicides went
unsolved in 1997. But among the 102 killers in the Times database,
not one got away. Eighty-nine never even left the scene of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, for example, after he killed three people at the Ohio
trucking company where he had worked, Gerald Lee Clemons walked to
the parking lot and leaned against his car calmly until the police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Michael Carneal, 14, killed three and wounded five at a
school in Louisville, Ky. Then he laid down his gun and said, ``I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, 33 of the offenders killed themselves after
their crimes. Nine tried or wanted to commit suicide, and four
killed themselves later. Nine were killed by the police or others,
perhaps committing what some refer to as ``suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people knowingly getting killed is striking,''
Alfred Blumstein of the Heinz School of Public Policy and
Management at Carnegie Mellon University said after examining the
review. Blumstein is the director of the National Consortium on
Violence Research.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison said: ``The link between suicide and homicide is a very
real one, and it hasn't been studied nearly enough. It has always
struck me about Columbine, people forget they committed suicide.
And that's understandable _ it was the least important thing from
the public point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Barbaro, a 17-year-old Regents scholar in upstate Olean,
N.Y., offered a glimpse into this suicidal impulse in the note he
left before he hanged himself with a knotted bedsheet in the county
jail. He was awaiting trial after firing random shots out the
window from the third floor of his high school, killing two
passers-by and a school custodian, and wounding nine others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just wanted to kill the person I hate most _
myself,'' he wrote. ``I just didn't have the courage. I wanted to
die, but I couldn't do it, so I had to get someone to do it for me.
It didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable insights to emerge from the survey is
how much these killers differ from the typical American murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all murderers in this country are black. Eighty percent
went to high school, and no further. Most of them killed someone
they knew, or while committing another crime, like a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers, on the other hand, were white, by far; 18
of the 102 were black, and seven Asian. The racial profile of the
rampage killers is close to that of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers were overwhelmingly male _ but not entirely.
Six were female, and they exhibited many of the same disturbed,
aggressive characteristics. Here again, however, was a distinction
from regular murderers, who are about twice as likely as rampage
killers to be women.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers were far more likely to have military
backgrounds, and to kill strangers. There are intriguing age
differences as well. The rampage killers were older than regular
murderers, with more in their 40s and 50s and fewer in their 20s,
compared with the typical killer.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rampage killers over 25, a third had college degrees.
Another third had some college education. Only nine had less than a
high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   And there seemed to be no urban bias for these crimes, as there
is for other violent crimes; 31 were in suburban areas, 25 were in
small towns or rural areas. Forty-two committed their crimes in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   That profile _ a group that is largely suicidal, and shows few
of the demographic patterns of poverty and race associated with
regular crime _ suggests that mental illness plays a huge role,
psychiatrists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental illness does not vary in different races, but
socioeconomics do,'' said Lothar Adler, director of a psychiatric
hospital in Muhlhausen, Germany, and author of ``Amok,'' a book on
multiple murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Times found much evidence of mental illness in its subjects.
More than half had histories of serious mental health problems _
either a hospitalization, a prescription for psychiatric drugs, a
suicide attempt or evidence of psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 24 who had been prescribed psychiatric drugs, 14 had
stopped taking them. Clemons, for instance, ran out of drugs a week
before his crime, according to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have shown that the mentally ill are no more
violent than other people, except when they are off their
medications, or have been abusing drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Indications of mental illness were far more common among the 100
cases than was evidence supporting popular explanations that
emerged in the days after some of these spectacular events. Violent
video games or television were mentioned in only a handful of
cases. Three killers showed an interest in the occult. Racist ideas
were apparent in the backgrounds of 16.
</P>
<P>
   But 48 killers had some kind of formal diagnosis, often
schizophrenia. Some of the diagnoses came after examinations by
psychiatrists in trial preparations _ which did not usually help in
their defense, as only eight avoided conviction on grounds of
insanity. Twenty-five killers received diagnoses before their
crimes, which illustrates another recurring issue: They do not just
suddenly snap. Many have long histories not only of mental illness
but of failure and dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of their education levels, for instance, a striking
number _ more than half _ were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high education level is one thing I hadn't anticipated,
and the link to unemployment is another thing I didn't realize,''
Blumstein said. ``One of the things that education does is raise
expectations, and raised ones are more readily frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For people without the emotional resources to accommodate it,
frustration ``can lead to rage, can lead to suicide,'' Blumstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   These crimes are not new. Public rampage killings first entered
the national consciousness with Charles Whitman, who stood on the
University of Texas' tower in 1966, firing his rifle at students,
killing 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they peculiarly American. The best scientific thinking,
in a field that is admittedly understudied, now holds that
multiple, public murder occurs at a fairly constant level across
time and cultures. What some people call ``running amok,'' a term
first used in Malaysia to describe frenzied, indiscriminate
killing, has been observed in many cultures, with weapons as varied
as grenades and tanks in addition to high-powered handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though homicide rates and suicide rates are very
different from country to country,'' said Peter M. Marzuk, a
professor in the department of psychiatry at the Weill Medical
College of Cornell University, ``the rates of murder-suicide are
really the same throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a strong impression that they have become more
common. In an effort to confirm the trend, The Times analyzed FBI
reports of all homicides since 1976. Each year there were 15,000 to
22,000 homicides, but very few involved three or more victims.
</P>
<P>
   That universe shrank even more, to just a few dozen, when The
Times weeded out those involving robbery or gang violence, and
those in which the primary victim was a family member.
</P>
<P>
   What is left is the closest thing there is to a census of
rampage killings _ about one-tenth of one percent of all killings.
</P>
<P>
   And it shows that in the 1990s, they increased.
</P>
<P>
   Their number remained fairly consistent from 1976 to 1989,
averaging about 23 a year, only once going above 30. But between
1990 and 1997, the last year for which data was available, the
number averaged over 34, dipping below 30 only once, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s, for some reason, it increased, and seems to
have a different level since,'' said Steven Messner, a
criminologist at the State University of New York at Albany, who
reviewed the numbers at the request of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   There are many possible explanations. But the shift coincides,
roughly at least, with a trend of increasing availability of more
lethal weapons. In the late 1980s, the production of semiautomatic
pistols in the United States overtook the production of revolvers,
and with their larger ammunition magazines and faster reloading,
semiautomatics have added to the potential for mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The effect may be apparent in the number of deaths per murderous
incident, which suddenly increased in 1993 and has remained high
since, according to the analysis of FBI data by The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have drastically increased the ability to inflict death
and injury,'' said Tom Diaz, author of ``Making a Killing'' and a
senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center. ``That means
you can shoot more rounds faster and easier, what they call spray
and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Times study, wielders of semiautomatics inflicted more
injuries. The ratio of maimed to killed victims was 50 percent
higher than for those who used other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the increased availability of high-powered weapons may not
explain everything. Some kinds of multiple murder have declined or
remained static. Killings of three or more people to cover up
another felony, like robbery, have not increased, for example.
Neither have multiple killings of relatives. The number of
incidents in which three or more died and the principal victim was
a family member has remained fairly steady, around 30 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the most common type of this violence was in the
family,'' said James Alan Fox, author of ``Overkill'' and one of
the nation's foremost experts on mass murder. ``Now it's no longer
true. It's in the workplace and in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the crimes may be feeding on one another,
particularly in an era of saturation coverage by cable television.
Fourteen of the killers expressed knowledge about their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ladislav Antalik, a Czech immigrant who killed two
former co-workers and then himself after being fired from his job
in Research Triangle Park, N.C., in 1994, had a newspaper article
in his car describing a previous massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine killers talked of doing it bigger and better than
it had been done before. William Kreutzer, known as Crazy Kreutzer,
as he set out to mow down a company of soldiers at Fort Bragg with
an assault rifle and a semiautomatic pistol, told a friend he knew
what the record number of multiple killings was.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the question of whether one event brought on the
next, experts say the recent increases in these crimes strongly
suggest a social contagion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you get a lot of people doing the same thing?'' said
Joseph Westermeyer, a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota
who has studied epidemics of explosive murder in other cultures.
``I think there is this copycat element.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler, in his book, documented two cases of soldiers' running
amok with a tank in Germany in the 1980s after a widely publicized
tank attack there. Army security was increased, and ``tank amok
never happened in Germany again,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   An angry, depressed, unstable, perhaps mentally ill person picks
up a gun because it has become a known alternative. ``Something
that was inconceivable to many people suddenly becomes
conceivable,'' Messner said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke University,
who has studied social contagions, said, ``The transmission
mechanism seems to be nothing more or less than that it's an idea
that's in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have these kind of catastrophic consequences from what
seems a minor change in the environment.''

HOW YOUNGEST KILLERS DIFFER: PEER SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Colo., Calif., Mass)   (Eds.: With RAMPAGE-KILLERS) 
 By FORD FESSENDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Evan Ramsey, 16, strode into the lobby of his high school
in Bethel, Alaska, in 1997 and shot a popular basketball player in
the stomach, there were already spectators gathered on the
mezzanine above _ students that he had told to be there to witness
his ``evil day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may not have known exactly what was to transpire, but at
least two students at Bethel Regional High had been intimately
involved in the planning of Ramsey's crime, in which two people
died. One student showed Ramsey how to load the shotgun the day
before. The other carried a camera to record the event, but forgot
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Such goading, sometimes even collaboration, is not uncommon
among the school-age killers who were part of a study by The New
York Times of 100 rampage killings in the United States in the last
50 years. It is one of the principal factors that set them apart
from adult killers.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the adults were loners, who planned their
crimes surreptitiously, even though they almost always broadcast
their intentions. Some of the teen-agers, on the other hand,
sought, and often obtained, reinforcement from their peers and
boasted of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme cases, including the shootings at Columbine
High School, teen-agers actually killed together. All of the adults
killed alone.
</P>
<P>
   In two other cases involving teen-agers, including Ramsey's,
collaborators were prosecuted, and in at least two more, police
have said they believe schoolmates or friends played a role.
</P>
<P>
   As the country approaches the anniversary of the killings at
Columbine, which crystallized public horror over rampage killings,
this distinction is crucial to understanding, and even preventing,
school shootings, many experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing study by the Secret Service's National Threat
Assessment Center of 40 cases of school violence over the last 20
years has reached some of the same conclusions. The study, done in
conjunction with the Department of Education, found that teen-age
killers often communicated their plans or shared their feelings
with other students, in sharp contrast to the pattern of adults.
</P>
<P>
   In most ways, rampage killings involving young offenders are no
different from those involving adults, The Times found in compiling
its database. Young killers are as likely to strike in small towns
as in big cities. Both groups are mostly white, but with some
blacks and Asian-Americans. Both favor semiautomatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But in other compelling ways, the teen-age killers differ. While
serious mental health problems are common among them, fewer commit
suicide after their crimes, The Times found. The younger killers
are less emotionally detached and more susceptible to peer
influence, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, school violence is declining. The number of homicides
and assaults at schools is down. But a series of mass killings at
schools in the last four years has seemed to present the country
with an ugly new face of school crime _ the sudden, explosive
rampage killing.
</P>
<P>
   Although these shootings seem new, the Times study shows that
teen-age rampage killers were around far before the recent trend.
Anthony Barbaro, an honor student, killed three and wounded nine at
his high school in Olean, N.Y., in 1974. Brenda Spencer, 16, using
a rifle given to her for her birthday, killed two and wounded nine
at an elementary school near her house in San Diego in 1979. ``I
don't like Mondays,'' she told reporters. ``This livens up the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious mental problems were reported in the histories of 10 of
the 19 teen-agers in the Times study. Two had been in psychiatric
hospitals. Six showed evidence of psychotic delusions. Five had
seen a mental health professional, and four had prescriptions for
psychiatric drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's quite possible that you're seeing incipient
mental disorder,'' said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist at
the University of California at San Diego, who has just completed a
study on juvenile rampage killers. ``But a lot if times it will be
minimized or not identified as readily as adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hempel, chief forensic psychiatrist at the Vernon campus
of North Texas State Hospital and Meloy's co-author, said the fact
that many of the adolescents were able to work with others was a
strong argument that they were less likely to be mentally ill, or
at least that their illness was in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people pair up to commit one of these, the odds of a
major mental illness go way down,'' Hempel said. ``Very few people
who don't have a mental illness can get together and plan something
with someone with a major mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that for many adolescents the plan to kill is a
way of thinking about getting even, so the point is to discuss it.
``Kids talk to kids about this stuff because fantasy is a
process,'' said Frank C. Sacco, director of a mental health clinic
in Springfield, Mass., who is researching school violence.
</P>
<P>
   The companionship may even make the crimes possible. ``Pairing
then allows them to do these acts where acting alone doesn't,''
Meloy said. ``It gives them courage or stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that peers know in advance may make it easier to
head off potential crimes. And immaturity may also point the way to
hope for prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is they're not as tightly wrapped emotionally
when they do mass murder,'' Meloy said. ``Given their emotional
ability, they should be more accessible to interventions and
treatment.''

GOOD TIMES COULD BURDEN INCUMBENT PREMIER IN GREEK VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ For Greeks, their economy, their standing in
Europe and even their tense relationship with Turkey are better now
than at any time since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And it is this new confidence that could be the biggest
liability for Costas Simitis, the Socialist prime minister, in what
has shaped up to be an extremely close race for re-election Sunday
against his challenger, Costas Karamanlis, leader of the
center-right New Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Greek voters may be more or less satisfied with Simitis
and his party, Pasok, those who are weary of the Socialists' long
lock on power and secure enough now to look for change, may be
tempted to take a risk and select a fresh, if untested, face,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are making up their minds on something that is not
discussed in public and cannot actually be done at the polls,''
said Thanos Veremis, a political analyst who heads a foreign policy
research group in Athens. ``How to change the government without
getting rid of Simitis? Greeks are happy with him, but they are
tired of the Pasok party's rule and the corruption that comes with
longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice is made more tempting still by the closeness of the
candidates economic and foreign policy platforms. Both espouse the
same fundamental choices for Greece _ cooperation with the United
States and other NATO allies, and cautious rapprochement with
Turkey and fiscal restraint to meet prerequisites for membership in
the European Union's joint currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign itself has focused on unemployment, health care,
schools and the feverishly volatile Greek stock market, which
boomed last year but has since plummeted, enraging small-time
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Pasok has held power since 1981, except for 1990-1993. Elected
in 1996, Simitis, 64, quickly shed the welfare state policies and
passionately anti-American rhetoric of his flamboyant predecessor,
Andreas Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
   Like Prime Minister Tony Blair in Britain, he moved his party
toward the center. Two years ago, the Greek economy fell
embarrassingly short of the minimum standards for the euro. Greece
has since caught up, cutting inflation, public debt and interest
rates and stabilizing the drachma, and it is almost certain to be
included to use the euro next January.
</P>
<P>
   That success could work against Simitis, since he called early
elections on the grounds that Greece needed a stable, experienced
government to lead it to the euro. Greeks already believe that has
been done.
</P>
<P>
   Karamanlis, 43, a lawyer who studied foreign policy in the
United States and is fluent in English, does not suggest he would
do differently, just better. ``We are the authentic expression of a
European orientation,'' he said at a campaign rally at the Olympic
Stadium in Athens on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He complained when Greece supported Turkey's effort to be
considered for membership in the European Union, saying the
government had failed to wring enough concessions from Turkey. But
those nationalist sentiments seem mainly aimed at garnering votes.
He assured American academics at a private lunch last year at his
alma mater, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston,
that Turkey belonged in Europe, using the same pragmatic language
as the Greek foreign minister, George Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo, which was fiercely
opposed by almost all Greeks, New Democracy again sought to tap
into popular sentiment by fiercely denouncing the United States and
its allies, at times echoing the rhetoric of Greece's small,
hard-line Communist party. But few in Greece believe that if
Karamanlis were elected, he would reverse the current government's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Karamanlis, who has spent his career in New Democracy party
politics, is mostly counting on voters' thirst for change. But his
chief credential is his lineage as the nephew and namesake of
Konstantinos Karamanlis, the founder of New Democracy and a
legendary former president and prime minister who coaxed the
European Union to accept Greek membership in 1981, six years ahead
of Spain or Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of polarizing policy disputes has forced a curious
reversal of roles _ Simitis campaigned as a capitalist while
Karamanlis moved left, portraying himself as the champion of labor
unions, farmers and other constituencies usually claimed by
Socialist parties. But his chances mainly rest on whether voters
will trust him to competently execute policies Simitis pushed
through.
</P>
<P>
   Many have not yet made up their minds. ``I will decide at the
last minute,'' Maria Christodulakou, 36, a schoolteacher in Sparta,
said Saturday. ``They do not really differ,'' she explained. ``I
don't think there is a big risk if either man is elected.''

30 YEARS AFTER NEW YORK LEGALIZED ABORTION, POLITICIANS OF THE TIME

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y _ To one side, it was an epochal breakthrough for
women's rights. To the other, it felt like the end of civilization.
A defining political and cultural event, it stunned nearly
everyone, and its tiniest details remain etched in the players'
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago this week, New York state legalized abortion,
adopting what was the most liberal law in the country, three years
before the Supreme Court made abortion legal nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The state's decision turned on dramatic, hard-to-predict
legislative votes and tactical errors by abortion opponents. It was
decided by the last-minute change of a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   New York had a Republican governor then, Nelson Rockefeller, and
Republicans controlled both houses of the Legislature. Of the 207
legislators, just four were women.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving supporters of that 1970 bill will celebrate the
anniversary on Tuesday at the Yale Club in New York City, at a
reception sponsored by the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League, known as NARAL. Their adversaries plan no
gathering, but are acutely aware of the date.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, a few states had carved limited exceptions out of what
was essentially a nationwide ban on abortion. A few weeks before
New York's Legislature acted, Hawaii approved the nation's first
broad legalization, but it applied only to Hawaii residents.
</P>
<P>
   New York was second, and its law went farther since it imposed
no residency requirement. In the first two years, 60 percent of
women having abortions in New York were from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Assemblyman Percy Sutton of Manhattan
introduced New York's first bill to loosen the prohibition. In
1967, 1968 and 1969, the Assembly defeated bills by Assemblyman
Albert Blumenthal of Manhattan to permit abortion under very
limited circumstances. The third vote was the closest, 78-69.
</P>
<P>
   But before 1970, the Republican Senate majority leader, Earl
Brydges of Niagara Falls, a staunch abortion opponent, would not
allow a vote in his house.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, some of the surviving participants
shared their memories of the legalization debate:
</P>
<P>
   John J. Marchi, a Republican state senator from Staten Island:
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion had barely entered into the public dialogue. I
remember attending the (New York state) Constitutional Convention
of 1967, and there wasn't a single bill on the subject, nor was
there any advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Ohrenstein, a former Democratic state senator from
Manhattan:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were living in a time of enormous change. There was the
war. There was the women's movement, which was really bringing the
abortion issue to a crescendo. It was the end of the civil rights
era, and we viewed this as a civil right. In '65, we had repealed
the death penalty, which people thought was impossible. There was a
sense that extraordinary things were possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lader, then chairman of what was then called the
National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws:
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just formed NARAL, in February 1969 at a meeting in
Chicago. We decided at that first meeting to concentrate on New
York state as our breakthrough state. We felt that New York
represented our best opportunity, and we knew that other states
often looked to New York as setting an example. So we set up tables
and gathered petitions in key districts in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Shack, then an organizer with the New York Civil
Liberties Union, now president of the board of NARAL:
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign to change the law was largely run by men, which
really tells you about that time. And people forget that back then,
a big part of the argument was about economics. Women with money
could get abortions. They could pay doctors to do them, or they
could go to Puerto Rico or to another country. Poor women, on the
other hand, were dying in droves from unsafe abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Long, chairman of the New York State Conservative
Party:
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion was a nonissue up until then. The party wasn't even
united on it then, because nobody had given it much thought. We
first put a pro-life plank in the party platform in 1968, and we
had a big internal fight about it. Nobody _ and I mean nobody _
expected this to become a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Constance Cook, a former Republican assemblywoman from Ithaca:
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed Al Blumenthal's bills with great interest, but a
Democrat really couldn't get a bill passed in those days, with the
Republicans in control. So in '69, Franz Leichter and I sponsored a
bill for a full-fledged repeal, and we did it again in 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Clinton Dominick III, a former Republican state senator from
Newburgh:
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Blumenthal and Fred Ohrenstein came up with the strategy of
doing it first in the Senate. The Senate was perceived to be the
more conservative house, and they thought if the Senate passed it,
that would improve the chances in the Assembly. So Fred Ohrenstein
came to me and said, `Would you be a sponsor?' I told Fred, `Only
if you get a bunch of other Republicans to be co-sponsors.' A
couple of days later, he came back to me and said the only other
Republican who would be a sponsor was Roy Goodman. But I said OK,
anyway. And then Fred said they decided that it would be best to
have a Republican as the prime sponsor. So without my doing much of
anything, I became the prime sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren M. Anderson, a former Republican state senator from
Binghamton, later the majority leader:
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't all that much lobbying on it, and especially not
against it. The big groups that have formed around this issue over
the last 30 years barely even existed then.''
</P>
<P>
   Long:
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really gear up over it because we didn't think it
would pass. It came rather fast, and it even took the church by
surprise, because their main concern was the aid for schools. I
remember a lot of us being kind of angry at the cardinal (Cardinal
Terence Cooke) and the bishops for not doing more, that if they had
all gone to Albany, it would have changed the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Lader:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Church was caught off guard. They didn't think we
had a chance, so they were really not that loud on the subject
until the end. The church was really focused on a bill for state
aid to parochial schools. The other strategic error was by Earl
Brydges, in letting it come to a vote. There were bills to create
limited allowances for abortion, but Brydges made sure that what
came to a vote was a bill for out-and-out pure repeal, full
legalization, no restrictions. A lot of his colleagues said it was
a ploy on his part, because he thought the more liberal the bill,
the more likely it would be defeated, and that would put an end to
it. He just miscalculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson:
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I don't know why Earl allowed a vote. Generally,
he was pretty forthright about what he was up to, but this was one
he kept to himself. I was as close to him as anyone in the
Legislature, and I don't know what he was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy M. Goodman, a Republican state senator from Manhattan:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most fascinating debate we've ever had in the
Senate, because the outcome was really unclear, and furthermore it
struck me as likely that some minds might change. It was a very
tense thing. I remember I studied for literally days, looking into
the embryology of the fetus, preparing for the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchi:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cliffhanger, and a number of people unexpectedly
voted in favor of it. I wasn't persuaded that we had lost until we
had the roll-call vote. I was in disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 18, 1970, the Senate was packed. The debate took more
than five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``From those of us opposing this bill, I hear a buoyancy and a
luminous debate,'' Marchi said in the floor debate. ``But from
those on the other side I hear plaintiveness and anguish. And it
must be this way, for we are for life and they are against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said: ``The present abortion law encourages butchery. We
torture the fetus and we allow them to be born in stunted and
twisted form. This law presses down unmercifully on the poor. Is
this equality under God?''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators had refused to say in advance how they would
vote, and even as the roll call began, the result was unclear.
Brydges spoke last, his voice gravelly and slow. ``I have a deep,
real, abiding conviction that this is the wrong way for the state
to go,'' he said, ``because we are a bellwether state, and many
other states will follow our lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The tally was 31 for, 26 against. Thirteen Republicans and 18
Democrats voted for the bill; 20 Republicans and 6 Democrats voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Ohrenstein:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was the majority leader of the Senate, a very powerful
man, a respected man, Earl Brydges, a very orthodox Catholic, and
he got up and made a speech, practically in tears, and he was
heartsick. He could have stopped it, but he said that he wasn't
going to stand in the way of the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman:
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt him tremendously that the vote worked out the way it
did. When it was over he slumped into his chair and just dissolved
in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Lader:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate vote set the Catholic Church off, and then they
really started to put pressure on the Assembly members. They had
children at parochial schools write letters to Assembly members.
Cardinal Cooke had a pastoral letter read in every church. When it
came to a vote, there were nuns and priests walking the floor of
the Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook:
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Senate vote, we amended the bill in the Assembly
because it had no restrictions at all, and we didn't think that had
a very good chance of passing. So we made it unrestricted abortion
up to 24 weeks, and after that only for the life of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Franz S. Leichter, a former state senator who was then a
Democratic Assemblyman from Manhattan:
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the first vote (on March 30) and it was 73 for to 70
against. But we needed 76 votes, an absolute majority of the house,
for it to pass. That certainly cast a pall and made us very
apprehensive, but we agreed to table it and try to bring it up a
second time (on April 9) ... People were really torn, as a matter
of conscience and as a matter of politics. People who had voted yes
the first time voted no, and people who had voted no the first time
voted yes. I spent 30 years in the Legislature, and it was one of
maybe 20 times that I saw a bill come to floor where you really
just didn't know what was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through an agonizing roll call, Assemblyman George M.
Michaels, a Democrat from a conservative, heavily Catholic, central
New York district, quietly voted no.
</P>
<P>
   The count ended at 74-74. One Assembly member was absent.
Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr., a Long Island Republican, did not
vote, in keeping with tradition that the speaker votes only if it
would affect the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Before the clerk could say ``record the vote'' and bring it to a
close, Michaels stood and asked to be recognized. At first he
rambled, his voice thick and trembling, and it was unclear where he
was headed. But heads turned when he said his constituents would
``condemn me for what I am about to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my sons just called me a whore for the vote I cast
against this,'' he said. Another son had told him, ``Dad, for God's
sake, don't let your vote be the vote that defeats this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully appreciate that this is the termination of my
political career,'' Michaels said. ``But Mr. Speaker, I must have
some peace in my family. And I therefore request you, Mr. Speaker,
to change my negative vote to an affirmative vote.''
</P>
<P>
   He crumpled into his seat and buried his face in his hands, as
bedlam swallowed the chamber. Supporters of the bill whooped,
opponents shouted ``No!'' and people on both sides wept. An
adversary screamed epithets at Michaels. Blumenthal kissed his
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Duryea cast the final ``aye'' vote, making it 76-73. Voting yes
were 46 Democrats and 30 Republicans. Voting no were 24 Democrats
and 49 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Senate passed the Assembly version of the
bill, 31-26. The day after that, April 11, Rockefeller signed it
into law. ``The wives of the Senate and the Assembly put this bill
through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that year's elections, Michaels, Dominick and a handful of
others who supported the bill lost to anti-abortion challengers.
Michaels died in 1992 at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the Legislature voted to repeal the 1970 law, but
Rockefeller vetoed it. In January 1973, the Supreme Court made its
landmark ruling in Roe vs. Wade, patterned in part on the New York
law.
</P>
<P>
   Cook:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have a sense at that time that we had done
something momentous, though it was long overdue. Looking back now,
it seems like a bigger deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Long:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to look back and see how the New York
Republicans have tended to remain a moderate party, while the
national Republicans have moved to the right on abortion and other
issues. Look at George Pataki and Rudy Giuliani, who are both on
the opposite side from us on this issue. The Republicans in New
York actually have a pro-choice plank in their platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchi:
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion has become fairly automatic. It's a tragedy. I don't
think you're going to have total elimination of it, but I think you
will see a gradual evolution of measures against it. I would say
this and capital punishment are the worst things the Legislature
has done in my time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Shack:
</P>
<P>
   ``This was absolutely the most important thing I ever did. We
knew that nothing would ever be the same again. We knew that we
were changing the world.''

FUJIMORI'S FUTURE CLOUDY, NO MATTER HOW SUNDAY'S VOTE GOES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ For a decade, President Alberto Fujimori has been
Latin America's master of crisis management, defeating terrorist
insurrections, hyperinflation and drug traffickers, as well as
settling a 150-year border dispute with neighboring Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   But as 14 million voters decide on Sunday whether these
successes should translate into five more years in office, Fujimori
faces his most serious political crisis since he shut down the
Congress and Supreme Court at the height of the guerrilla war in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he ekes out a first-round election victory, diplomats
and experts say, the campaign has been so marred by dirty tricks
and legal irregularities that Fujimori will emerge a weakened
leader. Several leading pollsters say a first-round win is unlikely
unless the president resorts to fraud, and election observers have
already received reports of preparations to steal the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accumulation of irregularities has meant that even if the
vote on Sunday goes without fraud, President Fujimori's third term
will be seen as illegitimate here and abroad,'' said Eduardo Stein,
a former Guatemalan foreign minister, who is leading an 80-member
Organization of American States observation team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a fair competition,'' he added, ``and if the
landscape of campaign irregularities is replicated on the day of
the vote, it will be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is important not only to Peru, where the little real
debate and independent media coverage the campaign has generated
has been infused by discussion of the legitimacy of the electoral
process itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is also likely to reverberate throughout a region where many
countries are still struggling to define the quality of their
democracies. This is particularly so in Venezuela, where another
elected strongman who has bent his country's democratic rules,
President Hugo Chavez, is facing a growing challenge in an election
set for May.
</P>
<P>
   A stolen victory would also place the United States in the
awkward position of having to decide whether to censure an
important ally in the effort to wipe out the drug trafficking and
insurgency that threaten the government in nearby Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Fujimori is being led by Alejandro Toledo, a
54-year-old business school professor whose rise from humble roots
has helped spur his popularity. He has also capitalized on the
growing concerns about the campaign as well as grumbling over three
years of particularly bad economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Press and television smear campaigns believed to be directed by
Fujimori's intelligence service destroyed the candidacies of two
leading opponents, catapulting Toledo into contention.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has been dominated over the last three months by a
scandal over the forgery of a million signatures to put Fujimori on
the ballot, egg-throwing mobs at opposition rallies and microphones
that went dead in the middle of opponents' speeches. There have
also been persistent reports from around the country that
recipients of government milk and cereal handouts have been
threatened with a cutoff if they do not attend Fujimori rallies and
vote for the president.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori tried feverishly to stop Toledo, television networks
owned by allies of the president began broadcasting a comedian
impersonating the challenger sitting next to a whiskey bottle. Nude
dancers appeared at a Toledo campaign rally this week with
television cameras in tow for live broadcasts, inspiring
speculation by many Peruvians and senior foreign election observers
that the dancers were planted by the Fujimori campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, an active duty army officer was assigned to
fetch a young girl from the provinces said to be the illegitimate
daughter of Toledo for the broadcast of a television talk show. And
the government began an investigation into the status of the
residency visa of Toledo's wife, Eliane Karp, a Belgian-born
naturalized American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has denied the variety of charges leveled against him,
and pollsters say he has actually surged in recent days in Lima, a
Fujimori stronghold with more than a third of the nation's votes.
Toledo has already vowed that he would cry fraud should he lose on
Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The campaign irregularities have been severely criticized by the
Clinton administration, the Organization of American States and
several public interest groups like the Atlanta-based Carter
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Senior diplomats here are already talking about drastic remedies
in case of fraud, including calls for a new election and
withdrawing recognition of the government by the Organization of
American States. The mounting political problems in Peru will
confront the organization with one of its biggest tests in years,
officials of the group said privately. They said they expected
Canada and the United States to try to mediate any conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moment of great crisis for the regime,'' said Enrique
Zileri, editor of Caretas, Peru's leading political magazine. ``If
Fujimori wins in the first round, a government that is totally
isolated and lacking legitimacy would result.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the election process began emerging as far back
as May 1997, when Congress dismissed three members of the
Constitutional Tribunal who had ruled that the law forbade Fujimori
from running for a third term. The opposition assembled enough
signatures to force a referendum on a third term in 1998, when
Congress, which is tightly controlled by Fujimori, ruled that
two-thirds of the legislators would also have to approve of a
referendum, sinking the vote.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Fujimori announced his candidacy last December, the
opposition had no way of challenging the legality of his campaign.
There has been sporadic violence over the issue, which has
intensified in recent days at rallies around the country, but no
leader has emerged to channel the discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Now Toledo, who has said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is his
hero, says he is ready to lead a vast civil disobedience movement
to protest the results should he lose.
</P>
<P>
   He has made a special plea to the army and police to guard the
election process. And to make his candidacy more attractive to
them, he has promised to raise police salaries and allow military
personnel to vote in the future. His pleas have been backed by
senior retired military officers who oppose Fujimori, and there are
persistent reports of discontent about the electoral process among
middle-rank army officers.
</P>
<P>
   International observers have already expressed fears of an
organized effort by Fujimori's allies to steal the election, even
with the help of election officials and senior military officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States observer team has received
numerous reports indicating that backers of Fujimori are training
hand-picked poll watchers in how to mangle vote tally sheets that
have large Toledo vote counts so that they will be disqualified. In
1995, 8 percent of tally sheets were disqualified in the
presidential vote and 40 percent in the vote for Congress, enough
to guarantee Fujimori's control, according to election observers.
</P>
<P>
   Other international observers have received reports that voters
dependent on government food and social programs have been given
ballots already marked for Fujimori and his congressional slate.
The voters _ observers say they are not sure how many may be
involved _ have been instructed to return the blank ballots they
receive at the voting places for payments ranging from about $1.50
to $3.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that fewer than half of the 88,000 voting tables
will be monitored by independent election inspectors.

U.S. RESISTS PLAN TO END TARIFFS AND QUOTAS FOR POOR NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is opposing a World Bank
proposal that would increase exports from the world's poorest and
most indebted nations for fear that it would inflame sentiments in
Congress against President Clinton's efforts to spur international
trade, particularly with China.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, pressed by the leaders of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund in preparation for their meetings here
next week, would allow some of the poorest nations of Africa, Latin
America and Asia to sell goods to the United States and other
Western nations without facing any tariffs or import quotas. That
could provide a huge economic advantage for those developing
countries, going significantly beyond the administration's efforts
to get Congress to forgive their debts as they undergo economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's opposition to the proposal comes at an
awkward moment, as demonstrators critical of the international
lending institutions assemble for a week of protests during their
meetings. Many of the protesters believe that the financial groups
do too little on behalf of the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   But as the trade proposal was argued out behind the closed doors
of the World Bank and the IMF, the administration worked behind the
scenes to scuttle it, said World Bank officials involved in the
negotiations. Those officials said they believed that the White
House feared that if they made such a commitment, it would undercut
the delicate support for the Africa trade bill, which has been
stuck in Congress, and that any promise of further opening
America's markets could undermine the huge effort to convince
Congress to normalize trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really caught in the middle here,'' one senior
administration official said on Friday, explaining why the White
House had refused to endorse a plan that would aid some of the most
struggling nations, including Senegal, Nicaragua, Congo, Kenya,
Honduras and Nigeria, which pose little competitive threat to
American firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to lift nations out of poverty is through
trade,'' the administration official said. ``But doing the right
thing here is not easy. We can't even get far more modest measures
through the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said she had
been unaware of the efforts to water down the World Bank effort.
But she said that ``the United States has a long record of support
for and delivery of preferential trade privileges for
least-developed countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the poorest countries, the United States, working with
Europe, Japan and Canada, have proposed an initiative'' that would
take much the same approach within the World Trade Organization,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a program, however, would likely be narrower in scope and
be enacted only after the Africa and China issues are already voted
on in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's quandary underscores the enormous economic
tensions that will be on display in Washington in coming days. Poor
nations will argue, as they did during the Seattle trade meetings
three months ago, that the United States and other rich nations are
using their enormous prosperity and technology to grow rapidly at
the expense of countries being left far behind by economic
globalization. That view is essentially endorsed in several reports
prepared for the spring meetings of the World Bank, which fights
poverty, and the IMF, which intercedes in economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   During his radio address Saturday, President Clinton briefly
mentioned his hope that Congress would agree to gradually wipe away
the debt of the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   But in Congress, where labor unions and others have argued
against further opening of American markets at a time of record
trade deficits, there is enormous resistance to removing tariffs or
quotas that protect American industries from low-cost manufacturing
abroad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For example, the Africa trade bill, which passed the Senate last
November but never passed the House, now includes requirements that
African nations hoping to export more clothing to the United States
duty free must buy American fabrics. Few of the countries could
afford to do so, making the market opening relatively worthless to
African weavers or small manufacturers. (Africa's trade with the
United States is comparatively small. The entire continent exports
about $13 billion in goods to the United States each year, roughly
what Japan exports here in a month.)
</P>
<P>
   But without such trade restrictions, members of Congress from
textile-producing states say they would have to vote against the
Africa bill. And the World Bank and IMF proposals would have
essentially undercut the bill's protections for American companies,
committing the United States, Europe and Japan to unrestricted
import of clothing, footwear or other goods from the most indebted
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that any such end run around
Congress would inflame many members, especially Democrats, thus
threatening the passage of the Africa bill and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, two main elements of Clinton's agenda
for his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Documents being prepared for discussion at next week's
Washington meetings are implicitly critical of how little the
world's wealthy nations have done to keep the divide between rich
and poor from increasing.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of one such paper, provided to The New York Times by the
World Bank, notes that during the Seattle meetings, the head of the
bank, James Wolfensohn, and the recently retired head of the IMF,
Michel Camdessus, called on major nations to spur imports from the
poorest nations. The paper describes the strategy as a way to
reverse the declining trend in foreign aid flows to these
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The paper refers to the critical importance of matching debt
relief with efforts to encourage exports that earn hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats involved in the drafting of the reports say that
the wording was toned down at the insistence of the United States
and, to a lesser degree, France and Japan. They all have a huge
sensitivity to opening their markets, particularly for agricultural
goods, and particularly in election years, one senior World Bank
official said. Instead of strongly recommending market openings,
the report now simply notes that ministers may wish to comment on
the subject.

<P>
   They are not drunk or high on drugs. They are not racists or
Satanists, or addicted to violent video games, movies or music.
</P>
<P>
   Most are white men, but a surprising number are women, Asians
and blacks. Many have college degrees, but most are unemployed.
Many are military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what
they plan to do. They carry semiautomatic weapons they have
obtained easily and, in most cases, legally.
</P>
<P>
   They do not try to get away. In the end, half turn their guns on
themselves or are shot dead by others. They not only want to kill,
they also want to die.
</P>
<P>
   That is the profile of the 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks
examined by The New York Times in a computer-assisted study looking
back more than 50 years and including the shootings in 1999 at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Four hundred twenty-five
people were killed and 510 people were injured in the attacks. The
database, which primarily focused on cases in the last decade, is
believed to be the largest ever compiled on this phenomenon in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though the attacks are rare when compared with other American
murders, they have provoked an intense national discussion about
crime, education and American culture. The Times found, however,
that the debate may have largely overlooked a critical issue: At
least half of the killers showed signs of serious mental health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was most intense last year, which began with echoes
of gunfire in a Salt Lake City television station in January and
ended with seven Honolulu office workers dead in November. In
between there was a berserk rampage by an Atlanta day trader that
left 12 dead and 13 injured. A self-styled fascist attacked a Los
Angeles day care center. Seven people died as a hymn ended in a
Fort Worth church.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most shocking were the shootings by two Columbine
High students who burst into classrooms and killed 13 and wounded
23.
 &UR;  &LR; While many possible causes have been cited, including violent
video games, a decline in moral values and the easy availability of
guns, there has been little serious study of this explosive
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis included only rampage homicides _
multiple-victim killings that were not primarily domestic or
connected to a robbery or gang. Serial killers were not included.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ While the killings have caused many people to point to violent
aspects of culture, there is little evidence that video games,
movies or television encouraged many attacks. In only six of the
100 cases did the killers have a known interest in violent video
games. Seven others were interested in violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a decade that had a sharp decrease in homicides, the
incidence of rampage killings appears to have increased, FBI data
show. Still, these killings remain extremely rare, much less than 1
percent of all homicides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Society has turned to law enforcement to resolve the rampage
killings. But the analysis shows that these cases may have more to
do with society's lack of knowledge of mental health issues than a
lack of security.
</P>
<P>
   The rage that boiled over into homicide was clearly building in
many. Of the cases reviewed, 63 involved people threatened violence
before the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not impulsive acts,'' said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic
psychologist at the University of California at San Diego. ``They
are not acts of affective violence, where they drink a lot and go
kill someone. There's a planning and purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was often a precipitating event _ a spark that set off
the tinder, and gave the crime the appearance of being at the same
time deliberate and impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most common precipitator was the loss of a job, which
was mentioned as a potential cause in 47 cases. A romantic issue _
a divorce or breakup _ was present in 22 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men see the loss of a job, or the loss of a mate, as
irrevocable and catastrophic,'' said David Buss, author of ``The
Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is as Necessary as Love and Sex''
and a psychology professor at the University of Texas. ``They set
out on a course to inflict the maximum cost on their rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recurring element were found, including some that
surprised the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Regular criminals try to get away. More than a third
of regular homicides went unsolved in 1997. But among the 102
killers in the Times database, not one got away. Eighty-nine never
even left the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three offenders killed themselves after their crimes.
Nine tried or wanted to, and four killed themselves later. Nine
were killed by the police or others, perhaps committing what some
call ``suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The link between suicide and homicide is a very real one, and
it hasn't been studied nearly enough,'' said Kay Redfield Jamison,
a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and
author of ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampage killers also differ by demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all murderers in this country are black. Eighty percent
went to high school, and no further. Most of them killed someone
they knew, or while committing another crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage killers were white, by far, though 18 of the 102 were
black, and seven Asian. The racial profile of the rampage killers
is close to that of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
   And rampage killers were far more likely to have military
backgrounds, and to kill strangers. And, rampage killers were older
than regular murderers, with more in their 40s and 50s and fewer in
their 20s, compared with the typical killer.
</P>
<P>
   Of rampage killers over 25, a third had college degrees. Another
third had some college education. Only nine had less than a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   And there seemed to be no urban bias for these crimes, as there
is for other violent crimes; 31 were in suburban areas, 25 were in
small towns or rural areas. Forty-two committed their crimes in
urban areas.  &QL;

SUDDEN DEFECTION IN VENEZUELA SCRAMBLES AN ELECTION SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARACAIBO, Venezuela _ For the second time in two years, a
former military officer vowing to dismantle a corrupt and
incompetent status quo has emerged to challenge Venezuela's
political establishment. This time, though, Hugo Chavez is not the
leader of the insurgency, but its main target _ and it is one of
his closest comrades in arms who is trying to drive him from the
presidency he has held for just 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arias Cardenas broke with Chavez and declared himself
a candidate barely a month ago. The challenge, which coincides with
signs of military discontent with Chavez, appears to have caught
the president by surprise and has resulted both in prominent
defections and increased squabbling within the government
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all political experts here are still predicting that
Chavez will triumph in the May 28 ``mega-election'' in which
virtually every elective office in this country of 23 million
people is up for grabs, as required by a new constitution made to
measure for the president. But at the very least, Arias' candidacy
has transformed what the Chavez camp envisioned as a leisurely
canter into a horse race whose outcome is no longer guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of his first year in office, Chavez, a
45-year-old left-leaning populist and nationalist, enjoyed an
approval rating of nearly 80 percent, a figure that was expected to
hold if Venezuela's two discredited traditional political parties
were foolish enough to offer an opponent. But many of the numerous
polls that have recently been published show him with a lead of
merely 10 to 12 points over Arias.
</P>
<P>
   Arias has been able to appeal to Chavez supporters precisely
because ``he comes from the same ranks'' as Chavez, said Teodoro
Petkoff, a former guerrilla leader and planning minister who is now
editor of a new newspaper called Tal Cual.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Arias' reformist credentials are such that
Chavez sympathizers can vote for him without feeling that they have
betrayed their ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president, Arias, 49, was one of the leaders of a
military coup attempt that failed in February 1992, was stripped of
his colonel's rank and served two years in prison. Since then, the
former seminary student has twice been elected governor of the
important oil-rich western state of Zulia while preaching a gospel
of probity and personal sacrifice in public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the electorate sees is a man who cannot be identified
either with the past or the present, but articulates a very
different message than Chavez, and in a very different way,'' said
Anibal Romero, author of ``Decadence and the Crisis of Democracy''
and other books on Venezuelan politics. ``And for the middle class
that never liked Chavez, Arias is their new champion by default,
because there is nothing else.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In what was seen as an effort to brake Arias' momentum and
deprive him of opportunities to get his message across, the
Chavez-dominated national electoral council has forbidden formal
campaigning until May 1.
</P>
<P>
   But a ``caravan of support'' here in Arias' home state had all
the hallmarks of a stump rally, suggesting the tone of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dignity, decency and good management!'' and ``No more empty
talk!'' were among the slogans blaring from loudspeakers as a
procession of more than 150 vehicles wound its way through the
streets of a working class neighborhood near a large oil refinery.
Earlier, in a speech at the airport, Arias sounded essentially the
same themes before a largely middle class audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time of words that deceive and simply encourage hatred and
vengeance should give way to better living conditions for all
Venezuelans,'' he said, rejecting what he described as
``demagogic'' calls for class struggle. ``This country is not poor
because someone has a nice house or car, but because of a lack of
proper, competent administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias, whose oratory is more restrained and manner less
exuberant than the still popular Chavez, has also hammered away at
what he describes as massive corruption, singling out Chavez's
closest adviser, Luis Miquilena. In response, Miquilena has called
Arias ``a Judas,'' but since polls show Miquilena is one of the
country's least popular public figures, his attacks may actually
have worked to the challenger's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the independent comptroller general whom Chavez
forces ousted in December delivered an annual report last week that
said the current government is no less corrupt than previous
administrations and pointed to ``a deplorable situation'' in a
military-run civic assistance program that is one of Chavez's
favorites. That has fed popular disillusionment and concerns about
the more prominent role Chavez wants for the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez promised us a social and economic revolution, but all
he has done is concentrate power in his own hands and give us the
old-style politics with a different cast of characters,'' said
Cesar Guevara, 40, whose last job was as a door-to-door survey
taker for a marketing company. ``Unemployment and crime are way up,
so we are worse off now than when he took over. No, we need to go
back to the true ideals of this movement so that we can have a real
change.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent manifesto, a group of more than 100 retired officers
led by Fernando Ochoa, a former minister of defense, warned that
under Chavez the armed forces ``have begun to be seen as an
organization at the service of a political project and not the
nation.'' Chavez, they said, has ``politicized the armed forces and
fractured their internal unity'' by using military events to
``batter and insult his political adversaries and vast sectors of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Chavez is also having to contend with divisions
within his left-wing Patriotic Pole coalition. As the result of
squabbles over the spoils of power, the 23-party grouping has been
unable to agree on a unified slate and has strengthened the chances
of anti-Chavez forces by running two or even three candidates for
some state and legislative posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a month ago, we were all wondering whether Chavez was
going to have any organized opposition at all after May 28,'' a
Latin American diplomat here said. ``Now not only has it taken
shape, but it comes from within Chavez's own movement, in the form
of Arias Cardenas and other dissidents, rather than from outside.''

U.S. STEPPING UP PRESSURE FOR HANDOVER OF CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is inexorably increasing
the pressure on the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez to reunite
him with his father _ and hoping it happens without resistance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has reason to be chary of the lingering
Cold War passions that divide the United States and Cuba, has tried
to moderate the tensions set off by the case of the Cuban boy. But
the Justice Department, with the White House's concurrence, has
nonetheless made ever more clear that the government's patience is
nearing its end.
</P>
<P>
   The major question facing administration officials at this point
is whether persuasion alone will bring about a peaceful transfer of
the boy this week, or whether it will take the force of law to
overcome defiance among the Miami relatives and their crowds of
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Saturday that a number of plans had
been prepared for the handover of Elian to his father, including
his removal from the home of Miami relatives by armed federal
marshals.
</P>
<P>
   The official added that everyone in the government hoped the
return of Elian to his father's custody would be accomplished
voluntarily and peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The official said: ``Are we capable of enforcing this action by
force? Yes. Does anybody want to see that happen? No.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the Cuban issue has been a problem for two decades.
Clinton links his 1980 re-election defeat as governor of Arkansas
in part to rioting among 20,000 Cuban refugees temporarily
resettled at Fort Chaffee, Ark., by the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Clinton has walked a careful line on relations
with Cuba, offering modest steps to increase cooperation and travel
between the two countries while maintaining the strict 38-year-old
economic embargo on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on cue from the president, officials from the White
House, State Department and Justice Department all expressed hope
in public and private last week that the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who arrived here on Thursday from Cuba, can work out an
amicable custody deal with his Miami relatives, who have kept Elian
since he was rescued at sea last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother, Elizabet Brotons, died when their boat sank as
they fled Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The administration does not relish the idea of Cuban-American
Miami rebelling over the repatriation of Elian. But neither does it
want to jeopardize the slow and delicate diplomatic opening to
Havana begun last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as other agencies are handling the emotional issue of the
shipwrecked boy, the State Department is trying to manage an
incremental opening to Havana. Last year the administration
announced that it would permit additional charter flights to Cuba
from the United States and would approve significantly more visas
for researchers, athletes, journalists, artists and students to
travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles played an exhibition game against the
Cuban national team last spring, and other sports events are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also quietly seeking broader cooperation
with Cuba on immigration, drug smuggling, the environment and
human-rights matters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly said that the case will be handled under
existing immigration law, which would most likely result in Elian's
return to Cuba with his father and his stepmother, Nercy Carmenate.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said that administration officials
were of one mind on the matter _ with the exception of Vice
President Al Gore, who broke with the president and announced that
he wanted the case moved into Florida family court, where Elian's
relatives in Miami might have a better chance of winning permanent
custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no split in the administration over what we hope
happens,'' the official said. ``There is great concern if the
family in Miami seeks a confrontation; there's no telling what
direction this could go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pastor, who handled Latin American policy at the National
Security Council under President Carter, said that Clinton should
harbor little hope of separating the Gonzalez case from 40 years of
pained history between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor also noted that Cuban-American tensions always seemed to
rise in election years and that this case was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no U.S.-Cuban issue that is not politicized,'' said
Pastor, now a professor of political science at Emory University in
Atlanta. ``The United States and Cuba have been contesting a
divorce for 41 years, so it's not surprising that this would be the
mother of all custody fights.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pastor said that the riots at Fort Chaffee in June 1980, which
left more than 40 Cubans and Arkansas law-enforcement officers
injured, caused a strain in relations between Clinton and Carter
that took years to heal. Clinton blamed Carter for sending
thousands of Cubans to Arkansas without adequate provision for
their security.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat monitoring the case at the State Department said that
officials there were ``happily out of the picture.'' He expressed
hope that Justice Department and immigration officers can persuade
the families to agree to a peaceful transfer of Elian to his
father's care.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have said that while they believe
the department has authority to order the boy's immediate handover
to his father, officials are trying to handle the case in a
``sensitive'' manner and would be willing to accept a few days'
delay to accommodate the wishes of Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But they have now set a schedule for meetings on Monday to
discuss the methods of the handover, with the boy's return to his
father coming shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has to handle this very delicately because
of the intensity of feelings, and it's not going to be easy,''
Pastor said. ``It's not going to be easy.''

the Nazis during World War II never took place. She also depicts
him as an extremist who manipulates, distorts and falsifies history

strong push in South Carolina has demonstrated to Georgia lawmakers
that they can't postpone the flag debate forever. But some
Democratic leaders were hoping to have the summer and fall to try
to build a coalition to push legislation in January to remove the
confederate battle emblem. With Marty King's pronouncement this
week that the state would be under a boycott if the change doesn't
occur next year, leaders have to try to figure out how to smooth

   COXNET FOCUS 0408: A SEASON ON THE LAND -- More flue-cured
tobacco is grown in Pitt County, North Carolina, than anywhere else
in the nation. The culture and the economy are rooted in tending
the leaf, and in the self-reliant way of life such labor demands.
Yet as court rulings, public opinion and pressure from Washington
alter the fortunes of tobacco, change has made its way into the
fields. There will be fewer and fewer lives like the ones Betty and
W.C. Moore of Bethel live, shaped and bound by the rituals of
passing seasons on the farm. (Schulken, The Daily Reflector) Art
includes a 5-column color photo of a farmer tending his fields, a
2-column color photo of a farm, a 2-column color photo of a farmer
eating lunch with his family and a 1-column color photo of a
farmer's wife ringing the dinner bell.

   WITH: TOBACCO PRIMER -- In their infancy tobacco plants look
like tiny shamrocks. As many as a million plants have taken root in
the warmth of W.C. Moore's greenhouse, snug in Styrofoam seed
crates, resting on a bed of water. They were sowed in mid-March,
and in April, when the threat of a hard freeze is past, they will
be transplanted in the field, the first crop of a new century. The
green fuzz sprouting in the seed crates doesn't look like much. But
with an average price, the half-million pounds of leaf it will grow
into could net $850,000. (Schulken, The Daily Reflector) Art

   BRITAIN-LIPSTADT _ LONDON _ The parties prepare for the verdict
in the case of author David Irving, who is suing Emory University
professor Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books for
libel over assertions made about him in her 1994 book, ``Denying
the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and
</P>
<P>
   Memory.'' Lipstadt portrayed Irving, 62, as a prominent and
dangerous ``Holocaust denier,'' who believes the systematic murder
of 6 million Jews by the Nazis during World War II never took
place. She also depicts him as an extremist who manipulates,
distorts and falsifies history for his own purposes. We re-cap the
story to this point; and why it is important. (Roughton, Cox News

   HANK-WILLIAMSIII _ Looking at 27-year-old Shelton Hank Williams
_ or Hank III as he's calling himself these days _ is like staring
into the face of a ghost. He is the spitting image of his famous
grandfather _ tall, skinny, almost woefully pale with thin lips and
chisled nose that could be reprinted straight from old black and
white publicity photos made in the 1940s. Deep in the back of a
mint green tour bus, the young legacy sits hunched over a beaten
guitar staring aimlessly at the worn carpet under his shredded
cowboy boots, waiting to go onstage in front of hundreds of pierced
and tattooed punk rockers at the cavernous Atlanta nightspot, The
Masquerade. As he launches a music career _ which started out
country and has now careened into thrash rock _ he seems keenly
aware of the inevitable comparisons that will be made to his family
tree. And Hank III has made a decision: He's going to uphold the
hard-living Family Tradition. (MLongino, Atlanta

   BKO-BASKETBALL-TRAGEDY _ On the afternoon of Sept. 16, Travis
Davenport lifted weights and shot hoops at his old high school
gymnasium. As always, his closest friends discouraged him from
joining their pick-up game. They echoed the advice of his doctors,
his pastor, his mother and other grown-ups. This time, Travis
listened, although it surely pained him. Basketball was his
passion. He played it year-round until the first in a series of
fainting spells. Even then, he occasionally would slip onto the
court. Just a few days earlier, a cardiologist had restated in no
uncertain terms that he must give up the game. So Travis, obediant,
tossed up casual jumpshots in the gym before heading south, back to
college in Cochran. That night, he collapsed and died. (Tierney,

SPORTS COLUMN: ANTHEM LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Thank goodness the Czechs won a match and
have a sense of humor. They apparently understand that when you
come to America, you take the gaffes with the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``To bring this Laker Girls and all this stuff, this is what we
like,'' Jan Kukal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls, especially,'' said Slava Dosedel after the Czech
Republic's Davis Cup team got a healthy helping of Hollywood, in
all its glitzy, vacuous splendor.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs love the hotel at Marina del Rey, but the freeway
traffic they could do without. They are enjoying the sights of Los
Angeles, but don't always appreciate the sounds.
</P>
<P>
   They heard the wrong national anthem Friday afternoon before
splitting the opening-day singles matches at the Great Western
Forum. Somebody worked very hard on a souped-up introduction
ceremony but forgot to consult an updated map. The Czech anthem
that was played was an old version _ the Slovakian march in
addition to the symphonic Czech part _ from before the peaceful
split.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is divided seven years, you know?'' said Kukal,
the Czech team captain, who ought to know because he is married to
a Slovak and lives in Bratislava, Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   When we last saw the U.S. team, triumphant in Zimbabwe, Captain
John McEnroe was referring to the quarterfinal opponent as
``Czechoslovakia,'' so maybe the organizers of
Davis-Cup-does-David-Stern didn't know. Or it could be there just
wasn't time to worry about diplomacy, with more pressing priorities
such as fireworks and Laker Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be lucky if they don't play the Russian anthem,''
McEnroe, a veteran Hollywood guy, joked earlier in the week, when
Kukal proactively raised the issue.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Kukal pointed out that the Slovak part
was played at a more accurate pace than the Czech part. No problem.
Patty Smyth McEnroe's rendition of our anthem and Lenny Kravitz's
``American Women'' sounded just right.
</P>
<P>
   Someone might have assured Kukal that this was no big deal in a
town where historical events are regularly interpreted loosely for
the benefit of dramatic effect. If McEnroe's team should go on to
win the Cup, they'll make a movie and we should expect the fans to
be serenading the Czechs with ``Commies, go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Our lines between entertainment and sports continue to blur.
Yes, those were the Laker Girls prancing between sets (not matches,
sets!) in tennis wear to Kravitz's remake of the old Guess Who hit.
The player introductions were vintage Charlotte Hornets vs. Miami
Heat. The noncorporate simplicity that made the first round in
Zimbabwe so refreshing just two months ago was as ancient as Bill
Tilden here once the Forum lights dimmed and the fireworks smoked
up the joint.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, we like our events dressed up and revved up, with
energy and attitude, the reason this round was awarded to Los
Angeles in the first place. It was the perfect script, the
sure-fire way of guaranteeing that reticent local boy Pete Sampras
would make the commute. McEnroe would have his dream team, Andre
Agassi and Sampras; we would beat up on the overmatched Czechs, and
the American Davis Cup cause would get a major marketing boost.
</P>
<P>
   As McEnroe says, ``Weird things happen in Davis Cup.'' Maybe the
anthem slight had nothing to do with Jiri Novak's three-set
demolition of Sampras, but that was Kukal's story and he was
sticking with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this can happen, maybe it, you know, help
Jiri,'' Kukal said. ``Novak played without respect. He got really
angry, and he woke up in dressing room after match. ``
</P>
<P>
   Meaning he forgot he was supposed to lose and played in a
possessed, nationalistic fervor. Unfortunately for the Czechs, by
the time Dosedel got on against Agassi, he was distracted _
presumably by Guess Who? _ and was dispatched in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Czechs' goal of surviving for the reverse singles Monday
was reached. Kukal was even wondering if the old anthem could be
played again Saturday, before Novak and David Rikl took on the
American team of Alex O'Brien and Jared Palmer in the doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do it, poor O'Brien and Palmer,'' Kukal said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't starting any international incidents. Europeans tend
to be bewildered and amused by our sports pageantry excess, our
need to decorate every event like it is the Super Bowl halftime
show. As far as Kukal was concerned, it was just another case of
Americans awash in the wonderfulness of being No. 1 _ or in the
case of Agassi and Sampras, No. 1 and No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Kukal was a good sport; he even applauded one of the few winners
Sampras hit. With all due respect to Lenny Kravitz, we still should
have got the Czech anthem right.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think in Europe this might not happen,'' Kukal said.
``It can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosedel said, just wait, when the Americans next come to Prague,
they can expect to hear the Mexican anthem. Then someone asked him
what he was thinking when the anthem kept going after it reached
the Slovak border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to whistle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say why, or at whom. &QL;

GERMANS SEEK FOREIGN LABOR FOR NEW ERA OF COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Vinod Kymar, the political counselor at the Indian
embassy here, is a puzzled man. Never in his many years in Germany
has he read so much about his country in the press, nor found so
much of it to be nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``High technology seems to have suddenly become synonymous with
India here,'' Kymar said. ``But the Germans are waking up about a
decade late. The United States has already taken the cream of our
talented computer people. All that remains for the Germans are
leftovers.''
</P>
<P>
   India's occupation of center-stage in Germany's political
debates began a few weeks ago with an apparently offhand remark at
a trade fair from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. He said his country
urgently needed new talent in its high-technology sector and should
be prepared to give residency documents, or green cards, to
brilliant Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The remark reflected a serious issue: underfunded, state-run
German universities have been very slow to adapt their traditional
curricula to reflect the explosive growth of Internet-related
industries. In all of Germany, there is just one newly created
chair in e-commerce, at the Goethe University in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in a country with more than 4 million unemployed,
there are an estimated 75,000 to 100,000 jobs vacant in the booming
Internet sector, with few Germans apparently qualified to fill
them. Hence the Social Democratic chancellor's sudden infatuation
with Indian software engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urgently need new programmers and developers for our
projects, but we generally find the German education with its focus
on heavy philosophical concepts does not turn out the people we
want,'' said Amelie Heinrichsdorff of Acotec, a start-up software
company based in Berlin. ``We think globally and would like to hire
talent wherever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The dot-com view of the world is still far from that of
Germany's opposition Christian Democratic Party. When the
government began drafting a law to allow up to 20,000 foreign
computer specialists into Germany with green cards, an outcry
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Ruettgers, a leading Christian Democrat, produced a
campaign slogan in Germany's largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia,
saying, ``Children instead of Indians.'' Schroeder described the
posters as ``indecent and economically damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ruettgers refined his message slightly, urging, ``More
education instead of more immigration.'' He was supported by the
substantial wing of his party that remains deeply opposed to the
idea of Germany as a ``land of immigration,'' despite the fact that
more than seven million foreigners live here.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulties of the Christian Democrats' anti-foreigner
message became evident when Dieter Hundt, the head of the powerful
employers' federation, lambasted Ruettgers' campaign as ``poorly
thought out and miserably populistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of big business and conservative Christian Democracy
tearing each other to shreds is novel in Germany. But then this is
a time of substantial political and cultural shift, with the Social
Democrats adopting many pro-business measures and many Germans
developing a sudden infatuation with the Internet. Yet even the
government's methods appear marked by bureaucratic hesitations of
old.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Riester, the Social Democratic labor minister, has
proposed limiting the stays of the new green-card immigrants to an
initial period of three and a maximum of five years. He also wants
to shape the proposed law so that jobs would only be offered to
foreigners once an extensive search has been made for a qualified
German.
</P>
<P>
   But Antje Radcke, a leader of the Green Party, which is the
junior partner in the coalition government, said such proposals
were far too cumbersome. ``If we should have learned one thing from
the experience of the `gastarbeiters' who started coming here in
the 1960s, it is that attempts to try to limit the stays of people
are doomed to failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those ``guest workers,'' many of whom came from Turkey,
remained, and were eventually joined by their families. As a
result, Germany now has about 2.1 million people of Turkish origin.
</P>
<P>
   The employers' association also argues that the work permits
should allow long or indefinite stays in Germany, and should be
issued without exhaustive checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have at least 75,000 job openings in this sector now. If we
are not able to move fast, what is the purpose of the proposed
government measure?'' said Ilka Houben, a spokeswoman for the
association.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions have been surprisingly muted in their criticism,
insisting chiefly on the need for any green cards to be accompanied
by improved education in computer sciences and training.

 &HT;    Ranch work may be seasonal, but cowboy mystique is timeless
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ There's a certain way a cow sounds when
she has pneumonia, a cough that rumbles through her wide chest and
comes out her mouth in a heaving hack.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a certain way she dodges a lasso, feinting left and
right and moving much faster than she should be able to. There's
the way the waist-high mountain brush snags the lasso again and
again before it reaches the running cow, the way she struggles as,
finally caught, she's wrestled to the ground and bellows when the
jumbo-sized vaccination shoots through the needle plunged into her
hide.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the way that sometimes happens in the rain,
weeklong periods of drizzle like those last summer when moisture
darkens brown leather chaps and dampens the jeans underneath them
and the saddle underneath the jeans and the horse underneath the
saddle, and it's late afternoon and the horse is unhappy and the
cow is unhappy and the lasso is wet and there are 2,300 other cows
spread over 50,000 acres of high summer pasture that possibly could
have pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Louis L'Amour might say, in such a situation, that it's time to
cowboy up: time to suck it in and do what needs doing. Cowboy up,
he'd say.
</P>
<P>
   If the concept exists outside the pages of romanticized Western
fiction, Jerry King knows a little about it. He's a cowboy, and
he's got work to do.
</P>
<P>
   It starts in spring with more than 40 miles of fence to tend,
then continues in June when 12 ranchers send their cattle up to
summer pasture in King's care, and lasts through fall when the
cattle come back to the lower valleys for winter or transport to
processing plants. During winter he trains horses.
</P>
<P>
   He's a cowboy, and the work never ends.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE WINDS OF THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get misty-eyed and romantic about cowboys. They
were and are integral to the allure of the West, the Real Men who
helped tame the wild prairies and mountains into prime grazing land
for enormous herds of cattle, then herded those cattle in mythic
drives that covered land to each horizon in a moving sea of beef.
</P>
<P>
   They were immortalized in dime novels about the West, the
steely-eyed, leather-skinned, Indian-fighting men's men who said
little, worked hard and liked their fancy women and liquor when
they finally got to town after months on the trail. They embodied
all that was free and mysterious and strong about the great
American West.
</P>
<P>
   Since the glory days of the West after the Civil War and through
the turn of the century, the role of cowboys has changed. Cowboys
started having to get off their horses to do things like fix fences
and administer inoculations to cattle and help with branding. They
began relying less on their guns and more on log books.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy job is mythicized and glorified in thousands of books
and movies, but some of it is accurate, King said. There's
something about strapping on a pair of spurs before mounting a
high-spirited horse, something about swinging a rope lasso and
watching it land perfectly over an unruly cow's head, something
about sitting in the saddle on a ridgeline overlooking a herd of
cattle, surveying the horizon and understanding something about
life.
</P>
<P>
   King, 35, and his wife, Chrissy, 33, have two sons: 6-year-old
Cody and 5-year-old Clay. They are a cowboy family.
</P>
<P>
   It's a seasonal lifestyle that guarantees the family never will
be rich. Cowboy salaries are small, cowboy quarters humble. That's
not important, Chrissy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving can be good,'' she said. ``You learn about your
priorities. Living at cow camp in the summer with no electricity,
you learn what a waste of time TV is.''
</P>
<P>
   They've criss-crossed the West, with King driving his tough,
old, primer-gray Chevy truck pulling the trailer they sometimes
live in and Chrissy driving the beige Jeep Cherokee with the boys
and most of their things.
</P>
<P>
   Because most cowboy jobs are seasonal, they've moved from
Montana to Colorado to Wyoming to New Mexico. They've been in
western Colorado several years and tentatively plan to stay,
depending on what kind of work King gets this winter training
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Now they live in a small bunkhouse about 16 miles from the lower
cow camp where they'll spend most of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many cowboy jobs around these days. With less than
2 percent of the U.S. population employed in agriculture, according
to the 1990 U.S. census, cowboys compete for fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The texture of the lifestyle is changing, too. King remembers
how, when he first became a cowboy in Wyoming, ranchers shared and
pooled the work on things like branding and vaccinating and
winter-range work. Now ranchers have to struggle to survive and
that preoccupation has dented in small ways the sense of community.
Cowboys are affected the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's no money in it,'' King said. ``These young guys
know they can go into mining, carpentry, high-paying jobs where
they can drive around in new trucks. There's not a lot of younger
guys in it. There's a lot of wannabes, but as far as cowboying,
it's dying.''
</P>
<P>
   To supplement the family income, King sells drawings and
paintings. He's been an artist for as long as he can remember,
though he has no formal training. His western landscapes of
cowboys, horses, wildlife and scenery are becoming well-known for
quality and accuracy in depicting the cowboy lifestyle. One of his
drawings was used on the official poster for the 1994 College
National Finals Rodeo, and some of his work is in the Cowboys
Artists of America display in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me I ought to go do my art full-time, but
nah,'' he said. ``I'd rather do what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now that's getting his six horses in shape for the rigors
of summer cow camp, when they will pack in salt licks and carry
King all day as he rides through the pool of 2,350 cattle that 12
ranchers contracted with him to manage this summer. He gets up
early, before Chrissy and the boys begin a day of home schooling,
makes his coffee and goes outside before the sun is up to don chaps
and get all the equipment he'll need from the tack trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Through the winter he trained other people's horses, but now he
has to get his own in shape, so he takes them to the arena across
the road and gets them used to answering to him and being ridden.
Chrissy doesn't ride and the boys are just learning. The pace of
life is relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING THE ROPES
</P>
<P>
   A very little boy at some point in childhood dreams of being a
cowboy. King did. Growing up in southeast Ohio in the Appalachian
foothills of Wayne National Forest, he got his first horse,
Brownie, at age 9. His dad paid $100 for the horse and saddle, and
King paid his dad back with money he made from trapping.
</P>
<P>
   He always was self-sufficient like that, the black sheep of his
family who preferred going off alone into the woods to hunt and
trap, rather than play sports like his two younger brothers or have
sleep-overs with friends like his two younger sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The King family lived on a large farm run by King's paternal
grandfather. King helped plow fields and feed the hogs and cows.
Mostly, though, when he wasn't in school or doing homework, he was
in the woods running coon dogs and trapping foxes, muskrats,
raccoons, opossums, whatever critters he saw. He used the money
from the animals he sold to buy more traps _ at one time he had 125
traps going that he checked every day.
</P>
<P>
   And he learned from old-timers, men familiar with the woods and
animals who taught him what they'd learned from experience.
</P>
<P>
   When he got Brownie, though, he spent a little less time in the
woods and a little more time in the corral. His grandma bought him
a black cowboy hat and he used trapping money to buy his first pair
of boots. He's rarely been out of boots since then.
</P>
<P>
   He subscribed to Western Horseman, reading it voraciously every
month and getting ideas about what he wanted to do. He wanted to be
a cowboy. He wanted to live in the West. He wanted to ride into the
open range and see for miles in any direction and live his life
outside the confines of a 9-to-5 rat race. When he graduated from
high school in 1983, he pooled the money he'd saved, $500, and
several weeks later packed his stuff in his Chevy Corsica, said
goodbye to his family and drove west.
</P>
<P>
   On that first trip, he slept in his car and ate at gas stations
and tried to envision, as he saw the plains flash past on
Interstate 80, what waited for him in the West. He watched the land
grow browner, the space get bigger, the sky bluer. He crossed into
Wyoming and knew he'd entered cowboy country. Instinctively, he
knew the way cowboys get jobs: stop at ranches and ask if they need
help.
</P>
<P>
   On his third try, the ZN Ranch near Saratoga, Wyo., owned by
George Williams, King got a job making $400 a month. His references
were good and he'd grown up working hard, so he got hired despite
his inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   His title was cowboy and he rode open range herding cattle, soon
learning that modern cowboys do a lot more. He helped brand cattle,
dig post holes, irrigate, spread poison out for prairie dogs, work
in the shop and run a swather. It was different from what he'd
envisioned, but he still found himself when he became a cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a job for whiners,'' he explained. ``It's a job for
people who like to be self-sufficient, who don't like being told
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a bunkhouse with a sagging roof. At night he and
another cowboy lay in bed and with a .22 shot at the mice running
through the ceiling. They got up before dawn most mornings and
gauged that day's work based on the season. In summer and fall they
were at cow camp and spent their days on horseback. During those
three summers, King learned to brand, deliver calves, take care of
equipment, give vaccines, use a lasso, diagnose bovine illness,
ride better and harder than he ever had. He learned to break up
clumps of cattle so they wouldn't trample a portion of pasture,
learned their quirks and idiosyncracies and how to work with
intense bovine stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, Williams kept him on and he did more ranch work,
which is common. Most cowboys take winter jobs like carpentry or
construction or work as ranch hands.
</P>
<P>
   Being a cowboy, though, was the job King loved.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he enlisted on a whim in the U.S. Air Force in 1986
while he was in Ohio visiting his family. He stayed in until 1990,
first loading cargo airplanes then working on heavy equipment. His
unit went to Fort Leonardwood, Mo., in late 1989 to train to
rebuild runways in preparation for Desert Storm, but he got out
before going to Saudi Arabia ``because I was tired of all those
rules and regulations,'' he said. ``I don't like being told what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   That winter he spent a few weeks with his family in Ohio, but
knew he'd head west in spring, when ranchers were hiring cowboys.
When eating at a Bob Evans restaurant in Kettering, Ohio, he met a
waitress named Chrissy. He sat at the counter drinking black coffee
and she teased him about his cowboy duds, the ``howdy, pardner''
stuff he got a lot back then. He asked for her phone number and she
said no, so he gave her his and asked her to call him. She did two
days later and that April they went to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   That was 10 years and two sons ago.
</P>
<P>
   A COWBOY TILL THE END
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the whole family will go to cow camp, alternating
between lower and upper camps. There will be another cowboy up
helping King, and they will spend the majority of their days on
horseback, overseeing the cattle. Chrissy and the kids will explore
the woods, take pictures, play, ride ATVs and keep the cabin tidy
and, when King gets back, mess around with horses and take care of
equipment and kick back.
</P>
<P>
   When the cattle come down to the valleys this fall, the Kings
would like to find a house near Loma. They have friends who will
help them if they need it because, though the cowboy lifestyle is
shrinking, what remains of it is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good people,'' Chrissy said, ``We've made some
really good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   If everything works out, they'll spend the winter in the Grand
Valley, where Jerry will train horses and create artwork and get
ready for the spring, when cowboys go to work. King said he'll be a
cowboy until he can't get on a horse anymore, but even then he'll
keep working with horses until he's so old he creaks like a leather
saddle.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is with cowboys.

 &HT;    Looking West, to the cowboy
 &HT;    By Marla Pierson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ On the big screen, a cowboy rides tall in the
saddle, moving rhythmically against a background of scenic vistas
and towering rock.
</P>
<P>
   A lone Texas Ranger, desperately outnumbered, chases bandits on
horseback through canyon and plain. A girl flirts with a cowboy in
a saloon.
</P>
<P>
   This is Hollywood's Old West _ a creation of film and novels
sometimes as far from the true West as it is from today's world.
</P>
<P>
   Even as early as the 1800s, legend colored the grueling life of
cowboys and other Western icons.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy now sells everything from cologne to cigarettes.
Television cowboys herd cats during a Super Bowl commercial break.
``Star Wars''' Han Solo is the quintessential good guy in what one
historian calls the modern morphing of a classic Western.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still identify in a positive way with the notion that
there are cowboys. You want to know there's some guy out there in
the middle of nowhere under the stars dealing with simple things,''
said Byron Price, executive director of the Buffalo Bill Historical
Center in Cody, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   The more complex the world becomes, Price said, ``the more we
need to experience that and believe that kind of thing can continue
to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which has little do with the realities of the cow
business today.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that carefree rider on horseback, said cattle aficionado
Bill Bond of Groesbeck. Real life is much more grimy.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a gooseneck trailer hooked to a worn-out pickup. The
trailer has a flat. A man's feet are sticking out from underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Bond said, ``is the modern cattle industry.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Richard Morrison, a rare-book dealer, publishes an
annual price guide of Western Americana and Texana material. He is
familiar with thousands of books written on the West. He knows how
their tales differ from reality.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Bond heads to the pasture to brand cattle, Morrison
wants to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everything in the books and movies is fictionalized _
here I am college educated, graduate school _ and I just love the
hell out of going out and helping him and H.C. (another friend)
work cows,'' Morrison said. ``It's a life that hasn't been
mechanized out of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who owns a Western book store and art gallery, said the
average individual cowherd in Texas is about 20 mother cows. He
said he considers his cattle operation small, but he's adamant he
doesn't want to be without a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just tradition with my family. I've just got to have
them. I don't know why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has noticed city folk moving to the country and acquiring
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting in Texas, maybe Oklahoma and the Western
states, it's very, very common for the working person when they
acquire affluence, when somebody makes some money, the first thing
they want to do is buy a ranch,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   To Don Reeves, curator of cowboy collections at the National
Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, part of the fascination is
the freedom to choose and live out this lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence, however you cut it, has a lot to do with it.
Self-reliance,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Price, executive director of the Buffalo Bill Historical
Center in Cody, Wyo., said cowboys ``represent our aspirations, at
least of white Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep canyons, tall mountains and broad vistas _ the notion the
West offered unfettered freedom where a person could control their
own destiny. That's really appealing imagery. The part of the myth
that's true is the deep canyons, tall mountains,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   It offered freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very quickly,'' Price said, ``people tried to replicate what
they had left and changed the face of the landscape. But the myth
remained.''
</P>
<P>
   There were cowboys driving cattle to market by the 1850s, living
out what Reeves calls ``a pretty mundane existence.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1870s, as life settled after the Civil War, the
cattle business heated up. Drives became a profitable venture
instead of an occasional necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper and magazine reporters looking for adventure after the
war turned their attention west, creating an image that holds even
into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys weren't quite their own bosses. They were hired hands
who sometimes didn't even have a claim to the horse they rode.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves remembers how the National Cowboy Hall of Fame had
trouble contacting the widow of a well-known rancher. She later let
them know she didn't want her husband connected with any cowboy
hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a cattleman. He hired cowboys,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The term cowboy ``was used more in press and in dime novels than
it was on the range,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vaquero'' _ which referred to both Caucasian and Mexican
workers _ or ``cowhand'' was more comman in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the fantasy of the cowboy in fiction and film that
caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the 19th century, dime novels glorified cowboy life.
Young men in the East read them, some heading out to the range
seeking their own adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Price noted early depictions of the cowboy were not kind. ``The
popular press thought they were sort of ruffians and uncouth and
unrestrained,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then those publications, striving to show America as a
civilized, maturing nation, started playing up the heroic taming of
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowboys became part of the taming group instead of those that
needed taming,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh winters in the late 1880s devastated herds. People looking
for capital investments in cattle turned away from the open range.
Feed lots began developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the fencing of the ranges and the hay feeding,
there was less work for some of the itinerant cowboys or
cowhands,'' Reeves said. ``In the teens, a great many cowhands all
fled to Hollywood for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The movies they would help make, however, hardly ever showed
cowboys working with cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's with them chasing each other or being chased by Indians
or in a barfight,'' Reeves said. ``The cowboys, the cowgirls, their
life revolved around the land and the cattle and their horses and
the ability of the horses to work cattle. And that's never
portrayed.'' The real cowboys were young.
</P>
<P>
   Some were 14 or 15. Most were 17 to 25 years old ``much like
professional athletes at the top of their game,'' Price said. ``You
couldn't take the day-to-day rigor of that after you got much
older.''
</P>
<P>
   They lived alone or in pairs in a line shack, a makeshift
dwelling sometimes dug out of the side of a hill. ``Just a place to
get in out of the weather,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the classic image of the cowboy is the trail drive,
even big outfits drove cattle only a short time out of the year
when there would be enough grass for the cattle to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many cattlemen who spent most of their life working
cattle, but they only went on one trail drive,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   All those gunfights, too, were created for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Texas passed pistol laws in the mid-1880s outlawing the carrying
of pistols and side arms. Ranch owners forbade it on their
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very early on, Texas cowboys were shorn of their firearms,''
Price said.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco resident W.A. (Bill) Poage's account of an 1874 cattle
drive along the Chisolm Trail, he writes that card-playing was not
tolerated. One boss, Poage wrote, frequently told him that ``a deck
of cards and a tent only caused boys to fuss and waste time.''
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy's footloose image is not entirely made up, however.
It was a transient life. Few of the ranch hands were kept on over
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys were independent sorts, apt to take their saddles off
the company horses and head for another ranch if they ran into
problems with their employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people from larger cities back East scoff at
self-reliance, individualism. But that is the tradition,'' Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the work fostered those traits. This is not a job
with sick days and substitutes who can be called in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out there alone. Whatever they found they dealt
with, whether stolen cattle or a steer stuck up to the neck in
mud,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of a cowboy's character was a quiet pride in the
work. Complaints and superlatives were not part of life on the
range. Loyalty was. Newcomers learned early not to gripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's thirsty. Everybody's hot,'' Bond said. ``So
there's some real good lessons to be learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The definition of cowboy today is slippery.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has heard plenty of old-timers say there aren't any more
cowboys like there were half a century ago. He's met people in
their 20s and 30s who would call themselves nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an identity and an occupation all rolled into one,''
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   To Price, part of the lingering appeal of this icon is that it's
participatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can adopt the stance and the look and the attitude and
they don't have to have a single cow,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   These are jobs that people fill daily on large ranches and in
family operations. There are men and women competing in rodeos or
maybe just living out the cowboy ideals of self-reliance and hard
work in suburban settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't see 'em from the highway, as Baxter Black the
cowboy poet says,'' Price said of today's cowboys. ``The thing to
know about myth like this is it endures so long as people can
participate in it and believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The frontier is space. Han Solo wears his ray gun slung low. The
Millennium Falcon is a glorified horse that can outrun all the bad
guys' horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowboys are finding a way to get into the next generation,''
Price said. ``That's why the myth will continue to be strong.''

KNITTING THE RAVELED THREADS OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was supposed to be a wonderful party, Los
Angeles' best chance in years to show off to 15,000 journalists and
the watching world its recovery from its early 1990s diet of fire,
riot and earthquake. But by this winter, the Democratic National
Convention, to be held here in August for the first time in 40
years, seemed to be shaping up as another disaster in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising was behind schedule. The billionaire moguls who
helped lure the convention were portrayed as bickering among
themselves. And if that were not enough, the worst police
corruption scandal in decades erupted in ugly headlines that sent
the city's public officials into a kind of collective meltdown, and
unions facing contract negotiations warned of possible labor
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mayor Richard Riordan, still smarting from the
collective raspberry that greeted the city's soggy New Year's
celebration, realized he would be blamed for any problems, ousted
the head of the local host committee and replaced her with a
trusted deputy, then got on the telephone and began dialing for
dollars himself. Now, local and Democratic Party officials say,
fund raising is back on track, planning is moving forward and they
are confident the convention will be a worthy successor to the one
that nominated John F. Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things weren't happening,'' Riordan, a Republican who worked
to win the convention, acknowledged in a recent interview.
``Questions weren't being answered. If you had to say one thing
caught my attention, it was when Dianne Feinstein cornered me and
said, `You know, even if you aren't technically part of it, you're
going to be held accountable, so you'd better get involved.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, part of the problem was that unlike past conventions,
including the 1984 gathering in San Francisco when Feinstein was
mayor there, this gala was to be privately sponsored. Working on
the model of the 1984 Olympics, Los Angeles' $35.3 million bid for
the convention was to be backed not by the city itself but by a
committee of prominent local citizens, including a trio of
billionaires: the entertainment mogul David Geffen, the insurance
and construction entrepreneur and philanthropist Eli Broad and the
supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, who agreed to raise most of the
money privately.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement posed challenges in a city celebrated for civic
entropy. At the same time, the Democratic National Committee, which
is responsible for planning details of the convention program,
along with logistics, was dogged by delays in selecting a chief
executive for the convention, and unsettled by what was still a
struggle for the nomination between Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley. Complaints rumbled from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   For about the first six weeks of the year, officials concede,
the host committee was virtually paralyzed. Decisions were deferred
on everything from where to hold the media party kicking off the
convention week of Aug. 14 to how to design an official logo for
posters and banners. In mid-February, Riordan ousted Lucy McCoy, a
veteran fund-raiser who had been in charge of the committee and
replaced her with his own deputy mayor and press secretary, Noelia
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   In her first day on the job, Rodriguez chose the Los Angeles
Music Center for the press party and within days hired a contractor
to design a logo, which features not only the usual
red-white-and-blue but other bright primary colors in a tableau of
stylized political placards proclaiming Los Angeles the ``Capital
City of the 21st Century.'' She also forced Riordan to spend two or
three hours a day, two days a week, raising tax-exempt
contributions from individuals and corporations, a task he called
``a pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a foundation established, but we really needed to
take it to the next level,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, perhaps the most influential private-sector player behind
the scenes in civic affairs, had been McCoy's patron, and confessed
he initially doubted Riordan's decision to replace her. ``I did not
totally favor it at the time, but I've come around to believe he
did the right thing,'' Broad said. ``I think Noelia's very
talented, and the mayor is spending a lot of time at this,
including fund-raising, and we are hopeful of getting the job done
in the next several months.''
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, officials said the host committee had raised
$27.6 million of its goal, bolstered by a $1 million contribution
from Broad himself and a second $1 million in collective
contributions taken in over the last week. That figure includes a
pledge of about $7 million by the city toward the cost of police
and transportation for the delegates, but officials say that plan,
apparently based on what was needed in 1996 in Chicago, will now be
more costly, given the geographic sprawl of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one senior planning official said, the agreement
with the Democrats called for the city to provide up to 150 buses,
each with a police officer aboard, to shuttle the delegates to and
from their hotels. In fact, the official said, more than 300 buses
will now be needed, at a cost of $4 million more, at least some of
which they hope to get from the state, whose governor, Gray Davis,
a Democrat, is Gore's campaign chief here.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Democrats were wary about signing an agreement not
backed by the full faith and credit of the host city, the host
committee's agreement called for it to provide letters of credit
totaling $10 million, as a guarantee against unpaid bills. Riordan
and Broad signed such letters, as did two other people, but neither
Burkle nor Geffen did so, and a spokesman for each said it was
never envisioned that they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly never agreed to that letter of credit,'' said
Andy Spahn, head of corporate affairs for Geffen's studio,
DreamWorks SKG. ``We agreed to do what we could to help Los Angeles
secure the convention, period, and we made it clear that at that
point, we would segue into helping elect the Democratic nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Absent a hierarchy, Broad took on the most prominent public
role, which by turns amused and ruffled the feathers of some of his
colleagues. For his part Broad insisted he had no wish to be top
dog and added, ``I wish some of the co-chairs would do more than
they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   After a rocky start last fall, the Democrats' convention chief
executive, Lydia Camarillo, a former executive director of the
Southwest Voter Education Project, a Hispanic voter rights group in
San Antonio, Texas, has geared up her staff here, and Gore's
national campaign chief, former Rep. Tony Coelho, has taken a more
active role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not feel like we're behind at all,'' said Rod O'Connor,
the convention's chief of staff, who noted that the party Web site
would broadcast all convention proceedings, including delegation
meetings, while a special network would allow delegates to book
accommodations and coordinate schedules online. ``There's a lot of
work to do, but this is where we want to be.''

<P>
   One remaining hazard: concession workers and engineers at the
new Staples Center arena, where the convention will be held, are
working without collective bargaining agreements. For months,
officials planning the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia have had written assurances from unions there that
would essentially rule out strikes or picket lines at convention
sites. But with roughly 300,000 workers in fields from film to
schools facing contract renewals by this summer, union officials
here say no such agreement will be forthcoming, at least until the
negotiations at the arena are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very optimistic we can work it out,'' said Miguel
Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County
Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. ``We've told that to the DNC and
we're willing to negotiate ay and night. But people shouldn't be
pointing their fingers at the unions.''

   Another Big Year For the Women
</P>
<P>
   In the lexicon of American politics, 1992 is known as the Year
of the Woman because that was the year women won four seats in the
United States Senate and 24 in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   This year's congressional elections are not likely to top that.
But 2000 is shaping up, nonetheless, as another important year for
women, especially when it comes to women running in highly
competitive races _ including many for open seats _ whose results
could weigh heavily in determining party control on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen or so Senate contests rated most competitive, women
are running in four, with the New York contest being the most
prominent since it pits Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. On the House side, women are solid contenders in
at least six of the 20 or so top races, among them the contest in
Pennsylvania's Fourth Congressional District as well as contests in
California, Florida, Minnesota, Ohio and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, there are about a dozen women running for the Senate
and about 140 for the House _ some of them already nominated,
others still angling to get nominated.
</P>
<P>
   As some political experts see Election 2000 unfolding, women may
get an extra lift at the polls this year because a number of top
election issues are of special importance to women. Among them:
abortion, education, gun control, health care and the Medicare and
Social Security programs.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a far cry from the women-in-politics situation 42
years ago, when Rep. Coya Knutson, D-Minn., the only woman ever
sent to the House from that state, was running for re-election. She
lost after her opponents circulated a letter they had obtained in
which her husband plaintively urged her to abandon legislating in
Washington and return home to him.
</P>
<P>
   This year, five of the 12 candidates running in Minnesota's
Fourth District are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's surely proof the Coya Knutson days are long gone,''
said Ellen Malcolm, the president of Emily's List, an organization
that raises money for Democratic women running for office who
support abortion rights. ``We think this year's election could very
well turn out to be the biggest for women candidates since the 1992
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossing Party Lines And Making Enemies
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Carlos Ramirez of El Paso, Texas, is the kind of supporter
Gov. George W. Bush just loves.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Democrat. He's a Latino. He runs a city that is heavily
Democratic and heavily Latino. And he loves to travel about the
country telling Latinos, whose political strength is growing but
who still lean Democratic, that he loves the governor and they
should too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the values that we share,'' Ramirez says.
</P>
<P>
   He was with the governor in the days leading up to the New
Hampshire primary. He was with him in the days leading up to the
California primary. And he was with him in 1998 when Bush became
the first Republican candidate for governor ever to carry El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez calls himself a conservative Democrat. But to other El
Paso Democrats he is a political pariah. And last weekend they all
but read him out of their ranks at a local party convention.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, they said, he can call himself anything he wants
and support whomever he pleases. But, they declared, he cannot
speak for them or the party and he cannot hold any party posts.
</P>
<P>
   A Poll Finds Voters Less Than Excited
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed a long, long way to November. And here is what the
latest Vanishing Voter Project poll by the Shorenstein Center at
Harvard found when voters were asked if they were paying any
attention this far from Election Day, and, if so, what conclusions
they had reached:
</P>
<P>
   One in five said they were paying ``quite a bit'' to ``a great
deal'' of attention to the candidates and issues. But all the rest
said they were paying ``just some'' attention to none at all.
</P>
<P>
   Final conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Boring,'' said three of every four.
</P>
<P>
   High Gasoline Prices As a Campaign Issue
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department says gasoline prices should decline a bit
before next fall. But the way Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia
sees it, unless the decline is significant, the cost of fuel will
be a good Republican issue on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, sent out a memorandum recently in which he urged
Republican House candidates to make special efforts to pin the
blame for high pump prices on Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Act now to let voters know that the Clinton-Gore
administration has been asleep at the wheel and has done nothing to
combat this crisis,'' he wrote. ``We cannot allow foreign countries
to gouge American consumers. Republicans are stepping forward to
address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional candidates _ Democrats and Republicans, House
members and senators _ were talking up the issue on the campaign
trail even before the Davis memorandum went out. But the memorandum
calls for more than just trail talk.
</P>
<P>
   Davis suggests that Republican candidates also initiate
letter-writing campaigns, that they seek out appearances on talk
shows and that they hold protests and press events at gas stations
and truck stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that hits home with every voter in your
district,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Walking All the Way To the Nomination
</P>
<P>
   Remember Duane Sand, the Navy man who retired, went home to
Fargo, N.D., and took off on a 346-mile trek across the state in
January to call attention to his novice campaign for the U.S.
Senate?
</P>
<P>
   He made it. Neither snow, nor minus 50-degree temperatures, nor
derisive laughter, nor ...
</P>
<P>
   What is more, at last weekend's Republican state convention in
Fargo, he managed to get himself nominated, defeating the favorite,
state Rep. Al Carlson of Fargo, by a solid 2-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in the hall was more surprised by the win than Sand. He
had no victory speech prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously demonstrated that he can attract attention,''
said Curly Haugland, the state's Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But come the fall, can Sand attract enough attention to beat the
veteran, well-entrenched Democratic incumbent, Kent Conrad?  &QL;

SEATTLE PROTESTORS ARE BACK, WITH A NEW TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Beka Economopoulos, a 25-year-old environmental
campaigner with a premature streak of gray in her long black hair,
the drive to shut down the world's financial institutions began in
Seattle's King County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   She and about 250 other woman spent five days there shortly
after Thanksgiving last year, most of them arrested for refusing to
disperse when the Seattle police told them to move on. Inside the
cells, they planned an encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five days they only thing we talked about was how to take
this to the next level,'' said Economopoulos, a Washington native
who now spends full time on this mix of environmental and economic
causes. ``You go through that, you know, and you're hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who disrupted the Seattle meeting of the
World Trade Organization are reassembling in Washington this week,
where they have identified as their targets two older, richer and
savvier agents of the global economy: the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. Students, church groups,
environmentalists, and labor unions, a few of them planning to
scale buildings and block traffic to make their point, say they
want to disrupt the spring meetings at both groups.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters contend that the institutions have destroyed rain
forests, left poor countries in debt, and protected Nike, Disney
and Monsanto instead of workers in the Third World. They estimate
that between 10,000 and 30,000 people will join the week-long
demonstrations beginning on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That would add a street dimension to a growing political and
academic fracas over how to change the two financial institutions
and, more broadly, whether globalization is hurting more people
than it helps.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the bank and the fund, which lend tens of
billions of dollars each year to poor and middle-income nations,
have come under strong pressure to slim down, pay more attention to
the side effects of their policies, and open up to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clinton administration has not reacted officially to
the protests, the United States, the largest donor to both
agencies, has a great deal at stake. At a time when America is
relying increasingly on the bank and the fund to manage the world
economy and spread American influence abroad, both agencies have
come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government has long done whatever it wants with these
institutions without anybody saying anything,'' says Jeffrey Sachs,
a Harvard economist who has become a leading critic of the sister
institutions. ``The tradition that allows the U.S. to create any
mission it wants for these institutions is being challenged _ and
it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the World Bank and IMF say that most of the
protesters and many political and academic critics have scant
knowledge of what these institutions do, and that the relative
health of the global economy these days proves that they are
effective. But the attacks have left the bank, the fund and the
Clinton administration on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that globalization has cut into a nerve _ many
people want more say and they should get it,'' said James D.
Wolfensohn, the World Bank president. But he adds that protesters
tend to extrapolate from a few past mistakes to condemn the whole
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some of the issues they raise, there will just have to be
differences of opinion,'' said Wolfensohn, a former investment
banker who in recent years has championed poverty relief projects.
``But people should also know that the bank is a very different
place than it was five years ago.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Washington protests may not mirror the unrest in Seattle,
where a rare alchemy of violence and vandalism by a small group of
anarchists botched crowd control by the police and dissolution
among world trade ministers gave opposition groups a notable
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But they do seem likely to show the ability of diverse
nongovernment organizations to mount a coordinated campaign against
a common enemy: globalization as envisioned by traditional,
free-market-oriented government economists. Communicating via the
Internet, about 450 groups are sponsoring the Washington
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   At a local planning session this week organized by the
Mobilization for Global Justice, veterans of Vietnam War-era
protests mingled with college students in T-shirts. A guitarist
sang in protest mode, paraphrasing a song by Leonard Cohen, ``First
we take Seattle, then we take D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had little of the visceral anger and fear of Vietnam
War protests or the passion of anti-apartheid demonstrations in the
1980s. Although one goal of the movement against globalization is
to turn the focus away from corporations to the poor nations of the
world, there were only a handful of people from what the
participants call the global South, or developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   One was Njoki Njoroge Njehu, a Kenyan who serves as one of the
movement's key ``facilitators.'' (Participants say there are no
generals, only lieutenants and ground troops.) She said the
coalition has managed to bridge different purposes because it
operates strictly by consensus. The process is mapped on a flow
chart on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are emulating the kind of world we are seeking, with total
transparency and without hierarchy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington protests will last for a week, beginning with a
march for debt relief organized by Jubilee 2000 Sunday and
culminating in rally-cum-civil-disobedience events on April 16 and
17, when the IMF and World Bank are scheduled to hold their spring
meetings and world finance ministers are to descend on the city.
</P>
<P>
   Police, wary of violence orchestrated by some 200 anarchists in
Seattle, have prepared for months in ensure that the meetings are
not disrupted. The main protest groups have pledged to demonstrate
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters view the World Bank and the IMF as global
loan sharks, hooking lower-income nations on cheap debt and then
insisting that they adopt free markets, unlimited investment,
privatization, restrained government spending, or risk a cut-off in
new aid.
</P>
<P>
   They are armed with research that they say shows some of the
poorest countries that get World Bank and IMF assistance,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have become dependent on loans.
They cite statistics that they say show that some African client
countries have experienced declining per capita income over the
last two decades, while other nations that shunned official aid
performed better.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the policies work, they often come at the expense of
the environment, others argue. The bank and the fund sometimes
require aid recipients to curtail fiscal spending and increase
exports to earn hard currency. To meet those targets, governments
often slash environmental protection budgets, they contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot conceive of policies more diametrically opposed to
sound management of resources'' than those preached by the bank and
the fund, said Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters have treated Sachs and Joseph E. Stiglitz, the
recently departed chief economist of the World Bank, as
intellectual leaders. Stiglitz's scathing insider critiques have
contributed to a raging debate in universities and in Congress
about the effectiveness of the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the protesters have implicit allies on the right. A
commission appointed by the Republican-controlled Congress to
recommend changes at the fund and bank last month called for an end
to long-term loans of the type criticized by environmentalists. The
commission also said the bank should act less like a bank and make
more grants, rather than loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath it all is a feeling that globalization has not
brought the benefits to the poor as promised,'' Stiglitz said.
``The architecture of the world financial system is decided by
finance ministers behind closed doors, but farmers and small
businessmen are the ones who get hurt.''

 &HT;    Documentary provides an interesting look at our presidents
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Philip B. Kunhardt III is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American President,'' the 10-hour PBS documentary he
produced, wrote and directed, does what no series has ever done: It
profiles all 41 presidents. Every commander-in-chief from the
obscure Rutherford B. Hayes to the legendary Franklin Delano
Roosevelt is featured in the series, which begins today and will
air over the next four nights in two-hour installments.
</P>
<P>
   But even Kunhardt, who produced the documentary with his father
and brother, wonders how many viewers will actually watch what
could be perceived as a dry-as-dirt history lesson. ``It does worry
me a little bit that the average person's attention span will be
taxed,'' he admits. ``But despite all the cynicism, people still
care about the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep viewers from switching channels _ or not watching at all
_ Kunhardt wisely chose to group the presidents' stories into a
common theme each night. For instance, ``Family Ties'' examines how
power and influence are handed down from generation to generation.
In that segment, John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy are profiled. Many viewers may be
surprised to learn, for example, that Adams was miserable during
his term and would often take long walks by himself or swim in the
Potomac River. Meanwhile, ``Happenstance'' explores the careers of
five presidents _ John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson,
Chester Alan Arthur and Harry Truman _ who were vice presidents,
but moved to the White House after the death of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been awfully deadly if we walked through history
in lockstep,'' Kunhardt notes. ``That would've been too
predictable. Each hour takes a different swipe at history, so we
could juxtapose an early president with a more recent one.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the profiles, ``The American President,'' which
took five years to make, also features interviews with President
Clinton and every living former president except Ronald Reagan.
Hugh Sidey, Time magazine's White House correspondent for four
decades, conducted the interviews and narrated the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Sidey to narrate other PBS documentaries in the
near future. ``That's the one and only time I'll do that,'' he
says, chuckling. ``It took three years and every other month I was
in the sound booth all day. That's hard work. Gosh, I don't know
how those narrators do it, and stand there agonizing over every
phrase and sentence. I'd just blow my brains out.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the veteran Sidey learn anything about a president he didn't
know?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that Andrew Johnson was a drunk and was hooched up at
Lincoln's inauguration,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of most historical documentaries seek A-list
celebrities to provide the voices for long-dead political figures.
``The American President'' producers, however, opted to sign up
politicians and well-known journalists. Among those lending their
voices include columnist George Will (John Quincy Adams); Gen.
Colin Powell (William H. Taft); talk show host Charlie Rose (John
Tyler); former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite (George Washington)
and radio personality Don Imus (Andrew Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   The raunchy Don Imus ... on PBS?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our last choice,'' Kunhardt acknowledges. ``We couldn't
get anyone else to do that part. Johnson was a racist,
segregationist and a stubborn kind of character. No one wanted to
touch it. When Don heard everybody said, 'No,' he said that made it
more attractive to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunhardt points out that the idea to not hire trained actors
wasn't attractive to him. He says his brother Peter convinced him
to use a diverse group of individuals. ``You know actors will bring
a tremendous ability of range and will bring a huge amount to the
project,'' Kunhardt says. ``But over the last 10 years, so many
documentaries have turned to the same actors. It was getting
boring, so we wanted to break the mold in a new way.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge, however, was gathering the volume of
material needed. ``We wanted this to be largely driven by the words
of the presidents themselves,'' says Kunhardt, who wrote the ABC
miniseries ``Lincoln.'' ``That meant reading huge volumes of their
writings, sometimes in unpublished form. We wanted intimate
writings and letters, and that meant going to the Library of
Congress and then deciphering their miserable handwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will viewers walk away with?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there's a renewed faith in the president,'' Sidey says.
``It's a remarkable institution.''

<P>
   PORT ARANSAS, Texas _ Out on the back porch of Woody's bait
stand, in a salt-thick breeze off the Gulf of Mexico, Johnny
Mathews, a fishing guide, flicks the foam from a cold beer and
weighs in on the topic of students on spring break: ``It's not that
they're bad people. They just don't know how to act like normal
people.''
</P>
<P>
   By normal, he means like native Texans.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300,000 college students or families celebrating
spring vacations have come and gone from the sandy Gulf beaches
that stretch 100 miles from here to South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   And left behind are mounds of trash, some alcohol casualties
recovering in emergency rooms, and a debate rekindled every year by
residents of the Texas coast: Is the annual raucous, crowded rite
of spring really worth the money, and the aggravation?
</P>
<P>
   Because towns like Port Aransas and South Padre thrive primarily
on the tourist trade, one would think that any visitor with a
credit card would be highly prized.
</P>
<P>
   But with the economy in full blossom and with the residents
increasingly restless about rapid growth in their once-small
communities, the value of crowds is being debated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities that once fought over the spring break crowd are now
becoming a lot more selective, particularly when it comes to the
college kids,'' said Ann Vaughan, a Chamber of Commerce executive
in this weather-beaten fishing village of 2,100 that had 100,000
visitors last month.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with traffic, lewdness and general rowdiness,
particularly among college students, have prompted Port Aransas to
change the focus of its marketing away from students, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come if they want to, but they have to play by our
rules,'' Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us the families, and let the students go to South
Padre,'' says Larry Stimson, captain of a bay fishing vessel called
the Island Queen, who has lived in both cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families will come with a set amount of money and spend
every bit on beer, hotels, restaurants, fishing trips and other
tourist stuff,'' Stimson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the students bring their own beer, sleep on the beach, and
just might buy a loaf of bread and some bologna. They don't have
any money, so you can't get any out of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have come to this conclusion. Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., once attracted as many as 350,000 students on spring break.
But Nicki Grossman, president of the Convention and Visitor's
Bureau, says, ``Now, we don't even like to see Fort Lauderdale and
the `s' word used in the same sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Fort Lauderdale attracted only 15,000 students out of
550,000 visitors in March, she said. ``We got rid of MTV and got
rid of the wet T-shirt volleyball games,'' she added. ``When MTV
went, the lemmings went with it. We felt that if the kids could
graduate, so could we.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said open container laws, police visibility, and a
half-billion dollars in beach clean-up programs and community
investments made it possible to discourage the student crowd and
attract the more lucrative family vacation business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college student business was worth about $110 million a
year at its peak, but the current family market we cater to brings
in between $450 and $500 million,'' Grossman said. ``If the weather
stays good and the kids stay away, everything's fine for us.''
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island has become known as a vacation destination
among students, and the resident population of 2,000 swells to
nearly 200,000 during spring break, says Jennifer Beck of the
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Vern Vincent of the University of Texas Pan American at Edinburg
says last year's crowd resulted in $700,000 in sales and hotel tax
revenues to South Padre.
</P>

   ``Spring break comes during the off-season and it really helps
the local businesses,'' he said. Everyone benefits from having the
spring breakers there.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Morrison of the South Padre police department said his
office arrested 530 people during this year's spring break, up from
the normal 15 to 20 monthly arrests at other times of year. ``Most
of those are driving while intoxicated arrests, and virtually all
of those are students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the porch at Woody's, Mathews, who has lived his entire
life in Port Aransas, said that even though he found the spring
visitors' habits peculiar, particularly their driving, the economic
benefit of their presence was worth the inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes the college students. ``You just have to learn
to go where they're not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for some residents, any visitors are too many. A popular
bumper sticker asks: ``If it's called tourist season, why can't we
just shoot them?''

JANITORS RALLY IN LOS ANGELES AFTER VOTING TO STRIKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the 15 years Maria Santania has worked as a
janitor here, her pay has increased $2 an hour, to $6.50. To earn
it, she vacuums, dusts and scrubs two floors of an office building
on South Hope Street in downtown Los Angeles _ 100 law offices and
consulates filled with thick carpeting and cherry wood desks that
she is regularly warned not to damage.
</P>
<P>
   At night Santania, who came to the United States from El
Salvador 18 years ago, goes home to a one-bedroom apartment in the
Koreatown section of mid-Los Angeles that she shares with her two
children; she separated from her husband six years ago. The rent,
$550, amounts to more than two weeks of her salary before taxes. So
on Friday, she joined thousands of striking janitors _ police and
union officials estimated a crowd of 3,000 _ marching down Wilshire
Boulevard in search of a larger pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-year janitorial contracts are lapsing in several major
American cities this year, including San Francisco, San Jose and
Chicago, but Los Angeles' was the first to expire with no agreement
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The strike came after janitors voted to reject a pay plan put
forward by a group of building maintenance companies that would
have offered a 50-cent raise the first year and 40-cent raises the
next two years. The workers are seeking a $3 increase in their
hourly pay over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be here,'' Santania said. ``I'd like to be
working. But I can't accept 50 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and other civil rights leaders and
political figures led marchers Thursday and Friday. And leaders of
the union, the Service Employees International Union, which
represents nearly 10,000 janitors in Los Angeles, said workers
would not go back until they got a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a dramatic increase in order for them to
move above the federal poverty line,'' about $15,000 annually for a
family of four, said Blanca Gallegos, a union leader. ``They're not
going back until the contractors come back with an offer they can
accept, that would be a livable wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Davis, the chief negotiator for the maintenance companies,
did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said wages for janitorial workers in Los Angeles
have declined in real terms from the equivalent of $13 an hour in
the early 1980s to an average of $6.80 today, as the face of
janitorial labor here has changed in the past two decades from
largely American-born blacks to foreign-born Hispanics. Union
leaders say the shift is a result of Los Angeles' status as a
magnet for immigrant labor. Union leaders said janitors in Los
Angeles earned less than unionized janitors in any other major
city.
</P>
<P>
   American Building Maintenance, one of the largest janitorial
services companies with more than 39,000 janitorial employees, and
the only one whose figures are publicly available, earned $49.5
million in profits last year on $933 million in revenues, according
to its annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Stang, a lawyer advising American Building Maintenance on
the negotiations, said the maintenance companies offered wage and
benefit increases better than the industry average, but union
members walked out on talks without responding to the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Stang said, companies that use union labor have to keep
costs down to compete with nonunion firms.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Fernandez, a 39-year-old mother of seven, marched on
Friday with her daughter, Sylvia, 10, and her niece, Patricia, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez estimated that she cleaned more than 100 toilets each
night at the Trans-America building downtown, earning $7.80 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of work for what I earn,'' she said.

IN SENATE BID, MRS. CLINTON CLAIMS TO HAVE GOP SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWEGO, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, apparently bolstered by an
uptick in support from upstate voters, said Saturday at two
small-town campaign stops that she saw evidence that many
Republicans would cross party lines to back her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more and more Republicans coming up to me,'' Clinton
told 50 Democrats who had gathered for a brief stopover at an
Italian restaurant in this Tioga County village. ``They came, both
men and women, and said they would support my campaign both because
they really want to continue the policies of the president, and
because they want somebody in the Senate who will work with
everyone in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton made almost identical remarks at the
annual Broome County Democratic Party Breakfast in Endwell, a
suburb of Binghamton. Responding to reporters here, she said her
evidence of growing Republican support was ``just anecdotal.'' She
said supporters she had met on this two-day road trip from
Rochester to the Binghamton area ``identified themselves as
Republicans, and that is gratifying to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In other remarks, Clinton sought to ally herself with moderates
and fiscal conservatives within her own party. At one point in her
Binghamton speech, in which she pointed to the success of the White
House in reducing the federal deficit, she said she advocated a
``rendezvous with responsibility'' in fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also took several occasions during her campaign stops
Friday and Saturday to portray herself as someone with long
experience in upstate New York. In describing her advocacy of more
stringent gun control, she said she had spent ``every summer'' of
her youth at a cottage on a lake near Scranton, Pa., and had
frequently visited Binghamton. ``I was taught how to shoot, not
well I admit,'' she said, adding that she had ``nothing against gun
ownership, and nothing against hunting or sport shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's breakfast meeting with Broome County Democrats, a
fund-raising event that attracted 400 people at $50 a plate, also
attracted a group of 20 opponents, who greeted her arrival outside
an Endwell restaurant with placards.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was one depicting a witch on a broomstick under the
phrase ``Westchester Witch.'' Another read: ``Hillary, if we elect
you, do we get him?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hoskins, an Endwell computer programmer who was carrying a
sign, said the group was composed of friends who opposed Clinton's
positions on abortion rights and other social issues.

EARTH DAY GOES GLOBAL AS IT TURNS 30 
</HEADLINE>

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With 4,500 organizations planning events in more than
180 countries, the 30th Earth Day is living up to its name in a way
that was not true for the first Earth Day, which was largely a
domestic affair and which provided a major spark for two landmark
pieces of federal environmental legislation, the Clean Air Act and
the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   But if much has changed over the years about Earth Day, one
thing about this year's event on Saturday, April 22, is strikingly
similar to the original: Denis Hayes is leading the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, just a few years out of Stanford University, where he
was student body president, Hayes dropped out of the Kennedy School
at Harvard to serve as national coordinator for the first Earth
Day, which was the brainchild of Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   There was more than a bit of the angry young man in Hayes'
approach to galvanizing public ire over air and water pollution.
This time around, as the chairman of the international Earth Day
Network, Hayes, 55, says ecological crises, especially global
warming, are no less severe. But the lawyer and environmental
advocate says the ``clean energy agenda'' at the heart of this
year's rallies is ``almost Reaganesque in its robust optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   The earth ``is confronting some extremely difficult problems,''
said Hayes. ``How do you deal with racism, how do you deal with
ethnic tensions that have existed for thousands of years? We don't
have any clever ideas. Global warming is an enormous threat to the
well-being of the planet, but it's one where we honest to God do
know what to do, and it's a matter of summoning the necessary
political will.''
</P>
<P>
   Summoning the will to confront global warming is thus the chief
goal of the Seattle-based Earth Day Network, which says the biggest
rally in this country on April 22 will be on the Mall in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Much as earlier Earth Days led to a push on such causes as
recycling, organizers hope this year's energy agenda will lead
consumers, government agencies and businesses to expand
conservation efforts and the use of cleaner forms of energy, such
as solar and wind power. The agenda also includes tougher pollution
standards for cars, appliances and factories.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are achievable and even affordable goals, Hayes
insisted last week at Earth Day offices in downtown Seattle, where
a giant world map flags the locations of Earth Day events across
the planet and where energetic staff members and volunteers appear
to be in touch, via the Internet anyway, with groups around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   To cite a smattering of events, there are workshops for youth in
Burkina Faso on solar cooking; a children's clean-air bicycle rally
in New Delhi; rallies to curb global warming in at least five
cities in Bangladesh; a car-free event in Seoul, South Korea, that
will close major streets to automobile traffic; and a huge
``eco-festival'' at London's Millennium Dome. A clean-air rally in
Mexico City may draw more people than the one in Washington, say
Earth Day organizers.
</P>
<P>
   But in all cases, Hayes said, these groups are focusing on a
``single, unifying global problem that has a local dimension to it:
Groups that are fighting tanker traffic through Puget Sound, groups
trying to protect the rain forests of Nigeria or the Arctic
Wildlife Refuge, Bangladeshis scared to death of an ocean rise that
will take out their country, all of them are really mobilized to
get engaged in a clean-energy agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hayes said he has been struck in international travels
by how many political leaders, not just ordinary citizens, cite
pollution as a dominant problem. ``That was certainly true in
China,'' he said, where heavy use of coal has contributed to
tremendous air pollution. ``Seven of the 10 most polluted cities in
the world are in China, and that's a source of some real
embarrassment for a nation that wants to hold itself up as a model
for an alternative form of development.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25th anniversary of Earth Day in 1995 was not without
controversy, as some environmentalists complained that the event
had taken on a nebulous feel-good air and a degree of corporate
sponsorship that led some to say Earth Day had been ``greenwashed''
out of significance.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, even as organizers have emphasized more teach-ins
and grass-roots events, Earth Day organizers had to stand by with
some pain as a recent dispute unfolded over a decision by ABC News
to have one of the event's celebrity leaders, Leonardo DiCaprio,
interview President Clinton about global warming. (Hayes said the
movie star had helped galvanize youth interest in the environment
and, he added, ``Leo is a fine, articulate spokesman, and we're
proud to have him.'')
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if environmental advocates have sometimes
been accused of lacking a sense of humor, that does not seem to be
an issue at Earth Day headquarters or on the Web site,
www.earthday.net. One of the network's projects is a daily online
compendium of environmental news called the Daily Grist, billed as
``gloom and doom with a sense of humor'' and marked by puns and
tongue-in-cheek headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Grist even offered an April Fool's edition reporting,
among other things, that a coalition of New Mexico environmental
groups was backing a massive shopping complex ``in the sprawling
suburbs of Albuquerque,'' which grateful developers were thinking
of naming Muir Valley. ``It's just a bunch of scrub brush,'' one
environmentalist was quoted as saying. Another said, ``All the
species on this land can be found in at least two or three other
places, so I don't see a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said a little such humor is a good thing, but he hopes
this year's event will spur a serious commitment to energy
efficiency. His ire has clearly been raised by sport utility
vehicles and large cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit took the most environmentally irresponsible vehicle
that is made in the world, found a loophole for it in the
standards, and then sold it to the greenest cohort of American
consumers,'' he said. ``Most of the SUV decision-makers among
consumers are young urban females, who are the strongest
environmentalists in the country. They sold it on the basis of
urban safety, and all these photographs of them in the Serengeti,
as though you're going to drive your SUV through the hills of East
Africa.''

RIGHTS PANEL CRITICIZES SHIFT IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas, Calif.)   By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights plans this week to issue a
harsh critique of policies in Florida, Texas and California that
have replaced affirmative action with admission to public
universities for the top graduates in every high school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the 10-page statement, which was approved in a 6-2
vote by the commission last week, notes that the programs' success
in bringing minorities to campuses relies on the segregation of
high schools, and that they do nothing to diversify graduate and
professional schools.
</P>
<P>
   It reserves special contempt for Florida's plan, which was
enacted voluntarily by Gov. Jeb Bush last fall; the other states
implemented the new admissions systems after affirmative action was
outlawed, in Texas by a federal court and in California by the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The plans ``may succeed as an effective public relations
strategy'' and ``could gain broad appeal because they focus on the
goal that everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn in
higher education,'' the draft statement says. ``But they are no
substitute for strong race-conscious affirmative action in higher
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement calls on the Clinton administration to ``leave the
sidelines and enter the public debate to reinforce the president's
support for affirmative action.'' It also outlines ways Texas and
California could improve their admissions programs, and says
``Florida should keep affirmative action unless forced to abandon
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1957, the commission, whose members are appointed by
Congress and the president, has no legislative or regulatory power
but is often described as the nation's conscience on civil rights,
issuing reports and recommendations, and sometimes holding public
hearings. There are six Democrats and two Republicans, and last
week's vote broke along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican members, Carl Anderson and Russell Redenbaugh,
have submitted a two-page dissent saying the statement is
``littered with inaccuracies and half-truths,'' and raising
questions about the research behind the statement as well as its
analytical approach.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of automatic admission for a certain percentage of
high school graduates is increasingly popular with people on both
sides of the affirmative action debate as a less controversial way
to diversify campuses and expand educational opportunities for
minorities than using race-conscious admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was the first to adopt the approach, guaranteeing the top
10 percent of graduates from each of the state's high schools a
seat in the public university of their choice. In the two years
that the program has been in place, the percentage of black and
Hispanic students at the state's flagship institutions, the
University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&AMP;M, has been restored to
the levels before the 1996 court decision that ended affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   California, where affirmative action was banned by a ballot
initiative in 1996, promises admission to the University of
California _ but not any particular campus _ to the top 4 percent
of high school graduates. Minority admission overall has increased
under the program, but it lags at Berkeley and UCLA, the most
competitive campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Bush implemented a plan by fiat, a year before a
proposed ballot initiative that could end affirmative action, to
curtail racial preferences and instead admit the top 20 percent of
high school graduates. Last month, officials in Pennsylvania
proposed a top 15 percent plan, and the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights has received inquiries from half a dozen other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall advice to folks is if you're thinking about a
percentage plan, you should do so warily,'' said Mary Frances
Berry, the commission chairwoman, who is a history and law
professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ``They're not
effective solutions. If you have affirmative action and can keep
it, you ought to keep it.''

EDITORIAL: NEW TWISTS IN NEW YORK SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   Two startling developments are changing the dynamics of the
Senate campaign in New York state. In a surprising shift, the
latest opinion polls show New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
losing ground to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times/CBS News survey last week, Clinton surged
from 2 percentage points behind to 8 points ahead of the mayor,
gaining not only in the city but also upstate, where Republicans
are traditionally strong. But in an unexpected counter trend, the
latest fund-raising reports show that the mayor has raised far more
money than the first lady. His campaign has a balance of $19
million compared with her $12 million. With seven months to go,
this race could devour as much as $70 million or $80 million for a
single Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind these two countervailing forces seem clear.
The latest polls are registering the mayor's mishandling of the
Patrick Dorismond shooting, including his unwarranted release of
Dorismond's juvenile records. The surveys also signal Giuliani's
failure to focus on a statewide message, especially to potential
voters outside the city. The unanswered question is whether the
Dorismond case has caused only a momentary blip in the polls, as
the mayor's campaign believes, or will solidify misgivings raised
by the first lady that he is a divisive and authoritarian figure
unsuitable for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the candidates are spending their considerable
funds to minimize their own weaknesses and amplify their
opponent's. After a shaky start, Clinton has gained in the upstate
areas by energetically working the rural coffee shops and courting
the hometown television stations. For her effort, she has pulled
even with the mayor upstate, a position that could be difficult to
maintain. Still, her support in Republican territory has clearly
terrified local Republican leaders, who already fear that if Al
Gore wins the presidential vote in a generally Democratic state it
will trickle down to the rest of the ballot. Undoubtedly shaken by
these latest polls, the mayor's campaign has scheduled more visits
outside the city to calm these Republican nerves and shore up
Giuliani's support.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor remains strong in the suburbs, where the first lady,
despite her move to a comfortable enclave in Westchester County,
has failed to energize voters or lure enough white professional
women into her army. The suburbs will be particularly hard-fought
territory, and the mayor launched his latest advertising campaign
to target them. Giuliani's new instant commercial features him
campaigning last week with Sen. John McCain, who appeals to crucial
swing voters, especially on Long Island. The ads not only allow the
mayor to ride on McCain's residual popularity, but also make it
clear that not all U.S. senators are soft and malleable.
</P>
<P>
   If each candidate stirs intense dislike among the opposition, a
political given in this high-powered duel, Giuliani's campaign is
using this antipathy to great financial advantage. An Associated
Press story in February cited donors around the country who could
not pronounce Giuliani's name but contributed to him because, as
one $100 donor in Dallas explained, ``I hate Hillary, plain and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The massive flow of regular campaign funds to both campaigns
makes it all the more distressing that each side is now also
raising largely unregulated donations or soft money. Two advocacy
groups _ Common Cause and Democracy 21 _ have asked the Federal
Election Commission and Justice Department to investigate these
donations that are not independent of the campaigns as required by
law. A swift ruling to stop these new ``joint committees'' would
help end a bad scheme before it becomes a political tradition.

A PLAN TO PRESERVE GIANT SEQUOIAS, WORLD'S BIGGEST TREES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Colo., Wyo.)   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has recommended
that 355,000 acres of national forest be given monument status to
safeguard about half the giant sequoia groves remaining in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are really precious jewels of the American geography,''
Glickman said Friday. Monument status would give them ``a
long-term, even permanent protection for the benefit of the
American people to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation will now go to President Clinton, who is
expected to approve it under the 1906 Antiquities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of his presidency, Clinton has been
increasingly using the act, which allows him to create national
monuments on federal lands without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   He has protected more land using the act in the lower 48 states
than any other president.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts in Sequoia National Forest, part of which is used
for logging, have met with opposition. In an effort to block
Clinton, three members of Congress from California have drafted
legislation that would require an 18-month study by the National
Academy of Science on how best to protect the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, a Republican sponsor of the bill, has said
that the president is ``declaring war'' on communities closest to
the forests. During debate on the measure last month, supporters of
the legislation acknowledged that it was unlikely to pass before
Clinton acted.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While the legislators agree that the trees should be protected,
they argue that cutbacks on logging in the national forest would
cost millions of dollars in lost jobs and would also be
shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   They say timber operations protect the sequoias by thinning out
the undergrowth and smaller trees surrounding them and protecting
them from fire and pest infestation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Glickman's proposal, any future arrangements for logging
within the boundaries of the monument would be outlawed, but
logging deals already negotiated would continue while logging is
phased out over the next 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   In his recommendation, Glickman outlined a plan that he said was
intended to safeguard the trees well into the future. He suggested
that a science advisory panel be created to help develop a
management plan for the trees. The plan would be used to draft
guidelines on issues like controlled burning, which could replace
the clearing by timber operations.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing operations and other uses that are already permitted
would remain in effect, and all existing rights of private property
owners within the forest would be preserved under the secretary's
recommendations. Recreational access would also continue. Existing
camps, like Camp Whittsett Boy Scout Camp and Pyles Boys Camp,
would probably remain, Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that overall, there will be a special management
effort to protect the trees over and above your normal forest
management,'' he said. ``Despite their tremendous size, giant
sequoias are vulnerable. They are very much affected by what
happens in the surrounding forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Forestry officials said that the area chosen for the monument
included 75 groves. The area was selected primarily because of
underground water supplies and its history of fires. The Sequoia
National Forest is close to a million acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancestors of the giant sequoia once grew as far east as
Colorado and Wyoming,'' Glickman noted. ``Now these precious trees
are only found on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada. To ensure
the permanent survival of these ancient giants, we must provide
them with permanent protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Although California's redwoods are the tallest trees in the
world, sequoias are the largest overall, measuring up to 30 feet in
diameter and weighing as much as 600 tons. In 1992, President Bush
signed a proclamation prohibiting logging within 1,000 feet of a
sequoia.
</P>
<P>
   Several other groves are already protected because they are in
national parks, not national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the antiquities act to establish four monuments
and expand another.

IN CORZINE COUNTRY, IDEA OF ETHNIC IDENTITY DIDN'T TAKE ROOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ill.)   By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAYLORVILLE, Ill. _ The name is Dutch. Probably.
</P>
<P>
   When Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs and
now a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey,
waded into the thicket of ethnic politics recently, he made it
quite clear that he regretted his ill-considered humor about
Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his repeated expressions of regret, one thing
remained thoroughly unclear _ his own ethnic background, an issue
that he treated with a mixture of ignorance and indifference. Asked
about his background, in a state where such things tend not to be
treated casually, he said he was told his mother's lineage was
English and his father's side was either French or Italian.
</P>
<P>
   If he hasn't seemed all that interested in his own ethnic
identity, conversations with the people he grew up with here in the
prairielands of southern Illinois offered a glimpse why.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly identifiable ethnic groups in Christian
County, including the Italians who came here to mine coal before
the mines petered out after World War II, about when Corzine was
born in 1948. It's just that Italian-Americans and other groups,
including a dwindling number of Jews, don't stand out as much as
they once might have, said Jack Mazzotti, owner of Rene's drug
store on the courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older group cared about that kind of thing, but they're
dying out,'' said Mazzotti, who remembers Corzine with fondness and
admiration from their days at Taylorville High School. ``We're all
pretty much all-American Americans now _ we don't have that class
and ethnic background thing that you see in the cities.'' (Or in
New Jersey, where one voter in four is of Italian descent.)
</P>
<P>
   Christian County's homogeneity might explain why Corzine would
be loose-tongued about ethnic jokes, Mazzotti went on, although he
winced when he heard of his old friend's recent gaffes about
Italian contractors making ``cement shoes'' and Jewish lawyers
getting them out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine grew up on a farm across the railroad tracks from the
highway at Willey's Station, a few miles up the road from
Taylorville toward Decatur. His father, Roy Allen Corzine, farmed
the fields around the house and sold insurance, while his mother,
Nancy, taught first and second grades at Memorial Elementary School
in Taylorville.
</P>
<P>
   As a Senate candidate, Corzine has liked to emphasize his humble
origins, partly as an antidote to a charge made by his opponent in
the primary, former Gov. Jim Florio, that Corzine was trying to buy
the Senate seat with an immense television campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Corzine's grandfather, also Roy, was a prosperous farmer who
was a Republican state assemblyman for four years and was chairman
of the important Agriculture Committee. Still, Corzine was not
pampered as a youth, said Carolyn Dorris, the sole surviving aunt
of Joanne Corzine, Corzine's wife, who also grew up here and who
has known Corzine since kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Florio said he never had to work hard, but he certainly
did,'' Dorris said in an interview at the big ranch house in
Taylorville's comfortable northeast section that the Corzines
bought for her and for Corzine's mother before she died. ``But he
worked the farm, and when he went to the U of I he got a union card
and worked as a hod carrier. He carried cement _ you think that
isn't hard?''
</P>
<P>
   Dorris was as unaware and as uninterested in the question of
Corzine's family background as he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing just doesn't come up very much around
here,'' she said, and apparently the Corzines are not alone. David
Herbert Donald opens his 1995 biography of Abraham Lincoln, who
settled less than 30 miles from here in Sangamon County, with the
words, ``Abraham Lincoln was not interested in his ancestry.''
Lincoln told a would-be biographer that it was ``a folly'' to
inquire into his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 1893 edition of ``Portrait and Biographical Record of
Christian County, Illinois,'' offers a fragmentary look at a
Corzine family, like Lincoln's and the other pioneer families
around here, slowly making its way west out of New York and
Pennsylvania with the retreating frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Schaffer Corzine, who moved to Christian County from Ohio
in 1861, had a father named Allen _ Jon Corzine's father's middle
name _ born in Pennsylvania in 1816, according to the Record. And
Jacob's great-grandfather was John Corzine Sr., the book reports,
``who came to America from Holland and settled in Manhattan Island,
where he owned 60 acres of land on which Wall Street now stands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said the librarian at the Decatur County
Genealogical Society, ``you can only go by what they told somebody
back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were already plenty of Corzines in Illinois before
Jacob Schaffer Corzine. Twenty-one Corzines fought in the Civil War
in Illinois regiments, none of them from Christian County. Today,
Jon Corzine's nearest local relatives live around the prairie
village of Assumption, 15 miles east of Taylorville.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jon Corzine, the Assumption Corzines are all tall,
Methodist and nearsighted _ but Republican _ and they took an
interest in their distant cousin when he began to get his name in
the papers as a New York bond trader. But Jon Corzine apparently
had no more interest in pursuing the matter of his past with
long-lost relatives than he had with New Jersey political
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wrote him once after someone sent us an article about
him in The Wall Street Journal,'' said Bob Corzine, a retired
Assumption farmer. ``It seems like it was six months before he
wrote back, and he said he had no knowledge of us here.'' Bob
Corzine let that sink in for a moment and added, ``He said he had
no interest in genealogy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorris was inclined to disbelieve any ties with the Assumption
Corzines, even though they lived less than a half-hour's drive
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're related it's like their yeller dog ran through our
yard once some ways back,'' Dorris said, suggesting that any
connection was brief and distant. ``That's about as close as you
can get to not being related.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mazzotti, the owner of Rene's drug store, had a more
charitable interpretation, saying that rich and successful people
could be hard to approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``His friends step back because they don't know whether to call
him or not,'' Mazzetti said. ``He's in a different stratosphere
now, and how do you approach him without setting off signals that
you want something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids,'' as Dorris called Jon and Joanne Corzine, have
hardly ignored their old town. They built a park in honor of
Dorris' late husband, Keith, behind the First United Methodist
Church here, and Tom Campbell, the principal of Taylorville High
School, pointed out that they had endowed two scholarships for
graduates of their alma mater. One, for $1,500 a year for four
years, is paid through the Bertram Hopper Memorial Foundation, the
same foundation, created by founders of the Georgia-Pacific Co.,
that gave Jon a scholarship to the University of Illinois. The
second, in Jon Corzine's father's name, is for $500, and goes to a
Methodist student.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has also been generous with his money to schools in the
East, and Dorris said he had a strong instinct to do the right
thing. Since her late husband had served four terms as Taylorville
city clerk before he quit in disgust at all the politicking, Dorris
tried to warn her favorite nephew about what he was getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he said he wanted to run I said, `Jon, politics is a
dirty game.' And he said, `I know, but we have to get some good
guys in or we'll only have scum.'''

 &HT;    Court time cut short
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the afternoon of Sept. 16, Travis Davenport lifted
weights and shot hoops in his old high school gymnasium. Echoing
the advice of his doctors, his pastor and his mother, his closest
friends discouraged him from joining their pickup game. This time,
Travis listened.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball was his passion. He had played it year-round _ at
Fairburn, Georgia's Creekside High, in AAU leagues, on any
playground _ until the first in a series of fainting spells. Even
then, he occasionally would slip onto the court and run one.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days earlier, a cardiologist had restated in no
uncertain terms that he must give up the game. So Travis, obedient,
only tossed up casual jumpshots in the gym before heading south,
back to college in Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   That night, he collapsed again and died. He didn't quite make it
to midnight of his 19th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   LOVE OF THE GAME
</P>
<P>
   Say the name Travis Davenport to people who were touched by him
and, subconsciously or not, their response eventually includes
heart.
</P>
<P>
   He put his heart and soul into it. Had a heart of gold. Played
half-heartedly sometimes. Did not take the warnings to heart. Was
heartbroken that his medical condition boxed out a life of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Davenport died of heart failure. He isn't the first
athlete to brush aside signs of serious trouble and not live to
regret it.
</P>
<P>
   The media are revisiting the tragic tale of Hank Gathers, a
shooting star for Loyola-Marymount. His fame had the life-span of a
shooting star. Gathers dropped dead of a heart attack during a game
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If Davenport heard those stories, he was hesitant to heed their
message.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball became his dying affection. ``He kept playing, even
after he experienced blackouts,'' said the Rev. Timothy McDonald,
pastor of Travis' church, First Iconium Baptist. ``He loved it
maybe a little too much. (Basketball) is the only thing he got
excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis was in elementary school when his divorced mother,
Sandra, had a basketball goal installed for her only child. It
lasted two years before toppling over from wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   So Travis and his posse took their ball elsewhere. They evolved
into the self-dubbed Penthouse Crew, an intentionally ironic tag.
Their hub was the basement of a member's home, where they mapped
out the weekend or shared their NBA dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, Travis stood out, if for no other reason that he was
rising toward 6 feet 7 and expanding to 250 pounds. If a person's
popularity can be measured by his number of nicknames, Travis was
the Crew chief: first Trap, then Baby Shaq, most recently Big Baby.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Little Giant'' is how Trea Reed remembers him, little
because he was still a kid, unwilling to flick off the TV in hotel
rooms on summer-league road trips for fear of the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Although well into his teens, Travis could connect with
youngsters, which made for enjoyable jobs as camp counselor or
teacher's student aide. ``Like a Pied Piper,'' said Al Outlaw, who
coached one of his AAU teams. ``The kids climbed all over him.''
</P>
<P>
   To his pals, he was a pillar. He drove them to the mall so they
could buy birthday presents for their moms. When A.J. Moye was
sneaker-less before a game, Travis unlaced his own and handed them
over. ``He taught me what friendship was all about,'' Moye said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis had shot up to 6 feet 5 as a ninth-grader and became an
instant starter at Creekside. The freshman led the
graduation-depleted Seminoles in rebounding and was second in
scoring. His coach, Kirby Lamb, described him as D-1, a player with
Division I college potential.
</P>
<P>
   Travis partly squandered his talents, Lamb said. ``By the time
he was a junior, I was ready to kick him off,'' said the coach,
since retired from Creekside. ``He didn't listen very well. He
regressed.'' His work ethic? ``Terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no gripes from the AAU end. ``He was hard-working
for me,'' Outlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior, Travis paced Creekside in points and rebounds.
Colleges on the outer fringes of D-1 cast an eye. One was Winthrop,
which made this year's NCAA Tournament. Another was Norfolk State,
which invited Travis to its campus. In an impromptu game there, he
passed out.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother heard, she flashed back to her senior year in
high school. Her boyfriend Johnny _ later her husband and Travis'
father _ had to quit football because of seizures. Could Travis
have inherited the trait?
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to Mrs. Davenport, omens already had appeared.
Travis, pleading exhaustion, had asked out of one Creekside game.
On the bench, he had acted oddly and complained of
light-headedness, Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
   During an out-of-state AAU game, he had asked for water, sat
down and fainted. When the paramedics arrived, a recovered Travis
shooed them away.
</P>
<P>
   The scare at Norfolk triggered a whirlwind of doctors'
appointments and a four-day hospital stay for assorted tests. The
malady was traced to his heart. Medicine and rest were prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Travis' obligation to each was spotty. Friends had to remind,
even force, him to swallow his pills and to swear off ball.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Travis was in his bedroom, about to accompany Trea
Reed and Kerry Willis to the movies, when he collapsed. Again, he
was back to normal as the paramedics pulled up.
</P>
<P>
   D-1 DREAMS DASHED
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Travis and his mother consulted as
many as five cardiologists. She was motivated to find a definitive
diagnosis. He was shopping for something else _ a doctor who would
approve of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But with each stop, the chorus grew louder: Put away the ball
and get a defibrillator or pacemaker implanted to rein in your
irregular heartbeat. He never did.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davenport says doctors ultimately traced the cause to a
viral infection. Travis' primary cardiologist declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never wanted to go to the doctors. He didn't like them,''
Reed said. ``They told him what he didn't want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   His true homeboys banned him from their informal games. But many
heard of Travis sightings, of him huffing up and down courts here
and there.
</P>
<P>
   Outlaw barred him from AAU tournaments. ``He was determined to
play,'' Outlaw said. ``I really don't think he realized how serious
it was. You know how kids feel: `I'm invincible.'''
</P>
<P>
   Insufficient entrance-exam scores had dashed his D-1 dreams. Now
his precarious health was dooming him at any level of college ball.
So he chose to keep his condition a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Hatcher, coach at Middle Georgia Junior College, was
familiar with Travis by word of mouth. He came to the Davenports'
home to sign Travis on reputation alone. Only as the ink was drying
was he informed that there might be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it would be hard for him'' to quit, Kerry Willis said.
His mother said, ``I was worried about him having to sit and
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   As summer faded, Travis enrolled at Middle Georgia. Even if he
would never suit up, he was a college student _ the first among his
beaming relatives. ``Travis was like a beacon to them, a source of
pride,'' Outlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cochran _ beyond the watch of his mother and concerned
acquaintances _ Travis could not resist basketball's lure. He
joined the team for pickup games before official practices began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played every day about 2:30,'' said his roommate, Marcus
Smith. ``Travis played for about a week.'' Smith said the coach got
word and put a halt to it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was struck by how Travis labored in the games, needing
extended rests. Travis was hefty but hardly overweight.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate became a surrogate parent, worrying each night how
he would cope if Travis had a heart attack and forbidding him each
day from playing. ``Told him I'd kick his tail if he tried,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   BITTER ACCEPTANCE
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, Mrs. Davenport made her regular two-hour Saturday
morning drive to Cochran to fetch Travis. Customarily, she returned
him Sunday night, but he stayed over for a doctor's appointment on
Tuesday. There, Travis heard the hurtful words once more, louder
than before: Forget basketball. It's over. Get a pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' she said, ``is when he came to the realization.'' They
prayed together, asking for guidance. They agreed that Travis could
find eventual solace in a teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a bitter acceptance. ``Mom, I can't understand
it,'' he told her. ``I get this far _ and this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The next night, she stayed home from church to grant Travis'
wish of a pre-birthday meal with his favorite dishes _ short ribs,
macaroni and cheese, collard greens. Thursday afternoon, the gym at
Creekside was filled with friends, some home from colleges in South
Georgia that had closed because of Hurricane Floyd. Travis wanted
to run with them. ``We wouldn't let him,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   So, he shot around and delivered his trademark bearhugs,
squeezing the breath out of his buddies. ``You made it to 19,''
A.J. Moye told him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he drove south, stopping by the dorm in Cochran to invite
his roommate out for a birthday celebration. Marcus Smith begged
off, citing studies, but Travis found an old Creekside crony to tag
along to a club in nearby Macon.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed a short time. Travis was walking to the car for the
ride back when he collapsed. Death came quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As the news spread north by telephone over the next 24 hours,
reactions ranged from disbelief to uncontrollable grief. Nobody was
more affected than Moye, who was expecting a guest _ Bob Knight.
The Indiana coach was paying his in-house visit to the junior from
Westlake High.
</P>
<P>
   When Knight arrived, Moye was in a back room, sobbing and
pounding the floor in helpless anger. The irascible, often
insensitive coach offered to return another time. Moye said he
could stay, and Knight comforted him with an embrace. The gesture
helped seal Moye's decision to sign with Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Penthouse Crew's survivors hung together through the
weekend, reminiscing, going to the movies, smothering their
sadness. They searched their consciences to ask what more they
could have done for Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew the whole truth of his risky romance with
basketball, of his failing health. But some had braced themselves
for the worst. ``I knew he was going to keep playing,'' Outlaw
said. ``If he was going to go, he wanted it to be with a basketball
in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral-goers filled the 1,000 seats in the First Iconium
Baptist Church and spilled outside. Creekside let out so students
could attend. The Middle Georgia team arrived in a van.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral procession snaked along to Forest Lawn Memorial
Gardens, where Travis was buried under a tombstone decorated by his
longtime jersey number, 40. A half-year later, Mrs. Davenport is
reminded of Travis each time she walks by a large glass case in her
living room. The shrine includes photos, trophies, a diploma,
videotapes of Creekside games, a jersey donated by Lamb, a Bible, a
single rose, a toy white dove, a copy of the poem ``Heading Home''
and a gift from the neighborhood kids of an angel clutching a
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davenport was not alone in missing Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Bo Kimble carved out an enduring memory of any
NCAA Tournament when he awkwardly sank a free throw left-handed in
honor of his deceased friend, Hank Gathers. Travis' chums all
honored him on their various teams by writing his name, number or a
favorite nickname on their sneakers and wristbands. Trea Reed has
picked out a vacancy on his arm for a tattoo of a No. 40 with
angel's wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a family and we lost our link,'' said A.J. Moye, who
then repeated the word that seems unavoidable when the topic is
Travis Davenport. ``He had a heart as big as he was.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wintry weather will cover much of the upper Midwest and
Northeast in the wake of a potent low-pressure system moving into
eastern Canada. Rain will end Sunday morning in eastern New England
as a potent cold front sweeps offshore. In the wake of the front,
periods of snow will linger into the afternoon from the Adirondacks
to the Green and White Mountains. Winds from the northwest
averaging 20 to 30 miles an hour will draw much colder air from
central Canada into the interior Northeast and Middle Atlantic
states. Farther west, a fast-moving disturbance will promote snow
showers from the northern Great Lakes to the west slopes of the
central Appalachians. Overnight, temperatures will fall below
freezing from the Dakotas to the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   After a cold dawn, the Southeast will be sunny and rather cool.
The Western states will be mild, but some mountain showers will
occur from Oregon to the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: APRIL SNOW
</P>
<P>
   Unless it is falling very heavily, snow does not easily
accumulate on roads during the daytime in April. The strengthening
April sun penetrates the overcast, helping to keep pavements warm
and discouraging snow from accumulating. On Friday morning, it
began to snow rather heavily across parts of Iowa and Wisconsin.
Initially, the snow whitened grassy surfaces, which absorb less
solar energy than pavements. As heavy snow continued into the
evening, snow built up more rapidly on roads.

<P>
   ``She realizes I am not quite normal at the moment,'' Solonin
said. ``And she wonders if I should not drop this project that is
making me so nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The project in question is Smolny College, the first institution
to offer an American liberal arts degree program in Russia. Jointly
run by Bard College and St. Petersburg University, Smolny opened to
a first batch of students in September. Among those invited to
teach was Solonin, who found himself torn between old anti-American
prejudices and an awareness that no ivory tower, even that of the
philosopher, could remain impervious to the end of the Soviet Union
and the arrival of capitalism a la Russe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for me to teach at Smolny,'' he
explained, running long fingers through an artfully trimmed beard.
``You see, the Russian style of teaching is the monologue. I know I
have to fight against this style, because the liberal arts approach
involves students being very active. So I must provoke student
participation. But it is hard for me to maintain my self-control,
and I worry I will bend students to my authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The existential crisis of Solonin, a man tugged between
disciplinarian instincts and democratic curiosity, is one measure
of the challenge of the Smolny experiment. With Russian society in
flux, the army at war in Chechnya and higher education in a state
of some dilapidation, the new college represents a bold gamble that
American educational values of openness and creative exchange can
take root in a country still vulnerable to an authoritarian
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   In the liberal arts system, students pursue a wide course of
study _ from history to politics to architecture. Breadth and depth
are equally prized. Nothing could be more different from the
Russian tradition of intense specialization in a single subject,
learning-by-rote and oral examinations.
</P>
<P>
   But the conviction at Bard College is that liberal arts became
popular in the United States because the country was building a
democracy; accordingly, it may now serve the same purpose in Russia
by opening young people's minds to critical debate and the habits
of participation.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like an entirely laudable and uncontroversial
objective in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., where Bard is home to 1,200
undergraduates. But in St. Petersburg, history is no quietly
flowing Yankee river; it is a succession of plots and counterplots.
The very name of the city has changed several times as it adapted
to different political realities.
</P>
<P>
   So Nikolai Koposov, the dean of Smolny College, has not had an
easy time. Indeed, repeated attacks on the new institution have
forced him to use all his diplomatic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sinister roles imputed to Smolny in public discussions
at St. Petersburg University over the last several months have been
those of a vehicle for a ``Jewish conspiracy,'' facade for the CIA
and saboteur of the sons of Russia fighting the Chechens. Koposov
has been obliged to explain to some of his colleagues why Smolny
teaches dance when Russia needs bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the charges, I replied that conspiracy theories have not
proved very efficient in history,'' Koposov said. A historian who
chose to specialize in 17th-century France to avoid subjection to
paeans of Marxism-Leninism, he is a man who understands Russia's
mixture of subtlety and brutality. His nuanced mind _ and sense of
humor _ will clearly be helpful in nurturing the compromises that
alone will sustain this delicate Russian-American hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is natural,'' Koposov continued, ``that after the decades
of Soviet propaganda, there are people who want to destroy Smolny
and, if they don't succeed, they want at least to be paid. You see,
defiant Russian nationalism may merely be a way of negotiating the
price of compromise. American culture is relatively little known in
Russia, but American money is rather familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in Russia, of course, that the United States has
had to confront an image problem as two conflicting trends in
education confront each other. The first is a push by American
colleges to establish campuses overseas as the global economy
reinforces the perception that students require international
experience. The number of American students studying abroad in
1997-98, the last year for which statistics are available,
increased almost 15 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to produce global citizens,'' said
Dr. J. Michael Adams, the president of Fairleigh Dickinson
University in New Jersey, which opened a campus in Tel Aviv in
1996. ``We see ourselves preparing citizens of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From Athens to Panama, American universities have been setting
up branches overseas, supported by the strong dollar and economy.
Rice University in Houston, for one, is helping establish a
university to open in 2001 in the north German port town of Bremen.
Courses will be taught in English and credits and degrees will
follow American standards.
</P>
<P>
   The second trend, however, is the emergence of a view that all
this talk in the United States of ``global citizens'' disguises the
true motive. Behind it, the theory goes, lurks a naked American
ambition: to shape the young minds of the world and so extend the
overwhelming cultural pre-eminence of the United States. It is not
surprising _ given the extent of America's economic, military,
political and cultural domination since the end of the Cold War _
that a reaction against what the French call the hegemony of the
United States has begun. Education, quite naturally, has not been
spared in this backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uniform education will lead to a uniform world _ one teaching,
one thinking,'' Claude Allegre, the former French education
minister, complained recently in Le Monde. ``That our students go
and study in the United States and Britain is entirely desirable,
but that the Americans install their universities throughout the
world, all on the same model and with the same courses, is a
catastrophe. We are preparing a counterattack, including
distance-education programs across national borders.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Any French or European counterattack, however, will confront the
hold on the world's imagination of American ideas and the English
language. (American college fees are rather less inspiring.) Even
Allegre went on to say that the change needed in French education
was from a model of the omniscient teacher instructing passive
students to one of ``interaction'' _ precisely the method embodied
in the liberal arts tradition. Little doubt exists that ventures
like Smolny elicit strong demand partly because they are seen as
passports to the Internet-driven culture of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   An enrollment of 300 students at Smolny _ four times the current
figure of 78 _ is expected by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But can these American institutions manage the difficult
balancing act involved in introducing new ideas into sometimes
stultifying foreign educational environments and do so without
betraying an arrogance that provokes nationalist reactions? Leon
Botstein, the president of Bard College, is convinced that the key
to success lies in the adaptation of an American model rather than
its imposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not interested in putting Bard College in Russia,'' he
said. ``What does interest us is a critical exchange of ideas, with
real respect for dissent, and the notion that the liberal arts
model has some international validity adapted to each cultural
context. Of course, there is skepticism in Russia about our
rhetorical pieties. But I firmly believe that a liberal arts
education, civil society and participatory democracy are linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, St. Petersburg, with its Italianate palaces of warm
ocher colors set down at the cold northwestern edge of Russia,
tells a story of the fertile, if not always tranquil, mingling of
cultures. The city itself was created as one fantastic exercise in
westernizing Russia. It was dreamed up by Peter the Great, who also
founded the university in 1724. In so doing, he sought to introduce
German educational ideas to a Russian setting, an illustration that
the marriage of national and foreign instruction is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   The original Smolny College, set on a broad bend in the Neva
River, was itself a Russian-Italian project, designed by Bartolomeo
Rastrelli, the Italian architect of the Hermitage, as a convent for
the Empress Elizabeth, a daughter of Peter the Great. The long
delays in its construction are evident in the mingling of rococo
and neo-Classical styles, but the result is felicitous enough.
</P>
<P>
   Next door stands the Smolny Institute, notorious because the
Military Revolutionary Committee of the Bolsheviks established its
base for the October 1917 coup here. Today a statue of Lenin,
newspaper in back pocket, clutching his cap, pointing the way
forward to a glorious proletarian future, stands before the
building. His back is turned to the Czarist Romanov emblem, a
double-headed eagle, that has been restored to the facade.
</P>
<P>
   Russian history _ tugged between East and West, tradition and
revolution, repression and reform _ is writ large in St.
Petersburg, an invitation to any student to reflect on the
variegated culture of what remains a Euro-Asian empire.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incarnation of Smolny, whose classes take place
principally at St. Petersburg University, a few miles from the
original blue-and-white convent building, amounts to a call to the
new Russia to opt for the liberal culture of the West rather than
lurch into some new authoritarian foray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smolny should be a reminder of what the liberal arts are
about,'' said Susan Gillespie, the director of Bard's Institute for
International Liberal Education. ``The capacity to be
intellectually courageous, creative and challenging in a
nonhierarchical classroom that prepares you for an open society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good. But of course Smolny is very much a work in
progress. Wires hang ominously from walls, computers are
conspicuous by their absence, and the penchant of Russian teachers
for the ``monologue'' dies hard in classrooms even if they have
been coached in the ways of the liberal arts. New courses in
everything from literary criticism to American studies demand an
agility for which the Soviet Union was no preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To convince a medievalist that he or she should have some
ideas about the French Revolution was impossible in the old
system,'' Koposov, the dean, said. His wife, Dina, also a
historian, added, ``There were two schools of philosophy in the
Soviet system: the official Marxist one and the unofficial one in
the Gulag.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, great strides have been made. Much positive sentiment
about Smolny exists within St. Petersburg University alongside the
misgivings and opposition. Smolny has been accepted as an integral
part of the university, one of the two or three most prestigious
centers of higher learning in Russia, with a faculty consisting
largely of Russian teachers giving courses almost exclusively in
Russian (as is required by law). The college offers graduates B.A.
degrees from Bard as well as degrees from Smolny.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, the Russian Ministry of Education approved a
decree designating Smolny an experimental site and establishing an
association of representatives from Russian institutions of higher
learning with the mission of creating a national network of liberal
arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason why this approval should not come,''
said Yuri Fedotov, the university's vice rector for international
affairs. ``The wider your range of activities, the more sustainable
you are in a market economy. Since communism fell, we have more
freedom and less money from the government, so we have to
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the experiments at St. Petersburg University have been the
introduction of four-year bachelor's degrees alongside the old
five-year specialist degrees; the foundation of a School of
Management; the offering of university places to so-called
commercial students, who are obliged to pay fees at a university
where all education has been free; and, most conspicuously, Smolny
itself, where students pay $2,000 a year. This fee is too high for
most Russians, but Koposov said that about 80 percent of the
students received scholarships covering all or part of the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by the philanthropist George Soros' Open Society
Institute in Budapest, by a $300,000 grant from the U.S.
Information Agency and by private donors, the college offers an
interesting fund-raising model in cash-short Russia; it also makes
professors more marketable by forcing them to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Erin Weeks-Earp, the one Bard student in the first group
attending Smolny, has had to adapt a great deal herself since
arriving from the United States last year. She is in the vanguard
of what Smolny hopes will eventually be a large number of students
from American and European colleges. Age 20, she considers herself
a patient and tolerant person. But her patience and tolerance have
been stretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a completely different attitude to everything you do _
life, work, study,'' she said. ``Last semester, I tried to write a
paper. I went to the library to sign up. I needed a passport, two
photos, and then I had to fill out a questionnaire on what I wanted
to research. Finally, I received a library card. But nothing is
computerized. All you have are card-index catalogs in boxes where
everything seems mixed up. In the end I found the reference for the
book I wanted and handed in a slip with its name. I was told to
come back the following Tuesday. And when I got the book, I could
not take it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks-Earp, who came to Smolny to perfect her Russian, has
thought a lot about what distinguishes the American liberal arts
approach. ``The aspect that students here have difficulty putting
their finger on is creativity,'' she said. ``At Bard, it is not a
transfer of information that takes place in class, but sharing, and
you may well find a student ripping apart a professor's ideas. That
is not an easy concept to grasp for Russian students.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are trying. In one classroom, a group of young Russians
is gathered for an anthropology course, ``Gender as a Concept and a
Field of Study.'' According to a prospectus prepared by the
professor, the class is devoted to an examination of ``gendered
human differences from prehistory to the present'' and
``cross-cultural examples of gender in the division of labor,
access to productive and reproductive resources, and the exercise
of political power.''
</P>
<P>
   The students seem motivated, drawn to the novelty of this
experiment. ``In the old way,'' said Nikolai Nikifarov, a student,
``you learn to lose your time listening to things that sound very
lofty, but don't mean anything. You listen but don't understand.
But in the liberal arts, you learn because you feel you need it,
not because somebody else thinks you need it. This dynamic feeling
gets you turned on.''
</P>
<P>
   Anastassia Zoueva, another student, said she had learned at
Smolny that ``you work better without pressure.'' In the regular
courses at the state university, she said, pressure was constant,
the lists of reading endless and the fear of offending a professor
great.
</P>
<P>
   But Smolny also presents some problems. Several students
acknowledged that their parents had difficulty understanding
courses that did not lead to a specific career; concern clearly
exists that jobs will prove scarce for graduates. This fear is
reflected in the fact that men have tended to shun Smolny _ about
80 percent of the first students are women _ partly because they
are not yet convinced that it can open the way to a good career.
``For government agencies and state businesses, the old five-year
specialist degree is still favored,'' Fedotov said.
</P>
<P>
   But the system that produced these specialists is clearly
cracking. In its way, it was an extraordinary achievement; the
Soviet Union focused enormous resources on education, and standards
were extremely high. This fact holds out the possibility of a true
marriage of the old and the new. Unlike in Latin America, where the
elites are sometimes known as the ``Miami boys'' because they go to
the United States to be educated, Russia may prove able to provide
its own elite education.
</P>
<P>
   But it will have to adapt fast. Konstantin Barsht is a typical
professor, teaching literature at another St. Petersburg
university, the State Pedagogical University. He earns $65 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody pays taxes so the government does not have enough to
pay teachers,'' he said simply, adding with a smile: ``But Russians
are very strange, many still want to work for ideas rather than
salaries. It is the main difference between Russia and the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Barsht has had to take a second job teaching English privately,
and he recognizes that he is in what he calls ``survival mode.''
Many of his fellow teachers have gone abroad or moved into private
industry. At the same time, these Russian industries are becoming
more demanding, and they all want three things: a higher education,
knowledge of computers and good command of English.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Smolny College, offering English, access to foreign
capital and a real marriage of Western and Russian ideas. It is
clearly a model with potential. But the last decade has been
crushing in many ways, full of disillusionment and difficulties. As
Barsht observed: ``The pressure of poverty creates a moral state
where optimism disappears. And somebody doing something new must be
a little optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Solonin, the philosophy dean, is one of the many Russians left
with deep doubts about change by his country's painful
transformation. ``We have to reconsider the relationship of freedom
and creativity,'' he said. ``We thought that creativity was a
function of freedom. But in the time of the Gulag, people were
totally unfree, and they created great works of science, of
literature, of thought. In the Soviet Union, it was impossible to
talk, but we had something to talk about. Now you can say whatever
you like, but people have nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   These words are shocking to Western ears, and they express all
this professor's skepticism about Smolny and the liberal arts. To
his mind, the American approach removes what he calls ``the tension
and discipline necessary for ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the CIA had yet to prove that it was not
behind Smolny. And yet, he is ready to try to understand, even to
adapt.
</P>
<P>
   In such painful adaptations, in such intellectual struggles,
Smolny may find its way. ``Smolny College is still wavering,''
Weeks-Earp said. ``But it will find its own middle ground because
people are motivated. Not the American liberal education. Not
classical St. Petersburg. Something else.''

   AMERICAN COLLEGES EXPANDING
</P>
<P>
   Many American colleges and universities have set up branches
throughout the world, citing an expanding global economy with
America at the center and the popularity of English as the language
of business. Foreign students are attracted to the prestige of an
American degree, and Americans are lured by the international
experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Champlain College (Burlington, Vt.): ``In the early '90s we
decided to focus on international,'' said David Huwiler, vice
president for academic affairs at Champlain. ``For years we told
our students that the world was moving toward a global economy and
we decided we should back that up.'' Champlain offers undergraduate
degrees in business and technology on campuses in the United Arab
Emirates and Malaysia and has plans for ones in India, Singapore
and Hong Kong. Champlain's Tel Aviv campus has 2,500 students, more
than in Burlington. (www.champlain.edu)

EDITORIAL: KOFI ANNAN'S MILLENNIAL VISION  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   Part of Kofi Annan's job as secretary-general of the United
Nations is to think big thoughts about the future of the planet.
Last week he made the most of that responsibility by outlining an
audacious vision for the world organization in the 21st century. It
would be easy to dismiss Annan's comprehensive vision as, in his
own words, ``absurdly ambitious.'' But it deserves a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   In a report setting the agenda for a millennium assembly in New
York in September to which all the world's leaders are invited,
Annan reiterated his advocacy of environmental protection, military
interventions to stop genocide and mass murder, and curbs on
weapons proliferation. But his most intriguing appeals focused on
imaginative efforts among states, nongovernmental organizations and
the private sector to fight poverty and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Annan is right to suggest that the United Nations take the lead
in bringing the Internet and other information technologies to poor
nations. Throughout the developing world the Internet can greatly
enhance access to markets, government efficiency and education at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
   He announced plans to create an innovative volunteer corps, the
U.N. Information Technology Service, to train groups in developing
countries to use the Internet. He proposed an Internet health-care
network for 10,000 online terminals in hospitals and clinics to
provide access to medical information.
</P>
<P>
   Annan stakes out worthy goals for the next 15 years: to halve
the proportion of the world's people _ currently one in five _
whose income is less than a dollar a day, and to halve the
proportion of people _ also one in five _ without access to safe
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   He endorses a World Bank plan to improve the lives of 100
million slum dwellers by 2020. He proposes that the United Nations
work with the pharmaceutical industry and other partners to develop
an affordable vaccine against AIDS, and sets a goal of reducing HIV
infection rates among young adults by 25 percent in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the world will fall far short of these targets. Only a
day after Annan's report was released, the U.N. Development Program
concluded that there has been little progress in combating poverty
in the last five years. The main impediments, it found, were
corrupt and authoritarian governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and other industrialized countries could
help by heeding Annan's call to drop their trade barriers against
exports from the least developed countries and lifting the debt of
poor countries.

OUTDOORS: SALTY FLYRODDING COMES OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER KAMINSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a cold, rainy day in early spring, the idea of getting
together with a bunch of fellow anglers and swapping stories around
a warm fire was as close to fishing as I was going to get. At the
North Shore guest cottage of the light tackle guide and
restaurateur James Kang, the anglers were there but so, too, was
the chill, largely because the heat pipes had burst in the one cold
spell of winter. We warmed ourselves with plates of hot lasagna and
crabcakes and got down to business.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of the meeting was more than an opportunity to
weave fish tales. The 17 guides on hand represented a vanguard of
the hundred or so flyrodder charter captains who have pioneered the
sport in metropolitan area waters. With fast growth, however, there
have come growing pains: guides who poach on each other's clients,
trash-talk about the competition, crowding at hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   These real-world difficulties are the kinds of things most of us
try to escape when we go off fly-fishing. But when you spend 150
days on the water in fair weather and foul and you have the kind of
kind of loner cowboy personality that makes you take up a career in
a little boat all by yourself, you are inevitably going to run into
elbow room problems.
</P>
<P>
   These nettlesome turf wars pale by comparison to the larger
environmental issues that confront all anglers. The great striper
comeback of the 1990s was caused in large part by enlightened (and
enforced) regulations and, notably, the ban on commercial fishing
in the greatest of all striper nurseries, Chesapeake Bay. In the
last few seasons, decreasing size limits, increased recreational
and commercial pressure and the opening of Chesapeake Bay to
netting mean that unless anglers organize and take important
conservation steps the hard-won resurgence of the striper may be
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not many businesses where you have only one supplier
and that supplier determines everything,'' said Frank Crescitelli,
a charter captain who was one of the prime movers behind the
guides' meeting and the professional association born of it. ``Our
only supplier is Mother Nature. If we mess up, she's gone and we're
out of business.'' This sentiment was echoed by others, including
the group's co-founders, Ernie French and Scott Holder.
</P>
<P>
   With conservation high on the agenda, the nascent group plans to
promote it both by example and by political pressure. Adopting the
catch-and-release ethic of trout fishing (out of which saltwater
fly-fishing developed), the organization will actively promote
no-kill striper fishing. By law, clients are allowed to keep two
fish, but all customers will be told that catch and release is the
goal and, in any case, no more than one striper may be kept.
</P>
<P>
   The guides also intend to keep less than their limit of
weakfish, flounder and bluefish. ``The law says you can keep 10
fish per day,'' Crescitelli said, ``but who ever needs, or uses, 10
bluefish?'' This is certainly the first time that charter captains
in our area (and to my knowledge, in the rest of the country as
well) have adopted a policy of taking less than the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   The group also plans to band together to attend hearings and
pressure legislators who know well that one guide speaks for
hundreds of angler/voters. All fisherfolk need to exercising some
political muscle right now, Holder pointed out, as competing New
York state Senate and Assembly bills have languished, during which
time the Department of Environmental Conservation's legal ability
to regulate key aspects of striped bass fishing expired.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term effect of this inaction, according to Gordon
Colvin of the Department of Environmental Conservation, could be
that New York state will be found in violation of the rules of the
Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, set up to oversee the
recovery of striped bass. That could lead to extreme restriction on
the fishery and, ultimately, its closure.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm raised by concerned angler/conservationists _
including the guides' group _ has roused legislators in Albany. The
Senate approved a compromise bill on April 5 and all that remains
to guarantee the opening of the striper season on May 8 is for the
Assembly to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   In a hands-on effort to promote conservation of pressured
resources, the guides plan to designate stewards for heavily fished
areas. Their job will be to inform others in the group when fishing
pressure on a particular spot is driving fish away. In that event,
all guides will agree to give the particular flat, shoal or rip a
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Here as elsewhere, the new association can suggest but not
enforce: nonetheless, the attendees unanimously agreed that these
are achievable goals. And the benefits of things like group
advertising, a collective Web presence and lower insurance rates
offer incentives beyond mere comity and good citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The first true test of the spirit at the recent meeting came
when the captains were asked to reach into their pockets. Jim
Levison, a retired New York City detective and East Hampton guide,
was appointed treasurer; he collected $50 apiece from the guides as
an initiation fee, with dues to be set later.
</P>
<P>
   We all ended the day agreeing that New York flyrodding had taken
an important first step.

EDITORIAL: KOFI ANNAN'S MILLENNIAL VISION  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 9:
</P>
<P>
   Part of Kofi Annan's job as secretary-general of the United
Nations is to think big thoughts about the future of the planet.
Last week he made the most of that responsibility by outlining an
audacious vision for the world organization in the 21st century. It
would be easy to dismiss Annan's comprehensive vision as, in his
own words, ``absurdly ambitious.'' But it deserves a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   In a report setting the agenda for a millennium assembly in New
York in September to which all the world's leaders are invited,
Annan reiterated his advocacy of environmental protection, military
interventions to stop genocide and mass murder, and curbs on
weapons proliferation. But his most intriguing appeals focused on
imaginative efforts among states, nongovernmental organizations and
the private sector to fight poverty and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Annan is right to suggest that the United Nations take the lead
in bringing the Internet and other information technologies to poor
nations. Throughout the developing world the Internet can greatly
enhance access to markets, government efficiency and education at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
   He announced plans to create an innovative volunteer corps, the
U.N. Information Technology Service, to train groups in developing
countries to use the Internet. He proposed an Internet health-care
network for 10,000 online terminals in hospitals and clinics to
provide access to medical information.
</P>
<P>
   Annan stakes out worthy goals for the next 15 years: to halve
the proportion of the world's people _ currently one in five _
whose income is less than a dollar a day, and to halve the
proportion of people _ also one in five _ without access to safe
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   He endorses a World Bank plan to improve the lives of 100
million slum dwellers by 2020. He proposes that the United Nations
work with the pharmaceutical industry and other partners to develop
an affordable vaccine against AIDS, and sets a goal of reducing HIV
infection rates among young adults by 25 percent in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the world will fall far short of these targets. Only a
day after Annan's report was released, the U.N. Development Program
concluded that there has been little progress in combating poverty
in the last five years. The main impediments, it found, were
corrupt and authoritarian governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and other industrialized countries could
help by heeding Annan's call to drop their trade barriers against
exports from the least developed countries and lifting the debt of
poor countries.

LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of NASCAR's top drivers are aging gracefully, a testament
to the value of experience. But one tip-off that they are aging is
the budding proliferation of father-son drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring example: the Earnhardts, Dale Jr. and Sr. The
elder Earnhardt, who will be 49 this month, is a seven-time Winston
Cup series champion, and he stands fourth in this season's
standing. Junior, as his son is known, is a 25-year-old rookie who
just joined this season's list of winners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with Junior's victory last week in Fort Worth, Texas,
the Earnhardts became the first father and son to win a Winston Cup
race in the same season since Bobby and Davey Allison in 1988.
Earnhardt Sr. won at Atlanta Motor Speedway last month.
</P>
<P>
   It took Junior just 12 races to make it to the winner's lane,
four fewer than his father required 21 years ago. ``Now we'll see
how big his head gets,'' Earnhardt Sr. said playfully after his
son's victory.
</P>
<P>
   As next week's racing shifts to storied Talladega, Ala., other
father-son drivers looking eventually to rival the Earnhardts
include the Pettys (Kyle and his son Adam), the Marlins (Sterling
and Steadman, who made his Busch series debut Saturday), the
Jarretts (Dale, the defending Winston Cup champion, and Jason), the
Labontes (Terry and Justin) and the Bodines (Geoffrey and Barry).
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting how Earnhardt Sr., stoic and gruff, approached
his son's slump before the breakthrough victory in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, Junior felt he needed some encouragement after
qualifying high but having trouble-filled finishes of 29th, 40th
and 38th. His father, working on his own car, gave no pep talks.
</P>
<P>
   At home after the poor finishes, Junior noticed that the phone
did not ring nearly as often as it had after his 10th-place in Las
Vegas. That bothered him because he figured this was going to be
his life's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can beat yourself up only so much,'' he said, ``before you
take a lot of confidence away from yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Gary Nelson, a former crew chief who is NASCAR's
Winston Cup director. Unsolicited, Nelson told Junior two days
before the Forth Worth race that he had a fine future. ``He said I
just needed to calm down,'' Junior said. ``It was good to hear. I
haven't heard that from anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior had come into the Winston Cup series as a two-time
champion of the Busch series, a fierce training ground for future
Winston Cup drivers. Still, he felt that Nelson gave him a
much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like being in a marriage,'' he said. ``Even though your
wife knows you love her, you've still got to tell her sometimes.
That was kind of the situation I was in. Like it'd be nice to get
patted on the back sometimes even though we had a bad weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he did think his father gave him some valuable advice after
the victory. ``He said to enjoy the moment and how it feels,'' and
then move on, Junior said. ``He knows that just as easily we could
have three more bad weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart established a benchmark for rookies last year when
he won three races and finished fourth in the point standing.
Earnhardt is ahead of him in one respect, though _ Stewart did not
win a race until his 25th start.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading the Wealth
</P>
<P>
   After seven Winston Cup races, there have been seven winners.
One more new winner and it will be a modern-era record to start a
season. Safety First  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the first Winston Cup race this year _ when one of Tony
Stewart's tire changers broke his leg when the car slammed into him
leaving the pit area in the Daytona 500 _ working on pit road has
proven more dangerous than steering a car at 180 miles an hour. And
losing control of right-side tires after they have been pulled from
a car has been a particularly troublesome safety hazard for both
crew and car.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday in Martinsville, Va., NASCAR officials will
penalize teams if they neglect to remove their right-side tires
from the pit box. It is a rule that may save a life.

POLICE OFFICIAL DEMOTED OVER RACIST REMARKS  
 BY JAYSON BLAIR  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The commander of a Queens police precinct was demoted
after participating in a conversation laced with racist jokes about
his supervisor, the Police Department's highest ranking
Asian-American, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Capt. Joseph T. Culbert, took part in the
conversation with a lieutenant and a police officer after he spoke
by cellular phone with the supervisor, Deputy Chief Dewey Fong.
Culbert thought he had hung up, but the call did not disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that Culbert then joined in ``an
inappropriate conversation'' that was inadvertently recovered on
Fong's cellular telephone's voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Culbert had made the call while driving to Brooklyn as part of
the crowd control unit for the funeral of Patrick Dorismond, an
unarmed man who was killed by an undercover officer last month.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials, one of the other officers questioned
Fong's intelligence and then asked how Culbert could take orders
from someone who was not smart and ``looks like a Chinese takeout
deliveryman.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that the three men began laughing and that
Culbert then joined in for several minutes of what were described
as jokes about Fong. The police did not release specifics about
what the captain was accused of saying.
</P>
<P>
   Fong later heard the comments while listening to his voice mail,
officials said, and then reported them to the office of Deputy
Police Commissioner Neldra M. Zeigler, who oversees the
department's division that investigates complaints of
discrimination and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Culbert and Fong did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Police officials did not say whether the other officers involved
were disciplined or transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Culbert, who was the commander of the 104th Precinct in the
Ridgewood section of Queens, was transferred to a night position in
the Strategic and Tactical Command, which is responsible for
policing northern Brooklyn. His demotion was reported in Saturday's
editions of The New York Daily News and The New York Post.

WRONG ANSWER TO THE BIG QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hockey's version of the worst team money could buy
ends its season in profound indifference at Madison Square Garden
Sunday afternoon, when the New York Rangers play host to the
Philadelphia Flyers on the final day of the National Hockey
League's regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers are going to the playoffs, perhaps as the top-seeded
team in the Eastern Conference. They have persevered even without
Eric Lindros, their former captain, who is suffering from yet
another of the concussions that threaten to end his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers? They are going home for the summer. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden and Cablevision were not the only ones who did not
get their money's worth for a payroll in excess of $61 million, the
highest in the history of the league. Neither did the Rangers'
ticket holders, not this season nor either of the last two, as the
Rangers failed to qualify for the postseason for three consecutive
seasons for the first time since some of the franchise's darkest
days in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who realistically took themselves out of the
playoff picture three weeks ago, were officially eliminated from
playoff contention last weekend. They ended up with a major
house-cleaning, instead. With four games remaining in the season,
Dave Checketts, president of the Garden, fired Rangers General
Manager Neil Smith and Coach John Muckler on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Rangers were looking back at Wayne Gretzky's
career and forward to an off-season spending spree. Then, over
seven underachieving, passionless, often agonizing months, the
Rangers provided an answer to this question: What difference does
$67 million worth of free-agent signings make?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Not very much.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive season, the Rangers will finish with a
losing record at home. They have been pushed around by bigger teams
for years. They have not made the playoffs since Mark Messier
headed west for Vancouver in the summer of 1997 after a messy
divorce from the organization that he willed to its first Stanley
Cup title in 54 years.
</P>
<P>
   With Checketts' blessing, Smith, in his 11th season as general
manager, gobbled up every major free agent on the market last
summer. Smith was hoping to build a stopgap between the present and
a future built around prospects like Manny Malhotra, Pavel Brendl
and Jamie Lundmark.
</P>
<P>
   What Smith wound up with, however, was something very different,
more like the New York Mets of the early 1990s: an expensive
rotisserie team that stopped dead in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the end of the 1992-93 season, when the Rangers lost
11 of their last 12 games, including the last seven, have the
Rangers stumbled this badly to the finish line. With one game
remaining in their season, the Rangers are 1-10-2 over their last
13 games. They are without a victory (0-7-1) in their last eight.
</P>
<P>
   As Rob DiMaio, whom the Rangers obtained just before the March
14 trading deadline, observed about his one-month stint with a team
bound for nowhere: ``There's no passion. There's no life. There's
no talking. There's no direction. I've never seen anything like it.
It's not hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   At least following the 1992-93 season, the Rangers went on to
win the Cup the next season. The foundation was already there,
however. In 1991-92, the Rangers had won the President's Trophy,
signifying the team with the league's best record. These current
Rangers have not had a winning season since Messier left.
</P>
<P>
   And they are built, as usual, around aging veterans, although
this season provided some bright spots for some younger players,
too. But the performances of Mike York, Jan Hlavac, Radek Dvorak
and Kim Johnsson were all too often dulled by the many failures of
the supposed stars: Theo Fleury, Valery Kamensky, Kevin Hatcher ...
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the changes start in the front office, as Checketts
heads a search for a new general manager. He hopes it will be
complete before the entry draft, which begins in Calgary on June
24. The new general manager will then pick the new coach. Both will
inherit a mess.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? What didn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of a lot of things,'' said Tim Taylor,
one of last summer's free-agent signings, who became something
close to the conscience of the club this season. ``But if everyone
had played to their potential, we wouldn't be in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Had any of the high-priced veterans even approached their normal
outputs of seasons past, there would never have been a full-scale
purge. They did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody getting used to each other and growing together,
that's something that took longer than a year as well,'' Taylor
said. ``We need to get a system that fits our team. You can't
pinpoint one thing. There are a couple of things that need to be
straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had been able to weather the 32 games they were
without their captain, Brian Leetch, who broke his right forearm on
Nov. 24. But once goaltender Mike Richter tore the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee during the All-Star skills
competition Feb. 5 _ the moment Muckler correctly termed the
season's turning point _ the Rangers' fortunes went into a
tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect metaphor for the season may have been Richter vainly
attempting to play the final two months on one good leg.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's worst fear was that he would be twinned with Muckler, if
and when the firings came. That is why Smith was believed to have
sought permission, without success, to have Muckler removed in
mid-November, a month and a half into a terrible season start.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's future was intertwined with Muckler's in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury, who has a measly 15 goals to show for a salary of
$8.5million this season, has acknowledged that the worst
performance of his career helped lead to the dual dismissals of
coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury said on the day of the firings: ``I don't think it's
entirely Muck's fault. I can take some of the blame. Obviously, I
haven't played as well as I wanted to. But in the end, it's always
the coach that takes the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the end, Muckler had obviously tired of Fleury's act.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his mind, he felt I wasn't working as hard as I could or
playing as well as I could,'' Fleury said, adding that part of the
problem might have stemmed from Muckler's thinking that Fleury was
still the same ``hell-bent for leather'' type of player he had been
in Calgary a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my role at that time was a lot different then what it is
now,'' Fleury said. ``We just didn't see eye to eye on how I'm
supposed to play and what his expectations of me were.''
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely the Rangers' problem this season: Almost all
their expectations went unfulfilled.

 &HT;    `Sassy Tree' composer lends Southern voice
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Like many folks, Carlisle Floyd confesses to a
love-hate relationship with the South. But he knows a rich,
melodramatic setting for opera when he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   The South has been the location for several works by the Latta,
S.C., native _ from Tennessee (``Susannah'') to South Carolina
(``The Passion of Jonathan Wade'') to Louisiana (``Willie Stark'').
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's newest opera, ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' is the
turn-of-the-century story of small-town life set in a North Georgia
town based on Commerce. Inspired by the 1984 novel by Atlanta
writer Olive Ann Burns, ``Cold Sassy Tree'' receives its world
premiere Friday at the Houston Grand Opera, which Floyd has been
associated with since 1976, when the college music professor moved
from Florida State University to the University of Houston. It's
being directed by filmmaker _ and opera enthusiast _ Bruce
Beresford (``Driving Miss Daisy'').
</P>
<P>
   The son of an itinerant Methodist minister, Floyd, 73, sat down
recently to discuss his Southern geography, and that of his operas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the South attracts the opera composer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The larger-than-life characters. The South tends to cherish
its eccentrics, and it has its own special kind of romance and
allure. And all of that was in the novel (``Cold Sassy Tree'').
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did ``Cold Sassy Tree'' come about?
</P>
<P>
   A: My sister, who lives in a little town called Holly Hills
(S.C.), gave it to me to read. I didn't know of its enormous
popularity, which I've since discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What attracted you to the material?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a curious book, such a mix of serious and comic, which
gave me a lot of trepidation. At first I thought, how can these
things co-exist side by side? And yet, that's the nature of
(Burns') work. It has very serious moments and then will turn
immediately very comic. I think that may be something pretty
specifically Southern, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The writing process took you home, didn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Writing the libretto, I felt like I had returned to my
childhood, in terms of hearing the language. (Burns) had an
incredible ear for dialogue. And that's something I think I'm
fairly skilled in recognizing. Her use of expressions, her
language, is absolutely stenographic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did adapting the book pose problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It's very episodic, like a series of vignettes rather
than anything narrative. The attractive thing was the vivid
characters. The locale, the color. That appealed to me very much.
My problem was to make some sort of dramatic narrative that can be
set to music.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was it like as a kid named Carlisle?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, my sister's name is Ermine, like the fur. You can
imagine as children growing up as Carlisle and Ermine. That's
pretty heavy; we wanted to be Betty Ann and Tom. But I quite like
Carlisle now.

 &HT;    Georgia faces possible boycott over state flag
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When former Gov. Zell Miller decided to take the lead
on changing Georgia's flag seven years ago, he ran into a
Legislature deeply divided and unwilling to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be practical _ there are not the votes in the
General Assembly right now to change the flag,'' Gov. Roy Barnes
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes promised only to ``continue to have dialogue'' over the
issue, but civil rights groups are pushing for more. They want
lawmakers to remove the Confederate battle emblem added to the
state flag during the height of the integration debates in 1956,
and they vow an economic boycott of the state next year if their
demands are ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That ultimatum by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
last week, and growing protests over the Confederate banner flying
atop the capitol in neighboring South Carolina, have made the flag
flap an unavoidable controversy for lawmakers next January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision this session to forego it and wait until
2001,'' said Rep. Calvin Smyre (D-Columbus), an African-American
lawmaker who chairs both the powerful House Rules Committee and
House Democratic Caucus. ``I don't know if we could put our finger
in the dike again and keep the dam from breaking.''
</P>
<P>
   But how state officials will handle the explosive issue _ so
volatile that it polarized the state and jeopardized the
re-election of the last governor to touch it _ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has refused so far to weigh in on the topic, even though
most political experts say he will have to take an active role if a
flag change occurs next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief and somewhat reluctant response to questions last
week, Barnes called the flag ``an important issue'' and discouraged
a boycott he said would punish African-American businesses as well
as the rest of the state. But he didn't comment on his role, and he
continued to focus on initiatives like his massive overhaul of the
education system as top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, though, top Democrats like Smyre and former
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, who favor changing the flag, seem to
be trying to cool the rhetoric to keep it from bubbling over into
the 2000 elections, when all 236 seats of the Legislature are up
for a vote. At the same time, they're talking about building a
coalition of business, political and civic leaders to lead and give
political cover to flag-changing efforts in the 2001 General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to figure out a way to avoid a confrontation,''
said Rep. Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta), a leader in the anti-flag
movement. He said leaders have suggested he could expect ``more
dialogue, more jelling of support'' after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, which represents pride in heritage for some, and an
intense legacy of racism and the Old South for others, is still a
touchy subject in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of newcomers without the sentimental attachment to
the banner could dilute the controversy in the metro Atlanta
suburbs. But talk of removing the Confederate emblem is still
enough to rally stiff opposition in some rural districts in North
and South Georgia, as Miller's 1993 push demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who is perhaps the most popular in Georgia's
history for his HOPE scholarship and pre-kindergarten programs,
narrowly made it back for a second term after initiating the flag
fight a year before the 1994 elections. Miller has said his
persistence on the issue wasted a lot of political capital and
probably made the flag more difficult for future lawmakers to
address.
</P>
<P>
   Those lessons aren't lost on legislators reluctant to reopen the
fight. During his bid for governor in 1998, Barnes said he didn't
favor resurrecting the issue. Even though African-Americans are one
of the strongest and most reliable voting blocks for Democrats, it
was three Republican lawmakers from the state's urban areas got the
most attention for advocating a new flag this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hot issue you don't win on,'' House Majority Leader
Larry Walker (D-Perry) said this week , explaining that most
lawmakers don't have a clear mandate from their districts _ not
even the No. 2 Democrat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on that,'' Walker said of his
position on the flag. ``I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.''
When may be the key question. Political experts differ on the
likely timing.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University political scientist Merle Black said 2001
offers perhaps the best opportunity for lawmakers to unfurl the
debate. Near the peak of his popularity, Barnes could leverage
substantial clout on the issue, with another year and legislative
session to buffer his re-election bid. And he may need to satisfy
black voters _ a key to his victory in 1998. ``The last thing he
wants is an open disagreement with black voters in Georgia,'' Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   But University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock
speculated that Democratic leaders will try to stave off a vote on
the flag for at least another couple of years, perhaps into Barnes'
second term, to keep from splintering their fragile alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum they want to get through redistricting'' in late
2001. Redrawing districts for Congress and the Legislature
determines the balance of power in the state. With a racially
divisive battle over the flag, ``the leadership,'' Bullock said
``could easily lose control of redistricting _ or maybe lose
control'' of the state.

THE OTHER ECONOMY: A CITY WHERE THE LIVING, AND THE LEAVING, IS
EASY

(Eds: This introductory note is publishable: Upstate New York, a
vast, diverse landscape of old cities, small towns, farms and
forests stretching from Buffalo to Albany and north to the Canadian
border, was once one of the most populous and prosperous regions of
the country. But the national economic boom that swept into New
York City and its suburbs passed it by. This is the first of an
occasional series on the region's quest for prosperity.) By LESLIE
EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ If this city wanted a ruefully honest bumper
sticker, it would read, ``Buffalo: Love It and Leave It.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan sums up the conundrum that is Buffalo, a city that
people say they love to live in and yet are leaving in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Once a bustling home to 1.1 million people, Erie County, which
includes Buffalo and its suburbs, now has 926,000 and is shrinking
fast. Last year alone, more than 10,000 people moved away, leading
to one of the steepest population drops of any county in the
nation, according to new federal census estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The departees are not retirees seeking the sun. They are young
and middle-age people seeking better jobs _ or any job at all. And
despite a burst of better economic news in Buffalo, the exodus
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been leaving for 10, 20, 30 years,'' said Anthony
M. Masiello, the city's mayor. ``We're not going to see a
significant reversal of that for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it now has fewer residents than Staten Island, Buffalo
remains New York's second largest city, which helps explain why the
presidential candidates have been much in evidence. So have Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani, the contenders for Senate.
Reigniting the economy is the biggest campaign issue upstate.
</P>
<P>
   But while politicians offer programs and policies, the reality
of Buffalo is not simply economic. It is historic, geographic,
demographic and psychological.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than in other parts of upstate New York that have also
lost residents, the shrinking of Buffalo seems to have seeped into
the city's soul and become part of its identity, as much as eating
spicy chicken wings and rooting for the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it in politics: The new county executive won an
upset victory with the campaign slogan ``Keep Our Kids.'' You see
it in home prices, which have scarcely budged in a decade. You see
it on the streets, built for heavier traffic (one of the joys of
Buffalo is being able to drive just about anywhere, including to
the airport, in less than 20 minutes). You see it in the local
sense of humor. One way to tell that you're from Buffalo, the joke
goes, is that half of your friends moved to Charlotte, N.C., and
the other half went to Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   And you can see it at Erie Community College's Williamsville
campus northeast of Buffalo. There, for years, a criminal justice
program has trained officers for local police departments and the
New York State Police. Now, it sends graduates to Virginia, Georgia
and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, it's good and it's sad,'' said Timothy J. Dwan, a local
judge who teaches at Erie. ``Our kids are getting darn good jobs,
but it's sad the South is plucking all the talent from the
Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pied Piper of Erie County may well be Rick Veit, the
employment manager for the government of Gwinnett County, Ga., just
north of Atlanta. Gwinnett is one of the fastest-growing counties
in the nation. This year, Veit needs to hire 30 to 50 police
officers, no easy task when unemployment is 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Veit grew up in Erie County, and a couple of years ago, he
got the bright idea of going home to recruit. He has hired 41
officers from western New York, 11 from Erie Community College
alone, and visited the college again last month to screen more than
200 potential recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Edward Smith, 29, who qualifies as a walking
piece of Buffalo history: He works at a grain elevator, as his
father and grandfather did. But the elevators, which were invented
in Buffalo in the 1840s, are now mostly abandoned, and there is
little to do at the few that remain. ``We drink a lot of coffee,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Jeff DeLair personifies a current trend in Buffalo _
underemployment, in which people take jobs for which they are
overqualified. Almost 127,000 workers in Buffalo have jobs but want
better ones, according to a recent study. The jobless rate in Erie
County is 6 percent, the highest of any major metropolitan area in
the United States (the national average is 4.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems tough to get a job up here,'' said DeLair, 25, who
has a bachelor's degree in criminal justice but works for a soda
distributor. ``The economy and the population; everybody's moving
south.''

</P>
<P>
   People have been leaving New York City, too, but immigrants from
overseas have more than made up for the loss. Buffalo once was a
city of immigrants _ from Italy, Germany, Ireland, Poland _ but no
more.
</P>
<P>
   That means fewer workers. ``The shrinkage in the labor force can
create further pressures in terms of labor shortages,'' said
Richard Deitz, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   So despite today's relatively high unemployment rate, companies
have to worry about finding enough workers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   That is definitely on the mind of Kevin J. Clarke, vice
president and general manager of Quebecor Printing Buffalo, which
embodies both the hope and the risk in Erie County today. Hope,
because business is booming at the printing plant, which is so big
that managers get around on bicycles. Presses the size of small
buildings run day and night, churning out paperback best sellers,
travel guides, even the drugstore coupon books that tumble out of
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecor is one of several large manufacturers around Buffalo
with expansion plans, which for Clarke means hiring at least 300
people in the next two or three years. That is where the risk comes
in.
</P>
<P>
   Where is he going to find them?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at our work force, who they are, how old they
are, how many will leave and retire, and how to replace them,''
Clarke said. ``In eight years, there's a very, very frightening
amount of skilled workers we're going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked about his recruiting plans, Clarke raved about the
pleasures of living in Buffalo: good schools, affordable housing,
short drives to and from work. He can say these things, he
explained, because he is from Long Island. ``People who are local,
all they see is what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be really something. At the turn of the 19th century,
Buffalo was the site of the Pan-American Exposition (where
President William McKinley was assassinated). Its steel mills once
lined Lake Erie. Grain elevators clustered along the Buffalo River.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright designed the first air-conditioned office
building here, as well as several homes; Louis Sullivan built an
early skyscraper, and McKim, Mead &AMP; White contributed mansions
along Delaware Avenue. City Hall is an Art Deco extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the beautiful buildings are still here, but the
prosperity that paid for them is gone. Development of the St.
Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s ended Buffalo's reign as a
transportation hub. In the 1970s, the steel mills began to close.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo still makes auto parts, but it is more than its economy
that makes the city part of the Rust Belt. Geographically closer to
Cleveland than to Queens, Buffalo looks like the Midwest, from the
huge bowl of sky over the flat country to the gravy that comes on a
turkey sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the niceness. To a degree few downstaters
understand, people really like living in Buffalo, which they say
has the advantages of a big city but feels like a small town.
Though parts of Erie County resemble Westchester County, ``you
don't have to be a big shot to have a house like the Clintons',''
said Daniel J. Ryan, director of career planning for the University
of Buffalo. ``And you know about the 6 degrees of separation? In
Buffalo, it's 2 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe the population problem will solve itself.
``Sure as day follows night, if jobs grow, the population will
grow,'' said Stephen Kagann, chief economist to Gov. George Pataki.
Last year, private-sector jobs in Buffalo increased by 1.8 percent,
he noted, less than the national average, but more than in the
previous three years put together.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffalo has clearly been slower than some of its Midwestern
counterparts to cope with the decline of its basic industries and
population.
</P>
<P>
   The area's advantages _ including that huge pool of
underemployed people _ ``have never been marketed to the outside
world,'' said Dennis Donovan of the Wadley-Donovan Group, which
advises companies on where to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Government is commonly seen as a culprit. Infighting among local
politicians is legendary; Joel Giambra, a Republican who is the new
county executive, has made waves simply because he is on speaking
terms with Masiello, the mayor, who is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Giambra insists that the area's reputation as a snow magnet is
not the source of its population problem. He blames high taxes. So
do upstate residents in a new survey done by Harris Interactive for
M&AMP;T Bank, based in Buffalo. The survey found that 20 percent of
upstate residents planned to leave in the next five years, about
twice the average for other regions. Escaping high taxes was cited
even more often than the desire for better jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine found that
Buffalo residents were the most highly taxed of any citizens in the
nation. New York's combined state and local tax burden is the
second highest in the country, after Hawaii's. High taxes also
contribute to the region's high electricity prices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But taxes are not the whole story, said George Palumbo, a
professor of economics at Canisius College in Buffalo. After all,
he said, New York City and its thriving suburbs have high taxes,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Another serious problem, in his view, is that the area's jobs
pay very low wages compared with similar jobs elsewhere. For
example, workers in finance-related jobs in Buffalo make 35 percent
less than the national average, Palumbo said; those in New York
City, of course, make far more. One possible explanation, he said,
is that ``a lot of back-office jobs have moved to Western New York
that don't pay a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But some jobs Buffalo pay at least $50,000 a year _ and at least
225 are vacant. They are listed on an Internet site _
buffaloworks.net.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which has led to a couple of job placements since it
was set up in January, is sponsored by the New Millennium Group, a
volunteer organization that seems devoted to making Buffalo
residents buck up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it with the psychic malaise?'' asked Douglas W.
Dimitroff, a lawyer who is one of the group's founders. Dimitroff,
who worked in New York City before his first child was born, said
that maybe you had to leave the city to appreciate it. ``Folks who
think the grass is greener somewhere else probably should go
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Kucharski did _ and ended up in Pennsylvania's Lehigh
Valley, the steel-making region that once seemed as downhearted as
Buffalo does today. As president of the Lehigh Valley Economic
Development Corp., Kucharski was involved in the area's successful
efforts to lure businesses from other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hopes to work the same magic in his hometown. Kucharski
was recently named president of the Buffalo Niagara Enterprise,
which has a multimillion-dollar budget contributed by local
governments and businesses. He has moved in ``a couple of blocks
from Mom,'' he said (and worries about gaining weight from eating
her home-cooked dinners).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious challenges of selling Buffalo to people who
have seen it only snowed under on the TV news, Kucharski says he is
optimistic. As a local saying goes, he said, ``The second hardest
thing is to move to Buffalo. The first hardest thing is to leave.''

HOW THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: See also RAMPAGE-KILLERS and RAMPAGE-KILLERS-SCHOOL) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times set out to study rampage killings by
assembling a detailed database of as many such crimes as could be
discovered by searching news clippings in all 50 states, scientific
papers and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Times researchers and reporters found 100 cases that met
strictly defined criteria aimed at encompassing the kind of crimes
that seem to have become more common recently. The crimes had to
have had multiple victims, at least one of whom died, and to have
occurred substantially at one time and in a place where people
gather _ a workplace, a school, a mall, a restaurant, a train.
Multiple killings that were a result of domestic strife, robbery or
political terrorism were excluded, as were serial killings.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and researchers reviewed newspaper articles and court
transcripts, and interviewed prosecutors, victims, families and,
when possible, the killers. Reporters recorded into a database more
than 90 separate pieces of information on each crime, including
age, mental health histories, victim relationships, weapons used,
warning signs, location, time of day and criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Fessenden, a database reporter at The Times, coordinated
the research.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 cases include 20 shootings at schools, 11 at restaurants
or shopping malls and 32 at the killer's workplace. There were 102
killers; 425 people were killed and 510 injured.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it was difficult to get precise information, as
news accounts and even police reports varied. And while extensive
efforts were made to be as complete as possible, there is no
central list of multiple murders, and the database does not include
every attack of this type over the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experts acknowledged it to be the largest and most
detailed database devoted exclusively to such murders in the United
States, and suggested it should be considered an initial step in a
systematic study of a largely unexamined field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be seen as a way of starting the conversation and
getting good social science going,'' said Franklin Zimring,
director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not science and shouldn't be addressed as science,'' said
Alfred Blumstein, director of the National Consortium on Violence
Research, who was shown The Times' findings. ``But I think it's
aggressive and careful.''

<P>
   They are not drunk or high on drugs. They are not racists or
Satanists, or addicted to violent video games, movies or music.
</P>
<P>
   Most are white men, but a surprising number are women, Asians
and blacks. Many have college degrees, but most are unemployed.
Many are military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what
they plan to do. They carry semiautomatic weapons they have
obtained easily and, in most cases, legally.
</P>
<P>
   They do not try to get away. In the end, half turn their guns on
themselves or are shot dead by others. They not only want to kill,
they also want to die.
</P>
<P>
   That is the profile of the 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks
examined by The New York Times in a computer-assisted study looking
back more than 50 years and including the shootings in 1999 at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and one by a World War
II veteran on a residential street in Camden, N.J., in 1949. Four
hundred twenty-five people were killed and 510 people were injured
in the attacks. The database, which primarily focused on cases in
the last decade, is believed to be the largest ever compiled on
this phenomenon in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though the attacks are rare when compared with other American
murders, they have provoked an intense national discussion about
crime, education and American culture. The Times found, however,
that the debate may have largely overlooked a critical issue: At
least half of the killers showed signs of serious mental health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was most intense last year, which began with echoes
of gunfire in a Salt Lake City television station in January and
ended with seven Honolulu office workers dead in November. In
between there was a berserk rampage by an Atlanta day trader that
left 12 dead and 13 injured. A self-styled fascist attacked a Los
Angeles day care center. Seven people died as a hymn ended in a
Fort Worth church.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most shocking were the shootings by two students at
Columbine High School who burst into suburban classrooms and killed
13 and wounded 23. The teen-age killers were much like the adults
The Times studied, but with important distinctions that may bring a
better understanding to the problem. As the anniversary of that
crime, April 20, approaches, the questions about crime and culture
will inevitably reverberate again.
</P>
<P>
   The Times set out to examine as many of these killings as
possible in an effort to learn what factors they and the people who
carried them out shared. For while many possible causes have been
cited, including violent video games, a decline in moral values and
the easy availability of guns, there has been little serious study
of this explosive violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Times included only rampage homicides _ multiple-victim
killings that were not primarily domestic or connected to a robbery
or gang. Serial killers were not included, nor were those whose
primary motives were political.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ While the killings have caused many people to point to the
violent aspects of the culture, a closer look shows little evidence
that video games, movies or television encouraged many of the
attacks. In only six of the 100 cases did the killers have a known
interest in violent video games. Seven other killers showed an
interest in violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a decade that had a sharp decrease in almost all kinds of
homicides, the incidence of these rampage killings appears to have
increased, according to a separate computer analysis by The Times
of nearly 25 years of homicide data from the FBI. Still, these
killings remain extremely rare, much less than 1 percent of all
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Society has turned to law enforcement to resolve the rampage
killings that have become almost a staple of the nightly news.
There has been an increasing call for greater security in schools
and in the workplace. But a closer look shows that these cases may
have more to do with society's lack of knowledge of mental health
issues, rather than a lack of security. In case after case, family
members, teachers and mental health professionals missed or
dismissed signs of deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they happen in a school, in a mall, in a crowded train
or in a workplace, these crimes have been characterized in a
language of incomprehension _ ``senseless,'' ``random,''
``sudden,'' ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, murder in the heat of domestic passion or a tavern
argument, in the desperation of armed robbery or in the cold
calculation of gang competition, seems to make ``sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reviewing court records and interviewing police, victims
and sometimes the killers themselves, The Times found that these
killings, too, have their own logic, and are anything but random or
sudden.
</P>
<P>
   The rage that boiled over into homicide was clearly building in
many. Of the 100 cases reviewed by The Times, 63 involved people
who made threats of violence before the event, including 54 who
threatened specific violence to specific people.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farley, for example, who was fired in 1987 for harassing
a female co-worker, told acquaintances he was going to kill the
people who had come between him and her before storming into his
former workplace, killing seven. James Calvin Brady told
psychiatrists he wanted to kill people, just days before he went on
a rampage in an Atlanta shopping mall in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not impulsive acts,'' said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic
psychologist at the University of California at San Diego. ``They
are not acts of affective violence, where they drink a lot and go
kill someone. There's a planning and purpose, and an emotional
detachment that's very long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was often a precipitating event in addition to
histories of failure and mental illness _ a spark that set off the
tinder, and gave the crime the appearance of being at the same time
deliberate and impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see someone who is morbidly depressed for a long time,
and they have a suicide plan in place, but the timing is determined
by impulse,'' said Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry
at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and author of ``Night Falls
Fast: Understanding Suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By far the most common precipitator was the loss of a job, which
was mentioned as a potential precipitator in 47 cases. A romantic
issue _ a divorce or breakup _ was present in 22 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men see the loss of a job, or the loss of a mate, as
irrevocable and catastrophic, something they can't get back or
attain again,'' said David Buss, author of ``The Dangerous Passion:
Why Jealousy Is as Necessary as Love and Sex'' and a professor of
psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. ``They set out on
a course to inflict the maximum cost on their rivals, even
sometimes killing the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the database found several recurring elements in
rampage killings, including some that surprised the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the aspect that most set these crimes apart, aside from
their spectacular nature, was this: Regular criminals try to get
away with their crimes. More than a third of regular homicides went
unsolved in 1997. But among the 102 killers in the Times database,
not one got away. Eighty-nine never even left the scene of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, for example, after he killed three people at the Ohio
trucking company where he had worked, Gerald Lee Clemons walked to
the parking lot and leaned against his car calmly until the police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Michael Carneal, 14, killed three and wounded five at a
school in Louisville, Ky. Then he laid down his gun and said, ``I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, 33 of the offenders killed themselves after
their crimes. Nine tried or wanted to commit suicide, and four
killed themselves later. Nine were killed by the police or others,
perhaps committing what some refer to as ``suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people knowingly getting killed is striking,''
Alfred Blumstein of the Heinz School of Public Policy and
Management at Carnegie Mellon University said after examining the
review. Blumstein is the director of the National Consortium on
Violence Research.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison said: ``The link between suicide and homicide is a very
real one, and it hasn't been studied nearly enough. It has always
struck me about Columbine, people forget they committed suicide.
And that's understandable _ it was the least important thing from
the public point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Barbaro, a 17-year-old Regents scholar in upstate Olean,
N.Y., offered a glimpse into this suicidal impulse in the note he
left before he hanged himself with a knotted bedsheet in the county
jail. He was awaiting trial after firing random shots out the
window from the third floor of his high school, killing two
passers-by and a school custodian, and wounding nine others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just wanted to kill the person I hate most _
myself,'' he wrote. ``I just didn't have the courage. I wanted to
die, but I couldn't do it, so I had to get someone to do it for me.
It didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable insights to emerge from the survey is
how much these killers differ from the typical American murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all murderers in this country are black. Eighty percent
went to high school, and no further. Most of them killed someone
they knew, or while committing another crime, like a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers, on the other hand, were white, by far; 18
of the 102 were black, and seven Asian. The racial profile of the
rampage killers is close to that of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers were overwhelmingly male _ but not entirely.
Six were female, and they exhibited many of the same disturbed,
aggressive characteristics. Here again, however, was a distinction
from regular murderers, who are about twice as likely as rampage
killers to be women.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage killers were far more likely to have military
backgrounds, and to kill strangers. There are intriguing age
differences as well. The rampage killers were older than regular
murderers, with more in their 40s and 50s and fewer in their 20s,
compared with the typical killer.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rampage killers over 25, a third had college degrees.
Another third had some college education. Only nine had less than a
high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   And there seemed to be no urban bias for these crimes, as there
is for other violent crimes; 31 were in suburban areas, 25 were in
small towns or rural areas. Forty-two committed their crimes in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   That profile _ a group that is largely suicidal, and shows few
of the demographic patterns of poverty and race associated with
regular crime _ suggests that mental illness plays a huge role,
psychiatrists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental illness does not vary in different races, but
socioeconomics do,'' said Lothar Adler, director of a psychiatric
hospital in Muhlhausen, Germany, and author of ``Amok,'' a book on
multiple murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Times found much evidence of mental illness in its subjects.
More than half had histories of serious mental health problems _
either a hospitalization, a prescription for psychiatric drugs, a
suicide attempt or evidence of psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 24 who had been prescribed psychiatric drugs, 14 had
stopped taking them. Clemons, for instance, ran out of drugs a week
before his crime, according to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have shown that the mentally ill are no more
violent than other people, except when they are off their
medications, or have been abusing drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Indications of mental illness were far more common among the 100
cases than was evidence supporting popular explanations that
emerged in the days after some of these spectacular events. Violent
video games or television were mentioned in only a handful of
cases. Three killers showed an interest in the occult. Racist ideas
were apparent in the backgrounds of 16.
</P>
<P>
   But 48 killers had some kind of formal diagnosis, often
schizophrenia. Some of the diagnoses came after examinations by
psychiatrists in trial preparations _ which did not usually help in
their defense, as only eight avoided conviction on grounds of
insanity. Twenty-five killers received diagnoses before their
crimes, which illustrates another recurring issue: They do not just
suddenly snap. Many have long histories not only of mental illness
but of failure and dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of their education levels, for instance, a striking
number _ more than half _ were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high education level is one thing I hadn't anticipated,
and the link to unemployment is another thing I didn't realize,''
Blumstein said. ``One of the things that education does is raise
expectations, and raised ones are more readily frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For people without the emotional resources to accommodate it,
frustration ``can lead to rage, can lead to suicide,'' Blumstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   These crimes are not new. Public rampage killings first entered
the national consciousness with Charles Whitman, who stood on the
University of Texas' tower in 1966, firing his rifle at students,
killing 14 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they peculiarly American. The best scientific thinking,
in a field that is admittedly understudied, now holds that
multiple, public murder occurs at a fairly constant level across
time and cultures. What some people call ``running amok,'' a term
first used in Malaysia to describe frenzied, indiscriminate
killing, has been observed in many cultures, with weapons as varied
as grenades and tanks in addition to high-powered handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though homicide rates and suicide rates are very
different from country to country,'' said Peter M. Marzuk, a
professor in the department of psychiatry at the Weill Medical
College of Cornell University, ``the rates of murder-suicide are
really the same throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a strong impression that they have become more
common. In an effort to confirm the trend, The Times analyzed FBI
reports of all homicides since 1976. Each year there were 15,000 to
22,000 homicides, but very few involved three or more victims.
</P>
<P>
   That universe shrank even more, to just a few dozen, when The
Times weeded out those involving robbery or gang violence, and
those in which the primary victim was a family member.
</P>
<P>
   What is left is the closest thing there is to a census of
rampage killings _ about one-tenth of one percent of all killings.
</P>
<P>
   And it shows that in the 1990s, they increased.
</P>
<P>
   Their number remained fairly consistent from 1976 to 1989,
averaging about 23 a year, only once going above 30. But between
1990 and 1997, the last year for which data was available, the
number averaged over 34, dipping below 30 only once, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s, for some reason, it increased, and seems to
have a different level since,'' said Steven Messner, a
criminologist at the State University of New York at Albany, who
reviewed the numbers at the request of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   There are many possible explanations. But the shift coincides,
roughly at least, with a trend of increasing availability of more
lethal weapons. In the late 1980s, the production of semiautomatic
pistols in the United States overtook the production of revolvers,
and with their larger ammunition magazines and faster reloading,
semiautomatics have added to the potential for mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   The effect may be apparent in the number of deaths per murderous
incident, which suddenly increased in 1993 and has remained high
since, according to the analysis of FBI data by The Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have drastically increased the ability to inflict death
and injury,'' said Tom Diaz, author of ``Making a Killing'' and a
senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center. ``That means
you can shoot more rounds faster and easier, what they call spray
and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Times study, wielders of semiautomatics inflicted more
injuries. The ratio of maimed to killed victims was 50 percent
higher than for those who used other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the increased availability of high-powered weapons may not
explain everything. Some kinds of multiple murder have declined or
remained static. Killings of three or more people to cover up
another felony, like robbery, have not increased, for example.
Neither have multiple killings of relatives. The number of
incidents in which three or more died and the principal victim was
a family member has remained fairly steady, around 30 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the most common type of this violence was in the
family,'' said James Alan Fox, author of ``Overkill'' and one of
the nation's foremost experts on mass murder. ``Now it's no longer
true. It's in the workplace and in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the crimes may be feeding on one another,
particularly in an era of saturation coverage by cable television.
Fourteen of the killers expressed knowledge about their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ladislav Antalik, a Czech immigrant who killed two
former co-workers and then himself after being fired from his job
in Research Triangle Park, N.C., in 1994, had a newspaper article
in his car describing a previous massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine killers talked of doing it bigger and better than
it had been done before. William Kreutzer, known as Crazy Kreutzer,
as he set out to mow down a company of soldiers at Fort Bragg with
an assault rifle and a semiautomatic pistol, told a friend he knew
what the record number of multiple killings was.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the question of whether one event brought on the
next, experts say the recent increases in these crimes strongly
suggest a social contagion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you get a lot of people doing the same thing?'' said
Joseph Westermeyer, a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota
who has studied epidemics of explosive murder in other cultures.
``I think there is this copycat element.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler, in his book, documented two cases of soldiers' running
amok with a tank in Germany in the 1980s after a widely publicized
tank attack there. Army security was increased, and ``tank amok
never happened in Germany again,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   An angry, depressed, unstable, perhaps mentally ill person picks
up a gun because it has become a known alternative. ``Something
that was inconceivable to many people suddenly becomes
conceivable,'' Messner said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke University,
who has studied social contagions, said, ``The transmission
mechanism seems to be nothing more or less than that it's an idea
that's in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have these kind of catastrophic consequences from what
seems a minor change in the environment.''

   They are not drunk or high on drugs. They are not racists or
Satanists, or addicted to violent video games, movies or music.
</P>
<P>
   Most are white men, but a surprising number are women, Asians
and blacks. Many have college degrees, but most are unemployed.
Many are military veterans.
</P>
<P>
   They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what
they plan to do. They carry semiautomatic weapons they have
obtained easily and, in most cases, legally.
</P>
<P>
   They do not try to get away. In the end, half turn their guns on
themselves or are shot dead by others. They not only want to kill,
they also want to die.
</P>
<P>
   That is the profile of the 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks
examined by The New York Times in a computer-assisted study looking
back more than 50 years and including the shootings in 1999 at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Four hundred twenty-five
people were killed and 510 people were injured in the attacks. The
database, which primarily focused on cases in the last decade, is
believed to be the largest ever compiled on this phenomenon in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though the attacks are rare when compared with other American
murders, they have provoked an intense national discussion about
crime, education and American culture. The Times found, however,
that the debate may have largely overlooked a critical issue: At
least half of the killers showed signs of serious mental health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was most intense last year, which began with echoes
of gunfire in a Salt Lake City television station in January and
ended with seven Honolulu office workers dead in November. In
between there was a berserk rampage by an Atlanta day trader that
left 12 dead and 13 injured. A self-styled fascist attacked a Los
Angeles day care center. Seven people died as a hymn ended in a
Fort Worth church.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most shocking were the shootings by two Columbine
High students who burst into classrooms and killed 13 and wounded
23.
 &UR;  &LR; While many possible causes have been cited, including violent
video games, a decline in moral values and the easy availability of
guns, there has been little serious study of this explosive
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis included only rampage homicides _
multiple-victim killings that were not primarily domestic or
connected to a robbery or gang. Serial killers were not included.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ While the killings have caused many people to point to violent
aspects of culture, there is little evidence that video games,
movies or television encouraged many attacks. In only six of the
100 cases did the killers have a known interest in violent video
games. Seven others were interested in violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a decade that had a sharp decrease in homicides, the
incidence of rampage killings appears to have increased, FBI data
show. Still, these killings remain extremely rare, much less than 1
percent of all homicides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Society has turned to law enforcement to resolve the rampage
killings. But the analysis shows that these cases may have more to
do with society's lack of knowledge of mental health issues than a
lack of security.
</P>
<P>
   The rage that boiled over into homicide was clearly building in
many. Of the cases reviewed, 63 involved people threatened violence
before the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not impulsive acts,'' said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic
psychologist at the University of California at San Diego. ``They
are not acts of affective violence, where they drink a lot and go
kill someone. There's a planning and purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was often a precipitating event _ a spark that set off
the tinder, and gave the crime the appearance of being at the same
time deliberate and impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most common precipitator was the loss of a job, which
was mentioned as a potential cause in 47 cases. A romantic issue _
a divorce or breakup _ was present in 22 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men see the loss of a job, or the loss of a mate, as
irrevocable and catastrophic,'' said David Buss, author of ``The
Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is as Necessary as Love and Sex''
and a psychology professor at the University of Texas. ``They set
out on a course to inflict the maximum cost on their rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recurring element were found, including some that
surprised the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Regular criminals try to get away. More than a third
of regular homicides went unsolved in 1997. But among the 102
killers in the Times database, not one got away. Eighty-nine never
even left the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three offenders killed themselves after their crimes.
Nine tried or wanted to, and four killed themselves later. Nine
were killed by the police or others, perhaps committing what some
call ``suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The link between suicide and homicide is a very real one, and
it hasn't been studied nearly enough,'' said Kay Redfield Jamison,
a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and
author of ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampage killers also differ by demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all murderers in this country are black. Eighty percent
went to high school, and no further. Most of them killed someone
they knew, or while committing another crime.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage killers were white, by far, though 18 of the 102 were
black, and seven Asian. The racial profile of the rampage killers
is close to that of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
   And rampage killers were far more likely to have military
backgrounds, and to kill strangers. And, rampage killers were older
than regular murderers, with more in their 40s and 50s and fewer in
their 20s, compared with the typical killer.
</P>
<P>
   Of rampage killers over 25, a third had college degrees. Another
third had some college education. Only nine had less than a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   And there seemed to be no urban bias for these crimes, as there
is for other violent crimes; 31 were in suburban areas, 25 were in
small towns or rural areas. Forty-two committed their crimes in
urban areas.

 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most us have witnessed things that we would be better
off never having seen. The writer Susan Sontag applies this
distinction to the Holocaust photographs she stumbled upon in a
bookstore at the age of 12 in 1945, years before she could
conceptualize what the Holocaust even was. Writing of the
experience in her landmark book ``On Photography,'' Sontag recalled
that when she looked at those photographs ``Some limit had been
reached and not only that of horror ... something  &UR; in me  &LR; went
dead; something is still crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern era takes it on faith that images of suffering
stimulate sensitivity to that suffering. But Sontag argues that
little good comes of viewing photographic horrors that you can
barely imagine and have no power to relieve. A few photographs
retain their power to shock, becoming moral reference points, she
writes. But in general, repeated exposure to photographed horror
inures us to that horror, leading us to view even the most
grotesque images as ``just pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   This warning came immediately to mind recently as I toured the
New-York Historical Society's exhibition ``Without Sanctuary:
Lynching Photography in America,'' which opened last month and runs
through July 9. The photographs mainly depict black men with
hideously elongated necks, swinging sometimes in threes and fours
at the end of ropes tied to light poles, trees or gallows.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frightening pictures shows hundreds of
well-dressed men in a field, pressing forward for a better view of
a naked black man who has just been hanged and is now being
mutilated and burned on a pyre.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 12-year-old Susan Sontag in that bookstore, I reached
my ``limit'' quickly and left the room. I returned briefly to take
some notes and was on my way, never to return. There is an
unbearable measure of horror here that I have no interest in
learning to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Lynching scholars tell us that the scenes in this exhibition
were repeated thousands of times _ often before the entire
citizenry of a given town _ and were common throughout much of the
country until the 1940s. These ``lynching bees'' or ``Negro
barbecues'' were often cast as carnivals, to which the residents of
nearby towns brought picnic baskets and their children _ some of
whom are shown in these photographs posed and smiling next to
disfigured black corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures in this show were mainly postcards that
commemorated the ``entertainment'' and were sent regularly through
the mail until it became illegal to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened under the name ``Witness'' this winter at a
small gallery in Manhattan, and consisted mainly of photographs
without explanation, mounted on the gallery walls. The Historical
Society's version of the show includes lengthy descriptive captions
and an added section on the figures in the anti-lynching movement
who eventually brought this horror to an end, among them James
Weldon Johnson, W.E.B. Du Bois and the heroine of the movement, Ida
Wells-Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this new section of the exhibition, I was reminded
that Wells-Barnett was sparing in her use of pictures or even
illustrations, understanding that likenesses of these events were a
form of brutality in themselves. Her first three works on lynching
_ ``Southern Horrors,'' ``A Red Record'' and ``Mob Rule in New
Orleans'' _ relied for their power on forensic descriptions of the
burnings and lynchings and shared only a single photograph among
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta collector James Allen, who found these photographs,
had hoped that they would provoke a discussion on the public nature
of racial brutality in the early 20th century and the role that era
played in shaping the racial attitudes of today.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Allen had hoped for a probing inquiry into the
nature of what he calls ``community violence,'' which leads to the
blood lust shown in the pictures. The written material that was
added to ``Without Sanctuary'' has given the exhibition some depth,
but not enough to produce the thoughtful meditation Allen had
wished for.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as he told me recently, ``White people feel guilty and
reticent; black people look at these pictures and just get angry.''
Having worked with these pictures for years, Allen is less
susceptible to their horror and was surprised when I told him that
I could not bear seeing them.
</P>
<P>
   A sober inquiry into racial violence has failed to materialize
not just in the galleries, but in much of the news coverage as
well. Some people were upset when news magazines reprinted the
photographs with too little historical context _ essentially
repeating the acts of those who took and distributed the pictures
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Allen had hoped to sensitize us to long-buried horrors of
America's racial past. But by choosing to do this through
photographs, he chose the most unwieldy method of all. With these
horrendous pictures loose in the culture, the ultimate effect could
easily be to normalize images that are in fact horrible.

ANALYSIS SHOWS RACIAL BIAS IN LENDING, SENATOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new study of nearly 240,000 home loan applications
from 1998 in New York City concludes that conventional banks have
largely ignored black neighborhoods, even those with above-average
incomes, creating a vacuum that has been filled by high-cost and
often abusive lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was done by the staff of Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., who called the results the best evidence yet of racial
discrimination in loan decisions by banks and so-called subprime
lenders that charge high fees and interest for home equity loans to
borrowers with limited access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   During the year that was studied, banks denied loan applications
from blacks at nearly twice the rate for whites, even when they had
the same income, the study found. The rejection rates were 21.6
percent for blacks and 11.4 percent for whites. Even blacks with
incomes above $60,000 were rejected more often than whites with
incomes under $40,000, with 20 percent of the blacks turned down
compared with 17 percent of the whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever in the mortgage world a tale of two cities,
this is it,'' Schumer said. ``As far as New York's lending
institutions are concerned, blacks and whites may as well be living
on different planets. The disparity is shocking, and nothing good
explains the difference. The obvious answer is race.''
</P>
<P>
   While banks made most of their loans in New York City's white
neighborhoods, lenders catering to the subprime market dominated in
black areas, providing 55 percent of the home loans there but only
9 percent of the loans in white areas. The number of subprime loans
had tripled citywide and risen sevenfold in black neighborhoods
during the five years leading up to 1998, the most recent year for
which data was available to be studied. In the same period,
conventional bank loans in the city rose just 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Critics label many subprime lenders as ``predatory.'' Government
officials and consumer groups accuse them of using deceptive
practices and imposing exorbitant costs that force countless
victims into bankruptcy and foreclosure. The state's largest home
equity lender, Delta Financial Corp. of Woodbury, recently settled
state and federal lawsuits over its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the citywide trends, the study also found stark racial
disparities in lending in neighborhood comparisons that paired six
mostly white areas with six mostly black areas of similar income in
the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the black upper-middle-class community of East
Flatbush, which has an average income of $60,010, banks rejected 25
percent of loan applications, and subprime lenders cornered 54
percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But in a white neighborhood, Sheepshead Bay, with an average
income of $58,230, banks denied only 8 percent of the applications,
and subprime lenders did only 20 percent of the loan business
there.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, Schumer said, is for banks to make more loans to
blacks and for the government to crack down on subprime loans that
cheat homeowners. He said he would introduce legislation that would
ban many abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the banking industry were reluctant to
comment on the study, saying they had not had a chance to see it.
The president of the New York State Bankers Association, Michael P.
Smith, said that banks opposed discrimination and lending abuses
and that most banks had won outstanding ratings from state and
federal regulators for their reinvestment in minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   In past debates, defenders of lending practices have said that
other factors might explain racial disparities. Black and white
applicants with the same income may have different employment
histories, credit histories and savings for down payments, for
example. ``You have to look at the underwriting criteria,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the vice president of the Community Bankers
Association of New York State, Gary R. Brody, said, ``It's
difficult to make judgments based on raw data.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer's staff said that such explanations could not
account for all of the disparity and the consistent patterns they
found. Their study was based on census data on race and income, and
on income and racial statistics that lenders reported to the
federal government on 239,502 mortgage and refinancing applications
made in 1998. Of those, 132,293 resulted in loans, 40,856 were
denied and 66,353 were withdrawn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Consumer advocates who have attacked lending practices praised
Schumer's study and his proposals. ``It validates what we've been
saying for some time,'' said Josh Zinner, who coordinates
foreclosure prevention efforts for the elderly for South Brooklyn
Legal Services.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's proposed Predatory Lending Deterrence Act would
require impartial credit counseling for borrowers and redefine
high-cost loans as those with an interest rate eight points above
the treasury rate (compared with 10 points now) or with points and
fees exceeding 4 percent of the total loan (compared with 8 percent
now). It would also bar penalties for prepaying a loan, refinancing
that fails to benefit borrowers, the financing of points and fees,
excessive balloon payments and lenders' demands for early payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is that predatory lenders would never be able to
get a foot in the door if traditional banks made loans in minority
neighborhoods,'' Schumer said. ``Even in prosperous black
neighborhoods, money is sucked out of the community that could be
used for other things. There are so many sad tales of people who
have worked hard their whole lives and bought homes, but because
their lenders are predatory, have lost everything.''

 &HT;    Freaknik evolves into a non-event
 &HT;    By Rochelle Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By all indications, this year's Black College Spring
Break, aka Freaknik, will be a non-event. And other cities are
benefiting from the demise of the gathering, which once brought
hundreds of thousands of rowdy college students to Atlanta every
third weekend in April.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competing event _ Kappa Fest 2000 in Galveston,
Texas _ will be held during what has traditionally been the weekend
that Freaknik reigned. Another is going on this weekend on the
Mississippi coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently what's driving the party goers away has been
Atlanta's clampdown in recent years on the cruising, lewd behavior,
and public drunkenness that have characterized the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The fall-off was particularly apparent last year, when Atlanta
police, often outnumbering the revelers, made a show of enforcing a
no-tolerance policy. They instantly arrested anyone who, for
instance, caused a traffic tie-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, there were police officers everywhere,'' Elizabeth
Jackson, 19, a junior at North Carolina Central University in
Durham, said of her first and last Freaknik in 1998. ``When you see
that, you think they are just waiting for us to get out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson went to the Black College Reunion in Daytona Beach,
Fla., last weekend and planned to go to Black Entertainment
Television College Day at Paramount's Kings Dominion amusement park
near Richmond, Va., Saturday instead of coming to Freaknik again.
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik was ``a little too much for me,'' she recalled. ``I saw
a lot of flesh, a lot of girls ... taking off their clothes to take
pictures, guys pulling their pants down to take pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   CREATING A MANAGEABLE EVENT
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police and city officials began cracking down on
Freaknik revelers after more than 200,000 people converged on the
city in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Galveston is embracing the 250,000 young blacks
expected for Kappa Fest 2000 Beach Party next weekend. Like
Freaknik, Kappa Fest started several years ago as an informal
gathering and soon grew.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this year, event promoters have taken over
Kappa Fest and have paid the city $375,000 to cover police and
sanitation costs anticipated from the event. Big name rap, gospel
and hip-hop acts have been scheduled for the three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston is putting out 350 trash barrels this year as opposed
to 100 last year and 210 portable toilets for the crowds to use _
four times more than last year. Nearly 50 sanitation workers will
be on duty throughout the weekend collecting garbage, and the city
will cordon off the city's beach area for the party. Free parking
and shuttle service to the entertainment district have been
provided to discourage cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston's goal is to make Kappa Fest ``a more manageable event
for us as a city and a more entertaining event for the students
that are coming down here,'' city spokesman Wes Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistakes that other people have made is they don't embrace
these events,'' Swift said. ``We really don't think as a tourism
destination we should turn people away.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in Atlanta, college students were running
into problems that could have serious long-term consequences, said
Chris Smith, sales and operations director for Multi Image Resource
Group, the New Orleans company promoting Black Spring Break 2000 in
Biloxi, Miss., which ends today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids were getting arrest records, getting fined, and getting
hurt,'' Smith said. ``If you keep getting slapped in the face you
are going to learn. College kids are not going to continue taking
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Multi Image worked with Biloxi and Gulfport, Miss., officials to
make the event there run smoothly with as few arrests as possible,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ... covered all bases so that everyone can be prepared
to have fun and go back to school,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A SPONTANEOUS CONVERGENCE
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta officials say it is unfair to compare Atlanta and
Freaknik to the new black spring break events and the beach towns
where they are being held.
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik is an occurrence unlike almost all other major events:
a spontaneous convergence of young people who came to Atlanta with
no other purpose than cruising up and down Peachtree Street.
Besides the National Job Fair and the Sweet Auburn street festival,
there were no major events, such as the concerts and contests in
the other cities, nor were there attractions such as beaches and
rollercoasters. Also, Atlanta's business community isn't receptive
to the crowd, while Galveston, Daytona, and Biloxi rely on leisure
travelers for their economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a city that comes to mind that is structured
like Atlanta that has an event like that,''said Bill Howard, vice
president of marketing, tourism and communications for Atlanta
Convention and Visitor's Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik has not been able to co-exist with the city because it
shuts down the city's operations, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta made every effort to accommodate Freaknik as much as
we could,'' Howard said. ``We made every effort to concede with
folks coming to Freaknik. (But) we have other events in the city at
the same time, and events that are hosted in Atlanta need to
coincide with other events. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any other city that was running into the problems we were
running into would employ the same'' methods to eliminate gridlock,
said DeWayne Martin, Mayor Bill Campbell's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   GOING, GOING, ...GONE?
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik is expected to continue its decline.
</P>
<P>
   Area club managers say that this year, they are hearing none of
buzz that normally precedes Freaknik. They'll be open as usual but
have little special planned besides adding extra disc jockeys and
staff during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be surprised if a lot of kids do come to Atlanta,'' said
Billy Pugh, a promotor who works with The Bounce nightclub on
Bankhead Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the city's historically black colleges say they
aren't talking about it and few are planning to visit from out of
town. One Internet Web site dedicated to Freaknik _
www.freaknik.com _ appears to have died in the middle of
construction. E-mails to the developers are returned unread.
</P>
<P>
   ``IS THE ATLANTA FREAKNIK OVER?'' asks an article on the
blackbeachweek.com, a Web site and electronic newsletter that
tracks beach parties and other events geared toward young
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Police Department has prepared its traffic plan,
which focuses attention on downtown Atlanta streets, Special
Operations head Maj. Pete Andresen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we want to minimize problems of the citizens of
Atlanta,'' Andresen said. ``If we have Black College Spring Break
traffic, we'll reroute it if it's inconveniencing regular
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Another telling sign that Freaknik has been nixed is that,
unlike past year, it will be business as usual this weekend. The
Hawks will play two games at Phillips Arena. The rock band Kiss
will be in concert there, too. Even President Bill Clinton will be
in town Friday. In past years, most major events were shifted to
other weekends to avoid the potential for clashes with the Freaknik
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is also bracing itself for Freaknik _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have a spontaneous event that's involving young
people, it's very difficult to assume no one will show up,'' Howard
said.

   BKO-BASKETBALL-TRAGEDY _ On the afternoon of Sept. 16, Travis
Davenport lifted weights and shot hoops at his old high school
gymnasium. As always, his closest friends discouraged him from
joining their pick-up game. They echoed the advice of his doctors,
his pastor, his mother and other grown-ups. This time, Travis
listened, although it surely pained him. Basketball was his
passion. He played it year-round until the first in a series of
fainting spells. Even then, he occasionally would slip onto the
court. Just a few days earlier, a cardiologist had restated in no
uncertain terms that he must give up the game. So Travis, obediant,
tossed up casual jumpshots in the gym before heading south, back to
college in Cochran. That night, he collapsed and died. (Tierney,

NO MATTER WHAT THE LIMITS, DRIVERS JUST KEEP PUSHING
</HEADLINE>
  By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most sports are about trying to exceed the known limits,
the drivers and mechanics of Formula One are more aware than usual
this weekend as they begin the European leg of the season at the
San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, Italy, that car racing is about
trying to stay within the limits.
</P>
<P>
   This is not only because a McLaren-Mercedes car was disqualified
at the Brazilian Grand Prix two weeks ago for a front wing that was
two millimeters (eight-hundredths of an inch) outside the permitted
limit. This is also because it was at Imola that Ayrton Senna died
six years ago while trying to push his car beyond the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes 90 percent is good enough to win,'' Senna once said,
``and sometimes 100 percent is not good enough. If it takes 200
percent to win, then I will put up with it. It's in my nature to
look for more. The challenge is to win and that is my great
motivation, even it if means going over the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   When a car is built a few millimeters beyond the limit, the race
stewards exclude the car, as has happened to cars in three of the
last four Formula One races. Drivers should exclude themselves when
they begin to go beyond the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high-tech sport where people are always going to go
to the limits to get maximum performance,'' said Max Mosley,
president of the International Automobile Federation, the sport's
governing body. ``When they go over those limits, then we have to
exclude them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Senna did not limit himself. Although his
Williams was not up to its world champion quality at the beginning
of the 1994 season, Senna managed to push the car into the pole
position in each of the first three races, including at Imola. He
also spun out in each race while being pushed by the young Michael
Schumacher, who was on the way to his first world title.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1993 autobiography, ``Vive Ma Vie'' (``Live My Life''),
Alain Prost, the four-time Formula One world champion and Senna's
greatest rival, tried to define what, aside from the desire to win,
makes drivers flirt with the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drive,'' he wrote, ``danger, speed and risk provoke an
increase in endorphins in the brain. We become `drugged' and fall
into a euphoric state. ... And we cannot control this state of
ecstasy. I occasionally found myself leading races on some of the
most dangerous tracks, and telling myself: `Slow down. You've got a
big enough lead.' But I went faster and faster, certain that I had
lifted my foot from the accelerator. It's a rare state of grace, an
extraordinary voluptuousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Prost had nevertheless decided after a serious accident in his
first year in Formula One in 1980 that he would drive at 90 percent
of his capacity and find the rest of his speed through the
development and setup of the car and adjustments of his racing
line.
</P>
<P>
   But drivers also develop, mature and undergo changes in their
appreciation of what constitutes their limits. Most young drivers
start out thinking nothing can happen to them. Even as they age and
become aware of the dangers, their confidence in their skill may
grow and in turn lead to driving ever closer to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Senna, a triple world champion, died at age 34. Both Jim Clark,
a two-time world champion, and Gilles Villeneuve, often considered
one of the greatest drivers, died in racing accidents at age 32.
Antonio Ascari, one of the best prewar drivers, and his son
Alberto, a two-time world champion, both died at age 36 _ Antonio
Ascari at the French Grand Prix in 1925, Alberto Ascari at Monza in
1955.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, now 31, broke his leg last year at the British Grand
Prix at Silverstone and considered quitting. But in an interview
last Sunday with Welt am Sonntag, a German newspaper, Schumacher
said the accident ``opened my eyes about several things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more free in my head,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher has won three of the four races since his return in
Malaysia last October. But if he is more dangerous to his rivals,
is he also more dangerous to himself? In the first two races this
season he went off the track on several occasions during practice
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Although last month he said he did not fear dying in a crash, in
December Schumacher said he would consider quitting if some
talented young driver came along to push him too far. ``Because
then you may try to extend your limits to keep up with what he's
doing,'' he said. ``And that can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when he won his second and last title, Schumacher said:
``In your whole body you must have senses to feel the limit and use
what the car is giving you, use this 100 percent. I think some
people may have more senses than others, and so have the ability to
drive the maximum time on the limit and use the maximum performance
the car can give you.''  &QL;

KNICKS NEEDING HOUSTON TO REGAIN HIS TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Fla.)  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ So often, it's as if Allan Houston needs his shooter's
touch as much as an artist needs his brush. He is helpless without
it, flustered when it disappears, crestfallen when a defender takes
it away.
</P>
<P>
   The moment it vanishes, his shoulders droop a little more, his
focus blurs a bit, and his defense usually suffers. Just after the
All-Star Game seemed to sap him, when his moves had the slur of a
record played a speed too slow, he hit a low in Miami on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   He folded with his team. After being a part of a 20-point
second-quarter lead, the Knicks' resident All-Star fell off the
face of a game that marked the team's most humiliating collapse of
the year. He scored just 15 points around the effort of Dan Majerle
and the wingspan of Bruce Bowen and had the energy for only one
rebound. That was several shooting slumps ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Knicks prepare to meet Miami on Sunday, in a road
game crucial to the team's chances at catching the Heat for the No.
2 seeding in the playoffs, Houston is mired in yet another
discombobulated stretch during his season of inconsistency. Over
the last three games, Houston has made just 16 of 42 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody who is going to stop me from
scoring,'' Houston said after scoring just 10 points against
Orlando in the Knicks' victory Friday night. ``I just have to be
quicker to make adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston has had trouble lately in changing his game to adapt to
circumstances. With opponents like the Lakers, Wizards and Magic
trapping him and cutting off his path to an open jumper, Houston
has been taken out of the Knicks' set offense. Against the Lakers,
it was devastating to the Knicks, not because he did not score, but
because his defense was inactive.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, at the forceful prodding of Coach Jeff
Van Gundy, Houston has tried to change his behavior. Against the
Wizards, he kept Mitch Richmond (6 for 22) under control. On Friday
he held off the Magic's Ron Mercer (3 for 15).
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that he did other things even when he didn't shoot
well,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's like, do something else to help your
team win.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory is critical for the Knicks on Sunday. The Heat is on a
six-game winning streak and holds a two-game lead over the
third-seeded Knicks for the lead in the Atlantic Division. But
after two victories on back-to-back nights, supplied by Patrick
Ewing's indefatigable performances (30 and 28 points,
respectively), there is an arrogance about the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be, what, down a game when we win?'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   And then he was reminded, the Knicks would be down three games
with five left to play if they lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said we'll gain a game,'' Ewing said. ``We ain't losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ewing bravado that had been so silent as the season began
has grown like a crescendo the better he has played. At the same
time, Houston has faded in the background. As Ewing has grown more
prominent in the offense, Houston has become more of a second or
third option than a first. Maybe Ewing is inhibiting him. Perhaps
Houston has just failed to fully recover from the drain of the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a psychologist,'' Houston said of his dip
in energy after the All-Star break, ``but if it lasted for more
than a week, I didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the break, the number of his attempted shots has fallen as
Ewing's has risen. But on Friday night, he ignored all the
statistics and took 17 shots. He made just 5. At one point, with
four fouls also weighing him down, Van Gundy took him out of the
game for eight minutes of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really frustrated,'' Houston said. ``What I've
learned since I've been here is to hang in there and stick with it.
My role on this team is to put the ball in the basket _ among other
things. If you're not doing that, you've got to do those other
things. And I knew I'd put it in eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned for the fourth quarter, he persisted instead of
disappearing. After starting 2 for 10, he continued to play defense
and sank three jumpers in three minutes. He slung his fist and
clapped his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the word is not confidence but cockiness,'' Houston
said. ``I think there's a difference. And that's something you got
to have, especially at my position.''
</P>
<P>
   For a 10-point game, Houston's face was uncommonly lit up with
excitement. He knew the Knicks needed the victory in Orlando to put
them in the right frame of mind going to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the Miami game the one to get us to the No. 2 seed
and put us where we need to be,'' he said. ``It's good to have won
two games in a row going into that game. It's going to get us a
little more confident, but not false confidence. We know in the
back of our mind we can get it done. My father always said: `You
either get better or get worse. You don't stay the same.' I think
mentally we've kind of grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentally, Houston has not let his offensive hiccups leak into
his defense. Lately, he has been less of a one-trick player and
more of an overall force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff has just let me know that I can be as great a defensive
player as I can be an offensive one,'' Houston said. ``That's what
I want to be.'' &QL;

REAL ESTATE: FOR VACATION HOMES, THE TREND IS BIGGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.H., Pa.)   By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The house rising on the corner of Jericho Lane and
Georgica Road in East Hampton may not be remarkable for its size _
at least by current Hamptons standards _ but it symbolizes a
direction that second homes are taking in many resort areas, to the
pleasure of their builders and the consternation of their critics.
</P>
<P>
   A children's playhouse, put up in the 1920s as part of the
estate next door, once stood on the 1.6-acre building site, which
was sold in August for $1,275,000. Three decades later, the
playhouse was transformed into a modest three-bedroom cottage that
in turn has been torn down to make way for what will be a residence
of 6,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the better _ so goes the mantra these days for many
weekend and vacation retreat seekers, whether they are buying homes
they will occupy, tearing down existing structures or building on
vacant land. Though outsize houses are nothing new _ think of the
so-called ``cottages'' with ballrooms in Newport _ it has been a
while, brokers and planners say, since so many houses of more than
5,000, 10,000 and more square feet have gone up in resort areas.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend has generated everything from admiration to envy
to outright alarm.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hamptons, for example, which is having a boom year in
both resales and new construction of everything from quaint saltbox
cottages to geometric contemporary structures to farmhouses with
media rooms and Jacuzzis, the ongoing flashpoint for the debate
over size is the 57,000-square-foot, 25-bedroom, 39-bathroom Ira
Rennert mansion rising over the potato fields of Sagaponack.
</P>
<P>
   When zoning was introduced in the Town of Southampton in 1972,
the code mandated that one-story dwellings be at least 800 square
feet and those with two stories be 1,200 square feet, according to
Paul Houlihan, the chief building inspector. But despite
controversies ignited in the past by flamboyant structures, no one
imagined that a house could truly be too big until plans for the
Rennert house were divulged.
</P>
<P>
   As the result of unsuccessful efforts to scale back its
dimensions _ a lawsuit is pending even as the house rises _ the
town passed a law in 1998 limiting residential buildings to 20,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rennert house may be the extreme, but it is not unusual to
see a house of 10,000 to 12,000 square feet,'' said Frank Newbold,
senior vice president and brokerage manager for Sotheby's
International Realty in East Hampton. ``Speculators are doing
10,000-square-foot houses. Five years ago, half that size would
have been humongous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Builders of spec houses are trying to impress potential buyers
with square footage,'' he said, ``so they are building almost to
the limits of setbacks _ and if they can possibly squeeze a tennis
court onto the lot, they do.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that space to fill, there is plenty of room for the
amenities most in demand right now. ``They include one enormous
room or `great room,' with double-height ceiling and oversize
fireplace; a swanky master bathroom that could be the same size as
the bedroom, with oversize Jacuzzi, and steam shower,'' Newbold
said, adding that such houses are often sold before completion. In
keeping with the demand, prices are rising almost everywhere _ and
inventory is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the picturesque village of Truro, Mass., are also
watching larger and larger _ and of course more expensive _
vacation homes appear, although in this strip of Cape Cod near
Provincetown anything more than 5,000 square feet is considered by
some to be gargantuan.
</P>
<P>
   Even though 70 percent of the town falls under the domain of the
Cape Cod National Seashore and thus must remain undeveloped, some
residents, civic officials and conservationists fear that the
proliferation of what they scornfully deem ``trophy houses'' will
alter the unpretentious image of the Cape's smallest and most rural
town and strain its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sferra, a planner with the Cape Cod Commission who worked
with the town to develop a local comprehensive plan adopted about
four years ago, said that the houses were cause for legitimate
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the traditional dwellings in Truro, it has
always had relatively modest cottages and Capes,'' she said. ``The
newer houses really dominate the landscape, and there is no sense
that the people building them are trying to fit them into the
landscape but want them to stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of time they are being built in places where people have
been able to walk or where open views of the ocean are being
blocked,'' she continued. ``Truro is a very small place where
people have traditionally gone to get away from civilization, from
government and from community, and suddenly civilization has found
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Williams, who resigned as the town's building
commissioner and zoning enforcement officer in February after
serving 15 years in the post, said he first sensed change in the
mid-1980s, when ``the two Laundromats in Truro closed down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One became an upscale gardening center and the other an
upscale delicatessen,'' Williams said. ``Neither could have
succeeded five years earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then about five years ago,'' he recalled, ``the first
million-dollar-plus house was built, followed by a series of
others. That marks a major demographic shift when on Memorial Day
there is an onslaught of Porsches, Jaguars and BMWs instead of the
usual wrecks of station wagons that people used to get to the store
or beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams views the future with some trepidation. ``If these
houses are an augury of what is to come, then they will change the
character of Truro,'' he said. ``There is something about Truro
that is practical, simple and functional. Trophy houses are a slap
in the face of the traditional. They belong in Newport. They don't
fit in here.'' He pointed to one house whose plans would have
violated height restrictions had it not been dug into a dune.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone agrees with him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are some bigger houses than there were in the past,''
said Arthur Hultin, a builder who put up one of the houses subject
to criticism. ``If there are two dozen trophy houses in Truro I'd
be surprised. There are hundreds of small houses. I don't see it as
an aesthetic problem and I disagree that they will change the
character and tone of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Size alone is not what matters,'' he went on. ``It is not
necessarily bad to be big. There are just some poor architectural
choices being made across the board where houses don't fit their
environment because they don't have lasting architectural merit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Weinstein, president of Roberts Associates Builders, who
does custom luxury construction and was responsible for one of the
first million-dollar homes in Truro, said: ``This is an interesting
issue because, on the one hand, people complain about sizes and on
the other we live in a society that puts pre-eminence on private
property and the right to exercise your right to build within the
constriction of any community's zoning laws. We don't all agree on
what is aesthetically appropriate or architecturally correct, but I
won't force my taste on someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Scale aside, prices on second homes, modest as well as lavish,
are escalating in Truro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house sold in May 1999 for $185,000,'' Nick Brown,
president of Thomas D. Brown Real Estate Associates and a member of
the Truro planning board, said as he pointed to what he termed ``an
entry-level vacation house,'' a two-bedroom, one-bath Cape. ``Today
it would be $50,000 more. Till a year ago, the most expensive house
was $1,125,000; today we have a listing for $1,650,000.''
</P>
<P>
   That house sits high on a bluff overlooking the ocean in the
front and moors in the back, and has its own steep steps down to
the beach. Built in 1899, it is a typical uninsulated
turn-of-the-century cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Because of erosion that averages four feet a year, ``it has been
moved back as far as possible without going down the back of the
dune,'' Brown said, explaining that whoever acquires it will have
to be a risk taker. ``They will be buying a house where they can be
king of the mountain for a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacant land in Truro, as elsewhere, is commanding ever higher
prices as it becomes scarcer. There are 2,600 houses in the town,
with enough land remaining before reaching buildout, the point at
which every empty lot has been used, for 1,400 more.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Xavier Slivka, president for construction of
Geiger-Phillips, an architectural firm in Wellfleet, Mass., that
specializes in high-end design, said the price of land has gone up
about 35 percent in the last year. ``A 40,000-square-foot lot in
North Truro was the buy of the year last year at $105,000,'' he
said. ``It's simple supply and demand. People with money want to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Truro reflects what is happening elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a banner year,'' said Joel Montgomery, a sales
associate with H.C.H. Real Estate in Harvey Cedars, N.J., on Long
Beach Island. ``What was $190,000 to $200,000 a year and a half ago
is now $275,000, and we are seeing properties that were $850,000 go
for more than $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   On Fire Island, where neighbors tend to be in viewing, if not
shouting, distance from one another, ``prices are higher than
ever,'' said Deborah B. Alter, who is in her 20th year as owner of
Fire Island Summer Space, which serves the mid-island communities
of Ocean Beach and Seaview and environs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales prices,'' she said, ``are up by 10 percent or more over
last year.'' In fact, she had a sale last week that far exceeded 10
percent. ``A house I sold last year for $183,000 is now reselling
for $295,000,'' she said. ``I can't believe it myself.'' The house,
in Ocean Beach, is a traditional two-story shingled cottage with
four bedrooms and an old-fashioned eat-in kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't have the million-dollar houses yet,'' she said.
``They tend to be in the high $500,000 to $700,000 range.'' These
homes are likely to be in the more expensive community of Seaview
and are often on double-size lots, making room for a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she noted, ``one street in Seaview now has six pools.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saltaire, the village with the largest houses on the western
end of the island, ``New homes are springing up all over,'' said
RoseAnn Larson, an associate with Larson Realty. ``They are maxing
out in size, 3,600 square feet, which is pretty big for Fire
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Kenneth E. Larson, who has been a general
contractor on Fire Island for 25 years and now limits his business
to Saltaire, said, ``This is the busiest year we've had in 10
years.'' A four-bedroom house he put up last year ran the owner
$1,075,000, and a six-bedroom nearing completion will come in at
about $875,000, but it is on a smaller piece of property, 3,000
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   So far Larson has not noticed much escalation in resale prices
over last year, but, she said, ``they were up last year and they're
still up, $500,000 and more in the upper market.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bucks County, Pa., where listings range from $300,000 to $3
million, ``It looks as if we are seeing an 8 to 10 percent
increase, though given the heat of the market it is probably
slightly higher on choice properties,'' said Chris Beadling,
marketing manager for Kurfiss Real Estate in New Hope. ``We don't
keep weekend property for more than a few days. We had a converted
barn in the rural town of Ferndale that we listed on a Thursday in
February and sold on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   George C. Ballantyne, senior vice president and New England
regional manager of Sotheby's International Realty, also reported
sharp increases in prices. ``In Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and
Northeast Harbor, Maine,'' he said, ``we have seen an increase of
20 percent, especially for waterfront property. Fifteen percent
appreciation over a year, which is substantial, is not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Berkshires, ``the million-dollar house was virtually
unheard of a decade ago,'' said Joseph Carini, president of Wheeler
and Taylor, a Sotheby's affiliate that has offices in Great
Barrington and Stockbridge, Mass. ``Last year we had more than a
dozen million-dollar transactions and we already have two
properties on the books for more than that now, including a 16-room
colonial farmhouse with a contemporary wing on 31 acres that is due
to close in June for $2,450,000.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report issued by Cook Pony Farm, a real estate
firm in the Hamptons, based on deeds recorded by Suffolk Profiles,
a biweekly listing of deeds, and two local newspapers, the number
of sales of $2 million-plus houses last year more than doubled
compared to 1998, rising from 39 to 89. ``With demand for larger,
more expensive homes growing, we anticipate ever stronger
appreciation in the foreseeable future,'' said Judi Desiderio, vice
president of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also pointed out that fewer than 10 percent of
the sales in the Hamptons were for transactions over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think of the Hamptons as being East Hampton,
Southampton and Bridgehampton, where average prices are over $1
million,'' Desiderio said. ``If they would rediscover areas like
Westhampton, Hampton Bays, Quogue, Quiogue and Remsenberg, they
would find places that are beautiful and affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Greenburger, the chairman and chief executive of Time
Equities, a real estate investment company and of Sanford J.
Greenburger Associates, a literary agency, bought a beach house
house on two and a half acres on the ocean in Quogue in September
and a country house on 30 acres in Old Chatham in Columbia County,
in January.
</P>
<P>
   He had looked at more than 50 listings in Quogue and more than
100 in Columbia County, searching for several years after
separating from his wife, with whom he had shared houses in both
communities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying two houses in one year is a bit overwhelming,'' said
Greenburger, who would not divulge what he had paid for either.
``But since I had looked in both markets for quite a while without
finding anything that excited me, I felt that when I found
something that was right and I should act.''
</P>
<P>
   His saga of search is not unusual, given the shrinking inventory
everywhere. ``A year ago we had close to 700 properties for sale,''
said Cuthbert Train, owner of Train Properties on Mount Desert
Island, Maine ``Now we're down to 200. If you want to buy a house
in Northeast Harbor on the water, you would be put on a waiting
list.''
</P>
<P>
   He does have four condominiums available. ``They have filtered
views of the harbor,'' he said. ``You look past the tennis courts
and past boats and eventually your eyes get to water.''
</P>
<P>
   The units, which have two or three bedrooms, range from $225,000
to $295,000. In general, prices on the island range from about
$200,000 to more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a lot of availability anywhere on the island,''
Train said, pointing out the discrepancy between the old-line
old-moneyed Northeast Harbor and other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Southwest Harbor, separated from Northeast Harbor by 500
yards of Somes Sound, you would pay half as much,'' he said. ``We
recently sold something in Southwest Harbor for $1.5 million. In
Northeast Harbor it would have been $3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Train always tries to own something in the community himself.
``I bought a third of an acre with a house on it last summer and
tore the house down,'' he said. ``I paid $75,000 for it and it is
on the market for $115,000 and is the only piece of land for sale
in the town.''
</P>
<P>
   With prices often dictated by the value of the land rather than
the condition, style or size of the house, demolition is becoming
increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teardowns are a big part of the market,'' Newbold said of East
Hampton. ``This area has been so carefully speculated that it is
harder and harder to find property, so we are doing cold calling,
saying, `You don't know how valuable your house has become.' A
ranch house with major mansions on either side is worth a great
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia County, a thriving second-home market, ``There is
more building and a different kind of building than in the past,''
said Frances Schools, owner and principal broker of Old Ghent
Realty in Ghent, who has been in business 32 years and recently
sold her most expensive listing: a house for $2.1 million in
Hillsdale. Middle-range houses in the area go for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that people did not come up here for new
houses,'' she said. ``Now they have to because there are not enough
old houses, particularly not the kind of houses they want: the best
of whatever it is. If you're going to get an 1800s federal, you
want it to be exactly what it was intended when built plus have
modern bathrooms and kitchen. If you want a contemporary, it must
be a very good creative contemporary, and there are not a lot of
those up here. So people are starting to build the $1 million-plus
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, ``It's not that many years ago that
builders refused to build with architects, and there was certainly
no such thing as a landscape architect. Now they're learning to
work with architects and becoming more modern and sophisticated. In
the past all people wanted were ponds; now they're putting in
swimming pools.''
</P>
<P>
   But the single most sought after commodity seems to be something
more ephemeral: privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest percentage of people who come up here want as much
quiet as they can get,'' she said. ``They work in the city, they
make money in the city, they require a city life, but they also
require a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Berkshires, Carini hears the same request from his
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want privacy, we have a beautiful 345-acre
hilltop where you can land a helicopter and that has three-quarters
of a mile of frontage on a trout stream for $1,100,000,'' he said.
``The property has a simple farmhouse and several outbuildings, but
it is awaiting a house commensurate with its setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Carini was confident that there would be a buyer in the near
future. ``We are quite fascinated by the younger successful
entrepreneurs from Boston, Seattle, California who breeze into town
and absolutely have the resources to purchase their exact
fantasies,'' Carini said. ``Sometimes we have a tough job
satisfying their needs.'' What do they want? ``The same things as
everyone else,'' he said. ``They don't want to just look at the
lake; they want to buy the whole lake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mix of clients in the Hamptons, Newbold said, ``We're
seeing younger and younger people, many of them in their mid-20s,
buying multimillion-dollar properties. They're not the captains of
industry but the lieutenants with substantial bonuses, along with
the dot-commers. A lot of them are new to New York, having come
from the Midwest or the West. They consider that part of the
package of New York City is a place in the country. It is part of
the New York experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave the prospective buyer on a budget, one
whose fortunes have not soared with stock options, who cannot
afford Versailles on the beach? There are, even as prices soar,
still houses to be had in lower and middle price ranges, though
what is considered reasonable in one community, say $400,000, may
be exorbitant in another. Buyers may just have to be a bit more
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Burns, a broker with N.H. Colonials in Holderness, N.H.,
in the lake region of central New Hampshire, where houses are
listed for $225,000 to $3.9 million, said that ``depending on the
size of the house and the community, you could get a house for
under $100,000 and use the town beach.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bucks County, low-end prices start at around $300,000, said
Chris Beadling, marketing manager for Kurfiss Real Estate in New
Hope, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Hamptons, there is the occasional bargain. ``We just
sold a cottage in Noyac in the Town of Southampton for close to its
asking price of $159,500,'' said Aspasia G. Comnas, vice president
and brokerage manager in Sotheby's Bridgehampton office. ``It was a
single-story cottage with two bedrooms, two sun porches _ and it's
one block from the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is a house in Water Mill in the Hamptons that
could be considered a bargain _ depending on one's perspective. Its
listing price a year and a half ago, $5 million, was recently
dropped to $3,395,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is a medieval-style stone castle built four years ago by the
brothers Alan and Ivan Wilzig, bankers from Jersey City, N.J., that
includes among its amenities a disco, a gym with steam room and
sauna, a screening room, a pool with underwater speakers and a
fish-stocked freshwater pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a very specific buyer,'' said Tom Raffo, an
associate broker at Sotheby's International Realty in Southampton,
the exclusive agent for the property. ``It's almost like a
self-contained resort. You never have to leave the castle.''

COMMENTARY: TEEN STARTUP, 18 AND WIRED FOR BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ The executives of the company running the
school district's computer system don't need to be told a thing
about the network or fiber-optic cables or even which teacher is
all thumbs on a mouse. All they need is a call every morning about
8 from the district secretary, Pat Raynor, to make sure they're
awake.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the district gets for hiring a couple of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Sims and Sean Myrden, both 18 and 1999 Riverhead High
School graduates, are president and treasurer of Eastern Digital
Intranet Services. Last week the school board accepted their
$73,940 proposal to oversee the Long Island district's 600-computer
network for a year. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   They helped build the system as 16-year-old interns and
maintained it as technicians after graduating. When the school
board terminated the contract of its technology director earlier
this year, they bid against five companies, some boasting long
experience and millions in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to bid lower than two guys living with their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if either of them has a mortgage,'' said Bryon
Duffy, the adult president of Tech2Logic, which bid $170,000.
``They don't need the big bucks other people need.''
</P>
<P>
   Need is not in Kris and Sean's vocabulary. Boys in the
wonderland of technology, they followed a youthful fascination to
big prizes. They've forgone college and other trappings of an old
economy that, for them, might as well be an exhibit at the Museum
of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like the college experience,'' said Kris, who tried a
few months at Suffolk County Community College. ``But at 18, I feel
like I'm beyond that. Maybe I'll go to college when I'm 30, when
I'm retired.''
</P>
<P>
   They met in high school, both drawn to rock 'n' roll and
computers. Sean, whose father is a computer consultant, helped wire
computers as a child. Kris fell hard for them at 14. In their
working-class town, they were always scouting odd jobs. After
pestering school officials, they were hired as interns between
their sophomore and junior years and helped install hundreds of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   They became indispensable. Between classes they were pulled away
to solve computer problems. After graduating, they became
$50-an-hour technicians. Now, Kris said, ``we're situated.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and wired, the teen-agers' world view is all giddy
exuberance and serious money.
</P>
<P>
   They considered Silicon Valley after hearing of a school
employee's relative whose salary and stock options there made him
rich on paper. ``Thirteen million or $1.3 million,'' Kris said.
``Some big number.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kris mentioned a building they saw as a possible
headquarters one day, Sean interjected, ``Someone bought that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' Kris said, briefly disappointed. ``Oh well,
everything's always for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris, the exuberant partner, said: ``I would be personally happy
if I made $100,000. Well, probably $80,000 I'd be happy with.''
This year.
</P>
<P>
   Brash, perhaps, but in six months last year they made about
$80,000. Their contract allows for extra pay for additional school
projects. Opportunities elsewhere seem plentiful. Their competitors
for the contract hardly wrote them off. Some offered them jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Holmes, the Riverhead Central School District
superintendent, is thrilled that local boys made good, but said
they pose a challenge to educators: ``How do we accommodate the
kids who are very bright but say, `Sorry, I don't have time for the
traditional stuff'?''
</P>
<P>
   The boys are not fretting. Kris has a Corvette. Sean has a
Lexus. They're in a rock 'n' roll band. They're the hottest startup
in Riverhead. ``I wear khakis every day and eat at McDonalds,''
Kris said. ``It's a field like no other. It's run by young people.
It's not an institution yet. It's not run by suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean's father, John, said he told his son: ``Remember these
events. Remember these times. They don't happen that often.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean, working at his computer, ``looked at me like I was
crazy,'' Myrden said. ``I could see the 18-year-old in him saying:
`This is going to happen all the time. We're going to make this
happen.'''

HIGH IN SPIRES, A FEATHERED LIFE TURNS SOLITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Laurel Fox could not stop watching them. Since
discovering the pair of red-tailed hawks nesting in a spire of the
Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, she has been enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, an occupational therapist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center in Morningside Heights, across the street from the
cathedral, was amazed five weeks ago when she first saw the male
alight on a nest guarded by his mate on the northern edge of St.
John's roof. Avid bird-watchers told her it was the third time they
knew of that red-tailed hawks had tried to nest in a city building.
</P>
<P>
   She was touched when, at the end of March, she saw him bring his
mate a bright green twig and insert it, like a ribbon, in the side
of the brown nest.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday evening, when she went out to her usual spot on a
terrace on the hospital's ninth floor to watch the birds, her heart
sank. The nest was empty, and the male hawk was sprawled, unmoving,
on the cathedral roof.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Fox and Charles Kennedy, a bird expert, returned
to check on the pair. As they watched, the female hawk appeared in
the sky and descended to the roof, where she found her mate, who
was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hopped up next to him and looked at him and then kind of
raised her wings up, which is quite a sight to see,'' Fox said.
``She bent down, but didn't touch him. Then she repeated it, and
then she just flew back up to the nest. The tentative way she
approached him looked like someone trying to figure something out.
It was very poignant.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the bird's death has not yet been determined.
Cathedral workers helped remove the male hawk, and on Tuesday, the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is to
deliver it to Ward B. Stone, head of wildlife pathology for the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation, who will do an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consider everything, including West Nile and other
infectious and parasitic diseases as well as poisons,'' said Stone,
noting that the hawk may have eaten an animal that was poisoned.
``We've had a red-tailed hawk die recently from Avitrol, a kind of
poison people use to kill pigeons, and we've also had red-tailed
die in New York from West Nile.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird experts say they are concerned that without the male, the
female hawk may not be able to tend to any eggs, and the chicks may
not hatch and fledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no male to bring her food and so we don't know what's
going to happen now,'' said Geoffrey Nulle, a Morningside Heights
resident and avid bird-watcher who was one of the first people to
see the birds. ``It's possible that she may find another male. It's
possible that she'll just abandon the nest and try again next year
with another male. We just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, still vigilantly watching the nest, is hopeful. On
Friday afternoon she said she saw the female leave the nest and
return sometime later with a twig. ``Even though Charles Kennedy
told me that chances are she would go away, she's back on the nest;
she still seems to be building it,'' she said. ``It looks like
right now she's going to stay.''

REAL ESTATE: FURNISHING AN APARTMENT WITH THE CLICK OF A MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., N.H., Canada)   By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the old days, about five minutes ago, it was
enough to know which restaurant had just opened in the meat-packing
district, or which store on Elizabeth Street sold the best dresses.
Knowing where to get things has always been part of the currency
here, the mark of the sophisticated New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, there's a whole new world to master, and that
doesn't mean Queens and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Its scouts are people like Brianna Lam, who lives in an elegant
Upper East Side apartment that is tastefully furnished with
antiques and early American oil paintings. She is friendly but not
effusive, perfectly dressed and as well-spoken as one would expect
from a woman who entered Columbia University at 16. When she
explains the row of liquor bottles in her kitchen by saying she
wanted to set up a ``bachelorette'' pad for herself, she seems as
Old World as her high-ceilinged apartment near Central Park in the
East 80s.
</P>
<P>
   But Lam, 28, is totally of her moment. The antique ottoman, the
secretary, the stereo system and the porcelain coasters didn't come
from little neighborhood shops. She found almost everything on the
Internet within two months of moving into her one-bedroom
apartment, and she spent only a fifth of what she had budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, Lam was separating from her husband and
was tired of the contemporary style they had cultivated. She wanted
antiques, she said, but nothing so expensive she couldn't give a
party without worrying that a $10,000 table would be teetering in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   By roaming through stores on the Upper East Side, she estimated
that it would cost her $50,000 to get the look she wanted, and so
she set aside that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she started shopping, she was shocked to see that a
pair of chairs she liked cost $5,000. The big department stores
were no more appealing. ``A lot of time when you go to department
stores, you have to wait for six weeks,'' she said. ``When you're
starting from scratch, that seems like forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But being a technology consultant with her own company, Business
Solution Providers Inc., it was natural to her to check out Web
sites in her spare moments. She quickly found an Aubusson-style
needlepoint rug for $850; an upholstered antique footstool, which
doubles as a coffee table, for $190; a hand-painted tole tray table
with a stand for $130; and curved mahogany library steps for $100.
She even unearthed, for $175, a Lladro figurine of a Chinese woman,
which drew her, she said, ``because it looks a little like my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she had to have help. Desperately wanting the library
steps _ which she found on eBay, the Internet auction site _ so she
could reach her collection of rare books on the top shelves of her
living room, she asked someone she works with to bid for her,
because at the crucial moment, just before the auction closed, she
was going to be at a meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
   With two chairs she had brought from her old life, and a chaise
lounge bought at Bloomingdale's and delivered quickly because it
was in stock, she completed her apartment with about $40,000 left
over. She took that money and began buying early American
paintings. Again she used the Internet, but usually went in person
to the galleries to see the work, after seeing online what was
available.
</P>
<P>
   In furnishing her apartment, she said, she used eBay a lot,
sometimes making the first contact there and then going off line to
negotiate when the auction minimum wasn't met. To protect herself,
she bought primarily from sellers who had garnered a lot of
positive feedback from previous buyers, comments that are posted on
the site. She always avoided buying anything that looked fuzzy in a
photo, and always asked a lot of questions about the object's
condition and shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 70 transactions, she said, she had only three
negative experiences. Twice, furniture was damaged because of poor
packing, but the pieces were insured. In the third case, china
arrived with two broken plates, but because it was insured, the
seller replaced them through www.replacements.com, a company that
sells individual pieces of china and glassware.
</P>
<P>
   Buying online, she said, saves time and broadens choices. ``It's
analogous to having a global amalgamation of stores right in front
of you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For paintings her favorite sites were www.sothebys.com and
www.artnet.com/questtroyal.html, a New York art dealer that
specializes in 19th and early 20th century art. Among her purchases
is an 1875 work by Jervis McEntee (1828-1891), a Hudson River
School painter, which she bought through a dealer she found on the
Internet _ who happened to be the person who lived in her apartment
before she did.
</P>
<P>
   She likes McEntee's work, she said, because it is not like the
``very bright, very sunny'' paintings typical of his time.
</P>
<P>
   He is often criticized for his darker pictures, she said, but
``he was someone I could relate to.'' She buys old art books partly
because they sometimes have personal information about painters
that isn't found in new books.
</P>
<P>
   She said she found eBay very time consuming because of the vast
number of items on sale. Mostly, she found the sellers very
helpful. When she saw the ottoman on eBay, offered by an antiques
dealer in the Hamptons, she made a bid, but when nobody met the
minimum, she contacted the dealer directly, said she had placed the
highest bid and asked for his best price.
</P>
<P>
   They struck a deal, and then came the best part. ``I said I
needed it for a cocktail party coming up,'' she said, ``and they
said, `We'll drop it off in the city for $25.'''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her bedroom, the rug came from Home Depot, a store she really
admires. ``I'm pretty bullish on their stock,'' she said. ``It's
one of the only non-Internet, nonwireless-communication companies
in my portfolio.'' She found her digital camera by going to
www.shopper.com to find out who had the best prices.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful duvet cover on the bed, however, came from a very
traditional source: her mother, who made it for her. ``When I was
little, she always wanted to make my clothes,'' said Lam, who was
born in Toronto and grew up in a small town in New Hampshire. ``I
wanted Levis.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that her apartment is finished, Lam is putting more time
into her other interests, including fiction writing and portrait
photography. She brings out a stunning photo of a woman she shot
during a race to Battery Park City, the woman's muscles glittering
like jewels in the light.
</P>
<P>
   She also likes handgun shooting, a hobby that startles anyone
who hears of it. ``People think it's violent,'' she said. But she
is not defensive. ``It's relaxing to me,'' she said. ``You're
focusing on the target.'' She shoots at a place in the West 20s,
where she likes meeting people she would never come across in her
work life, like police officers and FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work tons and tons of hours,'' she said. Then, ``I
thought, there's more to life than just working and making money.''

UMBILICAL-CORD ALARM FAILED TO STOP HOSPITAL KIDNAPPING  
 BY TINA KELLEY  
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police are investigating how a 2-day-old girl
could have been kidnapped from University Hospital at the Downstate
Medical Center in Brooklyn on Friday. She was returned safely that
evening, after the police arrested a teen-ager who they said had
taken the baby to a nearby apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Newborns at the hospital are fitted with a device on their
umbilical cords that activates an alarm whenever a baby is brought
near the doors to the ward. Immediately afterward, the doors are
supposed to lock.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm went off when the baby, Melanie Knight, was taken from
the ward, but her abductor apparently made it out of the hospital
before security officers near the hospital's exits were alerted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were nine police officers and 20 security
officers on duty at the hospital, plus one investigator and three
administrators, said Brian Kell, a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, Angelique Lawrence, 17, was scheduled to be
charged with second-degree kidnapping Saturday, a felony that
carries a possible jail sentence of five to 25 years, said Teresa
General, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   According to a high-ranking police official close to the
investigation, Lawrence was most likely able to leave through the
doors because someone was coming into the maternity ward at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the only possible way,'' said the official. ``If
someone is walking in the door, the whole system is shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not think Lawrence had an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If downstairs is not notified, it's a clear way out,'' he
said. ``It seems inadequate. I guarantee it's going to be
upgraded.''
</P>
<P>
   Kell said that no similar incidents had occurred in the 10 years
he had worked at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence had been a patient at the hospital, where she had just
had surgery that would prevent her from having children. She had
told friends she was going into the hospital to have a baby, the
authorities said.

REAL ESTATE: MAKING DISSENTERS' VOICES HEARD IN CO-OP MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether a co-op building has six apartments or 600, one thing is
fairly certain: There will rarely be a time when there isn't at
least one shareholder who believes that the building could be run
better by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   And while the naysayers may be wrong at least as often as they
are right, there are ways for dissatisfied owners to ensure that
their voices are heard and their votes are counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I estimate that about 10 to 15 percent or more of every
shareholder body is made up of natural-born dissenters,'' said
Arthur Davis, whose Manhattan management consulting company,
bearing his name, specializes in advising co-ops. ``Most of those
people wouldn't appreciate the way their board was performing even
if it were run by the most caring, communicative and capable
managers on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such dissidents, Davis said, can become an ``inflammatory and
chronically divisive presence'' in a building.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the natural-born dissenters, Davis said,
there is often another group of shareholders who express their
dissatisfaction with the status quo in more measured terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other class of dissenting shareholders are mostly
circumspect owners who feel their board is not representing the
best interests of the majority of the shareholders,'' Davis said.
``And generally speaking, such shareholders are actively pursuing
prudent ways to either influence the directors or change the makeup
of the board.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that while the demands of ``the natural-born
dissenters'' were often exaggerated and difficult to satisfy, the
more circumspect dissidents often raised issues that had workable
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   He advises any group of dissatisfied shareholders to take a
strategic, businesslike approach to achieve objectives. ``Whether
we're talking about three people or 33 people, the first thing I
would do is get everybody to sit down and summarize their issues
and their complaints,'' Davis said, explaining that the simple act
of articulating complaints _ and then committing them to writing _
often serves to separate legitimate issues from those that might be
consigned to the nitpicking category.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I would do is send a memo to the board
president stating the problems and proposing possible solutions,''
he said. ``If an answer is not forthcoming, or if the answer given
is unreasonable, then I would send the memo to every member of the
board asking them to sit down with two or three of the complaining
shareholders to see if a solution can be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   If that fails, Davis said, the dissenting shareholders have no
option but to attempt to rally the support of other shareholders in
the building by sending the memo to each of them and asking for
their suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the tricky part,'' he said. ``You might have a
dedicated board doing what they truly believe is the right thing to
do, and the other shareholders might think the dissenters are just
nitpicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Grant, the president of Diversified Property Management
in Brooklyn, said that dissenting shareholders whose complaints and
suggestions had been rebuffed by their board might want to consider
enlisting professionals to help them make their case to other
shareholders and, if necessary, to attempt to replace one or more
members of the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when management companies, accountants and
lawyers are approached by groups of shareholders and asked to
assess the way the building is being run,'' Grant said. He added
that this happened most often when shareholders believed that the
building's sponsor was still exercising control, whether directly
or indirectly, over the affairs of the building.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Grant said, there is a possibility that some
accountants, managers and lawyers might work for reduced rates,
even free, if the dissenting shareholders' complaints are
legitimate and the problems in the building appear to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once wrote a letter to three accounting firms and three law
firms asking if they would give free advice to a group of dissident
shareholders I believed had legitimate concerns about how their
building was being run,'' he said. ``All six firms offered to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason some professionals are willing to do that, Grant
explained, is because they can reasonably expect to be hired by the
building if the dissenting shareholders gain control of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a shareholder group cannot get professional assistance
in their effort, Grant said, the law provides them with some of the
tools necessary to mobilize other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any shareholder in a building has the right to get a list of
the names and addresses of every other shareholder in the
building,'' he said. ``And while it's possible that the current
management company might not make it easy, they have to make the
list available. You might have to sit there and copy it out by
hand, but they have to give you access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the list of all shareholders makes it possible for
dissident shareholders to state their case to every owner in the
building, including those who may sublet their apartments and live
elsewhere. And that, he said, could be quite useful when the time
comes to solicit votes for the election of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gonchar, a Manhattan co-op lawyer and the owner of a
Manhattan co-op, said that he used a more personal and
labor-intensive approach to ensure that his voice was heard and his
views acknowledged in his building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran for a seat on the board of directors,'' Gonchar said,
explaining that he wanted to influence how his building would
refinance its mortgage. ``I wanted to make sure that I would have
input in the decision-making process,'' he said. ``So I wrote up a
memo explaining how I would approach the refinance, and I slipped
the memo under every single door in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonchar, who won the seat he sought, said that while his
relatively low-key method for gaining a voice worked, there were
times when ``harsher solutions'' might be called for.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always wait for the annual meeting and try to elect a
whole new slate of board members,'' he said. ``But you need a lot
of support and a lot of committed souls to accomplish that.''

REAL ESTATE: FIDELITY IS A MAJOR INVESTOR IN REAL ESTATE, TOO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., R.I., N.H., Ohio, Texas, Ky., Utah, Calif., Hong
Kong, Britain, Canada.)  By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Financial District headquarters of Fidelity
Investments, the mutual-fund giant that manages $1 trillion,
couldn't be more modest. With no views, low ceilings and a rabbit
warren of corridors, the nine-story building where the company was
founded 54 years ago gives no hint of the real estate empire that
is rising from Fidelity's financial success.
</P>
<P>
   The family-owned and run company, long downtown Boston's biggest
office tenant, is now also poised to become one of its largest
commercial property investors and developers. In all, the FMR
Corp., Fidelity's parent, occupies almost 10 million square feet in
the United States and abroad, and it owns about 7 million square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, FMR owns 3.4 million square feet of downtown office
space. Of that, Fidelity Investments occupies 1.25 million square
feet, much of it in separate buildings surrounding its headquarters
at 82 Devonshire St. And it leases an additional 1.4 million square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Fidelity is probably Boston's only major office tenant
that is also a major investor and developer,'' said Thomas J.
Hynes, the chief executive of Meredith &AMP; Grew Inc./Oncor
International, a Boston real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's boldest investment here is the Seaport Center, part
of the real estate market emerging along the downtown waterfront.
The 2.5-million-square-foot complex includes a convention center
with office space that it redeveloped on an old fish pier in the
1980s, a two-year-old hotel and two office towers now under
construction. The east tower will open this fall, and the west this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Seaport Center hotel and towers are the first new buildings
that Fidelity has ever put up in Boston, and like most of its real
estate investments, is self-financed with company profits. It
obtained a 99-year lease on the 8.5-acre site from Massport, the
state port authority, and an option on a site for an adjacent third
tower.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its Devonshire Street headquarters, these three new
buildings have spectacular views of the harbor and downtown Boston.
In July, when the $140 million 16-story east tower opens, it will
be the first new office building in downtown Boston since the early
1990s. All told, there are nine projects valued at about $3 billion
being built or planned in the hot new Seaport District.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight percent of Fidelity's east tower has already been
leased, said Peter E. Masden, the managing director of Pembroke
Real Estate, the real estate investment unit of FMR. Given the
strength of the office market _ the vacancy rate is 2.9 percent and
rents are reaching into the $60-a-square-foot range _ Fidelity will
not itself occupy space there. ``The leasing is too good,'' Masden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes of Meredith &AMP; Grew said: ``Fidelity focuses on what's
cost-effective in deciding between leasing, owning and occupying.
And it has the in-house talent to do it all well.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the lure of substantial returns _ downtown Boston real
estate values went up about 70 percent in the last six years, city
assessors say _ Fidelity's rapid growth has made the accumulation
of real estate expertise imperative. It now has 30,162 employees,
about third of them working in Boston. In 1990, it had 7,000
employees, two-thirds of them in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real estate activity is driven by our jobs growth,'' said
David C. Weinstein, Fidelity's chief of administration. ``By the
mid-1990s, we were bursting at the seams.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the company has bought, leased or built space in
Manhattan _ 230,000 square feet in the World Financial Center _ and
in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Utah and
California, and abroad, in Canada, Bermuda, Britain, Germany,
France, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing fears that Fidelity might someday abandon Boston,
Weinstein said, ``In an economy based on brainpower, we're in the
catbird seat here with all the colleges and universities.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic slowdown in the late '80s and early '90s presented
Fidelity some opportunities for cost-effective expansion.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, during the mid-1990s, it bought 1.6 million square
feet of space in Massachusetts and New Hampshire from the Digital
Equipment Corp. And it bought 350 acres to develop a campus in
Smithfield, R.I., where it built a 250,000-square-foot office
building and is now constructing another slightly larger building,
both for its own use.
</P>
<P>
   It is also building in office parks near Dallas and Cincinnati
and in Walnut Creek, Calif. In London, it will soon complete
construction of a $100 million six-story office building near St.
Paul's Cathedral. Masden said that about half of it was already
leased at rents that reach $140 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Boston, where Fidelity still rents the same amount
of space it did in 1990, it recently bought two buildings with a
total of about 1.1 million square feet for its own use. Last year,
it paid $187 million for 245 Summer St., an 850,000-square-foot
building where it now occupies some space and will soon have
another 350,000 square feet for expansion. It renovated the second
220,000-square-foot building, 255 State St., on the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity was a pioneer in the Seaport District. With lenders and
tenants still wary from the 1990s real estate crash, Fidelity's
ability to self-finance gave it an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're independent of the business cycle,'' Masden said,
explaining that Fidelity could move ahead with its own projects
when other office developers could not find financing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's heft is also helping the entire Seaport District
to emerge as a new downtown neighborhood, said William F. McCall
Jr., the chief executive of McCall &AMP; Almy Inc., a real estate
advisory company in Boston. ``Everyone knew that once they started
building they'd finish without going bankrupt,'' he said. ``Their
investment gave the area a huge boost in credibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also helpful is $20 billion in publicly funded infrastructure
improvements now under way that have made the waterfront a prime
investment opportunity. The Seaport Center sits at what will be a
crossroads for a new transportation network. At its front door will
be a new tunnel under the harbor, to Logan International Airport;
an extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike; a rebuilt downtown
expressway; a truck road; and new rapid transit line.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after Fidelity was stymied in building a new tower on
Devonshire Street, it teamed up with the John Drew Management Co.
on the Commonwealth Pier project. Together, they redeveloped the
fish pier into 700,000 square feet of offices that Fidelity
occupies and a 150,000-square-foot exhibition hall for trade shows.
At the same time, Fidelity started negotiating with Massport to
lease more adjacent land.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, as financially shaky developers were forced
to shelve plans, Fidelity continued its site planning and
ground-lease negotiations. By 1994, it started to focus on the
design of the 247-room Seaport Hotel and broke ground a year later.
In 1998, the hotel opened, and Fidelity started building the
505,000-square-foot east tower designed by Shepley Bulfinch
Richardson Abbott Architects of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its real estate activity, the company is still
modest about its holdings. The only public acknowledgment of its
impressive real estate portfolio is a demure 12-inch bronze plaque
with a grayish patina that fades into the masonry around the
entrance to its headquarters at 82 Devonshire St. The plaque is
simply engraved: Fidelity Building.

 &HT;    Divisions visible among Davidian plaintiffs, attorneys
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There's been a shakeout in the number of
plaintiffs and the focus of their case in the last weeks before the
trial in the wrongful-death lawsuit against the government by
surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of those who died at Mount
Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   What's also becoming more evident is the differences among the
remaining plaintiffs as well as their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   With a June 19 trial date looming, there are now fewer than 100
individual plaintiffs left in the lawsuit, according to the court
docket in the district clerk's office at the Western District of
Texas. That number doesn't include estates.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell easily has the most clients, 78
people. Many are referrals from attorneys Kirk Lyons of North
Carolina and Charles Grigson of Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general under President
Lyndon Johnson, has 19 clients.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco tossed out 125
plaintiffs last July when he dismissed most of the claims in the
case. The plaintiffs left are those suing the government for using
excessive force during the raid, allegedly shooting at the
Davidians on the day of the fire and not having fire-fighting
equipment present.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Davidians Kathryn Schroeder and Rita Riddle _ both of
whom were at Mount Carmel when the ATF raided it on Feb. 28, 1993
but left before the fire that led to the deaths of David Koresh and
75 followers _ were among those plaintiffs recently exiting the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Both women asked to be let out of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Davidian Clive Doyle from angrily confronting
Caddell, who had been the attorney for Schroeder and Riddle, after
the Mount Carmel re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange gave a rare glimpse into the feelings of longtime
Davidians going into the trial. Most of them are represented by
Clark. Doyle, Sheila Martin, Mary Belle Jones (the mother of
Koresh's legal wife, Rachel) and David Thibodeau are clients of
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle accused Caddell of asking people to drop out of the case,
a charge that Caddell denied.
</P>
<P>
   However, Doyle seemed most angry about reports that Caddell, the
lead plaintiffs' attorney, had criticized Koresh in interviews with
the news media covering the re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he represents the Branch Davidians anymore,''
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell represents several Davidians, such as Misty Ferguson,
who was severely burned in the Mount Carmel fire, and Stan Sylvia,
a Davidian who was not at Mount Carmel during the siege. None,
however, were ever in the Davidians' upper echelon.
</P>
<P>
   That's given Caddell the leeway to be critical of Koresh's
actions at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you not be?'' Caddell asked. ``I don't make any
apologies for that. I wasn't at Mount Carmel. I don't know what was
going on, but I do know they should have surrendered after the
initial ATF assault and fought it out in court. The Davidians have
to take responsibility for their bad decisions just like the
government does. That doesn't mean if the FBI had handled things
differently that a lot more women and children wouldn't be alive
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Martin said Doyle was trying to make a point by
confronting Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive just wanted people to know he (Caddell) isn't our
lawyer,'' Martin said. ``He has nothing to do with our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Doyle, Martin doesn't appreciate hearing people blame
Koresh and the Davidians for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government was the one who came to us,'' Martin said.
``It's not like we were in town making demands. What happened was
horrible and should never have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney refrained from assessing Caddell's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the business of criticizing co-counsel,'' Clark
said. ``Never have been. Hope I never do.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clark acknowledged he views the lawsuit differently
than Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell told the Waco Tribune-Herald that he no longer considers
it crucial to the wrongful-death lawsuit to prove the government
fired gunshots at the Davidians on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the failure to have a plan to fight a fire may
be the most critical issue,'' Caddell said. ``Clearly, there was an
anticipation of a fire. But (Jeffrey) Jamar and (Richard) Rogers
said, 'We're not even going to try to fight one if it occurs.' They
understood that Janet Reno's instructions included having
firefighting equipment available. This is not a case where they
should have had a hook-and-ladder truck, and they only had a
pumper. They didn't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, though, feels that history demands the plaintiffs try to
prove the government fired shots at the Davidians on the final day
of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's essential to legal liability,'' Clark said.
``But whether the FBI fired shots or not is vastly important to the
American people and to history because they've so adamantly
insisted they didn't shoot. The meaning of that is enormous. How
can you hope for accountability if shooting occurred but the issue
remains unresolved?''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell attributes the two men's different trial philosophies to
personal history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been attorney general,'' Caddell said. ``I'm just a
trial lawyer. For me, a trial is about trying to win a lawsuit, not
make history. I'm not being critical of Ramsey. He has a different
perspective because of his own history. In my world, I measure
success or failure very simply. Did I make a recovery for my
client? If I make a recovery for my client, I will have succeeded
on their behalf. Let history pass its own judgment as to whether my
approach was effective or appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Clark, attorney James Brannon, who represents the estates
of Koresh's legal children (Cyrus, Star and Bobbie Lane, all of
whom died at Mount Carmel) wants to focus on proving shots were
fired at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy, not history, guides his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can show the government was a bunch of liars on that
issue, their credibility on everything would be gone,'' Brannon
said. ``I know jurors would look at it that way. I don't know
whether Judge Smith would look at it that way. I don't know the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Brannon said his relationship with Caddell has been cordial.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we walked out of the deposition of Janet Reno, he walked
up to the microphone and I got out of the way,'' Brannon said. ``I
didn't get stiff-armed. He is the lead counsel, and I let him
speak. I don't view our relationship as anything but cordial. If I
had his resources, I'm sure I would have done some things
differently, but I don't begrudge him for doing them. He's the one
advancing the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brannon said he may file a motion to remove Caddell as
lead attorney for the Holub plaintiffs (Jean Holub, Koresh's
grandmother, is the executor of the estates of his legal children).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're getting down to trial, I don't want to be
arguing with him as to what's best for my clients,'' Brannon said.
``I'm not trying to be critical of Mr. Caddell or anything that he
has done. I just need to row my own boat when we get into court.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he expects that he'll still be the lead counsel in
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Judge Smith will let three or four people plow
the same ground,'' Caddell said. ``I expect the court to designate
a lead counsel. He'll have responsibility for asking the general
questions. The other counsels will participate by asking questions
peculiar to the needs of their particular clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its raid led to the deadly siege, the ATF is likely to
take a backseat at the wrongful-death lawsuit trial. Caddell did
not depose a single official of the agency nor did he talk to any
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I didn't talk to any of them is that I knew what
they were going to say,'' Caddell said. ``It's not like any ATF
agent is going to admit firing his weapon indiscriminately without
having a target. But I think the evidence is clear that a lot of
the gunfire from the ATF was not directed at a specific target. As
a result, several people died.''
</P>
<P>
   Brannon agreed with Caddell's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to find out what those guys did,'' Brannon said.
``We already know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the emphasis on the FBI is a matter of trying the
case by the numbers. Five Branch Davidians died on the first day of
the Mount Carmel siege. On the last day, 76 people died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just reflects the far greater number of deaths on April
19th,'' Clark said. ``We're basically suing for wrongful-death and
survivor claims, with a few people suing for their injuries. That
inherently means there's going to be more of a focus on the FBI
than on the ATF.''

 &HT;    ELIAN'S FATHER AVOIDS MEETING WITH RESCUERS
 &HT;    820&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN AND MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after publicly thanking the fishermen who
rescued his son, Juan Miguel Gonzalez avoided a meeting with them
Saturday and gave no indication he would agree to meet with the
Miami relatives who have taken care of 6-year-old Elian for the
past four months.
</P>
<P>
   The latest development came as the U.S. Justice Department and
immigration officials readied plans to transfer Elian to his father
_ by force if necessary _ later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's attorney, Gregory Craig, said his client would meet
Sunday with a panel of child psychiatrists appointed by the
government to help advise officials on the best way of transferring
Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The two fishermen, cousins Donato Darylrimple and Sam Ciancio,
flew at their own expense from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Washington
to urge Gonzalez to meet with the Miami relatives and to allow
Elian to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, when they arrived at the suburban Bethesda, Md., home
of Cuba's chief diplomat here, they found that Gonzalez was
visiting the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, which serves as
an embassy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen, who have been outspoken in their support for the
relatives' efforts to keep Elian in America, said they planned to
remain until Gonzalez consented to meet with them. They were joined
by Delphin Gonzalez, one of Elian's great-uncles from Miami, whose
efforts to meet with Juan Miguel on Friday were similarly rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to get on my knees, I'm going to get on my knees (to
have) this meeting because I love Elian,'' Darylrimple said. ``What
I'm pleading for is for him to communicate with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Juan Gonzalez would meet with the fishermen, perhaps
Sunday, but their appeals would not change Juan Gonzalez's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the efforts of the fishermen would be better
directed if they tried to persuade Lazaro Gonzalez to voluntarily
and promptly bring the boy to his father,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, has been caring for the
boy since shortly after he was found floating in an inner tube
three miles off Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving day. Elian's mother
and 10 others died after their small motorboat sank during the trip
from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely Juan Miguel Gonzalez will agree to a meeting with
the Miami relatives, as has been urged by Florida's senators, Bob
Graham, a Democrat, and Connie Mack, a Republican, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Lazaro Gonzalez has filed suit in state court
against Juan Miguel Gonzalez, claiming he is unfit to have custody
of the child if he wants to return them to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing here is returning Elian soon to his father,''
Craig said. ``Lazaro has to take Elian by the hand and lead him to
(Juan Miguel) and say, 'here is your son.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, there can be no reconciliation between the
family factions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Sunday with the psychiatrists is the first of two
meetings that the government has sought to pave the way for the
transfer. Justice officials have urged the Miami relatives to meet
with the two psychiatrists and a psychologist on Monday to discuss
how to facilitate the transfer. It was unclear late Saturday
whether that meeting would take place.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, announcing the appointment of the
panel Friday, said their purpose was to help decide how and when _
not whether _ Elian would be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported
Saturday that Justice and immigration officials were developing a
plan for taking custody of Elian, perhaps as early as Wednesday, if
his Miami relatives do not agree to a voluntary transfer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. marshals and immigration agents would approach the Miami
house during daylight hours, the newspaper said, and would rely on
local police to respond to any disturbances that might occur.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was calm Saturday, as leaders of the volatile Cuban exile
community called off any protests until Monday, when they scheduled
a prayer rally.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of angry vows that they would form a human chain to
protect the boy, some exiles seemed resigned to the likelihood of
losing the battle over the boy, which they have turned into a focal
point of their 40-year cold war against Cuban dictator Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is the one who is going to lose,'' said Ramon
Hernandez, 74, who joined a small band of protestors outside the
Little Havana home of Lazaro Gonzalez. ``I don't understand how our
government can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez warned that some extremists might try to block any
effort to turn Elian over to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people are crazy and they're going to do
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A possible hitch to the government's plans could be a last-ditch
effort by the family to delay the reunion by going to court to ask
for an injunction to block Reno's order.
</P>
<P>
   They could ask for such an order from the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which is scheduled to hear their
appeal of a lawsuit stemming from the case on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   But the family might also try to going to a Florida family
court. They tried that strategy in January, arguing that Elian's
case is a child custody matter, but Reno brushed aside the
proceeding by saying the case is clearly an immigration matter and
solely the responsibility of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami federal judge upheld Reno on the issue, and has ordered
Elian returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   With the reunion appearing likely in the next few days, the
biggest unknown remained Miami's exiles. Miami erupted into two
days of protests in January after federal officials ordered that
Elian should go back to his father, with groups of demonstrators
blocking the entrance to Miami's seaport and tangling traffic
around Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas blasted federal
officials, saying their insistence on returning Elian to his father
despite the Miami relatives' objections was ``provoking'' the
community. Penelas was widely criticized for the comments, with
some observers saying he almost encouraged the protests.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Penelas called for calm and said police would make
arrests to stop any violence or disruptions of the public order. He
also praised exile leaders who cancelled a planned traffic
slow-down at Miami International Airport. Just when that might
happen remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have insisted they will not break the law,
but have also said they will not take the boy to a neutral location
to meet his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't violate any laws,'' Delfin Gonzalez said Saturday at
a press conference in Maryland. ``But if the government needs to
come and pick him up, they know where we live.''

SEATTLE PROTESTORS ARE BACK, WITH A NEW TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``woman'' to ``women'' in 2nd graf.) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Beka Economopoulos, a 25-year-old environmental
campaigner with a premature streak of gray in her long black hair,
the drive to shut down the world's financial institutions began in
Seattle's King County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   She and about 250 other women spent five days there shortly
after Thanksgiving last year, most of them arrested for refusing to
disperse when the Seattle police told them to move on. Inside the
cells, they planned an encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five days they only thing we talked about was how to take
this to the next level,'' said Economopoulos, a Washington native
who now spends full time on this mix of environmental and economic
causes. ``You go through that, you know, and you're hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who disrupted the Seattle meeting of the
World Trade Organization are reassembling in Washington this week,
where they have identified as their targets two older, richer and
savvier agents of the global economy: the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. Students, church groups,
environmentalists, and labor unions, a few of them planning to
scale buildings and block traffic to make their point, say they
want to disrupt the spring meetings at both groups.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters contend that the institutions have destroyed rain
forests, left poor countries in debt, and protected Nike, Disney
and Monsanto instead of workers in the Third World. They estimate
that between 10,000 and 30,000 people will join the week-long
demonstrations beginning on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That would add a street dimension to a growing political and
academic fracas over how to change the two financial institutions
and, more broadly, whether globalization is hurting more people
than it helps.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the bank and the fund, which lend tens of
billions of dollars each year to poor and middle-income nations,
have come under strong pressure to slim down, pay more attention to
the side effects of their policies, and open up to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clinton administration has not reacted officially to
the protests, the United States, the largest donor to both
agencies, has a great deal at stake. At a time when America is
relying increasingly on the bank and the fund to manage the world
economy and spread American influence abroad, both agencies have
come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government has long done whatever it wants with these
institutions without anybody saying anything,'' says Jeffrey Sachs,
a Harvard economist who has become a leading critic of the sister
institutions. ``The tradition that allows the U.S. to create any
mission it wants for these institutions is being challenged _ and
it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the World Bank and IMF say that most of the
protesters and many political and academic critics have scant
knowledge of what these institutions do, and that the relative
health of the global economy these days proves that they are
effective. But the attacks have left the bank, the fund and the
Clinton administration on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that globalization has cut into a nerve _ many
people want more say and they should get it,'' said James D.
Wolfensohn, the World Bank president. But he adds that protesters
tend to extrapolate from a few past mistakes to condemn the whole
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some of the issues they raise, there will just have to be
differences of opinion,'' said Wolfensohn, a former investment
banker who in recent years has championed poverty relief projects.
``But people should also know that the bank is a very different
place than it was five years ago.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Washington protests may not mirror the unrest in Seattle,
where a rare alchemy of violence and vandalism by a small group of
anarchists botched crowd control by the police and dissolution
among world trade ministers gave opposition groups a notable
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But they do seem likely to show the ability of diverse
nongovernment organizations to mount a coordinated campaign against
a common enemy: globalization as envisioned by traditional,
free-market-oriented government economists. Communicating via the
Internet, about 450 groups are sponsoring the Washington
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   At a local planning session this week organized by the
Mobilization for Global Justice, veterans of Vietnam War-era
protests mingled with college students in T-shirts. A guitarist
sang in protest mode, paraphrasing a song by Leonard Cohen, ``First
we take Seattle, then we take D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had little of the visceral anger and fear of Vietnam
War protests or the passion of anti-apartheid demonstrations in the
1980s. Although one goal of the movement against globalization is
to turn the focus away from corporations to the poor nations of the
world, there were only a handful of people from what the
participants call the global South, or developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   One was Njoki Njoroge Njehu, a Kenyan who serves as one of the
movement's key ``facilitators.'' (Participants say there are no
generals, only lieutenants and ground troops.) She said the
coalition has managed to bridge different purposes because it
operates strictly by consensus. The process is mapped on a flow
chart on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are emulating the kind of world we are seeking, with total
transparency and without hierarchy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington protests will last for a week, beginning with a
march for debt relief organized by Jubilee 2000 Sunday and
culminating in rally-cum-civil-disobedience events on April 16 and
17, when the IMF and World Bank are scheduled to hold their spring
meetings and world finance ministers are to descend on the city.
</P>
<P>
   Police, wary of violence orchestrated by some 200 anarchists in
Seattle, have prepared for months in ensure that the meetings are
not disrupted. The main protest groups have pledged to demonstrate
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters view the World Bank and the IMF as global
loan sharks, hooking lower-income nations on cheap debt and then
insisting that they adopt free markets, unlimited investment,
privatization, restrained government spending, or risk a cut-off in
new aid.
</P>
<P>
   They are armed with research that they say shows some of the
poorest countries that get World Bank and IMF assistance,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have become dependent on loans.
They cite statistics that they say show that some African client
countries have experienced declining per capita income over the
last two decades, while other nations that shunned official aid
performed better.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the policies work, they often come at the expense of
the environment, others argue. The bank and the fund sometimes
require aid recipients to curtail fiscal spending and increase
exports to earn hard currency. To meet those targets, governments
often slash environmental protection budgets, they contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot conceive of policies more diametrically opposed to
sound management of resources'' than those preached by the bank and
the fund, said Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters have treated Sachs and Joseph E. Stiglitz, the
recently departed chief economist of the World Bank, as
intellectual leaders. Stiglitz's scathing insider critiques have
contributed to a raging debate in universities and in Congress
about the effectiveness of the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the protesters have implicit allies on the right. A
commission appointed by the Republican-controlled Congress to
recommend changes at the fund and bank last month called for an end
to long-term loans of the type criticized by environmentalists. The
commission also said the bank should act less like a bank and make
more grants, rather than loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath it all is a feeling that globalization has not
brought the benefits to the poor as promised,'' Stiglitz said.
``The architecture of the world financial system is decided by
finance ministers behind closed doors, but farmers and small
businessmen are the ones who get hurt.''

U.S. RESISTS PLAN TO END TARIFFS AND QUOTAS FOR POOR NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Eds: Changes end of 1st graf.)  By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is opposing a World Bank
proposal that would increase exports from the world's poorest and
most indebted nations for fear that it would inflame sentiments in
Congress against President Clinton's efforts to win passage of an
African trade bill and give China permanent normal trading status.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, pressed by the leaders of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund in preparation for their meetings here
next week, would allow some of the poorest nations of Africa, Latin
America and Asia to sell goods to the United States and other
Western nations without facing any tariffs or import quotas. That
could provide a huge economic advantage for those developing
countries, going significantly beyond the administration's efforts
to get Congress to forgive their debts as they undergo economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's opposition to the proposal comes at an
awkward moment, as demonstrators critical of the international
lending institutions assemble for a week of protests during their
meetings. Many of the protesters believe that the financial groups
do too little on behalf of the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   But as the trade proposal was argued out behind the closed doors
of the World Bank and the IMF, the administration worked behind the
scenes to scuttle it, said World Bank officials involved in the
negotiations. Those officials said they believed that the White
House feared that if they made such a commitment, it would undercut
the delicate support for the Africa trade bill, which has been
stuck in Congress, and that any promise of further opening
America's markets could undermine the huge effort to convince
Congress to normalize trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really caught in the middle here,'' one senior
administration official said on Friday, explaining why the White
House had refused to endorse a plan that would aid some of the most
struggling nations, including Senegal, Nicaragua, Congo, Kenya,
Honduras and Nigeria, which pose little competitive threat to
American firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to lift nations out of poverty is through
trade,'' the administration official said. ``But doing the right
thing here is not easy. We can't even get far more modest measures
through the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said she had
been unaware of the efforts to water down the World Bank effort.
But she said that ``the United States has a long record of support
for and delivery of preferential trade privileges for
least-developed countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the poorest countries, the United States, working with
Europe, Japan and Canada, have proposed an initiative'' that would
take much the same approach within the World Trade Organization,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a program, however, would likely be narrower in scope and
be enacted only after the Africa and China issues are already voted
on in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's quandary underscores the enormous economic
tensions that will be on display in Washington in coming days. Poor
nations will argue, as they did during the Seattle trade meetings
three months ago, that the United States and other rich nations are
using their enormous prosperity and technology to grow rapidly at
the expense of countries being left far behind by economic
globalization. That view is essentially endorsed in several reports
prepared for the spring meetings of the World Bank, which fights
poverty, and the IMF, which intercedes in economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   During his radio address Saturday, President Clinton briefly
mentioned his hope that Congress would agree to gradually wipe away
the debt of the poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   But in Congress, where labor unions and others have argued
against further opening of American markets at a time of record
trade deficits, there is enormous resistance to removing tariffs or
quotas that protect American industries from low-cost manufacturing
abroad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For example, the Africa trade bill, which passed the Senate last
November but never passed the House, now includes requirements that
African nations hoping to export more clothing to the United States
duty free must buy American fabrics. Few of the countries could
afford to do so, making the market opening relatively worthless to
African weavers or small manufacturers. (Africa's trade with the
United States is comparatively small. The entire continent exports
about $13 billion in goods to the United States each year, roughly
what Japan exports here in a month.)
</P>
<P>
   But without such trade restrictions, members of Congress from
textile-producing states say they would have to vote against the
Africa bill. And the World Bank and IMF proposals would have
essentially undercut the bill's protections for American companies,
committing the United States, Europe and Japan to unrestricted
import of clothing, footwear or other goods from the most indebted
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that any such end run around
Congress would inflame many members, especially Democrats, thus
threatening the passage of the Africa bill and China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, two main elements of Clinton's agenda
for his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Documents being prepared for discussion at next week's
Washington meetings are implicitly critical of how little the
world's wealthy nations have done to keep the divide between rich
and poor from increasing.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of one such paper, provided to The New York Times by the
World Bank, notes that during the Seattle meetings, the head of the
bank, James Wolfensohn, and the recently retired head of the IMF,
Michel Camdessus, called on major nations to spur imports from the
poorest nations. The paper describes the strategy as a way to
reverse the declining trend in foreign aid flows to these
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The paper refers to the critical importance of matching debt
relief with efforts to encourage exports that earn hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats involved in the drafting of the reports say that
the wording was toned down at the insistence of the United States
and, to a lesser degree, France and Japan. They all have a huge
sensitivity to opening their markets, particularly for agricultural
goods, and particularly in election years, one senior World Bank
official said. Instead of strongly recommending market openings,
the report now simply notes that ministers may wish to comment on
the subject.

A MATCH STIRS SEVEN DECADES OF HOCKEY MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Vt., Pa., N.J., Mass., Canada)   By HUGH WHITNEY MORRISON  Hugh Whitney Morrison, a Rhodes scholar
from Canada, was a journalist on the Toronto Star and later with
the radio network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one of the few living members of the Oxford University ice
hockey team of 1931-32, I was invited to go from Toronto to attend
the 100th anniversary game between Oxford and Cambridge, which took
place at Oxford on March 5. So, at age 91, I and C. Herbert Little,
of Ottawa, went to England, as guests of honor of the current
Oxford team to represent our team, which not only beat Cambridge in
'31 but also went on to win the 1932 English and European
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The 100th anniversary game was played at the new Oxford ice rink
before a capacity crowd of just 1,200 spectators, mostly from the
two universities. Oxford residents were conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   During the opening ceremonies, Little and I were presented with
special Oxford player jerseys with our names and the number ``31''
(for the year we played) emblazoned on the back. We also received
pewter mugs suitably engraved with the compliments of the Oxford
team's sponsor, the King's Arms, a well-known and ancient Oxford
hostelry. Seventy years ago, the Americans at Oxford dubbed it the
``Kappa Alpha House.''
</P>
<P>
   The official face-off was performed by the present Canadian high
commissioner (i.e., ambassador) to the United Kingdom, Roy
MacLaren, who, as a Cambridge postgrad, was booed politely by
Oxford adherents.
</P>
<P>
   The game that unfolded from there was a play of memory and
contrast for me.
</P>
<P>
   In my day, all the players on the 1931-32 Oxford team were
Rhodes scholars and all, except one, Canadians. The lone Yank on
the nine-player squad was Leland Watson from the University of
Minnesota. For the 100th anniversary game, there were only two
Rhodes scholars on the Oxford team.
</P>
<P>
   And while this year's team was predominantly Canadian, the two
stars for Oxford in the 100th anniversary game were the team's only
Americans: Jonathan Finer, from Norwich, Vt., by way of Harvard
'99, and Ian DeArdo, a four-year veteran from the University of
Pittsburgh and McGill.
</P>
<P>
   Finer, 24, had two goals and two assists and was named the
overall ``man of the match'' in a game won by Oxford, 4-2; DeArdo
was named Oxford's man of the match (each team had its own MVP as
well). So, these U.S. forwards were the top two skaters for Oxford,
leaving 15 Canadian teammates to look on, along with two Britons,
one German, one Australian and one Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge team showed a comparable complexity: two
Americans, Philip Coticelli, from Brick, N.J., and George
Whitesides, from Newton, Mass.; two Germans; two Britons; one
Swede; and 10 Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   That Finer was the only American Rhodes scholar in the Oxford
lineup would not in itself be noteworthy, but there was only one
other Rhodes scholar on Oxford's 22-man roster. He was Marc de
Rosnay, the lone Australian, a 6-foot, 182-pound defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   De Rosnay had the dubious distinction of receiving a match
penalty, halfway through the first period, for a head butt. It was
a late call, and by the linesman, not by the referee. So Oxford had
to play short-handed for five minutes, after which another Oxford
player took de Rosnay's place.
</P>
<P>
   This incident led me to reflections on the game today and as it
was 70 years ago when I was an Oxford left wing. In my time, all
teams were limited to a total of nine players, including one extra
forward line. We played on larger ice surfaces _ 200 feet long by
100 feet wide _ as against the standard rink today, which is only
85 feet wide. The result was much more of a wide-open,
passing-the-puck game with fewer penalties and thus less stoppage
of play and fewer short-handed situations.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties against boarding an opponent within 3 feet of the
boards were strictly enforced. Fighting was practically unknown.
Since there was less body contact, our equipment had no hip or
shoulder pads and, of course, no helmets. I can't recall a single
penalty (though there must have been a few) in our Oxford-Cambridge
match, which was played in London before several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   In our 25 other games that season in England and on the
Continent, I can recall very few penalties, all minor. In the 100th
anniversary match, Oxford had 11 penalties, which included 10
minors of two minutes each. Cambridge had only four minors. This is
not to imply that this anniversary match was a roughhouse affair
(it was not); only, as we used to say, chippy by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   In my day, there were no professional teams in England or
Western Europe (though some recruited special players disguised as
nationals). A new amateur English League with six teams, all in
major centers, was formed in 1931-32. My Oxford team played 12
games in it, about half of them at Oxford before 3,000 to 4,000
fans each game, and we were unbeaten and untied. At season's end
the city of Oxford (not the university) presented each of us with a
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison today, the Oxford team has had to play in smaller
rinks and against inferior amateur teams, since it can't compete
with the two professional leagues that now exist in England.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, both the university and ice hockey had a different
emphasis. Today, Oxford University attracts a higher proportion of
older students taking postgraduate degrees. The Oxford captain,
Steven Smith, 30, has already earned a biochemistry Ph.D. in Canada
and is pursuing further research in that field. For Cambridge, last
year's captain, James Branch, 32, also a Canadian, who scored both
his team's goals and was Cambridge's man of the match, holds an
MBA.
</P>
<P>
   To judge only by this one anniversary match, though the game as
it is played today may be comparatively rougher than in my day, it
is not yet anywhere near that in the National Hockey League, with
its recent alarming, violent incidents. For this, all of us who
have been involved as players or spectators in or at this annual
Oxford-Cambridge match over these many, many years can be thankful.

the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.'' Lipstadt
portrayed Irving, 62, as a prominent and dangerous ``Holocaust
denier,'' who believes the systematic murder of 6 million Jews by
the Nazis during World War II never took place. She also depicts
him as an extremist who manipulates, distorts and falsifies history
for his own purposes. We re-cap the story to this point; and why it

strong push in South Carolina has demonstrated to Georgia lawmakers
that they can't postpone the flag debate forever. But some
Democratic leaders were hoping to have the summer and fall to try
to build a coalition to push legislation in January to remove the
confederate battle emblem. With Marty King's pronouncement this
week that the state would be under a boycott if the change doesn't
occur next year, leaders have to try to figure out how to smooth
over the flag controversy, keep it from flaring into an election

   COXNET FOCUS 0408: A SEASON ON THE LAND -- More flue-cured
tobacco is grown in Pitt County, North Carolina, than anywhere else
in the nation. The culture and the economy are rooted in tending
the leaf, and in the self-reliant way of life such labor demands.
Yet as court rulings, public opinion and pressure from Washington
alter the fortunes of tobacco, change has made its way into the
fields. There will be fewer and fewer lives like the ones Betty and
W.C. Moore of Bethel live, shaped and bound by the rituals of
passing seasons on the farm. (Schulken, The Daily Reflector) Art
includes a 5-column color photo of a farmer tending his fields, a
2-column color photo of a farm, a 2-column color photo of a farmer
eating lunch with his family and a 1-column color photo of a
farmer's wife ringing the dinner bell.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TOBACCO PRIMER -- In their infancy tobacco plants look
like tiny shamrocks. As many as a million plants have taken root in
the warmth of W.C. Moore's greenhouse, snug in Styrofoam seed
crates, resting on a bed of water. They were sowed in mid-March,
and in April, when the threat of a hard freeze is past, they will
be transplanted in the field, the first crop of a new century. The
green fuzz sprouting in the seed crates doesn't look like much. But
with an average price, the half-million pounds of leaf it will grow
into could net $850,000. (Schulken, The Daily Reflector) Art

professor Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books for
libel over assertions made about him in her 1994 book, ``Denying
the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and
</P>
<P>
   Memory.'' Lipstadt portrayed Irving, 62, as a prominent and
dangerous ``Holocaust denier,'' who believes the systematic murder
of 6 million Jews by the Nazis during World War II never took
place. She also depicts him as an extremist who manipulates,
distorts and falsifies history for his own purposes. We re-cap the
story to this point; and why it is important. (Roughton, Cox News

   HANK-WILLIAMSIII _ Looking at 27-year-old Shelton Hank Williams
_ or Hank III as he's calling himself these days _ is like staring
into the face of a ghost. He is the spitting image of his famous
grandfather _ tall, skinny, almost woefully pale with thin lips and
chisled nose that could be reprinted straight from old black and
white publicity photos made in the 1940s. Deep in the back of a
mint green tour bus, the young legacy sits hunched over a beaten
guitar staring aimlessly at the worn carpet under his shredded
cowboy boots, waiting to go onstage in front of hundreds of pierced
and tattooed punk rockers at the cavernous Atlanta nightspot, The
Masquerade. As he launches a music career _ which started out
country and has now careened into thrash rock _ he seems keenly
aware of the inevitable comparisons that will be made to his family
tree. And Hank III has made a decision: He's going to uphold the
hard-living Family Tradition. (MLongino, Atlanta

   BKO-BASKETBALL-TRAGEDY _ On the afternoon of Sept. 16, Travis
Davenport lifted weights and shot hoops at his old high school
gymnasium. As always, his closest friends discouraged him from
joining their pick-up game. They echoed the advice of his doctors,
his pastor, his mother and other grown-ups. This time, Travis
listened, although it surely pained him. Basketball was his
passion. He played it year-round until the first in a series of
fainting spells. Even then, he occasionally would slip onto the
court. Just a few days earlier, a cardiologist had restated in no
uncertain terms that he must give up the game. So Travis, obediant,
tossed up casual jumpshots in the gym before heading south, back to
college in Cochran. That night, he collapsed and died. (Tierney,

 &HT;    Penn State duo taking NFL draft by storm
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Penn State's players and coaches called Courtney Brown
the ``Quiet Storm,'' because of the defensive end's soft-spoken
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, LaVar Arrington stormed through Penn State like no
other player in the program's storied history. For three seasons,
the rebel linebacker butted heads with legendary coach Joe Paterno,
and even attacked an opposing kicker on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their strikingly different personalities and
backgrounds, one of the Penn State stars will be the No. 1 pick in
Saturday's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Browns officials say they'll choose one of them with
the first choice, and the Washington Redskins could draft the other
player with the second or third pick.
</P>
<P>
   Both players visited with the Browns on Thursday, and the
outspoken Arrington told his potential employer who he'd take.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the No. 1 pick, I would probably take (No.) 86,''
Arrington said, referring to Brown. ``But it would be nice if they
took (me).''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington and Brown would become only the sixth pair of college
teammates since 1967 to be selected within the first three picks of
the draft. Ohio State offensive tackle Orlando Pace (drafted No. 1
by the Rams) and cornerback Shawn Springs (No. 3 by the Seahawks)
were the most recent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And, although it seems like a remote possibility, both players
are holding out hope that the Browns will draft Florida State
receiver Peter Warrick with the No. 1 pick. That would leave
Arrington and Brown for the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's pretty exciting, the chance of Courtney and me
being on the same pro team,'' Arrington said. ``We're real close.
He's family to me. He's a heck of a guy. He might not always talk
and let people know, but he's a great person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caused a lot of problems in college and we're only going to
get older and more mature. So that can cause more problems in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, it was believed that Brown, 6 feet 5 and
269 pounds, jumped ahead of Arrington and Warrick after his
on-campus workout March 16. Brown ran the 40-yard dash in 4.55
seconds, which is faster than some running backs and receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't find many players coming into the draft who have
everything it takes like (Brown) does,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher
said. ``He's got size, speed, great character. He can play either
side (of the line). He's just a great, great prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown grew up in the small town of Alvin, S.C., with his distant
cousin, Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton. Brown goes to Bible
reading once or twice a week, and asked his family members and
friends not to talk to the media about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They named Alvin the `Home of Joe Hamilton,' but I think that
was a little premature because Courtney's about to rebuild the
town,'' Hamilton said. ``He's going to be top dog in the county,
definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown might not be the top dog in the draft. It is believed
that Arrington, 6 feet 3 and 250 pounds, could be gaining momentum.
He has apparently recovered from a lackluster workout, in which he
ran only slightly faster than Brown, despite being about 20 pounds
lighter than his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   That could be bad news for the Redskins, who reportedly covet
Arrington at outside linebacker. Washington really doesn't need
another defensive end after re-signing Marco Coleman in the
offseason, and also adding future Hall of Famer Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins reportedly will take Alabama offensive tackle Chris
Samuels with one of their first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Arrington) is driven,'' said Foge Fazio, the Redskins' new
linebackers coach. ``He's competitive. He loves the game and plays
with passion. He seems smart enough to come in and contribute right
away. There's no doubt in my mind this guy can come in and have a
positive impact for us. ... I hope we can get him. This guy can
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, who grew up in Pittsburgh, said he'll be happy in
Cleveland or Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a ballplayer,'' he said, ``and whatever city welcomes me
with open arms will be the city I play my heart out for. You never
can tell what they're thinking. (The Browns) said they don't know.
At this point, I'm kind of confident that maybe I'll end up in
Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Browns coach Chris Palmer admits that it will be difficult to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Arrington and you say to yourself, `Here's a guy
that's going to play every down,''' Palmer said. ``I think both of
those guys are top picks because both guys are every-down players.
A lot of times there's a linebacker that can only play on first and
second down, or a guy's not fast enough and he's got to come off
the field on third down. But both of these guys can make a
difference on any down.''

PENNINGTON'S THE ONE IN NFL QB DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes top prospects text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's quarterback crop won't capture the hype of last
year's, in fact, the focus in next Saturday's NFL draft will center
on just one man _ Marshall's Chad Pennington. But even Pennington
is not considered a top-five pick, with teams like Pittsburgh (8),
Denver (10), and San Francisco (12) pondering whether to use a pick
on him.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington is 6 feet 3 inches, 229 pounds, and an Academic
All-American. Tall, strong, and smart, attributes that endear him
to NFL general managers. But it's what he did with Marshall's
offense that has attracted NFL suitors. He threw for more than
3,500 yards in each of his three seasons, and over the past two
seasons he had a total of 76 touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Bowl MVP has traits that coaches such as Denver's
Mike Shanahan appreciate in a quarterback. He has the ability to
recognize defenses at the line of scrimmage and audibilize; he runs
the clock well; and he is mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington has to prove he can throw the long ball in the NFL,
though a West Coast offense (Denver, San Francisco?) might suit him
well.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Pennington, the early round selections appear to be
Louisville's Chris Redman, Tennessee's Tee Martin, Florida's Doug
Johnson, Hofstra's Giovanni Carmazzi, Michigan's Tom Brady, and
Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay.
</P>
<P>
   Redman is similar in size to Pennington _ 6-2, 222 pounds _ but
he doesn't run as well. The attraction he holds for scouts is his
toughness. He has a gritty nature, a la Phil Simms and Terry
Bradshaw, which is a positive and a negative. His reckless style
has made him injury-prone. Scouts like his accuracy and the way he
handles the ball (like Peyton Manning), especially on the
play-action fake.
</P>
<P>
   He threw for 3,614 yards last year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who did not have a spectacular senior year _ hurting his
draft position _ is the most athletic quarterback in the draft. He
is Donovan McNabb-like in his mobility. One thing in Martin's favor
is that he won a national championship two years ago and displays
leadership qualities that coaches love.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is an excellent physical talent, but he is not at top of
QB class because of his past commitment to baseball. He was a Tampa
Bay Devil Rays farmhand until he hurt his rotator cuff. Despite the
injury, scouts like his arm strength and his ability to throw it
deep. Because of his inexperience, he has a tendency to make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Carmazzi has been the rising star in the QB pool. He may be the
fastest of the lot, running 40 yards in 4.7 seconds at the combine.
The Academic All-American threw for 3,200 yards last season and is
capable of running with the ball. He's also considered a project,
but because of his intelligence and mobility, he may come along
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, nearly 6-5 and 210 pounds, is a dropback passer who
finally developed in his senior season. He was a bigtime player for
the Wolverines, making big plays when the team needed them. He was
not awed by any situation or event. Scouts like his calmness but
don't see him as a huge talent.
</P>
<P>
   Rattay comes from a run-and-shoot offense at Louisiana Tech, so
he will have to adapt his talents to the pro game. He's 6 feet and
mobile, best suited for an offense like the Tennessee Titans' where
Steve McNair throws a lot of short passes.
</P>
<P>
   The sleeper: Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton. He's 5-10, but he's a
superb athlete who belongs on an NFL roster.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Just read the title of his new book and you'll get an
idea of Noel Mamere's perspective: ``No Thanks, Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamere, an outspoken though hardly extreme member of the French
Parliament, has devoted an entire book to his argument that America
is a worrisome society these days. It has a record number of armed
citizens. It embraces the death penalty, turns the poor away when
they need medical care, and its legislators have failed to approve
a nuclear test ban. Yet, argues Mamere, the United States throws
its weight around and would have the entire world follow in its
steps.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, he says in his closing chapter, ``it is
appropriate to be downright anti-American.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, indeed in Europe, Mamere is by no means alone in his
criticism of the United States. Wander into a French bookstore
these days, and you will find any number of catchy titles (``The
World Is Not Merchandise,'' ``Who Is Killing France? The American
Strategy,'' ``American Totalitarianism'' to name a few) deploring
the American way _ from its creation of a society ruled by profit
motive to how the United States is now an unchecked force on its
way to ruling the world.
</P>
<P>
   The books are only one sign of what experts say is a growing
backlash of anti-Americanism. More and more often, Europeans talk
about America as a menacing, even dangerous force intent on
remaking the world in its image. And, like Mamere, many members of
Europe's political, cultural and intellectual elite are using a
kind of moral calculator to deplore the American model as severely
wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Poking fun at America has always been a European pastime,
particularly among the French. In the past, Americans have been
ridiculed as Bermuda-shorts-wearing louts who call strangers by
their first names and know nothing about the good life. But today's
criticism is far from being an amusing rejection of food rituals.
Experts say that it has a virulence and an element of fear never
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the fall of the Berlin Wall, America was left as the only
superpower,'' said Stephane Rozes, the director general of CSA
Opinion, which conducts many surveys for news organizations. ``And
there is a great deal of fear out there that the strength of
America's economy will impose not only economic changes, but social
changes as well. What they see is an America that has the ability
to impose its values, and they are not values that the Europeans
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans read menace in a wide range of recent events. Far
from seeing U.S. involvement in Kosovo as a hand of support from
across the Atlantic, for instance, many Europeans saw it as a U.S.
manipulation of NATO. And the humiliating fact that the
intervention would not have been possible without U.S. air power
only rammed home the perception of America's military superiority,
and of European deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But suspicion runs high in other areas as well. The Clinton
administration's cheerleading _ for instance, its repeated
description of the United States as being the ``indispensable''
nation _ strikes a threatening chord here. And recent disputes such
as America's decision last year to impose an import tax on goods
like Roquefort cheese and foie gras because the Europeans would not
accept hormone-enhanced beef from the United States only fuels the
European sense that the United States is a bully.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, these days, the World Trade Organization _ which
sanctioned the U.S. action _ is routinely dismissed as a tool of
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the United States is already using its vast
satellite and spy networks for industrial espionage is readily
accepted here, as recent debate in the European Union on the
Echelon electronic surveillance system showed. The United States
denied the charges, but the European bloc is still mulling an
investigation. Again, the size and scope of the surveillance system
make Europe feel dwarfed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the recent debacle over picking a new managing director for
the International Monetary Fund fueled the sense among some
Europeans that the United States can do whatever it wants. In
Washington, government officials let it be known that they were
opposing the first German candidate because, they said, no one in
Europe wanted to do the dirty work of pointing out his
inadequacies. That version of events did not get much press here.
In Germany, the U.S. veto power provoked snide remarks about the
Superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discovered that the superpower sees its global role
not only in the military area but also in setting the rules of
globalization through the IMF,'' pronounced Michael Steiner, chief
diplomatic adviser to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in the middle
of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the average European is embracing much of what is
American. Its films, its music, its fashion and, even if no-one in
France particularly cares to admit it, its fast food. The weekly
best-seller list shows more than half the top selling novels in
France are translations of American books. There are frequent
complaints of a brain drain as young people flock to Silicon Valley
and elsewhere in America to get their start in life.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time the view of a belligerent United States is
growing too. Polls conducted by CSA in the last few years suggest
that Europeans have some extremely negative views of the United
States. In April last year, 68 percent of the French said they were
worried about America's status as a superpower. Only 30 percent
said there was anything to admire across the Atlantic. Sixty-three
percent said they did not feel close to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Another CSA poll in September 1998, which compared the attitudes
of the Germans, Spanish, French, Italian and British toward the
United States, found they had deep reservations too. The Italians
seemed to appreciate America the most. But they still showed
profound concern about the American model. Between 57 and 60
percent said America's democracy and economy were worth admiring.
But 56 to 62 percent said Italians should not look to America for
inspiration on their way of life or their culture.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the impression that America has no more enemy,'' says
Michel Winock, a professor at the Institute d'Etudes Politiques de
Paris who often writes on the subject of anti-Americanism. ``It
does what it likes now when it wants. Through NATO it directs
European affairs. Before we could say we were on America's side.
Not now. There is no counterbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   On some social issues, the United States and Europe do seem to
be going in opposite directions. One that gets a lot of attention
is the death penalty, which has either been abolished or suspended
by all members of the European Union but is now legal in 38 states.
Coming executions are often carefully followed here as examples of
barbarism, and U.S. diplomats say they are bombarded with questions
about them. The fact that many recent executions have taken place
in Texas also colors _ negatively _ European commentators' views of
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But other aspects of America are deplored too. Essayists have a
field day with descriptions of the homeless on the streets, women
in jail forced to give birth in handcuffs, drugs, police violence,
racism and what they see as a puritanism that invades people's
private lives, the prime example being the reaction to the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has America been so loved and so hated,'' says the
novelist Pascal Bruckner, who has also written on anti-Americanism.
``But in some ways America should be glad. We are not condemning
the Russians for a lack of morality. We don't care. They don't
count.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rohatyn says he has felt the change of attitude take place
since 1997, when he came to Paris as the U.S. ambassador to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-Americanism today encompasses not a specific policy
like Iranian sanctions but a feeling that globalization has an
American face on it and is a danger to the European and French view
of society,'' Rohatyn said in an interview. ``There is the sense
that America is such an extraordinary power that it can crush
everything in its way. It is more frustration and anxiety now than
plain anti-Americanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohatyn, like many others, says it is hard to measure the
consequences of this attitude, though there are no doubt many. ``It
impacts most things,'' he said. ``Not that it makes transactions
impossible, but it certainly puts a different slant on them. It
totally negates the notion that our interest is also in their
interest. It creates the totally opposite point of view _ that only
the weakening of America can be good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an attitude, for instance, fed a recent frenzy of concern
in France over the amount of American investment here. Newspaper
articles suggested that American pension fund investments in French
companies were promoting layoffs of French workers to benefit
American retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's just not the case,'' Rohatyn said. ``That is not
the way things work, but it is a perfect example of that
anti-American view at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans believe that part of the problem is that
globalization has meant an increase in Americans doing business
abroad with methods that do not sit well with Europeans. These
Americans say that Americans tend to try to cut short discussion
and value quick decisions. Europeans tend to take longer and look
for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   But the French, and other Europeans, often mention Americans'
lack of knowledge about anything European and their unwillingness
to learn as a major aggravating factor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner described how when he was living in San Diego his
landlady asked him about his queen, even though France has not had
one since the 19th century. Mamere begins his book with a story
about how Steve Forbes, at a recent Davos meeting, invoked the
image of a Charlemagne who unified Europe two centuries ago.
Charlemagne died more than 1,000 years ago and is usually billed as
a conqueror, not a unifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omnipotence and ignorance,'' Mamere concludes about America in
his first chapter. ``It is a questionable cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamere's book, written with Olivier Warin, has not been
published in America, nor does he expect it to be. ``It would be
great if they read some of what we write, but they do not,'' he
said. ``It would be great if they saw what they looked like from
over here. But they are not interested. The Americans are so sure
of themselves. They think they are the best in the world, that they
are way ahead of everyone and everyone needs to learn from them.''

 TERENCE McKENNA, 53, PATRON OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terence McKenna, who so playfully and persistently pressed his
message that psychedelic drugs are mankind's salvation that Timothy
Leary himself christened him ``the Timothy Leary of the '90s,''
died April 3 at a friend's home in San Rafael, Calif. He was 53 and
lived on the South Kona Coast of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was brain cancer, said a publicist for his
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``If psychedelics don't ready you for the great beyond, then I
don't know what really does,'' McKenna said in December in one of
his last public speeches, at the Esalen Institute. Death, he said
then, felt close.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna combined a leprechaun's wit with a poet's sensibility to
brew a New Age stew with ingredients including flying saucers,
elves and the I Ching. The essential seasoning was the psychedelic
mushrooms that transformed his life and that he recommended _ in
``heroic doses'' _ for virtually everyone.
</P>
<P>
   He lived on the wild side of a wild generation. He dropped acid
in San Francisco in the 1960s, smuggled hashish in India and
searched the jungles of the Amazon for the magic mushrooms. He told
interviewers that he had smoked marijuana every day from the time
he was a teen-ager. In the 1990s, McKenna gained fame by delivering
his drug pitch to a new generation at nightclub ``raves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My real function was to give people permission,'' he said in
an article to appear in the May issue of Wired magazine.
``Essentially, what I existed for was to say, `Go ahead, you'll
live through it, get loaded, you don't have to be afraid.'''
</P>
<P>
   In lectures, in recordings and in five books, McKenna made his
case for illegal substances that many experts consider highly
dangerous. He had a grand theory: that psychedelic mushrooms are
the missing link in the story of human evolution. Not until our
primate ancestors began eating hallucinatory psilocybin mushrooms,
he contended, did they begin to acquire human qualities.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna, a lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard and deep-set
eyes, also professed to know exactly when the world would end: Dec.
22, 2012. He came to this conclusion through a mathematical
construct that he based on the I Ching, the ancient Chinese book of
divination.
</P>
<P>
   The package he pushed struck a chord, at least among the usual
suspects. Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead called him ``the only
person who has made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts on drug treatment attacked McKenna for popularizing
dangerous substances. ``Surely the fact that Terence McKenna says
that the psilocybin mushroom `is the megaphone used by an alien,
intergalactic Other to communicate with mankind' is enough for us
to wonder if taking LSD has done something to his mental
faculties,'' Judy Corman, vice president of Phoenix House of New
York, a drug treatment center, said in a letter to The New York
Times in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Still others had big trouble with his self-consciously cosmic
literary style. ``I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while
reading his shrilly ecstatic prose,'' Peter Conrad wrote in The New
York Times in a 1993 review of McKenna's book ``True
Hallucinations,'' published by Harper San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But many marveled at his stream of novel thoughts. ``To write
him off as a crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not
only full of fascinating ideas but also blessed with a sense of
humor and self-parody,'' Tom Hodgkinson wrote in The New Statesman
and Society in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Kemp McKenna was born on Nov. 16, 1946, in a Colorado
cattle and coal town, Paonia. He was a youth given to memorizing
passages of James Joyce and reading Carl Jung's ``Psychology and
Alchemy,'' and his main satisfactions percolated from his fertile
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my first encounter with psychedelics was looking at
Colorado and trying to understand that it was once the shores of an
ocean with hundred-foot-long sauropods tromping through the
mangrove swamps,'' he told Details magazine in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He found his way to San Francisco in 1965. According to the
April 1993 issue of Details magazine, Barry Melton, the guitarist
for Country Joe &AMP; the Fish, introduced him to marijuana in 1965.
Soon he tried LSD.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley that
year and was accepted into the Tussman Experimental College, which
emphasized self-direction. After the two-year program, he embarked
on travels around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 he and his brother, Dennis, journeyed to the Amazon
jungle in search of psychedelic plants. In a tiny mission
settlement in southern Colombia, they encountered, for the first
time, what drug enthusiasts call ``magic mushrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, the story goes, believed he could mentally cause any
telephone in history to ring. He placed a call to the McKennas'
mother in 1953 and reached her listening to Dizzy Dean calling a
World Series game. She refused to believe it was Dennis on the
line, because she could see his sleeping 3-year-old form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, McKenna returned to Berkeley to finish college. He
completed a self-tailored degree in ecology, resource recovery and
shamanism. His mind was focused on, and certainly by, mushrooms. No
one had yet figured out how to cultivate the mushrooms in the
United States, but the McKennas brought the South American secrets
home. They published them, and in the 1980s were growing 70 pounds
every six weeks. The operation ended when a friend was arrested for
his fungus farm.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the two brothers published their first book, ``The
Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching.'' McKenna
began to lecture both to old hippies and to converts to the
emerging New Age.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wired, he drifted into the role of ``charismatic
talking head.'' He wrote four books in the early 1990s. In addition
to ``True Hallucinations,'' they were ``Food of the Gods'' (Bantam,
1992); ``The Archaic Revival'' (Harper San Francisco); and
``Trialogues at the Edge of the West,'' written with Ralph Abraham
and Rupert Sheldrake (Bear &AMP; Co., 1992).
</P>
<P>
   McKenna met his wife, Kathleen Harrison, in Jerusalem in the
mid-1970s. They settled in Occidental, a small town north of San
Francisco. They had a son, Finn, who now lives in Jersey City,
N.J., and a daughter, Klea, of Santa Cruz, Calif. He is also
survived by his brother, Dennis, who lives in Minneapolis.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After a divorce in 1992, McKenna moved to Hawaii, where he and
his former wife owned property. McKenna built a modernist house,
which is topped with a huge antenna dish for the Internet
communications with which he became enamored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without sounding too cliche, the Internet really is the birth
of global mind,'' he told Wired. ``That's what a god is. Somebody
who knows more than you do about whatever you're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   When he fell ill last May, McKenna was enjoying a new life with
Christy Silness, a young woman he had met the year before at an
ethnobotanical conference in the Yucatan. He had medical treatment
for glioblastoma multiforma, a rare form of brain cancer, while
friends and followers added more esoteric touches.
</P>
<P>
   A self-styled ``grand kahuna of Polynesia'' biked up the
mountain to meditate at his bedside. A Nevada disc jockey, Art
Bell, asked his 13 million listeners to send good vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   Wired said that McKenna, like many others, wondered whether a
lifetime of drug use might be to blame for his brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what about it?'' he asked his doctors. ``You want to hammer
on me about that?'' They assured him there was no causal link.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what about 35 years of daily dope smoking?'' he asked. They
pointed to studies suggesting that cannabis may shrink tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' McKenna told them, ``if cannabis shrinks tumors, we
wouldn't be having this discussion.''

ENRIQUE ESPINOZA, 87, CHRISTMAS-TREE ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By ENID NEMY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Enrique Espinoza, an artist who with Loretta Hines
Howard created elaborate Christmas trees that were displayed
annually at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the White House,
died March 21 at the Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. A resident of
Manhattan, he was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza began his association with Howard in 1968. As a girl,
she began collecting 18th-century Neapolitan figures, and conceived
their eventual use in a Christmas tree creche at the Metropolitan.
Most of the creche figures, from 6 to 20 inches in height, were
donated to the museum by Howard before her death in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   For over three decades, Espinoza was responsible for
constructing and painting the landscape, framing the figures of the
Nativity scene and designing the star perched on the top of the
tree. He continued to assemble the tree until the year before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   The tree, now a Christmas tradition in the museum's Medieval
Sculpture Hall, has a sculpted base with a landscape of figures
re-enacting Christ's nativity. Three sumptuously dressed magi are
surrounded by their entourages and lifelike beasts of burden. The
figure of the infant Jesus lies on a nest of straw, flanked by Mary
and Joseph. Above them, suspended from the branches, about 50 large
angels hover.
</P>
<P>
   During the Carter administration, Espinoza and Howard also
created a Christmas tree and creche for the White House. It is
still displayed during the holiday season, as is another
installation done for the Albright Knox Museum in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza was born in Alpine, Texas, on Feb. 25, 1913, and
attended the New Orleans Art Institute. During World War II he
served in the Army as an artist and painted battle scenes, which
are now in the Army archives.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York after the war, attended the New School and
worked in what was a new field at the time, art therapy. Later, he
became an art restorer and taught art.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza is survived by a brother, Manuel Espinoza, and a
sister, Adela Breeland, both of Odessa, Texas.

DINA ABRAMOWICZ, 90, LIBRARIAN AND YIDDISH EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dina Abramowicz, the longtime librarian at the YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research whose firsthand and encyclopedic
knowledge of the lost Yiddish world of Eastern Europe made her a
treasured resource for hundreds of scholars and writers for over
half a century, died April 3 at Beth Israel Medical Center in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowicz had a formidable memory, and not only for those who
peopled her cherished birthplace _ Vilna, Lithuania, the great
center of Yiddish culture now known as Vilnius, where the YIVO
collection originated.
</P>
<P>
   Her mind was a mental card catalog for hundreds of rare and
obscure books and historical materials in the dusty YIVO stacks.
And she hunted them down for scholars like Irving Howe and
novelists like Leon Uris as well as for thousands of ordinary
people trying to research their family histories.
</P>
<P>
   When George F. Kennan, the diplomat and historian, was looking
for material one day on a 19th-century convert to Christianity, she
led him not only to the entry in the library's precious
Russian-Jewish encyclopedia but also to a scarce book in Yiddish
about Jewish apostates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of book that Dina knew off the top of her
head,'' said Zachary Baker, who succeeded Abramowicz as YIVO's head
librarian and now is curator of Judaica at Stanford University's
library.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Esther Hautzig, a Manhattan book editor and writer
who grew up in Vilna, said of her, ``No computer on earth can store
the information she had in her brain, because she lived through
it.'' She remembers Abramowicz as the librarian who provided her
with her first library card.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, Abramowicz received inquiries from journalists and
writers who liked to season their prose with a word or two of
Yiddish. They relied on Abramowicz as their authority for the
transliterated spelling of words like ``bobe'' (grandmother) and
``yichus'' (pedigree).
</P>
<P>
   Though less than 5 feet tall and dainty in an Old World way,
Abramowicz could be flintlike in her insistence upon historical and
linguistic accuracy. When a letter to The New York Times stated
that the word ``Holocaust'' was first used in the Dec. 24, 1942,
daily bulletin of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, she made sure to
write a corrective letter.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's bulletin, she pointed out, used a term translatable
as ``atrocities,'' not ``Holocaust,'' and the probable first use of
``Holocaust'' to refer to the mass slaughter of Jews was from the
May 14, 1943, Polish daily Nowy Dzien, which used the Polish word
for holocaust, ``calopalenie,'' to describe the liquidation of the
Warsaw Ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Her life, sorrowful as parts of it were, had a striking
symmetry, from Vilna to the New York home of the archives rescued
from Vilna.
</P>
<P>
   Vilna was fiercely loved by its Jewish inhabitants as the
``Jerusalem of Lithuania,'' a city of writers like Chaim Grade and
Abraham Sutzkever.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowicz was the librarian first of Vilna's Jewish children's
library and then, after the Nazis herded Jews into ghettos, of the
ghetto library. When she came to New York in 1946, she soon went to
work for the transplanted version of one of Vilna's most important
institutions, the YIVO library, many of whose thousands of books
and artifacts had been smuggled out by a ragtag band of slave
laborers and partisans known as the paper brigade.
</P>
<P>
   She was YIVO's head librarian for 25 years, until 1987; then in
her late 70s, she was eased off to work as research librarian, a
position she held until her death.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of teachers, Abramowicz was born in 1909, when
Vilna was part of the czar's empire; it was to live under Polish,
Lithuanian, German and Soviet Russian governments before she left.
She grew up speaking Russian, but when the Germans occupied Vilna
during World War I, they allowed Jews to start their own schools,
as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy, and Dina's parents sent
her to Yiddish-language elementary and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   After studying Polish literature in university, she went to work
for her first library, the Kinderbibliotek. She also became a
member of YIVO, the acronym for the Yiddish name of the Yiddish
Scientific Institute, an organization founded in 1925. It soon
became a repository of manuscripts of Sholem Aleichem and Biaklik,
records of Jewish communal governments and other historical
documents as well as thousands of books.
</P>
<P>
   When the Germans invaded in World War II and crammed Vilna's
56,000 Jews into neighborhood ghettos, Herman Kruk, a librarian,
tried to maintain an oasis of normality in the madness by setting
up a library, and he asked Abramowicz to staff it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who
will come to read books there?'' she remembered asking a fellow
librarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd
situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?'' was the
answer she remembered getting.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, the library circulated 100,000 books to its
starving, brutalized readers _ mostly, it turned out, escapist
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated. Abramowicz's
mother was dispatched to Treblinka, where she was killed;
Abramowicz was sent to a labor camp. By a stroke of fortune, the
door on the cattle train opened on the Vilna platform and she
simply walked off. She wound up in a less rigorous camp, one for
workers who processed fur for the German army's winter coats. She
escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a
nurse's helper.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, she found her father in New York, where he had
traveled just before the war broke out in September 1939. She soon
met Max Weinreich, a surviving YIVO founder, and joined him in
reconstituting the YIVO collection in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond helping scholars who visited the Vanderbilt mansion that
for years housed YIVO and its new home, Abramowicz seemed to take
on the search for roots as a personal compulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain periods of your life, you start to want to find out
what happened to your parents,'' she said once. ``I think it is the
survival instinct of a people trying to find out who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than two nephews and a niece, Abramowicz left no
survivors. But her name endures in dozens of acknowledgments by the
authors whose research she shepherded. In his tribute in ``The
World of Our Fathers,'' the classic work about the immigrant Jews
of New York, Howe thanked YIVO for making the book possible,
``especially its indefatigable and splendid librarian, Dina
Abramowicz.''

CLINTON TO MEET SEPARATELY WITH BARAK AND ARAFAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to reinvigorate the stalled Middle East
peace talks, President Clinton will meet here separately beginning
this week with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, the White House said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is due to come here on Tuesday. Arafat will come on April
20, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House restated the goal, embraced by the Israelis and
Palestinians, of reaching a final agreement by Sept. 13 on
questions like the future of Jerusalem, the shape of borders
between Israel and a Palestinian entity and the future of
Palestinian refugees. Arafat has said that if such an agreement is
not reached, he will unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have been running well behind schedule. Teams of
midlevel officials representing Israel and the Palestinians began a
new round of talks on Friday in seclusion at Bolling Air Force Base
in suburban Maryland. The same negotiators met at Bolling for a
week last month, apparently without much progress.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said last week that the negotiators were not
likely to bridge their differences without direct participation by
their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   During their visits, Barak and Arafat will also meet with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton and Barak would also discuss the
status of talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met for three hours with the Syrian leader, Hafez Assad
in Switzerland on March 26 in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade
Assad to moderate his differences with Israel and rejoin peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   That failure seemed to dash Clinton's hopes of presiding over a
comprehensive peace agreement among Syria, the Palestinians and
Israel before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States, Clinton said it was up to
Assad to make the next move. Administration officials said Assad
had stuck to his view that Israel should return land seized from
Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak will also discuss Israel's decision to
withdraw from Lebanon by July.

 &HT;    Mulholland outing cause for concern
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A record 57 homers were hit in the major leagues
Friday night. Unfortunately, for the Braves, new fourth starter
Terry Mulholland gave up three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds, Bobby Estalella and Jeff Kent hit home runs as the
San Francisco Giants opened a three-game weekend series with a 6-2
victory at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland didn't get out of the fourth inning against the
Giants, doing nothing to ease Braves concerns about the tail end of
their rotation without John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves don't need a fifth starter until April 22, but right
now they don't have a solid fourth behind Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine
and Kevin Millwood. Glavine pitches against the Giants today.
</P>
<P>
   Will the present plan suffice? Or will the Braves have to look
outside the organization, or at using young arms like Luis Rivera
and Bruce Chen? When might Steve Avery fit into the picture, or
John Burkett?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Braves' luxury of four strong starters in a row
might be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants needed only three-plus innings to catapult three
homers into the center-field seats off Mulholland, who hadn't given
up three in a game since 1996 with the Phillies. After the third
one, by Kent in the fourth inning, the Giants loaded the bases and
ended Mulholland's night on a base hit by pitcher Mark Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit the ball where our guys weren't, mainly on the other
side of the fence,'' Mulholland said. ``It's not the performance I
was looking for tonight. I don't think Bobby Cox or Leo Mazzone
were either.... I'd get guys where I wanted them in terms of
setting somebody up and I wasn't putting them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, who had harnessed his control in his final two
starts of the spring, didn't have it Friday, leaving pitches up and
over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   He never got much help offensively. Andruw Jones and Javy Lopez
each homered with the bases empty, but otherwise the Braves
stranded nine runners in seven-plus innings against the 38-year-old
Gardner, who's trying to win a spot in the Giants' rotation while
Shawn Estes is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hitting his spots and throwing on the corner,'' Lopez
said.

`LEARNING EXPERIENCE' FOR ODOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The payday for doomsday prophecy seemed to arrive
when the Clippers' prized rookie was introduced before a
season-opening scrimmage at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The public address employee referred to the gifted and
controversial messiah candidate as ``Larry Odom.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded perfect. Odom, also known as ``Lamar'' to his friends
and almost everyone else on the planet, appeared to be in the
perfect place for the predicted, diabolical ruination of his mighty
skills.
</P>
<P>
   And he arrived with historical debris of his own. Even Southwest
Airlines couldn't lose all of this guy's baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Being drafted and hired by the Clippers - in the rolling eyes of
basketball observers - was as dangerous as plutonium in the mitts
of The Simpsons.
</P>
<P>
   So ... with less than two weeks before the Clips fire up their
TVs for the playoffs, let's take at look at their journey with
Odom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a learning experience ... it makes you appreciate
winning,'' said Odom of his first year in what's commonly judged as
NBA purgatory. ``But you can't let it affect your long-term mental
approach. You can't let losing become you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice words, but what's he done to alter the perception, to help
produce victories? Try 16.7 points, 7.8 rebounds, 4.1 assists and
1.3 rebounds per game. The 20-year-old, 6-foot-10 multi-position
kid from NYC via Rhode Island and a fistful of AAU revivals can
fill a stat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite solemn oaths to make himself better, Odom hasn't
put in the extra work necessary to make the mid-range jumper, or
outwit wily defenders by occasionally using his right hand to avoid
a charging foul. He didn't move into the weight room to accrue the
necessary strength to finish plays. His habit of whining about
legitimately rotten calls has inspired officials to put him under
greater scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after a recent defeat at Houston, Odom returned to the
locker room and announced he was through for the rest of the
season. He also happened to have a severe calf strain, so Odom
seemed to be validating the content of this emotional outburst for
about a week. He's in uniform and back on the floor, but his game
is somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit that so-called rookie wall,'' he admitted last week.
``But I'm still looking forward to being the leader of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a kid, who plays hard and hates losing. But until he
arrives early for workouts and stays late, the improvement won't
occur.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Lamar to quit blaming the team and begin looking
into the glass.
</P>
<P>
   If he sees Larry looking back at him, the Clippers are in real
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls truly think the Clippers were tanking games as
draft strategy, they have more nerve than they can use. Didn't
Chicago GM Jerry Krause dump this season by trading Toni Kukoc
after Kukoc began leading the Bulls to the occasional victory?
Krause did receive another high pick and John Starks as
compensation, but then allowed the competent Starks to skip town.
... Grant Hill continues to assure at least one Detroit Pistons
crony that he's a free-agent goner this season. But think nothing
of soon-to-be-published revelations of the Hill house being put on
the market Mrs. Hill doesn't like the current crib and has
convinced the NBA's greatest small forward to purchase another one,
even if he changes his mind and remains with the Pistons. ... If
called to a vote, Seattle SuperSonics players might choose to play
for assistant coach Nate McMillan rather than Paul Westphal. One
source close to the Sonics said McMillan is no fan of Westphal, who
has yet to demand the George Karl-style defensive posture from his
players. McMillan, of course, is a Karl disciple. ...
</P>
<P>
   Seven-foot-five Chinese prospect Yao Ming wasn't allowed to
compete at last weekend's Nike Hoop Summit in Indy, put scouts did
get an eyeful of Olumide Oyedeji. Oyedeji, who played in the 1999
Summit, stunned NBA snoops with the results of what 12 months in
low-post lab study have done for his game. At 6-10, 240, the
high-flyin' Nigerian who plays for DJK Wurzburg, the same German
club team that presented Dirk Nowitzki to the NBA - could be a
mid-first-round pick. If he chooses to enter the draft. ``He
reminds me of Antonio McDyess with an accent,'' one scout said of
the 19-year-old Oyedeji, who submitted his name for the '99 draft,
then changed his mind. ... How serious is free-agent-candidate
Derek Anderson about hearing Clipper re-enlistment chatter? Here's
a clue: DA already moved out of his condo and is watching the clock
from an L.A. hotel. ... Last year, the pre-draft expo known as the
Portsmouth Invitational Tournament (PIT) produced a small-college
(NCAA Division III) dynamo named Devean George. The last four days,
Division II product Damon Reed, a 6-10 center from St. Rose (N.Y.),
may have played his way to the next level - an invitation to the
Phoenix pre-draft party. One Portsmouth invitee who didn't show is
Long Beach State's Mate Milisa. Milisa, the reigning Big West
Player of the Year, scratched due to a knee problem. ... Last
week's chat with Utah point guard Jacque Vaughn confirmed that the
expected free-agent departure of teammate Howard Eisley will not
guarantee Vaughn's Jazz return. ``It's been three years,'' said
Vaughn, who also will become a free agent July 1. ``It's time to
play.'' Earning starter's minutes in Utah is made impossible by
John Stockton, who seems fit for another season (or two). ...
</P>
<P>
   Etdrick Bohnannon started this campaign at Fort Wayne of the
CBA, but will end it having been photographed in two NBA team
pictures - those featuring the Knicks and the Clips, who signed the
defensive-minded ``four'' man through next season. ... More Clips?
Why not? The latest issue of ESPN The Magazine reported that
interim coach Todd and his two top assistants - some guys known as
Kareem and DJ - have a ``pact.'' If one of the three is hired for
the boss gig, he'll keep the other two around. According to
one-third of this triad, the report is fiction. ... Boston sharpie
Rick Pitino has promised to quit if his Celtics fail to make the
2001 playoffs. To keep him around, several Eastern Conference
coaches have made a pact to throw one game apiece to Boston next
year. ... Darius Miles, the ridiculously active 6-9 and
lottery-bound Flyer from Senior High in East St. Louis, Ill., made
just 51 percent of his free-throw attempts this season. ... Last
Sunday's scrap with Chris Childs demonstrated that Kobe Bryant is
extremely Jordanesque in his ability to swing and miss.

UMBILICAL-CORD ALARM FAILED TO STOP HOSPITAL KIDNAPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Expands earlier story.) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police are investigating how a 2-day-old girl
could have been kidnapped from University Hospital at the Downstate
Medical Center in Brooklyn on Friday. She was returned safely that
evening, after the police arrested a teen-ager who they said had
taken the baby to a nearby apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Newborns at the hospital are fitted with a device on their
umbilical cords that activates an alarm whenever a baby is brought
near the doors to the ward. Immediately afterward, the doors are
supposed to lock. The alarm was activated when the baby, Melanie
Knight, was taken from the ward in a bassinet.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were nine police officers and 20 security
officers on duty at the hospital, plus one investigator and three
administrators, said Brian Kell, a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, Angelique Lawrence, 17, was scheduled to be
charged with second-degree kidnapping on Saturday, a felony that
carries a possible prison sentence of five to 25 years, said Teresa
General, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   According to a high-ranking police official close to the
investigation, Lawrence was most likely able to leave through the
doors because someone was coming into the maternity ward at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the only possible way,'' said the official. ``If
someone is walking in the door, the whole system is shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an event, if security officers near the entrances are
not alerted immediately, someone could leave the hospital with a
baby without being caught, the official said. He said he did not
think Lawrence had an accomplice. ``If downstairs is not notified,
it's a clear way out,'' he said. ``It seems inadequate. I guarantee
it's going to be upgraded.''
</P>
<P>
   Kell said it was possible that someone could have held the doors
open while the baby was taken out, or that the doors could have
been propped open. He said the police were investigating both
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   According to hospital procedures, when the alarm sounds, the
security office is notified immediately, and security and police
officers at the entrances are notified.
</P>
<P>
   The alarms are tested daily by nurses, and once a week by the
hospital police. Three times a day, nurses check to make sure that
numbers on the device on each baby match those on the mother's
identification bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue Hospital Center, in Manhattan, has a similar security
system. When the alarm is triggered by an infant's being taken from
the maternity ward, the doors to the stairways are locked, and any
elevators will bypass the floor so that no one can leave, said
Richard Pollas, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At Downstate, where the maternity ward is on the third floor,
only the doors to the ward are locked when an alarm sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital police are not armed, though some carry batons.
Kell said that no similar incidents had occurred in the 10 years he
had worked at the hospital. The hospital uses the Pro-Sec security
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lutz, president of Pro-Sec Protection Systems, based in
Lakewood, N.J., would not discuss how the system operated, citing
security concerns, but he said the system had prevented an
abduction a couple of years ago. He would not say where.
</P>
<P>
   Security systems in maternity wards have become more common,
with advancing technology and concerns about abductions and the
switching of infants. Some electronic scanning systems even play a
lullaby after verifying that the mother and infant are wearing tags
with matching identification numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the higher-profile cases of infant switching became news
in 1998, when Paula Johnson of Ruckersville, Va., discovered that
her biological daughter Rebecca, 3, had been switched at birth with
the child of two people who were killed in a car accident before
they could be told of the switch.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, a 16-year-old girl abducted a newborn from St.
Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson, N.J. Ten years
ago, a 3-day-old boy was abducted from St. John's Episcopal
Hospital in Brooklyn by a woman who told the police she had had a
miscarriage two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that kidnappers are often women who have lost
children or are unable to have their own.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to earlier reports from the police, Lawrence had
visited a doctor at the hospital last week, and had been told she
had a condition that would prevent her from having children, a
law-enforcement spokeswoman said. Lawrence, who is overweight, had
told friends she was expecting a baby. On Friday, when she went to
the hospital to pick up some medication, she took Melanie, the
spokeswoman said.

 &HT;    Teixeira's loss became Tech's gain
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech third baseman Mark Teixeira can smile now
when he recounts what he then considered the worst day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's easy to look ahead instead of back when you are
one of the hottest hitters in college baseball and projected as the
likely first pick in the 2001 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure didn't think so at the time, but somebody must have
been looking out for me,'' Teixeira said. ``I couldn't be happier
the way things worked out. I just never planned it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira thought he would go in the first round of the 1998
draft, bypass college baseball to sign a lucrative pro contract and
work his way quickly through the minors to realize his major-league
dream. If his hometown Baltimore Orioles drafted him, all the
better.
</P>
<P>
   Then reality hit.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the draft, the Boston Red Sox said they would
select him with the 12th overall pick if he would agree to their
take-it-or-leave-it offer _ $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he wasn't taken in the first round or in any of
the next seven. By the time Boston finally selected him in the
ninth round, Teixeira had left his home in Severna Park, Md., to
work off some of his frustration at a gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mad that I called Georgia Tech as soon as I got back
and told coach (Danny) Hall that I was coming,'' Teixeira said.
``No way was I going to sign with the Red Sox then.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall had signed Teixeira to a scholarship offer but never really
thought he would see the powerful switch-hitter in a Georgia Tech
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when he didn't go in the first round,'' Hall
said. ``I couldn't believe it. The Red Sox had called me the night
before and said they were taking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he wasn't picked early, I thought we had a chance to
get him. Then, he became my ace recruiter, trying to convince our
other draftees not to sign and come here instead.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you fall from the first round to the ninth? Apparently by
having agent Scott Boras, a hard bargainer despised by many teams,
as your adviser and by initially rejecting the kind of money that
would have most people _ let alone an 18-year-old _ rushing for a
pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Red Sox told some teams things that weren't really
true,'' said Teixeira, who turns 20 on Tuesday. ``The money wasn't
the problem with Boston. I wasn't trying to be J.D. Drew. It was
the way it all was handled, with no chance to negotiate. It just
wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's loss was Georgia Tech's gain. The sophomore has been
terrorizing ACC pitchers for two years and has another season
before he is eligible for the draft again.
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira led Tech in average (.387), homers (13) and runs batted
in (65) in 58 games last year, and was selected freshman of the
year by Collegiate Baseball Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Teixeira has been even more dominating. Going into
Tech's weekend series at Maryland, he was hitting .447 in 31 games,
with eight home runs and 35 RBIs. Teixeira had eight multi-hit
games in a row and was batting .500 in ACC play.
</P>
<P>
   How good a hitter is Teixeira? He is putting up numbers that
Nomar Garciaparra could only have dreamed about during his first
two seasons at Tech. The All-Star shortstop for the Red Sox hit
.363 his freshman season and .297 as a sophomore, with a total of
seven home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sets Mark apart from the other top hitters I've had is
his power,'' Hall said. ``He can really hit the ball a long way.
Plus, he does it from both sides of the plate. Pitchers just don't
have much of a chance. He doesn't chase bad pitches and is willing
to go the other way when he has two strikes. You won't find a
better college hitter, and he showed last summer in the Cape Cod
League that he is just as good with a wood bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech has had six players taken in the first round of the
draft but never anyone first overall. Second baseman Ty Griffin was
the fourth player picked in 1988, going to the Chicago Cubs.
Pitcher Kevin Brown was taken by Texas with the seventh pick in
1986 and Garciaparra was the 12th pick by Boston in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A management major and dean's-list student, Teixeira says he
isn't even thinking about the 2001 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I care about is us getting to the College World Series
this year and next,'' Teixeira said. ``I can't control what happens
with the draft, so I'm not going to worry about it. I learned the
hard way that major-league baseball is business. Playing here is
the fun part, so I'm going to enjoy it.''

 &HT;    Woods storms into picture
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Things were changing by the hour at Augusta
National Saturday. On the weather radar and on the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   The front blew in at midday, bringing rain, then winds strong
enough to bend towering hardwoods and blow putts away from the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Tiger Woods got a break from the weather and vaulted
into contention with a 4-under-par 68 and a 54-hole total of
1-under 215.
</P>
<P>
   Woods started the day at 3-over 147, but four straight birdies
put him back in the race. Although a rain delay of just over two
hours broke his momentum, he came back with birdies at 13 and 15
before taking a crucial bogey at the 17th, when his second shot
spun off the front and into the bunker. Although Woods played some
of the back nine in the rain, the rough winds did not arrive until
he was off the course.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorm and lightning delay, which caused the course to
be emptied of fans and players, prevented the leaders from
finishing their rounds until this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get back in this tournament,'' said Woods.
``I didn't want to feel as if I was completely out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III, who barely made the cut Friday at
3-over, also regrouped with a 68 to tie Woods at 215. Love said
that if conditions were windy and cold this morning, as expected,
his chances might improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very comfortable if I'm seven or eight back,'' Love
said. ``I'd like to be four or five at the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were very tough after skies cleared and the winds
picked up, making chipping and putting particularly treacherous on
the slick greens, which dried out quickly after the rain. Scores
soared accordingly, making those who played earlier feel all the
more fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones hit disaster at the seventh hole, making a
triple-bogey 7, falling from 5-under to 2-under and finally off the
leaderboard. Phil Mickelson, who started the day one shot behind
leader David Duval, fell down the leaderboard with a front-nine 40.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, the 60-year-old, six-time champion, started the
third round at even par, but lost his two-day magic, stumbling to
an 81. Duluth's Stewart Cink had a second consecutive 72 and is at
3-over 219. Larry Mize of Columbus slipped to a 73 and stands
2-over.
</P>
<P>
   Today's first prize will be $828,000, up from $720,000 last
year, from a purse of approximately $4.6 million.

CIA FIRES OFFICER IN BOMBING OF CHINA EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is now the lead story on Page 1 of The New York Times.) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA has dismissed a midlevel officer whose
targeting error was blamed for the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade during NATO's air war against Yugoslavia last
year, an agency official and a lawyer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Six other agency employees, including a senior official and four
supervisors, also received administrative punishments from the
director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, for their roles
in approving a target that turned out to be the embassy and not a
Yugoslav military supply headquarters, the agency official said.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the attack on the night of May 7, officials at
the White House, the Pentagon and the CIA insisted that the bombing
was an accident _ the result of a simple, tragic human error.
</P>
<P>
   The attack badly derailed relations between the United States
and China, provoking stone-throwing mobs to swarm the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing and producing diplomatic strains that linger even today.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only on Thursday, 11 months after the bombing, that
the agency began to punish those held responsible, dismissing the
officer blamed for the targeting.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy was arguably the most dramatic single
event of NATO's 78-day air war. The attack, which killed three
Chinese and wounded 20 others sleeping in the basement for
protection, exposed deep doubts in the alliance over the wisdom of
its strategy and the susceptibility of even the most advanced U.S.
military weaponry to human error.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Chinese general visiting Washington in late January
demanded to know when those responsible would be punished. On
Saturday, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering met at the State
Department with China's ambassador, Li Zhao Xing, to inform him of
the dismissal and other punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials had informed members of the congressional
intelligence committees on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese side has been informed of this decision, but at
this point we don't have any information on what kind of response
the Chinese are going to make, and any kind of response would have
to made in Beijing,'' a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the CIA, Bill Harlow, issued an unusual public
statement Saturday _ and at the unusual time of a quiet Saturday _
announcing that Tenet had taken ``a number of actions'' as a result
of an internal review of the events that led to the bombing. The
statement did not mention what actions Tenet had taken, though an
agency official and the lawyer for one of the employees later
described them generally.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow declined to identify those punished, citing privacy and
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Although only one officer was dismissed, the statement
attributed wide blame for what it said were a series of procedural
errors in approving a target that turned out to be fundamentally
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numerous CIA officers at all levels of responsibility failed
to ensure that the intended bombing target _ the Yugoslav Federal
Directorate of Supply and Procurement headquarters _ had been
properly identified and precisely located before CIA passed a
target nomination package to the U.S. military for action,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy W. Krieger, a lawyer representing one of the supervisors who
received a letter of reprimand, said it was ``manifestly unjust''
to assign blame to individuals when ``the failure was systemic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shameful that the CIA caved in to political pressure to
provide scapegoats,'' Krieger said Saturday night. ``The agency has
already publicly admitted that the map provided to the officers
contained errors absent which the Chinese Embassy would not have
been mistakenly targeted. These officers were asked to improvise
and did their best with the tools provided to them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to administration, defense and intelligence officials,
the bombing was caused by a fundamentally flawed process for trying
to locate the directorate's headquarters in the New Belgrade
section of the Yugoslav capital. Armed with only an address, 2
Bulevar Umetnosti, the officer who was dismissed used an
unclassified military map to try to pinpoint the building's
location, based on a limited knowledge of addresses on a parallel
street.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who wrongly assumed that Belgrade's street
addresses were numbered uniformly, ended up targeting the Chinese
Embassy, which is on a frontage road nearly 1,000 feet from the
supply directorate that was the intended target, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the map, which the National Imagery and Mapping Agency
produced in 1997, the building that turned out to be the embassy
was not identified. Instead, the map showed the embassy in its
former location in central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   After a location was identified, the target was discussed during
at least three meetings among CIA officials, none of whom,
evidently, questioned the identification process, the officials
said. The target was then turned over to Pentagon officials who,
also without questioning it, put it on a list of targets to bomb in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first and last target the CIA selected during the
war, Tenet testified last year. Saturday's statement said the
agency ``lacked formal procedures for preparing and forwarding
target nomination packages'' to the U.S. military. It said several
steps had been taken to address ``organizational problems that
contributed to the accidental bombing,'' but then declined to
discuss them, saying they were secret.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the agency waited 11 months to punish those
it held responsible for the bombing. The agency's inspector general
completed an investigation of the targeting process last July.
Harlow would only say that Tenet acted after a lengthy review was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Because none of those punished were identified, it was not
possible to reach the dismissed officer or any of the others for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The six who retained their jobs _ some of whom have covert
identities _ received administrative punishments that varied from
an oral admonition to a letter of reprimand that includes a
one-year prohibition on promotions, raises or other special
recognitions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency official said that Tenet singled out one individual
for praise: another midlevel officer who raised concerns about the
targeting in the week before the strike. That officer called others
at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency and the NATO task force
in Naples, Italy, responsible for orchestrating the bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   However, his concerns were never brought to the attention of
senior officials who might have been able to call off the strike.

 &HT;    Short tracks Wallace's metier
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Rusty Wallace is on another short-track tear
and the pole for today's Goody's Body Pain 500 at Martinsville
Speedway. His brother, Kenny, is starting beside him on the front
row.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty ought to be able to explain why drivers not named Wallace
have trouble at the half-mile Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' Rusty said. ``It's the same thing when
people ask me why I run so good on short tracks. I tell them I
really don't know, I cut my teeth on (short tracks).''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace won two weeks ago at the short-track of Bristol. Here,
the drivers swap concrete for mostly asphalt and the high banks of
Bristol for the modest elevation of Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess on the short tracks I know what I want the car to
do,'' Wallace said. ``You have to have the car do what you want it
to do to maneuver and pass. ``Martinsville is the kind of place
where you could have a falling out with your own mother if she was
on the track with you,'' Rick Mast said. ``You know when you come
here that you're going to get mad at some people, and some people
are going to get mad at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mast won't have that worry: He didn't qualify the No. 14
Pontiac. But Mike Skinner, starting third in the No. 31 Chevy, can
relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I give people advice here,'' Skinner said, ``I say run
smooth. My son came up Friday morning and said Jeremy (Mayfield)
had the fastest car out there and he looks real smooth. He said,
`you look like you're up on the wheel with both hands and feet. Why
don't you just calm down and maybe you'll drive better?' In the
Winston Cup garage, it's hard to be as smooth as silk and be
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace seems to have mastered both functions. Now, he appears
poised to roll off a streak similar to one he began at Martinsville
in late 1992. In an eight-race stretch at Martinsville, he won five
times, was second twice and third once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down and selected our test sessions really carefully,''
Wallace said. ``I said, `wait a minute guys, we haven't been
short-track testing because everybody thinks we're good. We'll end
the race nowadays and finish third or fourth. We used to dominate
those things. I think it's time to go back to the tracks that are
the very best for us and test at those tracks and really perfect
them and when we come back let's get some wins. These things all
pay 180 points to win.' So, we did that at Bristol and it worked
out. We came up (to Martinsville) and tested and it worked out.''

COWBOYS GET A KICK OUT OF HOFFMAN'S JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no coaching job like Steve Hoffman's coaching job. Not
around here, there isn't. Maybe not anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   With his 12th season coming up at Valley Ranch, Hoffman has
always worked under these kind of marching orders:
</P>
<P>
   Search the countryside for the best available kicker and punter,
meaning a couple of fine young men who will make the Cowboys proud,
and never put the head coach's head on the line because of wide
rights or shanks. Forget, of course, about obtaining such talent
through the draft or free agency. Punters and kickers are vital,
just not that ``vital.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to pay, both guys must be willing to work for
the bare minimum in salary, and not a dollar more. It's a
longstanding Valley Ranch tradition that punters and kickers are
cheap labor, therefore saving a few bucks to pay the stars.
</P>
<P>
   With those guidelines in place, Hoffman is given a go-get-'em
pat on the butt and a friendly reminder that the Cowboys are
counting on him to get it right. Who knows when the outcome of a
game will be riding on a kicker's toe.
</P>
<P>
   Several games did last season and Richie Cunningham suddenly
started failing on field goals. Although the entire offense was a
mess, only one player lost his job over it. Cunningham was released
in November after an all-pro season the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the coaches told me the team had lost confidence in
Richie,'' said Hoffman. ``My answer to him was that Richie had lost
confidence in the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is a jovial sort with an excellent coaching reputation
for beating the bushes to locate gypsy kickers and punters who come
to the Cowboys as a nobody and eventually leave as a somebody. And
one way or the other, they all leave, although 95 percent of the
time it's because of better paying jobs elsewhere in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Gowin, the punter and kickoff man, did his job better over
the past couple of seasons than the likes of Aikman, Deion and Lett
combined. But when it comes time for financial reward, Gowin's came
last week from the New Orleans Saints. They swiped Gowin for a
$600,000 signing bonus and an average salary of over $600,000 for
three years. As good as Gowin was in both his areas, the Cowboys
would never think of investing that much money in him.
</P>
<P>
   What the heck, Jerry Jones just figures Hoffman will go out and
find another Toby Gowin who will work for the NFL rookie minimum of
$193,000. And while looking for a punter-kickoff man, Hoffman must
also find a new field goal kicker for the same price.
</P>
<P>
   These kind of players aren't important until they screw up _ and
then everyone is screaming, from the head coach, to the other
players, to the media, to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting concept,'' said Hoffman, smiling. ``But I
view it as a challenge. As much as I hated to lose a Toby Gowin,
I'm proud for him that he got that kind of money elsewhere. It's
like I've told all our guys for years about the money situation
here _ don't look at what's fair, just accept that's it this way,
and deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my standpoint, which comes from a team concept, I think
it's easier for us to find a punter or a kicker than it is to find
a \Rwide receiver\S Joey Galloway. So if we're saving money in my
area of the team, it's helping us elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving here with Jimmy Johnson in 1989, Hoffman has come
up with Ken Willis, Lin Elliott, Chris Boniol and Cunningham as
field goal kickers. All were untested and unknown in the NFL. All
made their marks. Punting-wise, his back-to-back duo of John Jett
and Gowin ranked among the league's best.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the new mystery men are Tim Seder and Jarret
Greaser (kickers) and Cory Collins and Barry Cantrell (punters).
They have all been signed, and others will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Where does Hoffman find these people? Seder is a high school
baseball coach in Ohio who showed up for a tryout wearing sneakers.
Cantrell is a Wall Street broker who was in camp with the Cowboys
two years ago. Collins is between jobs, having just been laid off
as a computer programmer. Greaser is a Texas Tech product who
didn't kick as a senior because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical things you can judge for yourself as you watch
these guys in tryouts, but the hard part is the guessing game on
can they handle the job mentally,'' said Hoffman, who can also
relate to the gypsy nature of free agent kickers and punters. He's
been there himself when it comes to holding on to an NFL dream long
after the college days.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early '80s, a punter named Steve Hoffman was cut six
times in four years after being invited to training camps with NFL
and United States Football League clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spirit, I'm one of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Hoffman is a Cowboys' coach who is always asked to
do more with much less. Thus far, he's never failed, with yet
another challenge immediately awaiting.

SHORTAGE OF QUALITY CHILD CARE HAS KANSAS CITY PARENTS SCRAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
 DAY CARE -- 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE and DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Last week the metropolitan area nearly lost
14 day-care centers run by the financially troubled YWCA of Greater
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   That situation, it turns out, is just the tip of the area's
child-care worries.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy booms, child-care employees are fleeing to better
jobs with better benefits, leaving many centers understaffed _ and
creating nightmares for working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some centers have cut hours, which has intensified the shortage
of spaces available for children to a crisis level, said Abby
Baucom, director of the Metropolitan Council on Child Care, which
recently released a status report on early childhood care and
education in the area.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the shortage of teachers and slots for
children causes many parents to drive miles out of their way or
settle for mediocre care _ or in some cases, both.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious parents linger on waiting lists, especially if they want
infant or toddler care. Some parents now reserve slots months
before their babies are born.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting so bad, Baucom said, that one woman telephoned
several child-care centers to ask about waiting lists so she would
know when to get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The economic woes have been labeled the ``child care trilemma'':
Parents can't afford to pay higher fees, which means centers can't
afford to hire and retain educated teachers, which means overall
quality of care is poor.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a problem not likely to be solved by parents paying
more. Many parents say they are paying the maximum they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles lurk from the Northland to southern Jackson County,
from the city to the suburbs. They are most intense in areas where
industrial growth is coupled with residential development. And they
affect the urban core, where welfare reform has put more mothers to
work and more children in need of child care. Child-care study
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on 1999 statistics, found:
</P>
<P>
   - The turnover rate for center staff is 42 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   - Only 4 percent of centers provide care during nontraditional
hours.
</P>
<P>
   - Forty percent of home providers and 60 percent of centers have
waiting lists for infants and toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Some frustrated parents turn to nanny services, but those can
cost $10 or more an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she does not need child care until this summer, Ann
Brendle of Leawood began shopping for toddler care last August _
nearly a year in advance. She contacted six child-care providers
and ended up 19th, 27th and 40th on three different lists.
</P>
<P>
   Because siblings of children already attending centers have
first shot at many openings, Brendle's odds of finding quality
child care looked slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I might get it, and I might not,'' said Brendle,
a former teacher who began thinking she might not be able to return
to work.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday she finally may have succeeded. She paid one center
a fee to hold a slot for her daughter, who turns 1 in June. If the
slot does not open as expected in July, the center will refund
Brendle's money.
</P>
<P>
   Infant and toddler care is more of a problem than for other ages
because of the high costs. Kansas requires one teacher for every
three infants, and Missouri requires one teacher for every four.
That is expensive, driving costs to $200 or more a week for
parents. Some centers do not provide care for these children,
because they lose money on them.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents nearly lost their day care when the YWCA said it is
considering filing for bankruptcy. Plans are being made for other
agencies to assume the responsibilities for 14 day-care sites if
the YWCA does file. Difficult issues
</P>
<P>
   Are there solutions to all these child-care problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of those things we haven't figured out,'' said
Karen Clayton, executive director of the Child Care Association of
Johnson County in Kansas, which is helping other agencies prepare
to inherit some of the YWCA's troubled sites. ``If I could answer
that question, I'd be doing speaking across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates say tobacco settlement money should be redirected
to child care. Others suggest a tax subsidy will be needed someday,
much like public schools are supported by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's up to businesses to subsidize care for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown centers of La Petite Academy in Tulsa, Okla., and
Wichita, Kan., have corporate support, which offsets expenses. A La
Petite center in downtown Kansas City at 10th Street and Baltimore
Avenue that will close this week did not have corporate support,
said Cindy Lehnhoff, La Petite's area vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents asked me, `What would it take (to keep the center
open)?' '' Lehnhoff said. ``I said, `Somebody's employer to step
up.' We can't lower our quality, and I think they respected that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Sprint Corp. announced it was eliminating a child-care
center from its Sprint campus in Overland Park, Kan., because too
many workers said they would need the service. The company did not
want a system in which they could be accused of playing favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, however, executives said they were
considering building a center near the campus. Other options being
considered by Sprint include leasing a building or contracting with
existing day-care providers near the new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp Credit Services provides day care for employees at
several sites across the country, including one near Kansas City
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (corporate officials) look at it as a benefit, and it's
promoted as an employee benefit,'' said Janice Clark, the site's
director.
</P>
<P>
   Employees pay fees often half what many other programs charge,
with the added benefit of having the center next door to work. They
can visit children during lunch in a 25,000-square-foot,
state-of-the-art, 3-year-old facility that earned national
accreditation a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say accreditation is key to improving the overall
quality of America's child-care system. Accredited centers must
meet curriculum, staffing and facility guidelines. These programs
deal with children's social, emotional and intellectual development
at a time children's brains are the most active.

   ...the most active.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Citi Family Center, take-home bags containing
developmental materials _ such as games, cooking activities and
books _ hang on racks near the lobby, each marked with a child's
name and color-coded by the children's ages. Parents check out the
bags for a week at a time, then return them for refills.
Accreditation
</P>
<P>
   There is a big push in the Kansas City area for child-care
providers to become accredited by the National Association for the
Education of Young Children. Indeed, accreditation was one of the
good-news items in the Child Care Council's report.
</P>
<P>
   So far 43 centers and three home providers in the metropolitan
area have earned accreditation. An additional 200 are working
toward the goal, Baucom said.
</P>
<P>
   However, staffing shortages can make it difficult to reach that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any center where you are constantly worrying about staffing
issues, quality takes a back seat,'' Clayton said. ``If the
director has to worry about whether she is going to have to drive
the van or cook the meals, then she is not worrying about
accreditation issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Child-care workers _ despite awesome responsibility _
historically have been among the lowest paid of America's labor
force. According to the new study, the average starting wage for
child-care teachers in the Kansas City area is $6.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Goodcents around the corner from my house is offering to
hire delivery drivers at $10 to $15 an hour,'' Baucom said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehnhoff from La Petite has raised her staff salaries $2 per
hour in the last two years to encourage staffers to come and stay.
Her employees now earn from $8 to $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then we have a labor shortage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, fewer than half of child-care centers
offer health insurance to teachers and assistant teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of child care for one infant and one toddler in a
center consumes, on average, about 25 percent of a family's income.
For poor families who earn too much for state-subsidized care,
child care can eat up 45 percent of family income.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of families, child care is the second-highest
monthly expense, after housing,'' Baucom said.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth, according to experts, is that parents have been
getting a break _ on the backs of child-care workers _ for a long
time. In a way, the traditional low pay of workers has served as an
unofficial subsidy for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Various studies show that parents pay between $3,000 and $4,000
annually in child-care expenses per child, Baucom said. But the
actual cost of quality care would be between $6,000 and $9,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Berta Sailer, director of St. Vincent's child-care center
in Midtown, predicts the problem will worsen until more money is
found for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get to the point where society and policy makers
recognize the work these people do,'' Sailer said, adding that
suburban centers have an advantage over day cares in the inner
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can raise rates, and their parents can probably afford
the increase,'' Sailer said.
</P>
<P>
   But most children who attend St. Vincent's do so on state
subsidy, which is tied to a funding formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could charge more, but it wouldn't do any good, because my
moms couldn't afford to pay it,'' Sailer said.

SMALL RADIO STATIONS ARE BIG ON SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Kan. _ Nelson Rupard, owner of radio stations
KIND-AM and KIND-FM here, was talking about his sole foray into
talk radio, the rage in his business for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a syndicated show with two women,'' said Rupard, who,
being only 88, still handles the station's morning show, answers
the phone and performs light maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupard didn't mind that the two were sassy and irreverent. As
the dean of Kansas broadcasters, he's been around long enough to
have heard absolutely, positively everything.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the two women started ruminating on bodily functions,
Rupard got on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd signed a contract,'' he said. ``But I told them this just
won't work here. They were nice. They let us out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupard, inventor, mentor and a font of wondrous stories about
radio, is a disciple of that now-fading school of broadcasting
called ``full service'' _ meaning no automation, real people behind
the microphone, attention to the minutiae of the community, and
good taste,
</P>
<P>
   For KIND-AM and KIND-FM, which simulcast from an unembellished
studio on the edge of Elk City State Park, that equates to three
hours of news and markets in the morning, a variety of music (show
tunes and '70s and '80s hits) through the rest of the day, and then
sports (from high school to the Royals) until midnight. Plus a ton
of local stuff _ meetings, reunions, the city council, awards, you
name it.
</P>
<P>
   So bodily functions are out.
</P>
<P>
   Rupard allowed that his insistence on a certain propriety may
have roots in personal experience. Sixty-plus years ago, not long
out of high school, Rupard was working at station WHB up in Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   One day an announcer nabbed him for a live commercial. Rupard,
healthy as a horse, was to play a satisfied customer of a certain
skin care product and offer a testimonial about its efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the copy I spotted this strange word,'' he said. ``I
tried to say it. But my tongue just got it all tangled. But they
were in a hurry, and I had to read it on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, as read by Rupard, came out minus the first, fifth,
and eighth letters.
</P>
<P>
   Rupard held onto his job. He worked as an engineer. He was on
the air. One of his jobs was to make sure a musician named Bill
Basie, later know as ``Count,'' was on time to do his weekly WHB
gig in the organ showroom of Jenkins Music Co. at 1217 Walnut St.
</P>
<P>
   He got to know other greats, such as Baby Lovett, Julia Hill,
and Bennie and Buster Moten. There were lots of live broadcasts,
not only from the old Northside Municipal Court, but also from the
Cherry Blossom Theater, where the ``Vine St. Varieties'' were held
and, oddly enough, whites sat in the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Rupard, who joined WHB in 1932, had landed in what
was the most exciting town in the country working in a kinetic
industry that then was not unlike today's computer frontier.
</P>
<P>
   There was always something new _ improved equipment, innovative
means of transmission, original shows coming down the network line
from New York and Chicago _ and above all, the knowledge that
thousands upon thousands of people clustered around a box that sat
like a shrine in their living rooms, listening.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't really matter to what. Radio gave people what they'd
never had _ immediacy on a communal scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were just a handful of stations in Kansas City then,''
said Rupard, ``WDAF, KMBC, WHB and maybe a couple more. Everybody
knew each other. Everybody traded ideas. It was all new. How many
stations are there now _ 30 or more?''
</P>
<P>
   Rupard left WHB in 1942 and went to Emporia, Kan., taking part
ownership in KTSW (now KVOE). There he helped set up a Kansas
network, part of which was to bring educational programs to
isolated parts of the state
</P>
<P>
   One of Rupard's proudest memories is captured in a picture of a
teacher and several students crammed into a car with books,
notebooks and pencils. The caption said they were listening to one
of the network's school programs on the car's radio. Their school
lacked electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio was meant to serve people,'' he said. ``That picture was
all about that.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Rupard came to Independence and built KIND
from the ground up. The call letters, incidentally, were originally
assigned to a World War II Navy ship. Over the years, Rupard has
been approached with monetary offers to trade the letters to West
Coast radio stations, ones apparently looking for an altruistic
image or more melodic jingles. Rupard has scoffed at such offers.
</P>
<P>
   KIND-AM went on the air in 1947 at 1010 on the dial. KIND-FM, at
101.7, was one of the first FM stations in the state. It began
broadcasting in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   With Rupard running the station and his wife, Francis, keeping
up the business end, the station did well. There was a brief
controversy in the early 1950s when Rupard hired a black news
reader, Cy Keller, not because of his race but, as Rupard said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the Korean War going, and Cy was the only guy around
who could pronouce the names there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who earned their spurs at the station were Merle
Blair, now president and chief executive officer of the Topeka
Chamber of Commerce; Hoite Caston, a Los Angeles writer, producer
and director; and Bill Kurtis, who became a TV network newsman and
is now a producer and host of documentaries on the A&AMP;E cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said that the last time he and Kurtis were at the station,
Kurtis motioned him to take his picture against one of the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Rupard, ``bless his heart, has egg-crates for sound deadening,
and Bill wanted a picture,'' Blair said. ``I mean, who can believe
that? Then Bill...says, `OK, let's cut some spots,' and Bill did
some commercials for, I think, a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to encouraging young talent, Rupard, in the late
1950s, invented a device called the ``101 Spotter'' that replaced
discs and reel-to-reel tape. It was a forerunner of the audio
cartridge machine, which made ``Top-40'' radio possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nelson represents the epitome of community broadcasting,''
said Harriet Lange, executive director of the Kansas Association of
Broadcasters in Topeka. ``There's not many like him around
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupard said there had been some very informal talks with Kurtis,
Caston, Blair and other alumni of KIND about their buying the
station when he's no longer around ``so the widow Rupard can be
taken care of.'' But he has no plans to retire. Too busy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing. Would Rupard say ``psoriasis?''
</P>
<P>
   He did. Perfectly.

 AWG, Teamsters battle to win over KC shoppers is escalating  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Monica Deleon last week pulled into the Price
Chopper parking lot in Roeland Park, Kan., but she quickly left
without shopping for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   A laid-off employee from Associated Wholesale Grocers had given
her a handbill describing the labor dispute between the food
wholesaler and 1,200 members of the Teamsters union in Kansas City
and Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Deleon said her father's experience as a union worker persuaded
her to shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's gone through this before,'' she said Thursday as
she pulled onto 18th Street Expressway. ``We know what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   While Deleon and others left without patronizing Price Chopper,
others ignored the ex-Associated workers and the leaflets in their
outstretched arms. Most drivers took the handbills but continued
into the store's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the hearts and minds of Kansas City grocery
shoppers is escalating.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters are engaged in a week-old conflict with Associated, a
grocery cooperative that laid off more than 600 warehouse and
transportation employees at its Kansas City, Kan., distribution
center. The company also did the same to nearly 700 employees in
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Citing mounting competition and a need to improve efficiencies
in its distribution system, Associated has outsourced its warehouse
and transportation operations to private companies. The Teamsters,
meanwhile, claim Associated is a growing wholesaler that wants to
boost profits for itself and its member owners by breaking the
union.
</P>
<P>
   The union has filed a charge with the National Labor Relations
Board, contending that Associated did not bargain in good faith and
requesting that the board rule that legal action be taken to
reinstate union members to their jobs. Associated said that it
followed federal guidelines, giving employees a two-month mass
layoff notice, and that those employees no longer work for
Associated.
</P>
<P>
   It could take four to six weeks for the board to decide whether
the union's complaint merits judicial action.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the outcome of the battle could be determined
by grocery shoppers in the Kansas City area, Springfield, Lawrence,
Kan., and Topeka, Kan. The union has identified those areas for a
boycott of stores that are supplied by Associated and are members
of its cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Associated continues to operate its outsourced distribution
centers. An executive said Friday that operations have not yet
returned to normal. But the company is satisfied with the progress
and expects to ship regular load amounts by today, said Jerry
Garland, the company's executive vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it wouldn't be back on schedule overnight,'' Garland
said. ``There have been delays, but we're right on track with where
we thought we'd be at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Associated is making its case through newspapers, radio and TV.
In the past two weeks the company has flooded Kansas City with
commercials and advertisements _ including full-page ads in The
Kansas City Star _ that ask consumers to support their locally
owned, independent grocers.
</P>
<P>
   The union has relied mostly on rallies and passing out
handbills. On Friday the union published an ad in The Star
disputing Associated's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``These appeals to the public at large are common features of
many labor disputes,'' said Clete Daniel, professor of labor
history at Cornell University. ``Employers use whatever leverage
they have to convince customers they're right, and the unions try
to generate support from average, working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel said the advertising resources Associated has used to
counter the union's boycott are no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grocery business operates on a very thin profit margin,''
he said. ``If you launch a boycott and impact a relatively small
number of customers, you can still have a profound effect on the
store's bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to determine the effect of the labor dispute and
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   A Price Chopper spokesman said Thursday that operations are
normal at its area stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes three to four weeks before finding out if
sales are affected, but all indications are that it's business as
usual,'' said Alan Chapman of Wilson Chapman/SJS, spokesman for the
Price Chopper group. ``On the first day (of the outsourcing),
deliveries were delayed, but every day it's gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, scattered reports of late deliveries continued
through the week. One truck was eight hours late on Wednesday to a
Kirksville store, according to one employee.
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear whether grocers that compete with Associated's
stores, such as employee-owned Hy-Vee Food Stores Inc., are
benefiting from the dispute. A Hy-Vee store manager declined
comment Thursday, and a call to Hy-Vee's regional office in Lenexa,
Kan., was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area the union is distributing handbills at
more than 30 stores at various times, said Al Hoover, coordinator
of Local 955's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not bullying anybody; we're just asking for support,''
said Troy Smith, an ex-Associated mechanic who had worked at the
company for more than nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers are undecided. Among them is Mike DeJanes, a
Kansas City businessman who talked to ex-Associated workers
Thursday at the Northland Price Chopper.
</P>
<P>
   DeJanes runs a small deli and catering service that does some
business with Associated and other food suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know where I stand,'' he said after a 15-minute
discussion with the handbillers. ``I understand that businesses
have to be competitive and make decisions about labor costs, but
I've seen companies use the union issue as a smokescreen, too. The
other factor is that (as a business owner) I want to be able get my
products so I can sell things. This dispute could affect me, too.''

ARIZONA EXPECTS RESHUFFLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - When the season ends, it's likely Arizona's place in
the National League West will be gone as the Diamondbacks head to
the American League if realignment goes the way baseball executives
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo, not
happy at all about his club's imminent move to the AL, isn't sold
on the fact that Arizona will never return to the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think whatever happens for next year is going to be the
first step in major realignment,'' Colangelo said. ``That could
absolutely affect us. Where we go, if we go, doesn't mean that's
where we stay. That's where we would be for a few years, but that's
not necessarily where we end up.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners aren't expected to talk about realignment at the April 18
meeting in Houston, but it will be a topic at the June meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig has let it be known he wants the Texas
Rangers out of the AL West. No approval is needed to shift Arizona
and Tampa Bay before November 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But if Arizona jumps to the AL West, it could be only a
short-term move because Selig is interested in a major realignment
project that could split the AL and NL into sections of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, fans: A day that was supposed to be of celebration
turned confusing for the Florida Marlins thanks to some curious
timing from Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He released an editorial in the
Miami Herald on opening day, stating that he would veto the
proposed $4-a-day cruise tax to help fund a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins were hoping to collect $320 million from the cruise
tax and owner John Henry was going to add $80 million for the new
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the timing of it,'' Marlins owner John
Boles said. ``I'm sure there were reasons for it, but it sure
shocked me to read the article _ opening day.... We've got enough
precipitation on us here without someone raining on our parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Rickey rhetoric: Since spring training, Mets left fielder Rickey
Henderson has been making noise about wanting a new contract. He
said he ``wasn't into'' playing. Henderson is upset he's making $2
million this season but thinks he was forced into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew they weren't going to do something with my contract,
we would have been fussing at the beginning of last season,''
Henderson said. ``I wouldn't have played for them. I would have
gone home. We probably would have gone to court to decide if I
accepted that contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout baseball, people are wondering about the situation.
Henderson is one of baseball's best leadoff hitters _ he hit .315
with 89 runs scored, 82 walks and 37 stolen bases last season _ but
the Mets are growing tired of his act.
</P>
<P>
   Woods vs. Valdes: The race is on in Chicago to see if Kerry Wood
makes it back into the Cubs rotation before former Dodger Ismael
Valdes. The Cubs are ecstatic that Wood, coming back from elbow
surgery, is making rapid progress and could pitch today for
Single-A Daytona, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cubs manager Don Baylor said Valdes, sent to the Cubs
along with Eric Young in the offseason, is at about the midway
point of spring and it could be two to three weeks before he's
ready to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis, had
trouble getting loose before his last throwing session.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Arizona made the playoffs a year ago and is the
favorite to win the NL West, but the folks in Greater Phoenix don't
seem to care. The Diamondbacks were 2,600 short of a sellout for
their home opener, and two nights later drew 15,007, the lowest
total at Bank One Ballpark. ``I don't know why,'' team president
Rich Dozer said. ``We've got Randy Johnson going, a perfect night,
the team wins the National League West.''... Ken Griffey Jr. made
his Cincinnati debut and was roundly cheered before the game by the
Cinergy Field record crowed of 55,595. And Griffey's mom, Birdie,
missed it. ``I was waiting for the elevator,'' she said.

   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush are running
neck and neck in the presidential campaign, according to a Newsweek
poll released Saturday. The poll found that 44 percent of
registered voters favor each of the two major party candidates,
while 12 percent were undecided. Among independent voters, Bush had
a slight edge with 45 percent compared with 39 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, scored 81
percent of Republican voters, while likely Democratic presidential
nominee Gore scored 76 percent of Democrats. Among minorities, Gore
got 63 percent compared with 23 percent for Bush, according to the
poll of 588 registered voters. The poll has a margin of error of 5
percentage points.

   CLINTON REELS IN FUNDS FOR DNC
</P>
<P>
   Though continuing to trail Republicans in fund-raising overall,
the Democratic National Committee did manage to raise almost as
much money as the GOP during the first quarter of the year due to
President Clinton's help. Clinton helped raise half of the $26
million the DNC took in during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the president was again working to raise more money
by attending a fund-raising lunch that was expected to bring in
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore attended a $5,000-per-person lunch in Broward
County, Fla., that was expected to bring in $1 million for the DNC.
Gore also announced an Internet partnership between the DNC and
Speakout.com, which he said will allow voters to read the party's
platform and propose changes.

   The DNC began April with more than $21 million in the bank _ its
largest amount ever _ according to General Chairman Ed Rendell.
This time four years ago, the party had $5 million in its account.
Since Jan. 1, 1999, the Republican National Committee has raised
more than $82 million; the Democrats $66 million.

   BUSH'S HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR POOR AMERICANS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is considering a $14 billion health care proposal
that would employ tax credits to pay health insurance premiums for
low-income Americans, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Bush
is leaning toward a plan that would grant $1,000 to each taxpayer
and $2,000 to families, according to the newspaper, although
advisers apparently disagree on the plan. These tax credits are
twice the size of credits that Bush formerly recommended. Some
Republicans back this plan as a way to increase the number of
Americans with health insurance without increasing the size of
government bureaucracy.

   GORE SILENT ON ELIAN WHILE IN FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   With Elian Gonzalez just 50 miles away, Vice President Al Gore _
who stunned the Clinton administration last week when he sided with
Miami's Cuban activists _ stayed silent on the issue Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian's father met with Attorney General Janet Reno in an
effort to get back his son, Gore met with more than 100 voters in
Delray Beach, to talk health care and taxes _ not Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hammered Bush's plan to allow people to invest part of
their Social Security taxes in the stock market. ``It may sound
like a small amount of speculation but it is really a large dose of
Social Security devastation,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said Friday that ``during the last
eight years, Clinton-Gore failed to enact reforms to save and
strengthen Social Security.''

   GRASS ROOTS IN THE PEWS
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell is set to step back onto the political
stage this week when he launches a voter registration and
mobilization campaign, ``People of Faith 2000.'' ABC News reports
that on Friday, Falwell will announce a plan to register an
additional 10 million religious people to vote, and to have them
carry ``I pray and I vote'' cards reminding them of their
commitment to turn out on Nov. 7. ABC says Falwell's folks also
plan to communicate with thousands of religious leaders to
encourage them to hold ``citizenship days''_ in effect, a
voter-registration drive in the pews.

VIJAY SINGH IS THE MAN TO BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ A howling wind provided a stiff challenge for the
leaders, but Vijay Singh was too steady to be blown off course
Saturday during the third round of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   With Tiger Woods and Davis Love III pulling themselves into
contention, the setup heading into Sunday's final-day action could
not get much better, considering the names near the top of the
leader board. But the pack will be chasing Vijay Singh, who seized
a three-stroke lead with a splendid ball-striking display despite
conditions fit more for flying a kite than for playing golf. Singh
nearly eagled No. 14 with a great approach shot that landed 2 feet
from the hole, then tapped in for a birdie that gave him his
biggest lead not long before play ended because of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   But a weird weather day at Augusta National Golf Club caused a
star-studded leader board to bunch like an accordion for most of
the day. Those who teed off early, like Woods and Love, played in
manageable conditions that allowed them to make a move. Those who
teed off late, like David Duval, Singh and Ernie Els, got a raw
deal and rugged conditions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the final two groups teed off, Els and Mickelson
followed by Duval and Singh, there had already been a weather delay
of 2 hours 5 minutes that forced the third round to be suspended by
darkness before eight golfers could finish. And what a day they had
endured. In the late afternoon, there were 20 to 30-mile an hour
wind gusts, with the highest gust recorded at 42 mph. Those
conditions made golf balls do funny things, both in the air and on
the putting surface. Fans were losing their hats, but many players
were losing strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and Loren Roberts played superbly considering the
conditions. Duval, despite a double-bogey at No.12, held his own,
as did Els and Mickelson. But Tom Lehman, Sergio Garcia and
Bernhard Langer lost precious ground that will make it difficult
for them to win, while Jack Nicklaus shot a difficult 81.
</P>
<P>
   After a day that was both exciting and unpredictable, Singh was
at seven under par through 14 holes when play was suspended. Duval
was in second place at four under through 14, and Roberts and Els
were tied at three under. Woods and Love, both of whom shot 68, and
Mike Weir, who shot 70, were tied at one under par.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely is a leader board that strong seen anywhere, and to see
it played out Sunday at Augusta will undoubtedly provide an outcome
of indelible memories. Some of Saturday's best moments were
provided by Woods and Love, who both did what it took to get back
into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, who has never had a top-10 finish at the Masters, was
unflappable in the wind. Singh, the winner of the 1997 PGA
Championship, will be trying to win his second major Sunday. If he
does, he will have earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Woods entered the tournament as the favorite, but entered the
day in trouble, trailing Duval, the second-round leader, by nine
strokes. Woods had two choices Saturday, either make a move or see
his chance to win slip away. Woods chose the former.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up this morning, I knew what I had to do, which
was go out and get myself back in the tournament,'' said Woods, who
snapped a streak of 10 consecutive rounds of 70 or worse at the
Masters. ``I hit solid shots and controlled the flight of the ball.
To shoot 68 in those conditions, I'm pretty proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the elements conspired to aid his cause. While the
last groups were out on the course dealing with the elements, Woods
and Love were watching on television, getting closer to the lead
all the time. You could almost picture Woods and Love with their
feet up on couches somewhere, watching the afternoon proceedings
with grins on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flags were blowing so loud, it sounded like someone
shooting a gun out there,'' Love said of the afternoon conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys that got those late tee times didn't get the best of
it. But that's the way things go.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh and Roberts showed tremendous resiliency. Roberts, one of
the game's best putters but who has never won a major, made four
birdies on the front side, then hung tough on the back nine to
complete a strong day. Singh used his length and composure to build
his lead.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with his putter Friday, Woods had dinner with
his father, Earl, who told his son that his hands were too low on
his putting stroke. Then Saturday morning, Woods's coach, Butch
Harmon, made a small correction.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Woods teed off, his stroke was corrected and his
attitude was determined. For the first time in the tournament,
Woods went on a strong run, making four consecutive birdies from
No. 7 through No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, play was called for the weather delay, which
temporarily broke Woods' momentum. But when play resumed, he made a
key up and down at No. 12, which featured a strange moment. As
Woods prepared for his chip shot at No. 12, a ball from the ninth
hole at the adjacent Augusta Country Club came flying over the
fence and landed on the 12th green. Startled, Woods backed away,
and a marshal retrieved the errant ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that scene from `Caddyshack 2,' where the ball just
went over the fence?'' Woods said. ``It was just splat, all over
the green. We never saw a cart, we never saw anybody. I guess he
was embarrassed and didn't want to come get his ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods kept moving forward, taking advantage of his length to
birdie both par-5's on the back nine, No. 13 and No. 15, to reach
two under par for the tournament, before a bogey at No. 17 dropped
him back a stroke when his day ended.
</P>
<P>
   Love also bogeyed No. 16 after reaching two under par, but
neither he nor Woods could complain too much. They were back on the
leader board. And they had plenty of elite company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't slept very good this week,'' Love said. ``It's very,
very hard to control your emotions out there. I want to win this
tournament just like any other major. But I want to win this one
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   So do many others. And after Saturday, many will still have a
chance.  &QL;

YANKS BEAT MARINERS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Paul O'Neill bent at the knees in the Yankees'
clubhouse Saturday morning and the cracking sounds from his joints
were sharp and loud, like wishbones snapping. ``C'mon, body, get
going,'' O'Neill said, trying to shake off sluggishness.
</P>
<P>
   He felt the same way about the Yankees: they had lost two games
in a row and it felt like a lot more, O'Neill said before
Saturday's game, and he did his part to end the mini-slump, driving
a run-scoring double in the ninth inning to edge the Mariners, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The game had felt as if it were going against the Yankees,
however. They were not sharp, going 0 for 7 with runners in scoring
position in the first eight innings. The score was tied, 2-2, with
the Yankees' runs coming on homers by Tino Martinez and Alfonso
Soriano. Orlando Hernandez had pitched seven strong innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa retired the last two Yankees in the eighth inning and
the first two in the ninth inning, in the late-afternoon shadows
that crept from the home plate area toward the mound. Lou Piniella,
the Mariners' manager, stood in the dugout and waved his arms
dramatically for the lights to be turned on, knowing how difficult
it is to hit in such conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter singled with two outs, however, bringing O'Neill to
the plate for a matchup that he had dominated in the past. O'Neill
had faced Mesa nine times during the regular season and had six
hits and three walks, for a batting average of 1.000, an on-base
percentage of 1.000. With the count two balls and one strike, Jeter
broke for second, slid headfirst and barely beat the throw of
Seattle catcher Dan Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa might have pitched around O'Neill and gone after Bernie
Williams, who had one hit in nine at-bats against him with four
strikeouts. But Mesa attacked, and O'Neill swung at a 3-2 pitch and
rocketed the ball out of the shadows and into the sunlight of
right-center field, between the outfielders. Jeter scored and the
Yankees went ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano, the top shortstop prospect promoted from Class AAA
Columbus after Scott Brosius strained a rib cage muscle, made his
first start at third base Saturday. He made a nice play in the
first inning, diving to catch a looping line drive, but generally
looked uncomfortable; he has played only a handful of games at
third base. After second baseman Chuck Knoblauch misplayed Stan
Javier's ground ball in the fourth inning, Knoblauch's first error
of the season, Soriano charged awkwardly when Alex Rodriguez
grounded to third, and the ball bounced off Soriano and into the
air for another error.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud drew a walk, loading the bases with one out and John
Mabry coming to the plate, and El Duque was laughing. Hernandez
beckoned Jorge Posada to the mound and said something to him _
perhaps about how to pitch to Mabry, perhaps about something else _
but he smiled and tapped Posada on the back of the neck, chuckling
in what others might have construed as a tense situation.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez threw an inside fastball and jammed Mabry, who popped
up to second and then slammed his helmet after returning to the
dugout. El Duque was still smiling, still having fun. The count on
Mike Cameron reached two balls and two strikes and Hernandez shook
off the sign from Posada and called him out for a meeting.
Hernandez shook Posada off three more times and there was another
meeting on the mound, the crowd booing. Teammates say that El Duque
sometimes will shake off the signs merely to confuse the hitters,
and this may have been the case Saturday; after Hernandez and
Posada spoke, the catcher returned to the plate, looked at the home
plate umpire, Ed Montague, and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Hernandez must have had a plan, because two pitches
later he blew a fastball past Cameron, and raised his fist slightly
in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were affording Hernandez almost no margin for
error, however, after Martinez lifted a solo homer to open the
second. The Yankees had runners at first and second and one out in
the second inning and could not score; Soriano's strikeout stunted
the rally. Martinez led off the fourth with a single and Ricky
Ledee lined a high drive to left. Thinking the ball would either
disappear over the fence or at least go over the head of Seattle
left fielder Raul Ibanez, Martinez rounded second and was on his
way to third when Ibanez caught the ball; the Mariners relayed the
ball to first for an easy double play.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer walked leading off the fifth and moved to second
on Soriano's bunt, but Jeter grounded to short and O'Neill flied to
right. The Yankees had another leadoff runner in the sixth when
Williams lined a single, but Martinez hit into a double play and,
with runners at first and second and two out, Spencer flied out.
The Yankees were 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position in the
first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez finally relented. Ibanez pulled a home run just inside
the right-field foul pole in the fifth inning, tying the score, and
again the Mariners loaded the bases with one out in the sixth. El
Duque dominated Cameron, whiffing him easily for the second out,
and it appeared as if he would escape another jam. But Ibanez
dribbled a grounder along the first-base line, too far away for
Martinez to come in and make a play. Hernandez had the only chance
to get an out, rushing over and reaching _ and missing the ball as
he fell. Ibanez was safe, Javier scored and the Mariners were
ahead, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out Wilson, though, and Soriano erased the
difference quickly by lofting a breaking ball from Frank Rodriguez
over the left-field fence. Tie score, again, but the Yankees
squandered an opportunity for more. &QL;

DODGERS STILL RECOVERING FROM PIAZZA TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - It doesn't rank with a show producer selling one of
his star players to finance a theater production, and it's not yet
time to parade a goat around Chavez Ravine to exorcise the demons
of past sins.
</P>
<P>
   But the fortunes of the Dodgers certainly took a dramatic turn
toward embarrassment and losing when Fox executive and baseball
novice Chase Carey traded Mike Piazza, and they haven't improved.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years after the fact, the Dodgers are still searching
for an answer at the catcher's position, and folks are still
talking about the impact of losing Piazza, not to mention the cloud
it created.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza can't play against the Dodgers without hearing whispers
of what might have been, or what his loss did to the organization,
but he doesn't wonder when the commotion will end.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans will let it go the moment we win,'' Dodgers first
baseman Eric Karros said. ``That's the whole thing. As long as
we're not winning, or as long as we're struggling and not playing
up to expectations....''
</P>
<P>
   While Piazza has moved on and prospered, by winning with the
Mets and by signing a seven-year, $91 million contract, the Dodgers
have continued to spiral downward.
</P>
<P>
   And it certainly doesn't help that Piazza has continued to
produce at his normal rate and the Mets are expected to contend for
a championship while the Dodgers wallowed last season and are
trying to answer questions about their catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to deal with the here and now, not the what-ifs,''
Piazza said. ``That's natural in life to do that sometimes, and I
know that's what people do, but you can't dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many continue to do so because it is such a sore point.
</P>
<P>
   Because of how the Piazza situation concluded and the fallout
that followed, the Dodgers have changed how they deal with players
and negotiating contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Daly, managing general partner and CEO of the Dodgers, was
working with Hollywood when Piazza was dealt, but he understands
the breakdown of communication between management and player was
the biggest reason Piazza was traded.
</P>
<P>
   Daly vowed that he, personally, would talk to players so a lack
of communication wouldn't be the reason for a trade or for a player
leaving the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that won't happen again,'' Daly said during
spring training. ``I will make sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that is of any concern to Piazza, who's distanced
himself from his Dodgers days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just concentrating on doing my job,'' Piazza said.
``That's what I'm supposed to do and that's the thing I have to
really dedicate myself to. I can't help (what happened). That's
just something that happened. As a player, you can't get wrapped up
into that stuff. It's tough enough to play baseball, let alone
playing with other circumstances or other things on your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   So Piazza just continues to produce. He batted .303 with 40
homers and 124 RBI last season with the Mets but caught flack from
the Shea faithful because he hit !ital!only!off! .293 with runners
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Dodgers, he has hit .318 with 64 homers and
208 RBI in 261 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about Dodger history, it's something
you're never going to be able to sweep under the carpet,'' Karros
said. ``It happened. Now, is it something that the decision makers
dwell on? Should we dwell on it as players? It's like saying, do we
go out there every day and worry we traded Pedro (Martinez) for
Delino (DeShields)?''
</P>
<P>
   Ahhhh, another idea for another time.

MEDIA MOTIVATE TIGER TO SHOOT 68
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Tiger Woods arrived yesterday at Augusta National
Golf Club with a point to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by television reports that characterized his Masters
chances as over, Woods said he sought to change public opinion. A
round of 68 in blustery conditions, highlighted by four consecutive
birdies, accomplished that objective. It moved the world's
top-ranked golfer to 1 under par for the tournament and within six
strokes of the lead heading into today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out of it,'' said Woods, whose round was disrupted by
a two-hour rain delay. ``I watched a little TV \RFriday\S night,
and a lot of people were saying I was completely out of it. ... I
didn't appreciate it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods declined to identify what station he was watching, but
multiple sports anchors in the Augusta area and on ESPN discounted
his chances after Woods finished his second round in a tie for 39th
place, nine strokes behind David Duval. Woods reeled in 33 players
with yesterday's effort, moving into a tie for sixth pending
today's completion of the suspended third round.
</P>
<P>
   Woods likened his motivational experience in front of the
television to a conversation Arnold Palmer held with Bob Drum, a
sportswriter from Pittsburgh, before the final round of the 1960
U.S. Open. Drum told Palmer he had ``no chance'' of erasing a
seven-stroke deficit heading in the final round. Palmer closed with
a 65, passed 14 players and won by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Palmer credited Drum with providing emotional fuel
for his comeback. Woods said he felt ``similar'' motivation after
watching Friday's telecast but declined to identify the
sportscaster who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you that \Rtoday\S,'' said Woods, who played his way
back into contention by collecting six birdies and two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, collected four of those birdies in consecutive holes
(Nos. 7-10), with none of the birdie putts traveling farther than
10 feet. Woods' streak ended at No. 11, where he was forced to wait
out the two-hour rain delay before hitting his approach shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't very happy,'' Woods said of the timing of the delay.
``When you're into the round and you're playing well, you're in a
rhythm. You can feel it in your body. To all of a sudden have that
come to a stop was a little disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   After two pars, Woods rebounded to bag birdies at the back-nine
par-5 holes (Nos. 13 and 15) before missing the green and taking a
bogey at No. 17. By posting a 68, Woods ended a streak of 10
consecutive rounds without breaking 70 at the Masters. He
positioned himself to win his second consecutive major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning PGA champ also reinforced a lesson that golf
analysts, in Woods' opinion, should have learned while watching
Paul Lawrie rally to win the 1999 British Open despite beginning
the final round 10 strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a major championship, if you go out and shoot in the
mid-60s, you're going to make up more than a couple of shots.
You're going to really move up in the field,'' Woods said. ``It's a
lot different than playing in a regular tour event. The conditions
are so much more severe that guys start thinking where they're at,
and it becomes more difficult to shoot a low round when you've got
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 10 shots back going into the weekend and play some
great golf, you can really win.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're Tiger Woods, you also have a chance to silence some
second-guessers from the TV studio.

DODGERS BEAT METS, 6-5 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco ambled toward the first-base line and
stared into the dugout after Devon White's three-run homer vanished
over the right-center-field fence Saturday. Franco's face was a
picture of disbelief. Had he really botched a four-run lead in the
ninth inning? Had he really turned a rewarding afternoon for Pat
Mahomes and Jay Payton and the rest of the plucky Mets into a
forgettable afternoon? He had.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Franco helped shove it toward being forgettable and
Armando Benitez, who was supposed to rest, cemented the grim
scenario by surrendering a two-out home run to Eric Karros that
enabled the Los Angeles Dodgers to steal a 6-5 victory in 10 dreary
innings at Shea Stadium. The former and current closer both
floundered and both were booed, and Franco was seriously lambasted
by the fans.
</P>
<P>
   What a waste of so many strong performances, what a disastrous
way to lose a game and what a way to make an afternoon forgettable.
This one-run loss felt much worse in the somber Mets clubhouse than
other one-run losses. This hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody did great,'' Franco said. ``Everybody did great, but
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have played only seven games this season, and they
proved in 1999 that they were a resilient club by coming from
behind to win 47 times. But, even if these Mets wind up having
similar qualities, they will not soon forget a game in which they
belted two homers off Kevin Brown, received a sturdy performance
from Mahomes _ a reliever filling in for the injured Al Leiter _
and then watched a 5-1 lead evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a ball game we should have won,'' said Payton, who
stroked his first major league homer. ``Everyone in here will tell
you that.''
</P>
<P>
   But they did not because Franco could not get three outs in the
ninth before the Dodgers scored four runs. Manager Bobby Valentine
mentioned before the game that Benitez was unavailable because he
had pitched in two straight games and it was too early in the
season for him to work in three straight. Since the Mets had a 5-1
bulge, the sight of Franco instead of Benitez in the ninth did not
seem puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   Franco immediately struggled as Karros led off with a homer.
After Adrian Beltre struck out, Franco walked Chad Kreuter and
allowed Kevin Elster's single. The tying run was at the plate and
Benitez received a call from Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `I need you. Can you pitch?' I said, `No big deal,'''
Benitez said.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez needs 7 to 10 minutes to get ready. While he warmed up,
Franco induced Jose Vizcaino to fly out. Two outs. Benitez was
still warming up and White was strolling to the plate. He was 1 for
5 in his career against Franco and 0 for 7 with five strikeouts
against Benitez, but Valentine wanted White, a switch-hitter, to
bat right-handed. Besides, Benitez, who dodged a question about
whether he needed a day off, said, ``I wasn't ready yet'' as White
batted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Johnny's ninth inning, whether it was a one-run game or
a four-run game,'' Valentine insisted. ``He just didn't have
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   White ripped Franco's outside fastball the opposite way for a
home run to tie the score, 5-5. Four of the first six batters
scored off Franco, negating Mahomes' five and two-thirds innings of
one-run pitching, Payton's homer, Edgardo Alfonzo's two-run shot
and Melvin Mora's three hits. Everything that could have made
Saturday special, from Valentine's reserve-dominated lineup to
Mahomes' searching for his first victory as a starter since Aug. 6,
1994, dramatically changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one stung after the effort Pat gave us,'' Franco said.
``It kind of got lost in all the other garbage that happened. It's
a tough one to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez replaced Franco for the 10th and was also victimized by
Karros. After recording the first two outs, Benitez said, he worked
too quickly, affecting his motion. He left a fastball high in the
strike zone and Karros hit it 425 feet to left-center. In the
dugout, the Mets were distraught. In the stands, the fans were
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that way all afternoon. Valentine rested Mike Piazza,
Derek Bell, Todd Zeile and Rey Ordonez and started Todd Pratt, Jon
Nunnally, Mora and Matt Franco in their places. Because Darryl
Hamilton is disabled with an arthritic left big toe, Payton started
in center field, meaning the Mets started three regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us were joking it was like a B game in spring
training,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Dodgers lost Brown when he broke his right pinkie
trying to bunt in the fifth inning. His manager, Davey Johnson,
said he would probably be out for three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It all worked for the Mets until the ninth. It worked until
Franco, who has 416 saves in his career, took the ball in a nonsave
situation and fizzled. Franco, his hands clasped behind his back,
was polite yet defiant as he spoke about the perilous territory he
knows so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do your job, you get booed,'' he said. ``What am I
supposed to do? I'm not going to go home and worry about it. I've
been booed for 11 years.''

DODGERS LOSE BROWN, SHEFFIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (NO NOTEBOOK TONIGHT, GAMER TK)-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - One of the brightest moments in the past few years
for the Dodgers was overshadowed by injuries to ace right-hander
Kevin Brown and All-Star outfielder Gary Sheffield that have
brought uneasiness to the first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is expected to miss three to four weeks with a fractured
pinkie on his right hand. Sheffield was on crutches after suffering
a high ankle sprain just above his right ankle. His status will be
re-evaluated today. While Brown appears headed for the disabled
list, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he's hopeful
Sheffield could return during the upcoming series at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Also, reliever Gregg Olson has a strained right forearm that
could send him to the disabled list and right-hander Mike Fetters
re-aggravated the left quadricep injury that plagued him early in
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   It made for a surreal clubhouse following an improbable win in
which the Dodgers rallied for four runs in the ninth and beat the
Mets 6-5 on Eric Karros' solo homer in the 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad day, but it's a good day for the victory we had to
come back like we did,'' Sheffield said. ``We needed the win to get
back on the right track, but to lose two key players, we have to
have other guys pick us up until we get back. Hopefully, I'll be
back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the lone given in the Dodgers' starting rotation, injured
his hand attempting to bunt in the top of the fifth inning. The
ball dipped below his bat and struck his hand. He doubled over in
pain but finished the at-bat. He also pitched the bottom of the
fifth inning before leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   He will fly to Los Angeles today and be examined Monday by hand
specialist Dr. Norman Zemel. But he's not ruling out his Thursday
start in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can pitch around it, I'd like to do it,'' said Brown, who
also bruised his right ring finger on the bunt attempt. ``It's a
matter of what they say what would happen. If it heals up OK, or if
it heals up wrong, is it going to be a problem down the line? We'll
see what they think. You're not really using that finger. If it
heals up wrong, will it be a problem then? That's what I have to
talk to them and find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where we'll see what they say and go from
there. As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to be out there as soon
as I can. Someone's going to have to convince me that I'm risking
having problems with it and causing problems with my pitching for a
while. I'm not interested in something that's going to cause a
season-long problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said the Dodgers wouldn't do anything
silly to jeopardize Brown's health or his career, and given he's in
the second year of a seven-year, $105 million contract it behooves
both parties to proceed cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's impossible to overstate Brown's importance to the
Dodgers, especially the starting rotation. For as much uncertainty
that surrounds the Dodgers' other starters, Brown is continually
counted on to pitch deep into games.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers trainer Stan Johnston said the fracture begins at the
base of the pinkie and travels up the finger to the first knuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to pitch with it, that's Brownie, but I don't see any
possibility of him pitching for three or four weeks,'' Johnson
said. ``We're not going to endanger a great career by bringing him
back too soon. That's just not going to happen. It's amazing he
could pitch another inning with the fracture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield suffered his ankle injury when he stumbled on the
warning track on Joe Nunnally's first-inning double. A long-term
injury would also have a heavy impact on the Dodgers' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, batting .400, has hit safely in all six games this
season. He also has two homers and two triples and sets up the
beefy part of the lineup with Shawn Green and Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got ready to plant my right foot and go back and get
the ball, my foot twisted, and I felt it, so I shifted my weight to
where I didn't break it,'' Sheffield said. ``This is not in a good
area because it's a high sprain. I hate that it's my right foot,
too. It's my push-off leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a sprained ankle, but to do it on my right
foot, and to see what Mo Vaughn went through last year and the pain
he had to play through all season. Hopefully, it's nothing like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson was plagued by an elbow problem during the spring, but
Johnston said this injury is in another area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to take a little bit of time,'' Olson
said. ``Right now, I'd say I need some time. It seems like (a
strain). It's right in the bulk of the muscle. It's not in the area
that's serious. You felt it every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters said his quadricep problem shouldn't linger and he'd be
ready to go today, but the Dodgers still face enormous gaps to fill
if Brown, Sheffield and/or Olson are disabled.
</P>
<P>
   It's compounded by the fact the Dodgers still need to decide on
a starter for next Saturday's game against Cincinnati. Carlos Perez
was supposed to start against the Reds, but he was sent to Triple-A
Albuquerque before Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said every option would be looked at, but the Dodgers
are more likely to recall other pitchers. Eric Gagne, Jeff Williams
and Mike Judd are the leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   What the Dodgers do to fill Sheffield's spot, if need be, is
more precarious. The Dodgers still have five healthy outfielders,
and they could call either an outfielder or an infielder into the
mix. Todd Hollandsworth is expected to start in Sheffield's
absence.

CELTICS STEERED INTO A SKID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, they were in playoff contention. They trailed
Orlando by a half-game in the race for the eighth and final spot
among Eastern Conference playoff hopefuls. But now, the season has
soured for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   No longer in playoff contention, they ran their losing streak to
10 with Friday night's 102-97 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers at the
FleetCenter. With six games left, including five at home, Antoine
Walker hopes the team will keep a positive frame of mind amid all
the negativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard and it's very difficult,'' Walker conceded.
``But right now we can't afford to feel sorry for ourselves,
because this is not the way we want to end the season. This is not
the positive way to end our season. This is not the way we want our
fans to see us at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, for ourselves and for the fans, we definitely need to play
good basketball while we're at home, give them some good
entertaining games, and get some wins and end the season on a
positive note.''
</P>
<P>
   But there remains the very real possibility that the Celtics
could go winless the rest of the way, in which case they would
establish a club record for futility. In fact, they need only lose
four more to surpass the team-record 13-game skid set in 1994 and
matched in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That worst-case scenario could prompt the front office to make a
major shake-up in the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good group of guys and we're better than what the
record indicates,'' Walker said. ``You don't want to tank the
season, you don't want it to go to waste, because then you force
management to shake it up, and if I was management I would shake it
up, too, if that was the case. But we've got to continue to work.
Two weeks ago, we were a half-game out of the playoffs and,
unfortunately, things went south on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cure for that is to get back and to play good basketball
and finish out as good as possible. Ten has got to be the magic
number that this has got to stop at. We've got to come back and get
a win Monday night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will get that opportunity when they host the Atlanta
Hawks Monday night at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to come in every day and work hard in practice
and come in with the right attitude,'' Walker said. ``That's the
one thing this team has done: come in with the right attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like guys don't want to be there. We want to be there
and get the work done. It makes for good basketball, because
everyone is still competitive and goes at each other and that's the
positive thing. We just got to get off this losing streak, so we
can show the fans and the organization that we're not as bad as our
record indicates.''

GREAT EFFORT FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Bruins did what they could for two periods
Saturday. For 40 minutes, Boston held the Philadelphia Flyers
scoreless, which is no mean feat for a club made up of mostly
American Hockey League players.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, a couple of mistakes, a disallowed goal, and the
opponent's superior talent added up to a 3-0 Flyers victory at the
First Union Center. The Flyers can clinch the Eastern Conference
championship by earning 1 point against the Rangers in New York
Sunday. A loss means the New Jersey Devils take the crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great effort, the guys played hard,'' said Boston
coach Pat Burns. ``We can't blame the goaltenders today, can we?''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the patchwork-quilt Bruins played very
effectively. But a miscue early in the third gave Philadelphia all
the offense it would need.
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Thornton, at the offensive blue line, made a blind
pass to no one and it resulted in the Flyers getting a three-on-one
rush.
</P>
<P>
   Exciting rookie center Simon Gagne skated the puck to the right
point and relayed it over to rookie defenseman Mark Eaton. Eaton
charged down the left circle on his forehand, drew Rob Tallas out
of the net, and scored on the backhand at 2:06 for his first NHL
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw like three of our forwards but it hit someone's skate
and then they're off three-on-one the other way,'' said Thornton.
``It was just one of those weird plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, the Flyers were pressing in the Bruins' zone
but the young Boston squad was able to hold them at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out a little slow at the start,'' said Tallas. ``We
knew we were going to be in for a tough game because they were
playing for something. I thought as the game went on, the young
defensemen that we have played outstanding. It was a good, solid
effort from our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas was tested many times and came up big, making 28 saves in
the first two periods. He said it was a matter of personal pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I particularly like to play here,'' he said. ``It meant a lot
to me to play because it was probably my last game as a Bruin. It
meant a lot to me to play well. I felt really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came oh so close to tying it on the power play at the
7:17 mark. With defenseman Dan McGillis off for cross-checking
Boston forward Peter Ferraro, Thornton fired a shot that hit the
crossbar and sat there for a split-second before dropping. Rookie
goalie Brian Boucher snagged the puck with his glove and pulled it
into his body. It appeared Boucher and the puck were over the goal
line and referee Paul Stewart ruled it a goal. But after video
replay, it was disallowed, although the video seemed inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard angle from where I saw it,'' said Thornton. ``It
was on top of the net and then it came down on his glove. I didn't
get a good look at it. (Stewart) seemed pretty excited that it was
a goal and I thought it was. Then they went upstairs. It was a
tough call.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 seconds after a Boston power play expired, the Flyers
got some breathing room with their second goal.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Eric Desjardins got the puck up the wall in his own
zone to send the Flyers out on a two-on-one. Center Keith Primeau,
in the left circle, made a perfect pass to right wing Mark Recchi
and he finished off the play at 14:03. John LeClair tallied an
empty-net goal at 19:07, giving him at least 40 goals for five
years straight. Boucher picked up his fourth career shutout and
second against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins close out the regular season Sunday at home against
the Pittsburgh Penguins.

WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN SEATTLE PEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have seen the face of baseball in Seattle without Junior, and
his name is . . . Daimajin?
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the enormously gifted Alex Rodriguez,
who may follow Ken Griffey out of town after this season, the key
to whether the Mariners are contenders in September may well be
their new Japanese closer, Kazuhiro Sasaki, who already is a huge
star in the Pacific Rim and has the makings of one over here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki's nickname is Daimajin, which is the name of a 60-foot
stone character in a Japanese folk tale who comes to life to save
his village from evil. Seattle general manager Pat Gillick is
paying Sasaki in excess of $8 million over the next two years to
spare Seattle the blown saves that were a staple during Griffey's
tenure with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch, 209-pound Sasaki, 32, is Japan's career
leader in saves with 229, and Thursday night he earned his first
save here against the Red Sox by striking out the side, showing off
a devastating forkball in the process. He also pitched the night
before against the Sox and threw a dozen fastballs, all for
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt he'd be good, we really did,'' said Seattle manager
Lou Piniella, who came into camp thinking Jose Mesa would return as
his closer, with Sasaki setting up, but changed his mind last
weekend. ``He threw the ball well this spring, and as spring
training progressed, he threw the ball better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Price, the Mariners' new pitching coach, played in the
Angels' minor league system with Bryan Harvey, the former All-Star
closer for the Angels and Marlins. Price says Sasaki's forkball
reminds him of the pitch Harvey learned from Joe Coleman, the
former Tigers pitcher. Sasaki doesn't throw it quite as hard as
Harvey did, but the paralyzing action is similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys who get ahead in the count and bury
it,'' Price said, ``but Kazu gets out ahead and throws strikes with
it, like he did against Jason (Varitek). The bottom falls out of
it, but it's still a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hideo Nomo, another Japanese pitcher, first came to the
Dodgers, his splitter was unhittable, but hitters eventually
learned to lay off the pitch because it usually dropped out of the
strike zone. That doesn't happen with Sasaki, Price says.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was just one series, but is Sasaki as good as he
looked against the Sox?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is,'' Price said. ``I think he's not going into an
unfamiliar situation here. He was looked upon as the premier
pitcher in all of Japan, where I'm told he's preserved like a
national treasure, and he's working here in circumstances that he's
not unfamiliar with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing it for 10 years. He knows what it's like to
pitch in the ninth inning. This is not the infancy stage of his
being a closer. And with his stuff, he doesn't have to back down to
anybody. He has great command of his fastball, and he's off the
charts with his forkball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization showed a real commitment to strengthening our
pitching. We were looking for a guy to step up and be that guy we
could rally around. No disrespect to Jose, but I see the public
really excited about Kazu. Not only for the way he pitches, but the
kid's personality. He's affable, always smiling, happy. He's
integrated himself with the club. He's a lot of fun to have
around.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 160 media members from Japan following
Sasaki during spring training in Arizona, and the Mariners' first
three games were televised back to Japan by NHK, a Japanese
television network, and broadcast by Jolf radio.
</P>
<P>
   When he came into the games in Safeco Field, the outfield panels
flashed ``Daimajin'' in giant letters while the center-field
scoreboard flashed the shortened version of his first name, Kazu,
in bright colors. He was greeted the first night with a standing
ovation, and he left to another one after earning his first save.
</P>
<P>
   The club, of course, understands the marketing possibilities
both home and abroad. He's already featured in a TV ad with club
broadcaster Dave Niehaus, supposedly learning English by repeating
some of Niehaus's pet phrases (``Grand salami'' for a grand slam).
Niehaus now has taken to uttering ``sashin,'' the Japanese word for
strikeout, when Sasaki rings someone up.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Hale, the Mariners' director of public information, told
of a reception held for Sasaki last weekend at Safeco Field in
response to a request from the Japanese-American chamber of
commerce. Five hundred people were in attendance, including many of
the top politicos in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The team's Japanese fans can now send messages to
Japan(at)Mariners.org and get a response from the team's Japan
liaison, Hide Sueyoshi, who also is the team's assistant to the
director for Pacific Rim scouting. And the team's press releases
are now available in Japanese on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Sox GM Dan Duquette liked Sasaki's skills but said his asking
price was too rich for the Sox, who gave $3.35 million to Korean
lefty Sang Hoon Lee instead. But it wouldn't have mattered if
Duquette were willing to cough over some of the Yawkey Trust's cash
for Sasaki. His agent, Tony Attanasio, is openly contemptuous of
Duquette and Boston's international scouting director, Ray
Poitevint.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella acknowledges there's a difference in these Mariners.
And it's not just Sasaki. Arthur Rhodes, the lefthander signed as a
free agent from Baltimore, was brought in twice to face Troy
O'Leary in the late innings and set down three Sox batters in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, in three-quarters of our games I didn't have a
lefty in the bullpen,'' Piniella said. ``You need matchups at the
end of the game. A manager basically uses what he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing how much smarter a manager becomes when he has a good
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we had a real good offense over here, but our
pitching was a struggle,'' Piniella said. ``We've fortified our
pitching, but now we're going to have to win with pitching and
defense. I knew that coming out of spring training. You're going to
see us play a lot of tight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the thunder we had in the past, but we're still
a home run hitting team, to be honest. You can talk all you want
about little ball, but we're still a home run hitting team.''
</P>
<P>
   A few long balls and one Daimajin, and the Mariners might still
be playing in October.
</P>
<P>
   A short triple
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bowa, the Mariners' third base coach, has been around pro
ball since 1966. As one of the greatest defensive shortstops in
history _ his lifetime fielding percentage of .980 is the National
League record for the position _ Bowa has an insider's view of the
Three Amigos, Nomar Garciaparra, Derek Jeter, and Alex Rodriguez.
He's coaching Rodriguez now _ A-Rod recommended him highly to
Gillick _ and he's a huge fan of Garciaparra and Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Bowa's thoughts last week, while first Nomar, then Jeter, went
head to head against A-Rod in Seattle:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all great players. They'll get a hit, steal a base,
drive in a run, make plays. If you need a home run, they'll hit a
home run. If you need a double, they'll hit a double. You want all
three of them up at the plate with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these guys comes along once every 50 years. We've got
three in one decade. I don't think we'll ever see anything like it
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing all three of them do is respect what has come
before them. Derek Jeter always says hello to me. Most guys don't
even know the names of the coaches and the managers. These guys
know the history of baseball. They respect the history of baseball,
and they all have work ethics second to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched them from the other side, and they all work hard.
They don't take shortcuts. They're all on the top of their game.
Yes, they're all great athletes, but they work at it, too. Their
greatness is not easily achieved. I'd get to the clubhouse at 7 in
the morning during spring training, and A-Rod would be there,
working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that shocks me about Nomar? My arm hurts when he
throws. I've never seen somebody who throws that unorthodox get so
much on the ball in my life. He literally slings it over there,
with unbelievable velocity. You watch most guys who throw on the
run, they're just trying to get rid of it and get it to the bag. He
throws with great velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a kid watching an instructional video of Nomar,
you'd say, `Don't throw like that or you'll blow your arm out.' (An
injury) would not surprise me, the way he throws. But I remember
talking to Jimy (Williams), and him saying, `I'm not saying a word
to this guy.' You can't. But I hope he doesn't blow out his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you compare the three of them, they all bring
everything to the party, but they all have different ways to get to
the party. A-Rod the other night, he hit a home run off his front
foot. Jeter inside-outs the ball unbelievably well. Nomar hits
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they do to each other is drive each other. They
all want to be the best, they all want a championship, and they all
respect one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking some heat
</P>
<P>
   Tim Spehr, the veteran catcher who opened the season in
Pawtucket, said 22-year-old Korean righthander Sunny Kim threw the
best bullpen session he caught in camp this spring. ``He's got a
great curve, a great split, and an excellent fastball,'' Spehr
said. ``He's going to come fast.'' Peabody's Steve Lomasney, who
caught Kim the last two years in Sarasota, Trenton, and the Arizona
Fall League, also has raves. Asked if Kim had a chance to become a
good pitcher, Lomasney looked disbelievingly at his questioner and
said, ``You mean he isn't one right now? He's got an above-average
fastball that he hits the black with on both sides of the plate, he
has a good breaking pitch that he can throw at any time in the
count, and his changeup (splitter), which is definitely his out
pitch, is one of the best around.'' Lomasney said Kim's fastball is
consistently 89-92 m.p.h. ``And there are certain times of the
game,'' he said, ``that he can hump it up to 95. His two-seamer is
as good a two-seamer as anybody. He's got real confidence in his
stuff, and he's not intimidated by anybody. He goes right after
hitters. And Sunny's real smart.'' Kim has picked up English
rapidly and carries around a portable computer translator . . .
It's a mystery why Donnie Sadler, who deserves to be on Boston's
big-league club, wasn't told until the day before the season
started in Pawtucket that the Sox planned to have him play center
field there. The decision was not made on Ben Mondor Way. It was
made on Yawkey Way. For Sadler, who would rather play second base,
center field is as much of a dead end as shortstop. Now, in
addition to having Garciaparra in front of him, he has Carl Everett
there, too, with Darren Lewis the obvious choice to play if Everett
goes down or needs a rest . . . Tough debut for Michael Coleman,
who was shifted to right field to make room for Sadler. He made an
error and whiffed three times in Pawtucket's 6-3 loss to Syracuse.
Tomo Ohka incurred his first minor league loss after going 15-0
between Trenton and Pawtucket last season, while Lee, in his
American pro debut, gave up four hits and four runs (one earned) in
1 1/3 innings.

   Ex files

<P>
   Ex-Red Sox Player of the Week honors go to Carl Pavano. The
24-year-old Expos righthander, who is finally healthy and coming
off a great spring, gave up just one run on five hits and a walk in
eight innings of an 11-3 win over the Dodgers Thursday night.
Runners-up honors go to Orioles righthander Pat Rapp (6 IP, 5 H, 5
BB, 2 R) and Giants outfielder Ellis Burks (home runs in each of
his first two games, including an upper-deck shot at Miami's Pro
Player Stadium). Worst performance by an ex-Sox player? Tampa Bay
DH Jose Canseco, who struck out four times in four at-bats Thursday
against the Twins. Pavano, of course, went to Montreal in the Pedro
Martinez deal three Novembers ago. Tony Armas Jr., the highly-rated
pitching prospect who went with Pavano, is in extended spring
training because of stiffness in his throwing elbow . . . Blue Jays
second baseman Homer Bush tried out a cherry-red Garciaparra bat
during BP last week. The verdict? ``It's a keeper,'' he said . . .
Angels president Tony Tavares acknowledged Disney chairman Michael
Eisner is ``not passionate about having to own this team.'' Eisner
was noticeably absent from the Angels opener and was actively
trying to sell the team. Maybe it's an AL West thing. Mariners
officials say Hiroshi Yamauchi, who has owned 49 percent of the
club since '92, has yet to see a game in Seattle in person.
Yamauchi, chairman of Nintendo International, lives in Kyoto,
Japan. Compared with Eisner and Yamauchi, Sox boss John Harrington,
keeper of the Trust, is front and center . . . Arizona's Randy
Johnson threw more pitches (133) than any other Opening Day pitcher
last week. No surprise there. The Unit threw 4,206 pitches last
season, the most in the majors . . . It was an unnerving
development for the Dodgers when catcher Todd Hundley had to miss a
couple of games with a strained medial collateral ligament in his
right knee. Hundley came back and played Thursday, but he hit just
.207 last season after coming back from elbow surgery . . . Closer
Mike Jackson, passed over in the free agent market by teams worried
about his health, has sent up red flags in Philadelphia after
complaining of a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel laboring
</P>
<P>
   A shaky debut for Charlie Manuel, the Indians' new manager, who
lost two out of three to the Orioles and Mike Hargrove, fired as
the Tribe's manager after their playoff elimination by the Sox. The
Indians already have lost more games against the Orioles this
season than they did all of last year under Hargrove, when they
went 9-1 against the Birds . . . Managers were showing short
tempers all over the circuit. Manuel made it through the opener, an
Indians win, but was tossed for arguing balls and strikes in the
next two games . . . Expos manager Felipe Alou cursed out Dodgers
pitcher Orel Hershiser for hitting slugger Vladimir Guerrero with a
pitch. Alou stood at the top of the dugout steps, bellowing at
Hershiser and saying the matter was ``between you and I.''
Hershiser, of course, denied he was throwing at Guerrero, who hit
two home runs in the series and had reached base three times in the
game when Hershiser nailed him. ``He's a big man, an honorable man,
a guy who might be in the Hall of Fame, and I might be lesser than
that,'' Alou said afterward. ``But I have a right to believe he hit
Guerrero purposely. If I'm wrong, I'll ask for forgiveness.''
Meanwhile, Milwaukee's new manager, Davey Lopes, yelled at Reds
shortstop Barry Larkin for stealing third in the ninth inning with
the Reds down four runs. The Brewers had left third base uncovered
while deploying a shift against Ken Griffey . . . You can be sure
Tigers fans took note of Gabe Kapler hitting two home runs in his
first game in Texas, while ex-Rangers slugger Juan Gonzalez already
is begging off games because of sore hamstrings. This is the fourth
season Gonzalez has missed games because of hamstring problems . .
. Brian McRae, released last week by the Cardinals, was in Seattle
last week working the Mariners-Sox game as an ESPN analyst . . .
While savoring the miracle of Andres Galarraga's return from cancer
and of Kenny Lofton's defying medical probability and returning
months ahead of schedule from elbow surgery, condolences go out to
the Aussie lefthander Graeme Lloyd, whose 26-year-old wife, Cindy,
died of complications from Crohn's disease on the eve of the Expos
opener. Said Expos catcher Chris Widger, ``It makes you think what
you do on the field is kind of stupid.''

NOMAR PUTTING FANS IN THE SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Edison Field, home of the Anaheim Angels, is
not far from York Field and Joe Miller Field in Whittier, Calif.,
where Ramon Garciaparra would hit millions of fungos to his young
son, Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   Edison is only a 20-minute drive from St. John Bosco in
Bellflower, Calif. _ a Catholic boys' school run by Salesian
priests _ from which Nomar graduated in 1991. It was at St. John
Bosco that he kicked a 47-yard field goal for the football team.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all this, Red Sox-Angels games in Southern California
are special for Nomar and his family. Mo Vaughn's parents, Leroy
and Shirley, attend almost every game, often sitting in a private
box Mo rents. Nomar, meanwhile, has more than 100 family and
friends scattered throughout the Edison stands, most on the first
base side behind the Red Sox dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him come over to the rail and kiss his sister before the
game,'' said an Edison usher Friday night. ``She was wearing a blue
Red Sox jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Garciaparras wear Nomar No. 5 jerseys. It was the
favorite number of dad Ramon (who grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico),
and it's been carried on by Ramon's kids, Nomar, Michael, Monique,
and Yvette. Red Sox garb is optional for mom Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra visited Edison Field (then Anaheim Stadium) the day
he signed his Red Sox contract in 1994 (``I wasn't even 21 yet, I
was 20 years old''). The Red Sox were playing the Angels that night
and Garciaparra went on the radio with Joe Castiglione and made a
lasting impression on Sox fans listening back home. When he made
his first trip to California with the Sox two years later, his
personal cheering section was 300 strong. It's not quite that big
anymore, and the Garciaparras are a little more reserved these
days, but it's still a formidable support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see 'em,'' Nomar said. ``They're everywhere in the
stands. It's always great to feel the support and go out there and
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just good to see family. But I've got to go out there and
play another game. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to
spend with them and stuff because we're playing a game every day.
To me, something special is being able to spend a lot of time with
the family and that I can't do while I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And the numbers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we had to do it through group sales,'' he said with a
smile. ``Now they're on their own and everybody gets them
themselves. I just take care of my immediate family now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other numbers were not so strong as the Sox prepared to play the
Angels in their fifth game of the season Saturday night. In the
Sox' first four games, Garciaparra was 3 for 16 (.188) with no
homers, no RBIs, and only one extra-base hit, a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fine, he'll be fine, he will be fine,'' recited
manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting good swings,'' Garciaparra said. ``This happens.
It's part of it and you've got to go through it. The pitchers
aren't doing anything differently. I'm seeing balls I usually hit.
Right now it seems like we're a little out of synch. Our pitchers
are doing a good job, but we've got to go out and get some runs so
they feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night against Jason Dickson, Garciaparra came up with
Trot Nixon on third and one out in the fourth inning. He popped to
short _ an uncharacteristic failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy on third, one out _ popping up _ that's not our team,'' he
said, disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just missing balls. We've got to create more opportunities
and capitalize on 'em. It's still early and there's a lot, a lot of
baseball left. The key is keeping everybody healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any extra pressure on me. I just have to
go out there and do whatever it takes _ move the guy over or drive
guys in. I never set individual goals for myself. I just want to
win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as he likes seeing family and friends, he looks forward to
getting back to Fenway Tuesday when the Red Sox open at home
against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our fans have expectations of us and we have high
expectations of ourselves as well,'' he said. ``We play hard and I
think they respect that we give 100 percent for nine innings. And
it shows because the fans stay and support us for all nine
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be good for Nomar to get home, even if it's 3,000 miles
from home. At Fenway, there will be more No. 5 jerseys in the
stands _ folks who love Nomar like family.

WARRICK STILL THE REASONABLE CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian Billick knows a few things about offense, having created
one at Minnesota that went wild and similar successful ones
elsewhere, so his opinion on matters offensive count, and his
opinion is clear on Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Take the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can measure him, weigh him, put him in shorts all you
want, but put the film on,'' said the Baltimore Ravens' coach last
week after Warrick had visited the team's training facility. ``He
is an impact player and will be one in this league. I don't think
anyone in this league will disagree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Charley Armey won't. The St. Louis Rams' general
manager firmly believes Warrick is ``the only impact player in this
draft. The only player who can change a game with one play and
will.''
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't he going to be the first choice?
</P>
<P>
   How about because of paralysis from analysis?
</P>
<P>
   When the college football season ended in January, Warrick was
the No. 1 pick by acclamation. He was all but unstoppable through
his career at Florida State. He played best in the biggest games.
He threatened defenses constantly and burned them often. He changed
games by his mere presence.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ran a 4.67 40-yard dash in February at a private workout
and showed up to meet executives of the Cleveland Browns in
military fatigues, and the talk suddenly switched to Penn State's
two defensive stars, pass rusher Courtney Brown and linebacker
LaVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   What's up with that?
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's agent, Michael George, wonders himself. He says the
Browns changed their mind about Warrick about two weeks ago and
will go with defense, meaning Arrington or Brown, depending on
which one agrees to a contract before he's selected.
</P>
<P>
   Both are potential stars, but Warrick is the kind of player who
can do the things that another guy who was slip-sliding away in the
draft a couple of years ago does. He can do what Randy Moss can do,
which is force a defense to change the way it plays.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently if he would take Vonnie Holliday again if he had
the chance, Green Bay Packers general manager Ron Wolf said, ``No,
I'd take Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no knock on Holliday, it's a comment on what can happen
when teams look at a player they know is special and then go about
finding holes in him. In Moss's case, it was all off-the-field
problems, of which he had enough to legitimately concern teams. He
slid to No. 21 and has been in the Pro Bowl ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But Warrick has no such history. One bad 40 time run on an
indoor basketball court while wearing outdoor track shoes and
everything changed for him, which illustrates the weakness of many
NFL scouting operations.
</P>
<P>
   They spend millions to watch young men play football. They watch
film of them playing football. They go and watch them play football
live. They turn on the TV and watch them play football. Then
February comes when all the football games are over and they change
their minds based on a workout or a rumor.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the smartest guy in this entire process seems to be
young Warrick himself.
</P>
<P>
   He answered the questions about his speed by simply saying, ``To
be a great receiver, you don't have to have great speed. You have
to run great routes, then make yards after the catch. Teams aren't
drafting me to be a track star. If they want a track star, then
draft one. If they want a wide receiver, then I think I'm the best
in college football.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he is, but there is even a school of thought that says you
don't take a wide receiver No. 1 under any circumstances. It is a
position shared even by guys who should know better, guys who make
their living running offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what Warrick did in his career and he was probably
the best player in college football the past three years,'' said
Washington coach Norv Turner at the recent owners meetings. ``I
think it's the position.''
</P>
<P>
   What Turner meant was that only five wide receivers have ever
been selected with the first overall pick. One was Irving Fryar,
who put together Hall of Fame numbers but not until he left the
team that gambled on him _ the Patriots. Another was Keyshawn
Johnson, and teams are talking about trading multiple picks to get
him away from the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel people will argue that it is easier to find great
receivers than great pass rushers, and that may be true, but you
can also miss far more easily on a pass rusher than on a great
receiver because the pass rushing game in the NFL is far different
from college, while route running and receiving skills are more
readily transferable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with receivers is there are more of them, so the
differential from the top one to the fifth or sixth one isn't as
great as at some other positions,'' said Browns coach Chris Palmer.
``Peter Warrick is a great player. But the other two are
something.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd better be, because if the Browns and Redskins pass on
Warrick and he slips to No. 4 _ or even to Billick in the fifth
spot _ and turns into the same kind of player in the NFL that he
has been in college, somebody will have some explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   As Warrick's agent loves to remind people, two years ago,
Arizona took Andre Wadsworth with the third pick, and Minnesota
took Moss with the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Whom would you want today?
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Browns should remember what time of year this is.
It's a time when otherwise sane personnel men stop believing their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There is still time for the Browns to avoid that. All they have
to do is what Billick suggested. All they have to do is put on some
film and see how many of these great defensive players they're
interested in ever tackled Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Rice, he's not the fastest man in the world, but when he
breaks out, isn't anybody going to catch him,'' Warrick said. ``It
all boils down to making plays when your number is called.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick does that, which is why when his number is called
next, it should be the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer still in demand
</P>
<P>
   If you don't understand how few NFL-caliber quarterbacks exist
today, consider the case of Rick Mirer. The former No. 1 pick of
the Seattle Seahawks has thrown 10 touchdown passes and 27
interceptions the last four years, with half the touchdowns and a
third of the interceptions coming last season when he went 2-4 as a
starter for the New York Jets before losing his job to a former
special teams player, Ray Lucas. Yet Mirer is being courted by the
49ers and Vikings and reportedly has a handshake agreement to sign
with San Francisco after June 1 when the Niners will have enough
cap room. As it stands, Mirer is set to have a two-day workout with
the 49ers during their April 28-30 minicamp. At the moment, the
49ers are $1.467 million under the cap but need to have $2 million
cleared to make their 10 draft selections . . . San Francisco is
not sure whether Steve Young will be back, but several close
friends believe he will not. Young always said he was unlikely to
get married until he was finished playing. He recently took that
step and has been on an extended honeymoon in the South Pacific. If
he does decide to play, the Denver Broncos hope to make a deal to
land him . . . Pity the league's assistant coaches. Not only are
Larry Kennan's efforts to get them medical insurance and other
benefits falling on deaf ears, but now the owners have done away
with the supervisory tag that allowed an assistant to break his
contract without permission if he was moving up to a coordinator's
job. Now no coach can take such a job without his old club's
permission if he is under contract. Do these guys coach in America
or the World League? . . . After a week of throwing, San Diego
quarterback Ryan Leaf says he has not gotten back the zip after two
arthroscopies on his shoulder in the last seven months. Leaf will
see well-known orthopedic surgeon James Andrews in Birmingham,
Ala., this week for a second opinion. The Chargers initially
claimed there was nothing wrong with his shoulder, but the young
quarterback remains convinced otherwise . . . The Rams will unveil
new uniforms at a fashion show in a St. Louis mall this week. They
have changed from royal blue to navy blue. Fortunately, the ram
horns remain on their helmets . . . Helmet trouble exists in New
York, however, after the Giants announced they were going back to
the old ``NY'' logo. This enraged politicians in New York and New
Jersey, many of whom work under the theory that if you train, play,
and practice in New Jersey all week, you shouldn't put ``NY'' on
your hat on Sunday afternoon. ``Calling them the New York Giants is
like Diana Ross going out on tour without Mary Wilson and trying to
say it's the Supremes,'' said New York Senate minority leader
Richard Codey. ``It's time for them to face it. They're the Jersey
Giants no matter what it says on their helmets. The closest they've
come to New York is when they look at it.'' Equally outraged was
New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman, who probably should have more
important things on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tangled Web
</P>
<P>
   Only a week after NFL owners ``agreed'' not to do anything that
might jeopardize a leaguewide Internet deal, Dallas's Jerry Jones
did that when he signed a five-year deal to let Broadband Sports
operate the Cowboys' Web site. The owners had voted to unify
NFL.com with team Web sites but did allow individual clubs to
operate independently this year. Jones seemed to jump the gun,
though, with an ambitious plan that would include streaming video
of Cowboys practices, among other things. Technically, Jones did
nothing wrong because all clubs are free to make local deals this
year, but clearly he went further than expected . . . After meeting
with the Browns, Arrington feels he has a good chance to be the
draft's top selection. This comes only days after he advocated for
his teammate, Brown, to be the top selection. ``After conversing
with the owner and the coaching staff, I get the feeling they
really don't know,'' Arrington said. ``But at this point I'm kind
of confident that maybe I'll end up in Cleveland.'' Both Arrington
and Brown were in Cleveland Thursday. A day earlier, Arrington was
in Washington, saying the Redskins would be ``a perfect fit for
me.'' It probably didn't bode well for his interest in the Browns
that he claimed he spent most of his eight-minute interview trying
to convince them to take Brown . . . Speaking of draftees with
something on their mind, Michigan State wide receiver Plaxico
Burress has seen himself slide from a projected top-five pick to
more than halfway down the first round because of rumors that he
has attitude problems and is difficult to handle. Burress is
blaming most of the rumors on the Philadelphia Eagles, with whom he
failed to connect on several interview sessions. At the combine in
February, the Eagles claim, he blew them off to attend an Indiana
Pacers game. Burress says he knew nothing about the meeting. Then
last Monday, Burress said he wanted to go watch his school play for
the NCAA basketball title in Indianapolis rather than meet with
Philadelphia. Angered over a request from agent Leigh Steinberg's
office to reschedule, the Eagles simply canceled. The Jets, Bears,
Ravens, and Buccaneers all agreed to reschedule meetings with
Burress. Other unflattering (and Burress says unsubstantiated)
rumors are that he showed up for his private workout in a stretch
limo (he says it was a van) and that he is already more than
$200,000 in debt. It didn't help that when college teammate Gari
Scott came to visit the Eagles, he told reporters that many
teammates considered Burress arrogant and selfish. This happens
every year at this time to somebody. One year it happened to a guy
named Dan Marino. He seemd to survive it all right, and if Burress
can play, he will too.
</P>
<P>
   Minding his own business
</P>
<P>
   During the annual coaches breakfast at the owners' meetings in
Florida, Patriots coach Bill Belichick was asked if he was glad he
got out of the Jets' situation considering the problems new coach
Al Groh is already facing with Johnson and a tight salary cap. ``I
don't sit around and gloat about what everybody else's problems are
in the league,'' Belichick said. ``We've got about $400 under the
cap and no players, so I'm not really worried about the Jets. I've
got enough of my own problems.'' Unlike many of Belichick's
players, he understands the situation in New England . . . As
installment payments go, Barry Sanders made a big one last week
when he forked over $88,333 to the Lions as he began repaying the
portion of his signing bonus an arbitrator says he forfeited by
retiring two days before training camp last summer. Sanders paid
the first installment with a cashier's check, and the remaining
ones will be far bigger. If he stays retired, he has to come up
with $1.83 million a year for the next three years. He owed only
$83,333 this year because the Lions had withheld the final $1.75
million due him from his signing bonus last September. Right now
Sanders and the Lions are fighting over when the other payments are
due. Arbitrator Sam Kagel has yet to rule on that, but either way
it'll be a big installment . . . Jimmy Gould, agent for Terry
Glenn, should know better than to tell a reporter he is trying to
get the Patriots to renegotiate Glenn's contract, which has two
years to run. Glenn remains a special player, but his medical and
off-field problems have retarded his progress and made him less
than a fan favorite. The last thing he needs at the moment is talk
of a potential sit-down strike if he doesn't get the kind of deal
his draft day contemporary, Indianapolis's Marvin Harrison, just
landed. Harrison had 115 receptions for 1,663 yards and 12
touchdowns last year and was rewarded with a five-year, $25.4
million contract that included a $11.5 million signing bonus. This
has made Glenn and Johnson antsy. Johnson is demanding a new deal
or a trade from the Jets, couching it in a demand for ``respect.''
These days in sports, ``respect'' means only one thing: cash. The
difference is that Harrison put up far bigger numbers than Johnson
or Glenn and had only one year remaining on his contract, so his
new deal was extremely cap-friendly as well as good business for
the Colts. Glenn and Johnson have two years left, so there is no
pressure on the teams to do a thing. Fiscally, the smart thing is
for the Jets and Patriots to hold to their present deals. The smart
thing for Glenn is to be quiet and have the kind of season Harrison
had last year, when he had two years left on his contract. If Glenn
does anything near what Harrison did in 1999, he'll cash in next
year . . . Times have definitely changed in Tampa. The Bucs, who
once couldn't give away tickets, are within 2,000 sales of becoming
one of 11 NFL teams with a waiting list for season tickets. They
will try to sell those tickets at a pick-your-seat event this week
. . . Don't expect to see wide receiver Bert Emanuel in Raymond
James Stadium, though. The Bucs' wide receiver, who has been a
major disappointment the past two years, has been told not to
bother attending the team's offseason workouts because he'll be
gone by June, one way or another.

COMPLAINTS, LIKE CHANGES, NOTHING NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ So, many players were unhappy with the changes
made to Augusta National Golf Club? What a surprise. They are
usually such an agreeable group of gents.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw was aghast that the club would lay a shovel to
Bobby Jones's legacy. Jack Nicklaus couldn't use his tree lines.
Tiger Woods said the ninth hole was completely changed. And Phil
Mickelson, noted architect, said, ``I think Bobby Jones and Alister
Mackenzie were great designers. I don't think it's the place of
anybody, if you can't break 90, to be changing the golf course from
those original designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, of course, shot a crisp 83 in the first round of The
Players Championship two weeks ago, so by six shots he apparently
is qualified _ to offer expertise on the subject. But when he tries
to do that, he makes it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had the chance to play the same golf course that the
guys did in the '30s and '40s,'' he told reporters last week.
Apparently, he feels life was more fair for players back then. We
must assume, however, that while he'd like to play the Augusta
National of that era, he would not like the purses golfers played
for, the greens they putted on, the transportation they dealt with,
or their lack of TV exposure.
</P>
<P>
   And how about equipment? Why is it OK to improve equipment but
not to update golf courses? Simple. The equipment changes have
benefitted the players, while changes to courses usually don't.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta has long been one of the world's greatest courses, and
that hasn't changed one bit. Rough has been added to offset the
tremendous distance players now hit the ball. What remains the
heart and soul of this course, however, is its greens, which
require accurate shots to find the correct spots.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods shot 75 Thursday, it had nothing to do with narrow
fairways. He shanked a shot from the middle of the fairway at the
par-4 10th and made double bogey. He misjudged the wind at the
par-3 12th and went into the water. He missed a 2-foot putt at the
12th for a triple bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Stadler took a 9 at the par-5 15th. The rough? The
disrupted tree lines? The 1982 champ scoffed: ``The golf course
played the same as always. You have to hit good iron shots in
there, or you're struggling to make par.'' Stadler dumped his third
shot into the water on 15, took a drop, then got the next one wet.
Cheers to him for not blaming Tom Fazio, the famed architect who
oversaw the changes to this venerable course.
</P>
<P>
   And bravo to all those players who embrace logic on this
subject. Nick Price is among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy they are (making changes),'' said Price. ``There are
changes that needed to be done there over the years. It's nice to
see them do that, to make the course play longer and harder.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those folks who cringe at the thought of altering the
Mona Lisa of golf courses, check out the 2000 Masters media guide,
which chronicles 69 significant changes over time. Many are subtle,
some are not. There was, for instance, the switch from Bermuda to
bentgrass on the greens in 1980. There are still mumblings from the
old guard to go back to Bermuda to speed 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't today's pampered players love that?
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind one thing about today's professional golfers: They
always find something to complain about. David Duval said exactly
that when asked about _ guess what? _ complaints that the TPC at
Sawgrass was too penalizing. Indeed, these players can't figure out
what the problem is, which makes you wonder whether there is a
problem. Go back to Pinehurst and last summer's US Open. John Daly,
after opening with a 68, spent an hour singing the praises of the
USGA for choosing such a site and exercising great judgment in its
setup. By Sunday, however, Daly had crashed, thanks in part to an
11 at the par-4 eighth hole. Suddenly Pinehurst was a goat farm and
officials were to blame. OK, so Daly is a bit irrational, but in
the final round, Price said the USGA had applied too much water to
the front of the greens, which prevented balls from releasing
toward the pin. Not an hour later, Craig Parry said the course was
too dry. ``Gentlemen, don't they use water in the US?'' he asked.
Paul Azinger said the Masters was the hardest tournament to win, as
it required all aspects of your game. Stuart Appleby opted for the
British Open. As difficult as Augusta National is, said Appleby,
``St. Andrews was a more complicated'' course . . . As the Masters
shapes its field in the mirror of the World Golf Championships
(using world rankings to determine exemptions), some PGA Tour
players have been left out. The decision to eliminate exemptions
for Tour winners was a hot topic last week. Many feel the greatest
prize for winning a Tour event has been a spot in the Masters. That
is no longer the case, as tournament officials invited the top 50
in the world rankings to make the event more competitive. The rule
adversely affected Olin Browne, Brad Faxon, Brian Henninger, Rich
Beem, J.L. Lewis, Tom Pernice Jr., and Jim Carter, all winners in
1999. Some players didn't know about the change. Gary Nicklaus was
in a playoff with Mickelson at the BellSouth last Sunday and
thought a victory would get him an invite to the Masters. While
many players don't like the new criteria, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold
Palmer did not have a problem with it. Hal Sutton was another.
``Overall, change is not easily accepted,'' said Sutton. ``It's
never popular the first time. But I think it's a good change.'' . .
. Padraig Harrington criss-crossed the globe before coming to the
Masters. The personable Irishman missed the cut at Bay Hill March
17 and did not have a berth in the following week's TPC. Since he
wasn't playing BellSouth, he was facing a 2 1/2-week layoff, so he
went to Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo for back-to-back European Tour
events. The travel was a gamble right before his Masters debut. But
in each event, Harrington had at least a share of the 54-hole lead;
he lost in Rio but won in Sao Paulo, which made the long trip to
Augusta more enjoyable _ and more tiring, too. He felt vindicated,
for many European Tour observers had questioned the move. ``It was
the right decision,'' he said . . . Jean Van de Velde is heading
back to Europe for the Seve Ballesteros Trophy April 14-16. He will
play for Continental Europe, coached by Seve Ballesteros, against
Great Britain and Ireland, captained by Colin Montgomerie. ``Seve
told me I would play more games than I did in the Ryder Cup,'' said
Van de Velde with a smile. In last September's Ryder Cup at
Brookline, Van de Velde played just one singles match . . . Part of
the charm of the Masters is that the course is not closed to
members until Monday. So Daly was in a foursome with Mid-Amateur
champion Danny Green and two members last Sunday. Daly was spotted
loading six boxes of shirts into his car for friends and relatives.
He loves everything about the Masters, but his five-year exemption
for winning the 1995 British Open is up, and who knows whether
he'll be back? Daly figured he ``had spent his prize money'' on the
gifts. Before he missed this year's cut his track record had been
decent at the Masters. Until this year, he had made the cut in all
seven appearances, his best finish a tie for third in 1993 . . .
Also playing Augusta last Sunday was Butch Harmon, who made two
treks around the fabled layout. He didn't break 80 either time; the
greens were too fast for him.
</P>
<P>
   Elder statesman
</P>
<P>
   Lee Elder has been a special guest with a distinguished presence
all week at Augusta. Twenty-five years ago, Elder was the first
black to play in this prestigious event. Wednesday night, Elder was
honored at a golf writers dinner, and he fielded questions at a
lengthy press conference Tuesday. While disappointed that more
blacks have not followed in his footsteps, Elder, 65, remains
committed to helping children find their way into golf. ``I think
we are going to be able to help more of the young kids,'' he said,
``and certainly it won't take so long before we can have other
black players be champions as well as Tiger Woods.'' . . . The
world's hottest golfer probably won't be seen again until April 28
at the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship in Stockbridge, Ga. We are,
of course, talking about Karrie Webb, who is 4 for 4 in 2000 . . .
Price, on the competition Woods brings to the Tour: ``It will be
really interesting to see how pro golf develops over the next five
years. Tiger has been out here for three years now, and the young
guys who were 12 or 13 when he started are now 15 and 16. He set
the bar at a certain level, and those young kids are practicing
very hard to hit the ball as far as he does. They know what they
have to do.'' . . . Mark O'Meara and Woods spent the week before
the Masters playing at Isleworth in Windermere, Fla. One member of
their group was Sergio Garcia, O'Meara's guest for a few days. ``He
figures, `These guys playing at Isleworth are winning all these
majors _ maybe I need to get there,' '' said O'Meara.

WOODS COMES FROM OUT OF NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Tiger Woods was lining up his second shot on the
par-3 12th hole Saturday, a shot that even Woods called
``interesting,'' his left foot on grass, his right foot in a
bunker, and the ball on the lip.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden Woods's shot became even more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   A golf ball came flying onto that tiny 12th green. Dropped from
the heavens? Discarded by a Martian? Tossed overboard from a
wayward UFO?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden you hear this `Splat!' . . . and there it was
on the right side of the green,'' said Woods. ``It'd be a great
shot for (Sunday's) pin placement'' on the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   The ball couldn't have come from another Masters golfer because
of the location of the green, nor could it have come from a
rambunctious fan because the gallery is kept at least 200 yards
away. It is the splendid isolation of the hole that made the sudden
appearance of the ball so much out of golf's Twilight Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was an earthly explanation for the golf ball from
the heavens. The Augusta Country Club adjoins the Augusta National
Golf Club, on which the Masters is held, and the ninth hole (a par
4) of the Augusta CC passes on a hillside above Augusta National's
12th hole, the middle jewel of Amen Corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy from the Augusta Country Club sprayed one,'' said
Woods, `` . . . it was like Caddy Shack II . . . where one of the
balls just comes over a fence.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no shout of ``fore'' and no warning, said Woods. ``I
never saw a cart and I never saw anybody; I guess they were too
embarrassed to come and get it back,'' although high above Woods
and the 12th a cart kept scurrying back and forth, looking for the
errant ball.
</P>
<P>
   To no avail. A Masters marshal had picked it up and put it in
his pocket. ``I wasn't going to play that ball,'' said Woods.
``It's not my brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but another chapter of the Woods lore was about to be
written.
</P>
<P>
   A writer asked Woods if he could identify the brand of the ball
from the heavens, expecting a simple ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a Precept, but I'm not sure,'' said Woods. ``It
looked like . . . the dimple pattern from a distance looked like a
Precept.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams had unusually sharp eyesight, but Woods said he was
able to identify a golf ball by its dimple pattern, and from a
distance of 30 to 40 feet, although Woods would say he was about 20
feet from where the ball landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyesight's 20/15,'' said Woods, trying to downplay his feat
of vision. ``Most pros, you throw a ball down, they can tell (the
ball's brand) just by the color of it, you can see the different
dimple pattern because each ball is uniquely different. You can
just tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods Saturday got himself back into contention with a 4-under
68 that left him 1-under after three rounds. His inspiration was
from his experience (``I knew if I could just get back under par,
anything can happen''), and from a late night sportscast Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching television, and a lot of people were saying I
was out of it,'' said Woods, who was a bland 3-over after two
rounds. ``I didn't appreciate it. I'm not out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who said the dastardly words?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you that (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was also aided by a putting lesson from his father, Earl,
who did not walk the course but had watched his son on television
the first two rounds. His father suggested Tiger was holding his
hands too low before putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I took a look at it and, yeah, they were a little low,''
said Woods. ``The lower your hands the easier it is to hook the
ball. My dad has always been a believer in holding your hands up to
release your left hand with your right hand. I tried it (Friday
night), didn't like it, but I also felt it was probably better than
what I had.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. Woods made four straight birdies from the seventh
through the 10th holes, and even though they were set up by supreme
iron shots that left Woods with putts no longer than 7 feet, he
made them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm back, and I can release the blade properly,'' said
Woods, ``and get the ball rolling on line, and not . . . it felt
like I'd been skidding the putts a bit. But now the ball's rolling
end-over-end and the ball's not lipping out. That's when you know
you're really rolling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was in the middle of his birdie run when a storm halted
play for two hours. His drive was in the middle of the 11th fairway
and he was ready for another birdie attempt. ``It was
disconcerting,'' said Woods, who spent the time ``eating and
listening to some great stories from the old guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was so anxious to resume play that he was standing by his
ball 10 minutes before the siren sounded. Woods went on to par the
11th, and then came the Twilight Zone of the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to taking a putting lesson from his father, then
going out to eat with him Friday night, Woods also spent a good
chunk of the night watching the Weather Channel. ``From what the
Weather Channel said, there's going to be some frost overnight and
freeze warnings,'' said Woods. ``Temperatures in the 30s and 40s
(Sunday), so it has to be colder when the leaders (who could not
complete their rounds Saturday because of darkness) play and it has
to be be warmer when I play.''
</P>
<P>
   He needed to get under par after Saturday's round, said Woods,
to get back in it. ``Now I feel I'm in striking distance, based on
what the forecast is.''

ARRINGTON, BROWN A PENN STATE DOUBLE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It should be a simple matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the first pick of the 2000 National Football League
draft, the Cleveland Browns select . . . Courtney Brown, defensive
end, Penn State,'' is the way NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue will
announce it next weekend in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Tagliabue will step up to the microphone
again and say, ``The Washington Redskins select . . . LaVar
Arrington, linebacker, Penn State.''
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, Brown and Arrington, arguably the two best
defensive players in college football last season, will move to the
next phase of their career.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there could be some last-minute maneuvering. The Browns
might deal the top pick to a team desperate for an offensive tackle
that moves up to take Alabama's Chris Samuels, or to a team needing
a wide receiver to be the last piece in its championship puzzle and
wants Florida State's Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, then the Redskins, picking second and third,
could collect on a daily double and get both of the Penn State
players. The two wouldn't mind that, but it's probably better for
them to be separated so they can establish their own identities,
make their own footprints.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, anyone who has had to deal with Penn State's defense
the past couple of seasons knows about Arrington and Brown and how
much havoc they have created.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just unbelievable specimens,'' said Browns director of
football operations Dwight Clark, who will make the call on the
first pick. ``It's like somebody chiseled them out of granite.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as they are alike in the end product, they are almost
completely different in their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington is often over the line with his style of play and
personality. His teammates called him ``LA'' because he has some
Hollywood flash to him, whether it's leapfrogging blockers or
saying outrageous things.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in contrast, is a small-town kid from South Carolina who
will use the fewest words possible to express his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, at 6 feet 3 inches, 250 pounds, is a prototype NFL
linebacker, even though he'll tell you, ``I'm all mental. The
mental aspect of my game is the strongest part. I'm not the biggest
guy. If I am going up against somebody 300 pounds, I'm not going to
go over and nonchalantly knock him over. I have to envision what I
am going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, who passed up his senior season, says he has no
preference as to where he goes, which is pretty much standard stuff
from top prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they need me to do, I will do,'' said Arrington. ``It
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington said he toyed with the idea of coming back for his
senior season but rejected it when longtime Penn State defensive
coordinator Jerry Sandusky retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the whole defensive line graduating and when Jerry
retired, it made my decision easier,'' said Arrington. ``I didn't
feel like starting over. There was no need for me to come back and
prove anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington understands the hype that has surrounded him and will
continue to surround him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can live up to the hype,'' he said. ``But I'm not
changing the way I play because of the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he encourages it. He has been compared to New York
Giants Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor, but he said, ``I don't think
I should be compared to Lawrence Taylor because I respect him too
much. I have a long way to go before I can be compared to Lawrence
Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Arrington kicks it up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I will get No. 56,'' he said with a laugh when asked
what number he would like to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has heard similar comparisons with men at his position and
shrugs them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an honor to be characterized with such great
players,'' he said. ``But I haven't played one down in the league
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Arrington has looked every bit as intimidating as LT
in his prime. Take his performance in the Alamo Bowl this season.
Penn State, which had slid from a national championship contender
to a Big Ten also-ran with three consecutive losses, felt it had
something to prove. So did Arrington, in what he knew would be his
last college game. Fourteen tackles later _ three of which almost
certainly led to interceptions by Texas A&AMP;M quarterback Randy
McCown _ Arrington had proven his point.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington's playing style on the field matches his lifestyle off
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live life to the fullest,'' he said. ``My parents have
raised me to live life and not be afraid.'
</P>
<P>
   His father, Michael, served in Vietnam and nearly lost his legs
in a tank accident. Doctors told him he would never walk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He proved them all wrong,'' said Arrington with a fierce sense
of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's style is much more low-key, much less demonstrative.
Even his teammates wonder what's underneath the hood.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin, Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton, said,
``That's just him. He doesn't open up to guys that he really
doesn't know sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Brown about his future and he shows none of the confidence
that Arrington brandishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough coming to the NFL and understanding the
game at this level,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't back off when asked if he can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think about the game,'' said the 6-5, 270-pound Brown,
who last season had 29 tackles for losses and 13 1/2 sacks (giving
him a school-record 33 for his career) and was Big Ten Defensive
Player of the Year and a unanimous All-American. ``Whatever needs
to be done, I try to take care of on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The negative part of Arrington's scouting report is that he
sometimes free-lances too much and will incur some dumb penalties
(for instance, an unsportsmanlike conduct infraction for hitting
Pittsburgh punter Greg DeBolt in the face mask).
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts wonder whether Brown will be too small to play
defensive line against the 300-pounders who now seem to dominate
NFL offensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   All of it seems picky right now. Come Saturday, both players
will be in New York, ready to take the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it goes Brown, Arrington or Arrington, Brown, it really
doesn't matter that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to wait and see what happens,'' said Brown.
``We're going to have a job to do and we'll go out and do it.''

RODGERS RAN OFF TO BOSTON GLORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, it seemed that foreign runners had a
stranglehold on the Boston Marathon. From Japan, New Zealand,
Ireland, Belgium, Finland, Colombia, and Canada they came to
capture this crown jewel of the marathoning world. There was no
prize money involved in those days, just prestige. Then, in the
1975 race, a local runner named Bill Rodgers burst upon the scene,
winning Boston and helping to usher in the running boom. It was the
first of his four Boston triumphs, the last of which came in 1980.
On the 25th anniversary of Boston Billy's first BAA victory and the
20th anniversary of his last one, we take a look back.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rodgers had been there before, running in the lead pack of
the Boston Marathon, only to have his legs say ``no mas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, he'd dropped out at 21 miles; in 1974, he'd been in
fourth place before dropping back to 14th as his legs _ but not his
spirit _ gave way.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was in 1975, dueling with favorite Jerome Drayton.
They'd been joined by Mexican Mario Quezas as they followed early
pace-setter Bernie Allen from the noon start in Hopkinton into
Framingham. Course record-holder Ron Hill was just behind.
</P>
<P>
   As Allen faded, Drayton took the lead and Rodgers followed,
knowing he was scrapping the game plan he'd worked out with
legendary Greater Boston Track Club coach Bill Squires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went after Drayton,'' Rodgers recalled. ``I caught him, but
probably the two of us were unconsciously pushing too hard. There
were a lot of people yelling for him, and that made me run
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rodgers-Squires plan called for a cautious beginning, then
an accelerated pace through the middle stages of the 26-mile,
385-yard course that ended by the Prudential Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is suicidal,'' Rodgers would say later of the
downhill early miles. ``At 10 miles, I knew I was too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's Jerry Nason, who wrote the paper's lead story on the
Marathon for 50 years, saw it differently. They ran, he wrote, with
their ``strides in perfect harmony, an unusual orchestration in a
marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nason also recognized history in the making as the pack
approached Wellesley Square and the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Connecticut Yankee (Rodgers was born in Newington),
started priming his musket,'' he typed. ``When he pulled the
trigger, the race, the record, and Jerome Drayton were doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   At that checkpoint, Rodgers had 30 yards on Drayton and was 11
seconds ahead of Hill's course record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but I've got a compulsion to get up
to the front,'' said Rodgers later. Now, there he was, out front
with a motorcycle escort to bring him home _ if he could keep up
the pace.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the signs of Rodgers's pending breakthrough were
apparent, except that no one outside the world of high-level
marathoning had noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The previous fall, he had won the Philadelphia Marathon in an
unremarkable 2 hours 21 minutes, but, as he would show many times
in future races, he ran to win, not necessarily for fast times.
</P>
<P>
   So that victory went largely unnoticed, as did his third-place
finish in the World Cross-Country Championships in Rabat, Morocco,
where he held the lead with only a mile to go. Among the top
runners left in his wake that day was 1972 Olympic Marathon champ
Frank Shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Squires, ever cagey, had told the few who inquired about making
Rodgers the favorite to win Boston: ``Don't pick him. He's too
inexperienced. A year from now, he'll blossom into the marathoner
he should be, but not this soon against this field.''
</P>
<P>
   But Squires also knew Rodgers was special, saying, ``He has all
the tools, the competitive instinct, the light build and the
intelligence you need in a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   And this would be a perfect day for the front-running Rodgers.
It was sunny but cool (50 degrees) with a brisk 20-mile-per-hour
northwest wind to push him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the 1975 edition of the Boston Marathon unfolded,
a running boom was also erupting. It would sweep the nation first
and then the world. Rodgers, who was scraping out a living as a
Boston College graduate student in special education, little
suspected that he was about to become the Pied Piper of that
movement. He was more concerned about finding a decent job.
``You've got to be known to get a job today, and I'm not known,''
he lamented before the race.
</P>
<P>
   It was all he could handle to be running alone and a little
scared at the front of the pack with 13 miles still to go _ making
a very public journey into unknown territory. That he was the right
person in the right place doing the right thing at the right time
never occurred to him until later.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy singlet and shorts? Hardly. The man who would go on to
have his own clothing line was wearing a T-shirt with ``Boston''
and ``GBTC'' hand-lettered on it. His No. 14 signified his 1974
finish. He wore the white ``Mickey Mouse'' painter's gloves that
would become his trademark for 10 miles. Then, instead of
discarding them, he frugally carried them the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Any time the thought that he might actually win the race crept
into his mind, the thought that he might not even finish came right
along with it.
</P>
<P>
   By 17 miles, he was convinced he'd been going too fast; he was
38 seconds under Hill's record pace at the Woodland checkpoint. ``I
slowed down when I turned (at the Newton Firehouse) into the hills
because I was worried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Squires was right: Rodgers was an inexperienced marathoner.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to take water, he stopped. (``I can't run and
drink.'')
</P>
<P>
   When his shoe came untied on Heartbreak Hill, he became the
first runner of the day _ but certainly not the last _ to stop on
the Boston course's notorious climb. However, he bounced back up
and continued on his way.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston crowds were so big and loud that he couldn't tell how
close his nearest pursuer was. At Coolidge Corner he was 1:18 ahead
of the course record pace, and, unbeknownst to him, Drayton was
done, dropping out not far from where Rodgers had tied his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a vision of him sneaking up on me from the side,'' said
Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   If the crowd took away his ability to see his pursuers, it also
gave him hope. ``The noise and the crowd support helped a great
deal,'' he said. ``It kept me going when I felt like quitting, when
ordinarily I would have quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the final 2 miles did Rodgers really think about
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to think that I might win if my legs didn't cramp up
on me,'' he said. ``I know I'd get across the line if I could see
it. I would have crawled in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers neither crawled nor slowed. He came home in 2:09:55 to
finish 35 seconds better than Hill's course record and set an
American mark.
</P>
<P>
   Told his time, Rodgers shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't run that fast,'' he said. ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had.
</P>
<P>
   Amby Burfoot, Rodgers's former roommate at Wesleyan University,
had won Boston in 1968 in a time of 2:22:17. On this day in 1975,
Burfoot ran faster than that (2:21:20) and finished 32d.
</P>
<P>
   He called Rodgers's record run _ at the time the fifth-fastest
marathon in history _ ``one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
marathons ever. Anything faster was done on a pancake course. This
is a real course.''
</P>
<P>
   1980: Pure willpower
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, on April 21, 1980, the thermometer hit 67
degrees by 9 a.m. The temperature would be in the high 70s during
the race. Normally, his opponents would take joy that the weather
was too warm for Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodgers already had taken the heat. He'd been boiling for
months since President Jimmy Carter announced the US boycott of the
1980 Moscow Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   If times had been normal, Rodgers wouldn't have been running
Boston; he'd have been preparing for the US Trials in Buffalo May
24. But Carter had decreed the boycott in protest of the Soviet
Union's invasion of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no Olympics for the US athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers was crushed. Four years earlier, he had run second in
the US Trials, then, hampered by a foot injury and more warm
weather, finished 40th in the Montreal Games.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had been a conscientious objector during the Vietnam
War now became an outspoken critic of US policy.
</P>
<P>
   How much would an Olympic medal have meant to Rodgers?
</P>
<P>
   ``An Olympic medal is like a rock from the moon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He eschewed plans to wear a black armband to protest the boycott
and went out to try to win a third straight Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If a normally meek and mild Rodgers was capable of thrashing the
field, what would a well and truly angry Rodgers do?
</P>
<P>
   Battle the heat, is what he did. Survive, and use his knowledge
of the course and his downhill running talent to take the lead at
the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I won that race was that people I know were
giving me water,'' he said. ``That's the only thing that got me
through. The last 8 miles were pure willpower. It was the epitome
of the Marathon. I was getting cramps for the last 6 miles. If
anybody was moving at me at all, I might have stopped and started
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no one there to move at him. Rodgers, a consummate
downhill runner, had shed his final challenger back on the
Wellesley downhills.
</P>
<P>
   Having outrun his anger, Rodgers savored his place in history by
raising the four fingers on his right hand as he crossed the finish
line, signifying his fourth Boston win.
</P>
<P>
   It gave him nine marathon ``majors'' _ four Bostons, a Fukuoka
(Japan), and four New Yorks.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there was no invitation to visit the White House
as there had been following his 1979 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rodgers's win soon was overshadowed by the doings of
Rosie Ruiz, who stole the women's race and the headlines for the
next week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Rodgers's four Boston victories turned out to be only a brief
interlude during the foreign domination of Boston. Since 1980, only
two Americans have won the Boston Marathon: Alberto Salazar (1982)
and Greg Meyer (1983).

STEVENS CLEANING UP HIS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the things he has read, some of the looks his wife gets
from other parents when she drops their 3-year-old off at school,
they all serve to underscore to Kevin Stevens what he freely
admits, that he made a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one to blame here but me, but some of what's out
there is so out of whack,'' said Stevens, speaking Saturday for the
first time since his Jan. 23 arrest for possession of an illegal
substance (crack cocaine). ``If you believed it all, you'd get the
impression that all I've been doing is drinkin' and druggin' my
life away. That's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stuff you read, things the cops have said . . . at
times I've just wanted to put my head in my hands and cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the National Hockey League's most feared scorers and
most affable athletes, Stevens is a recovering binge drinker who
attends daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings near his home in Rye,
N.Y., and who also intends to play again in the NHL one day. He
will attend the Rangers' final home game of the season Sunday at
Madison Square Garden, after which he will meet with the media and
present his side of the incidents surrounding his arrest in a
Collinsville, Ill., hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested that morning along with three others, including a
prostitute, Pamela Velia, Stevens in a Feb. 14 Sports Illustrated
article was described as a ``crack monster'' _ a characterization
provided by a Collinsville police officer who said he was quoting
Velia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what that means, `crack monster,' '' said
Stevens, speaking via telephone from the Rangers' workout facility
at Rye Playland. ``The article also had one of the cops making me
sound like I used crack cocaine for eight years. What I said was,
the first time I used cocaine was eight years ago, but that was the
powder, not crack. I don't have a drug problem. I never have. What
I've had is a drinking problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who will turn 35 Saturday, also maintains that Velia,
whom he said he had never met until after the Rangers' game hours
earlier in St. Louis, set him up for the arrest, deliberately or
unwittingly. He thinks she may have offered him up to police as a
means of getting charges dropped against her from a prior arrest.
Stevens's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, theorizes that Velia might
have been attempting to set up Stevens to be robbed. Stevens began
partying that night with some $3,000 in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd been arrested four or five other times, and she's been
arrested since,'' said Stevens. ``I mean, these are bad, bad people
we're talking about here. You wouldn't let your dog hang out with
them. But, hey, it just shows you some of the bad decisions I
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Velia were arrested along with Darryl Crawford,
described by Stevens as Velia's boyfriend, and Alfred Triplett, the
cab driver hired by Stevens, for $100 an hour, after leaving a
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stevens, the four of them were in a Collinsville
Travelodge motel room for only a short time that morning when Velia
said she wanted to make a phone call. In order to activate the
phone, Stevens had to make a $20 deposit, which he did by twice
making trips to the front desk and handing $10 to the clerk. By the
time Stevens returned to the room after the second deposit, Velia,
Triplett, and Crawford were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Collinsville police were knocking at his door, asking to
search the room. Velia, Stevens theorizes, set up the arrest
possibly by calling the police moments after that second trip to
the front desk. His attorney believes Velia might have called the
front desk and the clerk, in turn, called the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Illustrated article reported that police, freely
granted permission to enter the room by Stevens, found the beds
still made. When an officer pulled back a pillow, a crack pipe
tumbled out. Bruntrager said police also found a small amount of
crack rolled up in a towel under the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly,'' said Stevens, ``when they began lifting the
mattresses and stuff, and found that, I said, `You know what, that
must be from the people who were in the room before.' They found
stuff that I didn't know was there. But the room was in my name, so
I get charged. When they found the other three, they all had drugs
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages left at the Collinsville police department by the Globe
Saturday were not returned. A pretrial hearing is set for Thursday
in a Madison County courtroom in Edwardsville, Ill., but it's
possible only Stevens's counsel will have to appear. Stevens
already has pleaded not guilty to the possession charge, a felony.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since his arrest, Stevens has gone about trying to
reassemble his life and career. After his release from the
Collinsville jail, he reported directly to a Los Angeles drug
rehabilitation center and spent five days there before transferring
to another rehab in Connecticut for the next seven weeks, commuting
from his home in Rye, Tuesday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling much better,'' said Stevens, who late last month
was placed back on the Rangers' payroll after being suspended in
January for violating the NHL/player union rehabilitation program.
``But anyone can stay sober in rehab. It's what happens to you,
what kind of support system you have, once you're out of rehab.
Luckily, I've got a great family and great friends who support me.
And the AA meetings help me a lot. That's been unbelievable. The
first time I went, I couldn't believe it, two guys I knew from
college were in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Stevens's wife, the former Suzanne Pannuto
from Marshfield, Mass., gave birth to the couple's third child,
Ryan. Luke is 3 and Kylie is 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I really care about right now is my family,'' said
Stevens, who met his wife just before they began their freshman
years at Boston College in 1984. ``People read all this, about a
prostitute and crack, and they're going to draw their own
conclusions. But my wife knows the truth. She's the sweetest girl
in the world, and now when she takes our kid to school, people look
at her like she's married to some lunatic. I put myself in a bad
position here, but it's all related to my problem with alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, said Stevens, he made a decision to stop
drinking, voluntarily checking himself into a Los Angeles rehab in
conjuction with the league/union substance abuse program. He said
his drinking never got to the point where he put it before anything
else in his life, either his family or his career (``I never drank
before a game,'' he said), but he felt it was time to eliminate
booze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt it was better for my life that I not drink,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to entering a nightclub after the Jan. 22 game in St.
Louis, Stevens said, he had been without a drink for 18 months,
except for one time, a lapse that he said he promptly reported to
the rehab program's administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those months, I stayed sober,'' said Stevens. ``But I did
it the hard way _ no meetings. And I never cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that night in January. Stevens hadn't played in four of
the five games leading up to the game in St. Louis. He wouldn't
have been in the lineup there if Adam Graves hadn't left the club
to be with his wife, in labor with twins. In his third year with
the Rangers, earning $3.2 million _ the end of a five-year deal he
signed in Boston _ Stevens had become a spare part in a struggling
offense. Neil Smith, then the club's general manager, was on the
verge of a deal that had Stevens going back to Pittsburgh, where he
played on two Cup winners at the start of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was playing well,'' said Stevens,
describing the mindset that ultimately led him from first drink to
hotel room to jail cell after going without a point in St. Louis.
``I was taken back by that. I was thinking ahead, getting to
Pittsburgh and not playing well there, not being comfortable with
that. But my big mistake was having that first beer. I drank and
drank and drank. That's the way it is with me. I could drink for
two years and not have a problem. But it's that next day that I go
out of control, and you just never know when that next day will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is Stevens's final payday with the Rangers, although he
will not suit up against the Flyers. He's been working out
regularly in recent weeks, but hasn't skated. If the Rangers had
made the playoffs, he said, his intention was to play.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 1, Stevens will be a free agent. He would prefer to
return to the Rangers and will discuss that possibility soon with
club CEO Dave Checketts. Stevens is realistic enough to think that
his days on Broadway are finished and he'll have to look for work
elsewhere. He expects he'll place his home in Rye up for sale in
the next few weeks and move the family back to their home in
Duxbury, hoping to get employment offers over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, teams are going to be scared, I know that,'' he
said. ``But I'm clear-headed now, and I know I can play well, and I
don't mean as a third- or fourth-line guy. I can be on a first or
second line. I don't have that desire (to drink), that restlessness
in me. I'll be able to go somewhere and truly be able to give it my
best shot. I know, wherever it is, it's not going to be a good
contract, but I don't really care about that. I'll take an
invitation somewhere, no contract, and go in and earn it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to earn my way back. I just don't want it to end here,
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Stevens also realizes his January escapade
could have led to a far different epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm lucky to be alive,'' he said. ``I'm lucky in that I
put myself in a bad position, and now I'm grateful that I'm able to
be sitting here, with a great family, still able to play in the
league. If the cops didn't come, who knows, maybe I would have been
killed. That could be the blessing in disguise in this whole
thing.''

INFLATED PRICE FOR DILUTED PRODUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NHL is vastly more marketable than it was 10-15 years ago.
Its image, while hardly pristine, is far more civil than it was in
the bench-clearing, donnybrook days when even the sport's most
ardent supporters had trouble explaining the difference between
hockey and pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, this isn't John Ziegler's NHL anymore. It still has
its, shall we say, imperfections, its festering carbuncles. But
under the hand of commissioner Gary Bettman, now seven-plus years
on the job, the league cleaned up its image and was able to call
itself a 20th-century sport, even on the verge of the 21st century.
The same couldn't be said when Bettman took the wheel in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference late last week, Bettman did what
commissioners do _ he extolled the virtues of his corporation, soon
to include 30 teams. He told the North American media that TV
ratings, attendance, and scoring all were on the upside in
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Concussions, he noted, are actually down considerably from one
and two years ago. That's hard to believe when it seems every
roster has someone on the sidelines wondering what day it is, but
the Commish quoted numbers to support the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Bettman added that there are no plans ``on the radar
screen'' to add more teams to the playoff pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear from people in the league occasionally harkening back
to the good old days when four of six teams, two-thirds of the
teams, made the playoffs,'' said Bettman. ``But I believe that
where we are now, going to 16 out of 28 _ 16 of 30 (next season) _
is a whole lot better than 16 out of 21 (at the start of the
(1980s). I think it has made the regular season meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to ticket-buying fans, Bettman quoted
evidence that the escalation of player salaries has begun to slow
down. If there is any hope for the NHL not shutting down in the
summer of 2004, when the collective bargaining agreement expires,
it will have to be found in the fine print of the players'
contracts, unless the league can find other revenues to keep ticket
prices from soaring out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said ``a bunch'' of the 28 teams will lose money this
year. For years, the Players' Association has regarded such
estimates as ownership scare tactics. Bettman and union boss Bob
Goodenow undoubtedly will chew over that interpretation ad
infinitum, but we do know this much: Ticket prices in most every
sport, and hockey in particular, are beyond the reach of a growing
portion of the public. If they don't at least level off, hockey is
on course for one whopper of a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   Not to sound like Alan Greenspan, but the growing bubble of the
economy has to burst one of these days. When it does, hockey could
be in for the biggest chill of all. I base that not on the
undergraduate Economics 101 course I took a quarter-century ago,
but simply on the number of rinks with $80, $90, and $100 loge
seats. Forget supply and demand and pie charts (we'll see enough of
those during the '04 lockout) and just look at the prices. A pair
of $80 loge seats for a full season would price out at $6,560. Now
add a playoff run, with higher prices. It begins to approach
$10,000. Long gone are the days when the local plumber or sub shop
owner maintained ownership of a pair of Bruins season tickets. And
if they have kept them, chances are the tab is split with three or
four other friends.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not price that most threatens today's NHL. Far
more serious a problem is the entertainment value. This may seem
subjective, especially in light of how grim the Bruins played for
about 80 percent of this season. But take it from someone who
spends far too many hours clicking through countless games on the
satellite dish: There is simply a lot of bad hockey out there.
</P>
<P>
   Every commissioner has his plate full, Bettman more than most,
because the NHL is a league of ``old economy'' clubs (Boston,
Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit, and the Rangers) that
historically printed money no matter what the product, and an
assorted bunch in a ``new economy'' that included the well-heeled
Flyers as well as some truly struggling franchises such as Calgary,
Tampa Bay, and the Islanders. It's very difficult to get those two
groups on the same page in terms of growing the product.
</P>
<P>
   When Columbus and Minnesota enter the league in the fall, the
NHL will have 14 teams that don't make the playoffs. That's fine.
But the truth is, about half of those clubs will barely be
competitive October to April. In its ambition to broaden the
footprint of the league, in hopes of structuring a product with
nationwide broadcast allure, the NHL thinned out the North American
and international talent pool. If not for the Russians, Swedes,
Finns, and Czechs, there might not be enough talent to stock 15
teams. Their presence makes it about a 21- or 22-team league.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's stated mandate for the first decade of the 21st
century is to keep salaries down (ticket prices, too) and grow the
TV and Internet audience. The unstated mandate has to be to stop
the expansion lunacy. It's over. The player mines have been
stripped. The product already has outreached supply by 25-30
percent. Not enough good players. Too many bad games. If New York
doesn't understand that equation, none of the other numbers matter
one iota.
</P>
<P>
   Protective mechanism
</P>
<P>
   Grant Fuhr followed up the intention he stated more than a year
ago and announced his retirement, effective this weekend. But word
out of Calgary is that he already has agreed to a new deal, worth a
paltry $200,000, for 2000-01. Confused? Don't be. Fuhr's signature
on that deal will allow the Flames to expose him in the June
expansion draft and not risk losing Fred Brathwaite and
Jean-Sebastien Giguere. Fuhr gets a nice going-away present and the
Flames buy some cheap insurance . . . If Flames general manager Al
Coates sticks to the plan he made clear last fall, coach Brian
Sutter will get the gate now that the Flames have missed the
playoffs for a fourth straight season. Too bad. Sutter did a fine
job with the disjointed, inexperienced pieces he was handed. Word
around Calgary last week was that Coates also could be turfed . . .
Brave words from Bryan Berard last week (``I'm going to give this
the hardest fight of my life to get back on the ice''), his first
comments since his devastating eye injury a month ago and
subsequent surgery. He said he feels improvement in the eye and
dreams about returning. But it was shocking to hear the pride of
Woonsocket, R.I., say he won't consider wearing eye protection.
According to the Players' Association, 90 percent of NHLers don't
want to wear visors. Anyone who saw the video of Berard's accident,
blood streaming from his eye, has to be frightened by that
denouncement . . . Olympic update: Yes, the NHLers will be there in
2002, said Bettman, provided the IIHF and the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee can dot all the i's and cross the t's . . . The Kings
lost ex-Bruin Bryan Smolinski for up to six weeks with a wrenched
knee last Monday. No surgery necessary, but there may be no season
to return to, especially if the Kings draw the Avalanche in Round
1.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins' ax swift
</P>
<P>
   History shows that the Bruins waste little time dumping coaches
when Harry Sinden decides it's necessary. Some don't make it
through the season (Fred Creighton, Gerry Cheevers, Butch Goring).
Others generally have been lopped within two weeks of the end of
the season (Rick Bowness, Steve Kasper, Sutter). All signs point to
Pat Burns getting the heave-ho, and given the black cloud that has
hovered over the Hub's hockey team since early December, the dirty
deed likely will occur sooner than later. Again, two weeks is a
realistic barometer, allowing for some of the initial dust to
settle and the playoffs to begin. And who picks up the pieces in
Burns's wake? The ideal candidate would be ex-Bruin Dave Poulin,
now at Notre Dame, but sources close to him say Poulin wouldn't be
eager to return to Boston, not with spending always an issue and
the current player stock so thin. When the time comes, look for
Poulin to be back in Philly as the Flyers coach. Northeastern coach
Bruce Crowder, another ex-Bruin, should get a feeler, but sources
around the league generally believe he needs more experience. No
doubt Baby B's coach Peter Laviolette will end up in the mix here,
possibly as head coach. Remember: Management and Burns came to
loggerheads over the force-feeding of AHLers into the Boston
roster. That's not going to change in a hurry. Then why not hand it
to Laviolette, who has more experience with those kids than anyone
in the organization? . . . Cross Detroit power forward Brendan
Shanahan off the free agent shopping list. The Winged Wheels signed
him up last week, a four-year deal worth about $24 million (a Ray
Bourque-like $6 million a year), and language is in place for a
fifth season . . . Notice Dominik Hasek's shutout over the Devils
Thursday night? If the Sabres make the playoffs, it will be as the
last seed in the East. But with Hasek back in form, and Doug
Gilmour revived since his swap from Chicago, the Sabres easily
could win a round or two. The Sabres also didn't allow the Leafs a
single shot in the second period of a 3-2 win . . . John McMullen,
whose Devils soon will be sold to YankeeNet (possibly finalized in
June), could end up owning the Avalanche. Another possible suitor
in Denver: former Celtics owner Alan Cohen . . . Can someone
explain how the Ducks, with superstar strikers Teemu Selanne and
Paul Kariya, can't make the playoffs _ for the second time in three
seasons?

ATTENDANCE PROBLEM OUT OF SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Celtics saw the new NBA last week. They went on the road to
play two playoff-bound teams in important games. In both cases, a
neutron bomb could have exploded in the arena without hurting a
soul.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets are trying to get an arena built downtown
amid pretty stark evidence that the people there don't care about
the team. There was an announced crowd of more than 16,000 against
the Celtics, but there were probably half that many people in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   This was a team on a winning streak, fighting for fourth place
and the alleged ``home-court'' advantage, and still the place was
dead. Already, the Hornets' visible co-owner, Ray Wooldridge (as
opposed to the one being kept out of sight in Jupiter, Fla.), is
trying to back off a proposal to have the public fund the $220
million arena.
</P>
<P>
   The following night, the Celtics played the Pistons in the
Palace of Auburn Hills, Mich., and the announced crowd was 14,581.
There may have been 10,000 people in the building.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons have Grant Hill, one of the league's few marquee
players. They, too, were on a roll of sorts under new coach George
Irvine. Once again, the building was lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know what's wrong with the league? People who bought
tickets don't bother going to the games. People who bought tickets
can't give them away, so the seats are unoccupied. You look at
games on the satellite dish and it is the same in every building,
though more noticeable in some (Cleveland, New Jersey, Miami).
</P>
<P>
   You might expect a dropoff in attendance in cities such as like
Boston, where there is no playoff chase. What's the excuse in
Charlotte? OK, the invisible owner has a bit of a public relations
problem, and the players get arrested now and then. But they've got
a good team.
</P>
<P>
   In their first 10 years, the Hornets sold out every game in a
24,000-seat building. This year, they've had three sellouts. They
once capped season tickets at 21,000. Now they've got 14,000. Their
average attendance last season was 19,232, sixth-highest in the
league. Two years ago, they were second to the Bulls at 23,405 a
game. This year, they're averaging 17,807 with what may be their
best team ever. But it's not uncommon for there to be fewer than
10,000 people at a game (the turnstile count can be unearthed
because Charlotte Coliseum is a public facility).
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, like the Hornets, have a huge building that looks
empty when all the seats are not occupied. The Pistons were eighth
in the league in attendance last year at 17,783 a game. This year,
they're at 16,492. Then again, the Pistons had attendance problems
before the Bad Boys, have had them since the Bad Boys, and have a
history of first-round playoff exits. They've tasted two titles,
and making the playoffs apparently doesn't have the same cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino saw all this and shook his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have shot a cannon off in those buildings,'' he
said. He then noted that the Celtics have the fifth-best paid
attendance. But all you have to do is watch a game in the
FleetCenter and you can see the empty seats there, too.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? The Pistons had a four-hour meeting last week on
that very subject. How do you get people to sit in the seats they
bought? When that becomes a marketing nightmare, then you really
have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones, the Hornets' free agent guard, already said he
might go elsewhere because of the sparse support in Charlotte. One
prominent landing spot: Orlando. Yet the Magic, who have as
exciting a team as any in the conference, can't fill their arena,
either.
</P>
<P>
   For a big game against San Antonio last week, the Magic drew
only 15,267, almost 2,000 shy of capacity. Two weeks ago, the Magic
drew only 13,505 for a Sunday afternoon game against Miami. Orlando
is averaging 13,281; it drew 16,444 last season. Yes, the Magic
started the year with a bleak forecast, but now they're probably
going to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Charlotte's problem. Or Detroit's. Or Orlando's. It's
the league's. The NBA would be in for sticker shock if turnstile
count were used for attendance. That ludicrous capacity streak at
the United Center would be history (it was equally ludicrous at the
Boston Garden).
</P>
<P>
   They can note that the average attendance this season is about
the same as it was last year, but that misses the point. The
tickets may be sold, but the seats are empty. It's a problem. And
it will remain a problem until the product is worth the price.
Right now, it isn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   Fading fast
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Feb. 29, the 45-11 Portland Trail Blazers met
the 45-11 Los Angeles Lakers at the Rose Garden. The Lakers won,
90-87, and, as they say, the rest is history. That loss didn't just
stun the Blazers. It vaporized them. They're no longer watching the
Lakers. They're watching their backs as the Utah Jazz sneak up on
them for the conference's second-best record. Portland is
cooperating. It dropped back-to-back games last week to Houston and
Vancouver. Meanwhile, Monday night's game in Utah is huge for both
the Blazers and Jazz. After Portland's disturbing loss to the
Grizzlies, Scottie Pippen said, ``It's obvious we're not playing
well enough to beat anybody. We have to find something to motivate
us. I don't know if there's enough time for us to get what we need
back, to where we feel enough confidence to win a championship.''
Said coach Mike Dunleavy, ``We're in the worst situation you can be
in _ one of complacency. We've got to play harder.'' A Utah victory
would square the season series with Portland at 2-2 . . . Two names
you might want to watch as the NBA draft approaches are Ernest
Brown and Corey Hightower. They were teammates at Indian Hills
Community College in Ottumwa, Iowa, a Juco powerhouse. Both are
likely to come out and both appear to have ``first-round talent.''
Brown is a 7-footer from New York City, Hightower is a
6-foot-7-inch slasher from Flint, Mich. Yup, another Flintstone.
So, too, is Charlotte reserve Eddie Robinson, who offered these
thoughts on Hightower: ``I grew up with Corey. He lived down the
street. He's got what it takes to make it at this level. It's all a
matter of how hard he's willing to work. He asks me about the
league and I told him that his (predraft) workouts are the most
important thing. You have to have a good showing to make teams want
to pick you.'' As for Brown, the NBA lusts after athletic big men.
He has signed to play at Iowa State (Hightower has done the same at
TCU) but there's a potential headache; Iowa State hired one of
Brown's former Juco coaches. There's also what scouts
diplomatically call a ``stability issue'' with Brown. He left his
high school team (St. Raymond's), had some menial jobs (and also
fathered a child) and then went to Arizona to play Juco before
moving on to Indian Hills. Hightower, who attended the same school
as Tracy McGrady (Mt. Christian Zion in Durham, N.C.) before
heading the Juco route, is said to be the more highly regarded
right now (although scouts feel he's not as gifted as Darius Miles,
a top high school player). ``He's a good offensive player, very
athletic,'' says one GM. The two won't play before the assembled
NBA talent spotters until the June camp in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Riled up
</P>
<P>
   Since scoring 19 points in the second half of a fiasco in
Orlando, and after Pat Riley tore into critics of his team, the
Miami Heat have put together a nice little run. The Heat went into
the weekend having won five straight, all at home, including
victories over Phoenix, San Antonio, and Charlotte. The Hornets,
after losing to Miami, are 3-15 against teams that are in first or
second place in their division, with seven straight losses . . .
The Grizzlies finally stepped to the plate for coach Lionel
Hollins, who had not gotten a pay raise since replacing Brian Hill
last December. Neither Hollins nor GM Stu Jackson is under contract
past this season and both are believed to be on a slippery slope
because of an impending ownership change. Hill, meanwhile, has
moved back to Orlando and told the Vancouver Province that he has
not seen a Grizzlies game since he was let go . . . The suggestion
that taxpayers in North Carolina entirely fund a new arena for the
Hornets went over as you might think. In a letter to the Charlotte
Observer, Gina Cardinal of Charlotte called the proposal
``outrageous'' adding, ``our schools are struggling to pay teachers
even a below-living wage, children are trying to learn while
sitting in stifling trailers and some tall, mentally adolescent men
are being overpaid to throw a ball through a hoop. What is wrong
with our priorities?'' . . . The Warriors need three more wins to
avoid their worst season since the league went to an 82-game
schedule. The 1997-98 Warriors were 19-63 in P.J. Carlesimo's first
season. The 1964-65 San Francisco Warriors went 17-63 after winning
the division the year before. The reason: a midseason deal that
sent Wilt Chamberlain back to Philadelphia. Alas, the Warriors have
no more games with the Clippers, but that wouldn't do it anyway;
they're 1-3 against the Clips . . . Don Nelson has something to
shoot for down the stretch, even if his Mavericks don't. Nellie,
who says he's moving to the front office next season, is, according
to the Dallas Morning News, tied with Dick Motta for most career
ejections: 59 . . . Pitino now says he sees the Celtics, Nets,
Nuggets, and Mavericks at the same level. ``Whoever gets the one or
two players that gets them over the hump will be a
Philadelphia-type team. That's what we're trying to do.'' That's
reassuring . . . You may recall that Jalen Rose thought his
contract made him a free agent after last season. The Pacers
thought otherwise and prevailed when the matter went to
arbitration. Given the kind of year Rose has had, who looks like
the winner now as Rose enters free agency? Rose, who went to
Michigan, couldn't bring himself to root for Michigan State in the
NCAA final against Florida. He did say that he wasn't awed by the
talent, predicting that only three or four players from the Final
Four were NBA-caliber. ``When I was coming out of college,'' he
said, ``everyone could play.'' One of those four is Florida's Mike
Miller, who could be a top 10 pick if he leaves school. Pitino said
that Miller is not ready for the NBA and should return to school.
He added that he was not saying that to help his buddy, Florida
coach Billy Donovan. He simply thinks Miller is too raw.

TRAINER SAHADI WINS WITH THE DEPUTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- The Deputy, bred in Ireland and raced as a 2-year-old
in Great Britain, eaned the opportunity Saturday to race in an
event that is as American as mom and apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Petardia put to rest the question of whether Jenine
Sahadi can train thoroughbreds, winning the $1 million Grade I
Santa Anita Derby by one length over the previously unbeaten War
Chant and stamping himself as one of the favorites for the Kentucky
Derby on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was vindication for Sahadi, who was needled by Bob
Baffert during Thursday's post-position draw and stormed away from
the media gathering before later returning to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The first female trainer to win the Santa Anita Derby, she will
now have the opportunity to become the first woman to train a
Kentucky Derby champion if The Deputy remains healthy between now
and Derby Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so proud of a horse before,'' Sahadi said of
The Deputy, third for much of the way before taking a short lead at
the top of the stretch. ``I know one thing -- he has a bigger heart
than any other 3-year-old out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi was asked if there had been any anxious moments during
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole race was anxious, are you kidding?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, ridden by Chris McCarron, and War Chant, with Jerry
Bailey aboard, were the 2-1 co-favorites among an on-track crowd of
41,222 and raced through the stretch together before the winner
began to gradually pull away in the last sixteenth of a mile.
</P>
<P>
   It was McCarron's third Santa Anita Derby victory in 19 tries
and he will be looking for his third Kentucky Derby triumph after
winning with Alysheba in 1987 and Go For Gin in '94.
</P>
<P>
   Of his duel with War Chant and Bailey, McCarron said, ``It was a
matter of who was faster from the quarter pole to the wire. If I
get that same trip a month from now, man I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron said before the race he felt War Chant might be the
best 3-year-old in the country, better than Neil Drysdale's more
highly regarded Fusaichi Pegasus because he'd overcome adversity in
his last race (the Grade II San Rafael Stakes) and gone on to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's the second best now,'' McCarron quipped. ``Maybe
we have a better one now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron has been aboard The Deputy, 4 for 9 lifetime with two
seconds and three thirds, in all four of his U.S. starts. He's come
away impressed, saying Sahadi has done a masterful job with the
colt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back to my first experience with the horse and fast
forward to today,'' he said. ``He's been an A student from day one.
He's been an absolute professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This colt pulls you to the race track, and I love that quality
in a horse. He just loves to be on the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning time of 1:49 for the 1 1/8 miles on the dirt was
well off the stakes record of 1:47, but the winning connections
couldn't have cared less.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Irwin, one of the colt's owners, said he believes Fusaichi
Pegasus is the best 3-year-old in the country but that his horse's
disposition will be an advantage in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he (Fusaichi Pegasus) will handle the festivites
at Churchill Downs,'' he said. ``Our horse won't have any problem
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, trained by Baffert, finished two lengths behind
War Chant in third. Anees was fourth, followed by pacesetter
Surfside and Cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside's connections, who have touted the filly for the
Kentucky Derby all year, may have to reconsider after she finished
8 1/2 lengths behind the winner following slow early fractions of
:23 1/5, :47 1/5 and 1:11 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, Baffert and Anees' trainer, Alex Hassinger, all
indicated after the race that their horses are Kentucky
Derby-bound. The past three winners of the Derby -- Charismatic
last year, Real Quiet in '98 and Silver Charm in '97 -- ran fourth,
second and second, respectively, in the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baffert: ``He could never really get into his own deal.
We'll go on (to the Derby).''
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger bemoaned the lack of a faster pace. Anees trailed most
of the way before unleashing a late charge that left him six
lengths behind The Deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a great run to be where he was, and I think when we
change cities (to Louisville) we'll see a different horse, just
like last year. I'm not concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Anees ran third in last year's Norfolk Stakes at Oak Tree before
rebounding to win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream Park in
Florida.

McENROE ANGRY AS U.S. FALLS BEHIND 2-1 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD -- The question to Jiri Novak: Is this a dream weekend
for you?
</P>
<P>
   Novak's response: ``This is not a dream. This is reality. We are
winning 2-1, and we are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the U.S. Davis Cup dream team -- the top two singles
and top two doubles players -- finds itself in the middle of a
waking nightmare: One point away from defeat and its captain
expressing urgency, blasting his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're acting like spoiled children,'' John McEnroe said after
Novak and David Rikl swept Alex O'Brien and Jared Palmer 7-5, 6-4,
6-4 Saturday to take the lead in this Davis Cup quarterfinal at the
Great Western Forum. ``You have to work harder, you know. ...
Enough of being like, `Hey, these guys are playing well.' That's
not good enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should win every match. Novak's a good player. He's not as
good as our players. They're a good doubles team. I don't believe
they're as good as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, McEnroe said, the Americans need to work harder. He
didn't think Pete Sampras worked enough, and Novak handed him his
worst Davis Cup defeat on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe didn't think O'Brien and Palmer did, either, and
Novak-Rikl swept them in 2 hours, 5 minutes after losing twice
previously to the Americans, including last week in Key Biscayne,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be extra effort,'' McEnroe said. ``If we're
guilty of anything, it's that we're not taking responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He gets no argument from O'Brien and Palmer, who said the Czechs
never let them get into their game.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Novak-Sampras match on Friday, the Americans
weren't able to capitalize on early break chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs broke in the first set to take a 6-5 lead, then
withstood two break points to close out the set.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. led 3-2 in the second set and had two break points,
only to have the Czechs fight back.
</P>
<P>
   By the time O'Brien and Palmer finally broke, tying the third
set at 3-3 on a Rikl double fault, it was too late. Novak and Rikl
broke again to go up 5-4, and Novak served the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played much better today than the other two times,''
Palmer said. ``Both served better, they returned better. They did
everything better. We had trouble getting anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason: the Czechs listened to the advice of teammate Martin
Damm , who lost to O'Brien-Palmer last month in Indian Wells while
teamed with Robbie Koenig of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``One set goes to Martin Damm,'' Czech captain Jan Kukal said.
``We did exactly what they didn't like. Against them, you have to
return 90 percent of balls on line. You can't cross. You have to
stay on baseline.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is Novak. Many great Czech tennis players have
become American citizens, the most notable being Ivan Lendl and
Martina Navratilova.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps McEnroe might consider approaching Novak about switching
allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Novak said he wanted to become his country's
top Davis Cup player (he considers Lendl the top now). After
accounting for the last five of his country's Davis Cup points --
three against Great Britain and two here -- it's hard to argue he
isn't on his way. A victory today at noon against Andre Agassi
would further cement his reputation. It also gives the Czech
Republic the quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are playing the team matches like a Davis Cup, there's
a special feeling because you are playing for the people that
support you and for the people in the city or the country,'' Novak
said. ``So we are playing for everybody, and that's such a nice
feeling for us.''

SAHADI: NO MAN'S DEPUTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA - Who's training The Deputy?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert's infamous question of Santa Anita Derby Week was
answered in no uncertain terms Saturday. And Jenine Sahadi didn't
have to say a word.
</P>
<P>
   Who's training The Deputy?
</P>
<P>
   It was answered by the crowd, by the winning owners and by the
winning jockey.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy is trained by the popular new star - dare we say
starlet? - of this Kentucky Derby season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get him (Baffert)! Show him who's boss!'' fans yelled from
behind the ropes as Sahadi walked behind The Deputy and Chris
McCarron from the saddling paddock to the track before the 63rd
Santa Anita Derby. Sahadi found herself acknowledging the unusually
raucous cheers with little waves of both hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt sort of like Julia Roberts, not that I look like her,''
Sahadi said of the red-carpet treatment. ``I felt like (begin
ital)somebody(end ital).''
</P>
<P>
   As Sahadi made her way from the winner's circle to the clubhouse
elevator after The Deputy and McCarron fought off War Chant and
Jerry Bailey to win by a length in the nation's deepest Kentucky
Derby prep, the crowd hanging over the horse tunnel shrieked its
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi, a 37-year-old USC graduate and former Hollywood Park
marketing- and publicity-department employee, had just became the
first woman trainer to win a Santa Anita Derby. She will go to
Louisville with a good chance to become the first woman trainer to
win the Kentucky Derby, set for May 6.
</P>
<P>
   For historians, as well as less-enlightened handicappers, the
issue of the next four weeks won't be whether The Deputy is up to
the challenge but whether Sahadi is up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Although she now has won three $1 million races, proving herself
at her sport's highest levels, Sahadi has been dogged by
insinuations she should share the credit with men.
</P>
<P>
   It started seven years ago when she got off to a fast start with
a barn made up largely of horses handed down from her boyfriend,
Julio Canani, the Santa Anita Handicap-winning trainer who was
temporarily out of business. It continued when she married fellow
trainer Ben Cecil.
</P>
<P>
   And it exploded in headlines when Baffert, at the Santa Anita
Derby post-position draw ceremony Thursday morning at Clockers'
Corner, took a verbal shot at Sahadi by asking McCarron, ``By the
way, who's training The Deputy, you or Jenine?''
</P>
<P>
   An unamused Sahadi responded, ``Thank God my horse has class,
because there's a lot of people who don't.'' Then she walked off
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, from the sounds of the on-site crowd of 41,222
Saturday, Sahadi won the brief debate in the public's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's colt, Captain Steve, finished an unthreatening third.
A wiseguy in the stands yelled at Baffert: ``Who trains Captain
Steve?''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, the Kentucky Derby winner in 1997 (Silver Charm) and
1998 (Real Quiet) and the perennial Churchill Downs scene-stealer,
might find he's no longer the public and media darling this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi sampled her new popularity Saturday morning when she met
with dozens of children from around the country who attended the
Santa Anita Derby with help from Kids to the Cup, a nonprofit
organization founded by California racehorse owner Trudy McCaffery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 12- and 13-year-old girls coming up to me and saying,
`I'd love to be just like you,' '' Sahadi said. ``That makes you
feel good, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   She has earned the adulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jenine Sahadi trained this colt to the minute and did it
absolutely perfectly,'' said McCarron, who has ridden The Deputy in
all four U.S. races and in workouts. ``It's been a while since I've
been on a horse of this class who's been perfectly happy every
single day he was on the track. He loves to be out on that
racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Valor head Barry Irwin praised Sahadi's communications
skills - ask Baffert if she knows how to get her point across - and
her creativity as a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Added Team Valor partner Jeff Siegel, who is also a popular
handicapper: ``I have no problem whatsoever in having her bring
this horse up to the race. Jenine is a Kentucky Derby (caliber)
trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now isn't ``Who's training The Deputy?'' It's ``Who
better?''

JUST ME AND MORLEY AND SHERIFF JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BY E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 
(PHOENIX) - A producer from 60 Min utes calls to say they're doing
a profile of Mari copa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and would I talk
to them about it. Sure, I say. Then I hang up and call the REAL
producer of 60 Minutes, Sheriff Joe himself.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Paesano!'' he says. ``Did you get the last pizza I sent you _
with the anchovies?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``reward'' he ships over occasionally for ``blasting''
him.
</P>
<P>
   I tell him I just got off the telephone with a woman who works
with Morley Safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Arpaio says know ingly. ``We referred 60 Minutes to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   You referred them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' the sheriff says. ``I want you to get some national
publicity again. I got you on 20/20, didn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   I remind him that the seg ment I taped for that show was cut
from the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll get on this time,`` Arpaio says sincerely, adding,
``You've been hitting me so much, if they want the opposite view
they'll use you. You twist the words amazingly. And you're a
critic. And you don't like me.''
</P>
<P>
   To Sheriff Arpaio, these are good things:
</P>
<P>
   Blasting him in print. Twist ing words. Not liking him.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't be good things to a politician living in the real
world, but they are to Arpaio, who lives a fantasy of his own
creation.
</P>
<P>
   A movie.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio is the writer, pro ducer, director and star of an ongoing
production called ``The Toughest Sheriff in America.'' His show's
been on the air longer than Seinfeld. America can't get enough of
him. And neither can Europe and Asia and the other places who've
sent film crews to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is accommodating. He built a custom-made movie set on jail
property and packed it with real-life inmate extras. The place is
called Tent City.
</P>
<P>
   He created the black and white striped costumes the bit players
wear, complete with pink underwear, and gave a few of them
recurring roles as members of carefully choreo graphed chain gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, apparently, he's taken on the responsibility of casting
director as well, putting the 60 Minutes folks in touch with a
local newspaper hack who'll trash Arpaio to Morley Safer and, in
doing so, make Ameri cans love the sheriff even more than they
already do.
</P>
<P>
   He can't miss.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wyatt Earp, Arpaio came to Arizona from some place far away
and reinvented himself. The Illinois born Earp spent the last years
of his life cultivating his own legend by working as an advisor to
Holly wood Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts bred Ar paio went one better. He's culti
vating his legend while still on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Politically Incor rect With Bill Maher will be in
Phoenix taping shows inside Tent City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a captive audience (in Tent City),'' Arpaio says. ``If
Maher treats me badly, he may stay there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   People love it when Joe talks this way. It's the best part of
his shtick, the illusion he uses to obscure the real-life problems
with the jail. The lawsuits. The deaths. The charges of inhu mane
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, are you doing a column on this or are you just ticking me
off?'' Arpaio asks.
</P>
<P>
   It would only tick him off if I didn't do a column, didn't per
form my role in the movie of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio is the Francis Ford Coppola of his profession. The John
Ford. The Steven Spiel berg. Maybe that's why, on the collar of his
uniform shirt, the sheriff wears four stars.
</P>
<P>
   I figure he got them from Roger Ebert. &QL;

SCHOOL TAX CREDITS WIDE OPEN TO ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KARINA BLAND  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - School tax credits intended to help needy children
instead are paying for private school tuition and fancy trips for
kids whose parents can afford the expense.
</P>
<P>
   In all, almost $28 million was diverted from the state's general
fund in 1999, some of it covering middle-class kids' tuition and
public school jaunts to California's Catalina Island, The Arizona
Republic has found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state doesn't regulate or even monitor the tax
credit program, leaving it open to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 law allows taxpayers to donate $200 to public schools and
$500 to private ones and take the same amount off their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said it would get needy students into private schools
and let more schools run extracurricular programs.
</P>
<P>
   But a review by The Republic found questionable practices the
framers of the legislation didn't anticipate or, if they did,
didn't publicly disclose:
</P>
<P>
   Many donations to private school scholarship funds are earmarked
for students already enrolled instead of new students, essentially
creating a state voucher system.
</P>
<P>
   Well-off public school parents pay for their kids' trips and
activities, then claim it as a tax credit, disappointing schools
hoping for a new source of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Revenue has questions about possible
abuse, but has no authority to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time taxpayers gave freely to the
program, which had been entangled in an unsuccessful court battle
challenging whether it violated the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Joint Legislative Budget Committee estimated the
program would cost the state's general fund $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, public schools and charters collected $13,992,979.
Private schools got $13,315,172.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your money,'' said James DiCello, assistant
superintendent for business services for the Paradise Valley
Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, his district received $770,000 in tax credit
donations, but only $183,000 of that actually came to the school.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was written off by parents for their kids' activities,
most notably an annual school trip to the Catalina Island Marine
Institute where they study oceanography and scuba dive.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $183,000 the district did get, DiCello said it cost half
that in overtime for the school secretaries who stayed late to
write endless receipts for parents, to compile reports and for
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   DiCello is dismayed: ``We're not any better off than we were
before that legislation.'' &QL; 
SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS SET UP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the credit for private school scholarships,
including Rep. Mark Anderson, R-Mesa, who sponsored the
legislation, touted it as a way to send kids to private school who
otherwise couldn't afford to go.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happens with most of the 32 scholarship funds
set up to pass out the money.
</P>
<P>
   Shanicka Brown, 9, and her sisters, 8-year-old Kiara Moore and
Ericka Rogers, 6, for example, now attend the Academy of Destiny in
Phoenix, on scholarships from the Arizona School Choice Trust.
</P>
<P>
   That fund, as well as the Catholic Tuition Organization of the
Diocese of Phoenix, for example, bases scholarships on income.
Neither lets donors earmark money for a child.
</P>
<P>
   But other funds do, and, in come cases, the money is going
almost exclusively to children already in private school,
regardless of financial need.
</P>
<P>
   The law only stipulates that 90 percent of what's collected go
to scholarships, not for who or why. Donors can name a child to
receive their money, though not their own. So, parents are writing
$500 checks for their friends' kids and asking them to do the same
for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 96 percent of the $361,530 received by the Arizona
Scholarship Fund was earmarked for kids in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Director ChamBria Henderson said these are children whose
families struggle to pay their fees. She urges parents to solicit
donations for their children, asking relatives and friends to give
in their child's name.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Franks, a former lawmaker and conservative activist who
came up with the idea for the tax credit, readily admits that is
what parents do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that be the worst thing that happened in the world?'' he
asks.
</P>
<P>
   He and other supporters admit the private school tax credit is
the next best thing to vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   For years, conservative lawmakers have tried to create a voucher
program to send kids to private schools with state money. Asking
for just $1 million or $2 million, the bills fail every time.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Franks asks, ``Why do we need vouchers at this point?''
Not with private schools raking in almost $14 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who rally enough people to write checks for their kids
can cover their entire tuition _ all with money that would have
been in state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend the private school tax credits violate the
Arizona Constitution, which prohibits the use of public money to
aid parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most courts have ruled against vouchers, the tax
credit skirts the question of constitutionality by rerouting the
money before it gets to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has turned into something so close to vouchers you almost
can't tell the difference,'' said Sen. John Huppenthal, R-Chandler,
chairman of the Education Committee and a longtime voucher
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Education Association filed suit, but the Arizona
Supreme Court refused the case in late 1998, upholding the law.
</P>
<P>
   `It is a sham,'' said Penny Kotterman, the teachers group
president. ``It clearly subsidizes private and religious schools.''
</P>
<P>
   With 5,000 openings statewide in private schools, there is more
money for scholarships than space for new students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has turned out that people who already had their children
in private schools got a tax break,'' Kotterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Private school officials said the tax credit likely will create
such a demand that more private schools will open. Another Catholic
school, for example, is opening in Chandler in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Kotterman said the money would do more good, including
reducing class size and hiring more teachers, in the state's
general fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the program is working as it was intended and
getting additional resources to education,'' said Francie Noyes,
spokeswoman for Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Noyes admits it is mostly middle-income families whose
kids already are in private schools who are taking advantage of the
program, not the poor kids supporters claimed it would help. &QL; 
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Roosevelt Elementary School District in Phoenix, one of
the poorest in the state, money from tax credit donations has meant
after-school dance classes and keeping computer labs open late into
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The $102,000 donated to the district last year paid for a
student-run bakery and cafe at Lassen School and assorted field
trips, things the kids wouldn't otherwise have been able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly does make a difference in the inner-city districts,''
said Mary Miller Crews, a Roosevelt teacher who coordinates the tax
credit program. ``We do honestly appreciate it. We are very, very
grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her donations came from outside the district because few
of the people living there can afford to give away $200.
</P>
<P>
   She said she gets calls from taxpayers in richer districts,
saying they are sending her checks because their own schools don't
really need it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Deer Valley School District, students are raising money
to attend a mock trial debate contest through the tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   And Sun City residents came through for nearby Dysart schools,
which collected almost a half-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This is how school officials thought it would work.
</P>
<P>
   The public school tax credit always was intended for
extracurricular activities. School officials thought they would
spend the money on microscopes for the science club, sports
uniforms and music lessons for kids who can't afford them.
</P>
<P>
   That is happening in some districts, but in others, like
Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, schools record lots of donations
but actually get few checks. Instead, parents spend $200 on their
child's activities, then ask for a receipt to write it off.
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, Desert Canyon Middle School collected $150,242,
98 percent of which went back into parents' pockets, Principal Glen
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   DiCello tells of parents using the tax credit to send band
students to Vancouver and New York, other kids to cheerleading and
wrestling camps. The annual California Catalina Island trip costs
parents $300 _ really, $100 after the tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of this money is going for tax relief,'' DiCello
said. ``It's not going to the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   And schools have to pay to administer the program.
</P>
<P>
   Huppenthal said he knows the tax credit is causing problems for
public schools, which, unlike the scholarship funds, don't get to
keep any of the money for administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``our parents like the situation as it stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, too, said he doesn't mind parents using the tax credit
to pay for their kids' activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people support extracurricular activities that
are good for kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan
used her tax credit to help pay for her son's trip to Catalina
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit, Anderson said, means students who couldn't
afford to participate in school-related activities now can.
</P>
<P>
   That notion draws laughter from Roosevelt's Crews, who said few
of the parents in her district could afford to spend $200 on such
activities, tax credit or not. &QL;  CAN'T TRACE ALL
FUNDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Department of Revenue, chief economist Georganna Meyer
rubs her temples, perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Most public schools and scholarship funds have reported how much
they collected, though they are not required to by law. She has few
concerns about them.
</P>
<P>
   But on her desk is a stack of forms from people who said they
made $500 donations to scholarship tuition funds she can't trace.
</P>
<P>
   Something queer is going on, and there's nothing she can do
about it. The tax credit legislation provided no oversight and no
muscle to investigate any suspected fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is charged with compiling a report on the tax credits for
state lawmakers, a job made more difficult because the law doesn't
require schools or funds to report anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one audits them, and we're certainly not going to,'' Meyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The funds must file with the Internal Revenue Service. Still,
there are no rules about scholarship criteria or how long funds
have to give them out.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer puzzles over the scholarship fund of the Chabad Lubavitch
Orthodox Jewish Synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that such funds provide money to at least two
separate schools. But this fund claims that its Phoenix Preparatory
High School, where boys and girls are taught separately in the
Orthodox Jewish tradition, is two schools even though they are
housed in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said that what they are doing is legal.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, far more people claim they wrote checks to
public schools than the schools actually report. Meyer won't have
exact numbers until after tax season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real concerned,'' she says. She pauses and then adds,
``At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers don't alarm me, but I see lots of possibilities
for abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   There are problems inherent with any new program, contends
Anderson, the law's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will consider legislation next session to mandate
that schools and scholarship funds report to the state and possibly
do away with designating donations for a specific child.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson believes in the tax-credit program: ``You don't want
people misusing it.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA has dismissed a midlevel officer whose
targeting error was blamed for the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade during NATO's air war against Yugoslavia last
year, an agency official and a lawyer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Six other agency employees, including a senior official and four
supervisors, also received administrative punishments from the
director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, for their roles
in approving a target that turned out to be the embassy and not a
Yugoslav military supply headquarters, the agency official said.
</P>
<P>
   In punishing the employees, the agency acknowledged that blame
for the bombing fell on a range of people and spanned several
levels of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the attack on the night of May 7, officials at
the White House, the Pentagon and the CIA insisted that the bombing
was an accident _ the result of a simple, tragic human error.
</P>
<P>
   The attack badly derailed relations between the United States
and China, provoking stone-throwing mobs to swarm the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing and producing diplomatic strains that linger even today.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only on Thursday, 11 months after the bombing, that
the agency began to punish those held responsible, dismissing the
officer blamed for the targeting.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy was arguably the most dramatic single
event of NATO's 78-day air war. The attack, which killed three
Chinese and wounded 20 others sleeping in the basement for
protection, exposed deep doubts in the alliance over the wisdom of
its strategy and the susceptibility of even the most advanced U.S.
military weaponry to human error.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Chinese general visiting Washington in late January
demanded to know when those responsible would be punished. On
Saturday, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering met at the State
Department with China's ambassador, Li Zhao Xing, to inform him of
the dismissal and other punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials had informed members of the congressional
intelligence committees on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese side has been informed of this decision, but at
this point we don't have any information on what kind of response
the Chinese are going to make, and any kind of response would have
to be made in Beijing,'' a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the CIA, Bill Harlow, issued an unusual public
statement Saturday _ and at the unusual time of a quiet Saturday _
announcing that Tenet had taken ``a number of actions'' as a result
of an internal review of the events that led to the bombing. The
statement did not mention what actions Tenet had taken, though an
agency official and the lawyer for one of the employees later
described them generally.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow declined to identify those punished, citing privacy and
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Although only one officer was dismissed, the statement
attributed wide blame for what it said were a series of procedural
errors in approving a target that turned out to be fundamentally
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numerous CIA officers at all levels of responsibility failed
to ensure that the intended bombing target _ the Yugoslav Federal
Directorate of Supply and Procurement headquarters _ had been
properly identified and precisely located before CIA passed a
target nomination package to the U.S. military for action,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy W. Krieger, a lawyer representing one of the supervisors who
received a letter of reprimand, said it was ``manifestly unjust''
to assign blame to individuals when ``the failure was systemic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shameful that the CIA caved in to political pressure to
provide scapegoats,'' Krieger said Saturday night. ``The agency has
already publicly admitted that the map provided to the officers
contained errors absent which the Chinese Embassy would not have
been mistakenly targeted. These officers were asked to improvise
and did their best with the tools provided to them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to administration, defense and intelligence officials,
the bombing was caused by a fundamentally flawed process for trying
to locate the directorate's headquarters in the New Belgrade
section of the Yugoslav capital. Armed with only an address, 2
Bulevar Umetnosti, the officer who was dismissed used an
unclassified military map to try to pinpoint the building's
location, based on a limited knowledge of addresses on a parallel
street.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who wrongly assumed that Belgrade's street
addresses were numbered uniformly, ended up targeting the Chinese
Embassy, which is on a frontage road nearly 1,000 feet from the
supply directorate that was the intended target, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the map, which the National Imagery and Mapping Agency
produced in 1997, the building that turned out to be the embassy
was not identified. Instead, the map showed the embassy in its
former location in central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   After a location was identified, the target was discussed during
at least three meetings among CIA officials, none of whom,
evidently, questioned the identification process, the officials
said. The target was then turned over to Pentagon officials who,
also without questioning it, put it on a list of targets to bomb in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first and last target the CIA selected during the
war, Tenet testified last year. Saturday's statement said the
agency ``lacked formal procedures for preparing and forwarding
target nomination packages'' to the U.S. military. It said several
steps had been taken to address ``organizational problems that
contributed to the accidental bombing,'' but then declined to
discuss them, saying they were secret.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the agency waited 11 months to punish those
it held responsible for the bombing. The agency's inspector general
completed an investigation of the targeting process last July.
Harlow would only say that Tenet acted after a lengthy review was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Because none of those punished were identified, it was not
possible to reach the dismissed officer or any of the others for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The six who retained their jobs _ some of whom have covert
identities _ received administrative punishments that varied from
an oral admonition to a letter of reprimand that includes a
one-year prohibition on promotions, raises or other special
recognitions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency official said that Tenet singled out one individual
for praise: another midlevel officer who raised concerns about the
targeting in the week before the strike. That officer called others
at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency and the NATO task force
in Naples, Italy, responsible for orchestrating the bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   However, his concerns were never brought to the attention of
senior officials who might have been able to call off the strike.

WOODS STORMS BACK INTO CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ They are in pursuit of a green jacket, but for
the wind-blown competitors in the 64th Masters, a winter parka
would be the choice of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   As the focus of this major championship took a chilling turn in
Saturday's third round, from treacherous greens to frostbite, there
was a confession from Vijay Singh that you perhaps may never hear
from someone playing so well in a major championship: ``We were all
just looking to get off the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in his right mind when he said it, too. The rest of his
body was frozen, however.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the third round was unlike anything this fabled event
has seen in a long time. When it began, the weather was relatively
calm, Tiger Woods was laboring nine shots out of the lead, and most
of the leaders were home in bed. When it mercifully came to an end
at 7:45 under moonlight, Augusta National GC may as well have been
in Iceland, Woods was very much a factor, standing 1-under after
shooting 68, and most of the leaders were wondering why they hadn't
pursued a warmer sport. Like ice fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the wind was coming,'' said Singh, ``and we could have
handled that. But I wasn't expecting the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't face this sort of weather _ temperatures in the 40s,
steady winds of 25 m.p.h. _ in his native Fiji, which makes what he
did even more remarkable. Singh, starting the day at 5-under, one
shot behind David Duval, tightened the straps to his ski boots . .
. er, golf shoes . . . and somehow made four birdies against two
bogeys to vault into a three-shot lead before the round was called
because of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumes at 8:15 this morning, eight players will
return to their positions to complete the third round. Singh
(7-under) and Duval (4-under) are standing over third shots to the
par 5 15th; Ernie Els (3-under) and Phil Mickelson (2-under) are on
16; Tom Lehman (1-over) and Steve Jones (1-over) will finish the
17th, as will Bernhard Langer (1-over) and Jeff Sluman (1-over).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Loren Roberts (71--213) has the clubhouse lead at
3-under and a couple of major threats _ Woods and Davis Love III _
got back into the hunt by sitting on their favorite couch in front
of their televisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I hope these guys play terrible today,''
said Love after he, like Woods, went out early and shot a 4-under
68. ``I hope they get what I got (in Round 1 when he teed off late
in high winds). How's that for a political answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Cold-hearted, perhaps. But, then again, all other body parts
will have to thaw out, too. The forecast called for an overnight
frost, low temperatures this morning, and gusting winds. Only this
time, they'll all be in the same iceboat.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case in Round 3. Woods and Love got a good
portion of their rounds in before the horn sounded at 12:25 p.m. to
signal lightning in the area. The lightning never materialized, but
rain fell, and by the time play resumed two hours later, the
temperatures had dropped 20 degrees and the winds were whistling
through the pines.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who had shot 33 on the front, negotiated his remaining
eight holes with two birdies and a bogey to join Love at 1-under
and bid farewell for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Singh never showed such pleasure, though certainly he had to be
pleased. Paired with Duval in the final group, he teed off at 4
p.m. and was forced to walk in the path of golfers whose wheels had
been blown off. ``You could see the scoreboard, and everybody's
dropping off,'' said Singh. ``I just thought about concentrating on
what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, playing with Els just in front of Duval and Singh,
made five bogeys going out and dropped to 1-under. Els only made
one bogey on the front, but wasn't making anything happen. The
third-to-last pairing of Lehman (out in 38) and Jones (a
triple-bogey on the par 4 seventh after he skulled his shot from
the front bunker to the back bunker) was struggling, too.
</P>
<P>
   None of which flustered Singh. He tied Duval at 6-under with a
birdie at the par 5 second, assumed the lead when Duval
three-putted the par 4 third, but fell back into a tie with a bogey
at the fourth. When he birdied par 5 eighth, Singh was at 6-under
and in front by one.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, meanwhile, had gotten to 5-under with his fourth birdie
on the front, and though he gave two shots back when he went into
the wind on the backside, the man they call ``The Boss of the
Moss'' was content.
</P>
<P>
   Duval was looking at a red round until he got untracked by a
gust of wind at the par 3 12th. Delightful hole to watch,
infuriating one to play, it sits at the heart of Amen Corner where
the wind blows in every which direction. Only sometimes it waits
until after you have hit, which happened to Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the club as a lot of players did,'' said Duval of his
8-iron. ``It was just not favorable for me. It was bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   It was wet, the double-bogey knocking him to 3-under. Singh, who
had bogeyed the 11th with his worst swing of the day, hit next,
just as the wind settled down. His 8-iron came to rest 6 1/2 feet
behind the pin and he made the putt to complete a three-shot swing
on Duval and get to 6-under.
</P>
<P>
   Duval got within two shots with a birdie at the par 5 13th, but
Singh birdied 14 with a tap-in after a laser pitching wedge, such a
delightful turn of events he did the sensible thing _ he looked to
a tournament official to beg for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't come until he and Duval had driven off the 15th and
hit their lay-up shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of holes to be played,'' said Singh, who is
considered the hardest working player on the PGA Tour. But for the
first time ever, he was going not to the practice range, but to the
nearest fireplace for relief.

DEVELOPERS, WARY OF LIMITS ON GROWTH, PUSH PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - The scene is as rural as it gets: farmland stretching
for miles in the southeastern corner of the Phoenix area,
all-but-empty roads, the occasional crow of a rooster.
</P>
<P>
   But the sign along Arizona Farms Road tells another story: ``For
sale, 41 acres, 353 home sites permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   All along Phoenix's fringes, it's happening over and over:
Developers are racing to rezone fields and isolated desert for tens
of thousands of houses.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the rush, many say, is the Nov. 7 election, when
voters could pass the Citizens Growth Management Initiative and
slap restrictions on growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deadline-beater,'' said John Kross, development
director for Queen Creek. ``These guys want to get their
development rights in under the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   So many subdivisions are in the pipeline that some say growth
limits, if passed, wouldn't be felt for years. Others worry that
planning is getting short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the view that all these houses will barely be
enough to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are adding up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, population 26,000, has 39,000 homes in the pipeline
and 6,000 to 7,000 more on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County has approved three master-planned communities in
the past year, the first since 1995. They have nearly 14,000 homes
in all, and the county is reviewing two other applications.
</P>
<P>
   Five developers in Buckeye are trying to get master plans
through by November, including more than 100,000 homes on the
western side of the White Tank Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Growth Management Initiative isn't on the ballot
yet, but the Sierra Club, which is leading the campaign, says it
has enough signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative would require every Arizona community of more
than 2,500 people to adopt a growth-management plan that includes
an urban growth boundary. The boundary, drawn just large enough for
10 years of population growth, would limit where services could be
extended or densities increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of confusion'' over what steps are
needed now to make sure a project can be built later, said Elliott
Pollack, an economist and real estate investor. Is zoning enough,
or a development agreement? Or must the bulldozers be rolling?
</P>
<P>
   Housing analyst R.L. Brown is urging clients to get a five-year
stockpile of land with zoning and other approvals, known as
entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is out zoning and entitling anything they can think
of,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the headlong rush for zoning moving faster than the
Queen Creek area, where Kross is tracking 16 projects next door in
Pinal County, a total of 76,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The developments dwarf Queen Creek, with its 1,200 homes and
3,600 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The town itself has approved more than 10,000 homes within the
town limits while struggling to keep its agricultural roots and
rural lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Like many residents, Barry Jones, a former Mesa police
administrator, went there for the chance to live on a large lot and
keep horses. He's stunned at the development on the drawing boards.
Suburban neighborhoods with four homes per acre don't fit the
spread-out country living of Queen Creek, where densities are one
house per acre or less, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved to get away from it all,'' he said. ``We didn't think
it would grow this fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Martinez lives in town and prizes the tranquillity. She
said she'd like enough development to bring a supermarket and
pharmacy, sparing her a 15-mile drive, ``but not this explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of homes approved may be deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not all going to be here tomorrow,'' said Dennis Cady,
Pinal County planning director.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the larger projects will take five to 15 years to sell
out, he predicts, and will scale back in size. The pace of building
could slow, too, if the economy falters or interest rates rise
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Cady would much rather see coordinated development
in master-planned communities, rather than haphazard lot-splitting
with no requirements for water, sewers or access.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Creek Mayor Mark Schnepf worries that with so much haste,
``it sometimes means the project isn't as well-planned as it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Ranch, nine miles southeast of Queen Creek, touched off
an avalanche of housing proposals. The mixed-use, golf-course
development is approved for 6,600 homes and construction is
steaming ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by farms and desert hills, Johnson Ranch demonstrates
how many home buyers are willing to put up with a remote location
to get a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat the housing prices out here,'' said Misty
Hidalgo, formerly of Mesa. She figures her $107,000, four-bedroom
house would go for $33,000 more in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, however, is her husband's 45-minute commute to
Chandler. Some of her neighbors make three-hour round-trips to jobs
in northwest Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo feels safer with her three sons, 3, 7 and 9, no longer
in a tough city neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better getting our kids out in the country,'' she said,
``not that it's going to stay country long.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the surrounding land is already planned as homes
for thousands of other urban refugees. So many projects are
chugging through that some planners predict it will be years before
any growth boundaries would start to pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many years of authorized development in place now,''
said Bill Mee, infrastructure financing coordinator for Phoenix.
``It would take a long time before people would start noticing.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the new applications, some enormous projects got the
green light years ago. Estrella Mountain Ranch, with 18,600 acres
at the southern end of Goodyear, is approved for 60,000 homes,
although that number won't be reached for years.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bahr, a spokeswoman for the Citizens Growth Management
Initiative, realizes that developers are trying to get ahead of the
game but argues that the initiative is no less valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't buy into the argument that it's too late,'' she said.
``It can always get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   If the initiative passes, communities would take awhile to draw
growth boundaries, but interim restrictions would kick in right
away. New subdivisions or any increases in zoning intensity would
require a four-fifths approval of the local governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buckeye is one of those places where huge inventories
of home sites are being gathered. Driving into this town of 6,000,
you can still catch a whiff of manure, and you won't spot any large
housing developments. Yet seven master-planned communities are in
the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Projects are being revived that were floated in the go-go land
speculation of the 1980s. Town Manager Joe Blanton said Buckeye's
trump card is that development can tap the ample water supply that
now irrigates cotton and other crops.
</P>
<P>
   Maeve Johnson, executive director of Valley Partnership, a real
estate lobbying group, sees ``fear of the unknown'' at work.
Besides uncertainty over the initiative, there are questions about
how Growing Smarter Plus, a package of proposals passed by the
Legislature, will play out.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson says developers tell her that they're just
positioning themselves for the future.
</P>
<P>
   And some argue that the number of homes in the hopper isn't
large, considering the heated pace of growth in the 1990s. The
Phoenix area has been adding almost 25,000 houses and apartments a
year, said Stanley Paul Cook of Landiscor Aerial. A 10-year
inventory would be a quarter of a million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Brown says developers may be hustling for approval now,
but the Citizens Growth Management Initiative would likely throw on
the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting that prices would rise dramatically, he said, ``I
think major land sellers will be very slow to release their land
for development.'' &QL;

TWO MEN WHO RESCUED ELIAN PLAN TO TALK WITH BOY'S FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ The two fishermen who plucked Elian Gonzalez
from the sea flew to Washington on Saturday and, after an initial
attempt failed, appeared headed for a meeting with the boy's father
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The two fishermen, Sam Ciancio and Donato Dalrymple, both of
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., accompanied by two of the boy's Miami
relatives, had appeared midafternoon at the suburban home where the
boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is staying. Gonzalez had left
the home, which belongs to the senior Cuban diplomat, about 20
minutes before the group arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer serving as an emissary told the group Gonzalez
would not see them. So the fishermen and Elian's uncle Delfin
Gonzalez and cousin Alfredo Martell walked briskly before the 20
cameras set up on Millwood Road and voiced their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would return several times until Gonzalez agreed
to see them. The fishermen and representatives for Gonzalez met
Saturday night to work out a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple said the fishermen wanted both to give Gonzalez, who
arrived on Thursday from Cuba, an opportunity to thank them in
person and to encourage him to meet with his Miami relatives and
work out a peaceful solution to the custody fight over the
6-year-old boy, who was found floating in an inner tube on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 others drowned while fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've come to do is to reunite the Gonzalez family
together,'' said Dalrymple, who told interviewers in Florida he
would prefer that the boy stayed in the United States but said
outside the Bethesda home he would not attempt to sway the father.
</P>
<P>
   Ciancio said: ``This man owes us at least to meet with us. I
mean that's the bottom line. He owes us that respect.''

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. - The golf ball came from seemingly nowhere, sort
of like the epitaph that had been delivered the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods was standing over his ball at the 12th hole of
Augusta National Golf Course Saturday, preparing to hit a perilous
chip onto the par-3 green, when a golf ball fell out of the sky. It
landed on the putting surface but near enough to Woods that he
could read its dimple pattern and identify its maker.
</P>
<P>
   Woods got a good chuckle at what apparently was a duffer's
vagrant shot from the ninth hole of the Augusta Country Club course
that abuts Augusta National. On this day the fifth-year pro had the
luxury of laughing as he would launch no such aberrant shots in the
third round of the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   After the comic interlude, Wood would chip to within eight feet,
sink the putt and be on his merry way to a score of 68, a great
result on a day that was more like summer at St. Andrews than
spring at this plot of land golfers like to call heaven (but were
calling something entirely different by nightfall).
</P>
<P>
   Woods's third-round surge, achieved in cold and windy conditions
that turned ridiculous after a two-hour midday storm delay,
catapulted him from 39th place to tied for second in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Four golfers ahead of Woods on the scoreboard - V.J. Singh,
David Duval, Ernie Els, and Phil Mickelson - were stranded on the
course when darkness fell. Among them, only Singh, was under par
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods's 4-under-par effort, the other 56 golfers vying for
the Masters green jacket can curse whoever it was that Woods heard
writing him off on television Friday night after he survived the
cut by one stroke with opening rounds of 75 and 72.
</P>
<P>
   When will people learn to let a slumping Tiger lie?
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a little T.V. (Friday night) and a lot of the people
were saying I was completely out of it,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   He paused to let a smile cross his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he's right in the thick of it. My oh my, if Woods didn't
have a nickname we'd have to call him Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year he has come back from seven strokes down with
seven holes to play to win. So why shouldn't Woods get woozy
visualizing the possibilities of teeing off today, six strokes
behind Singh, who has three-and-a-half holes of his third round to
negotiate before before tackling the final 18?
</P>
<P>
   When people say of Woods what was once said of Jack Nicklaus -
that he plays a game with which they're not familiar - it can mean
only one thing: They don't play chess.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old is always thinking a couple moves ahead.
Consider what he said when somebody asked him if he thought he'd
have an advantage over golfers forced by Mother Nature to complete
their third rounds today.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he believed he would, explaining, ``From what the
Weather Channel is saying, there's going to be some frost and
freeze warnings. Temperatures are supposed to go down to the 40s
and 30s tomorrow so it will be pretty cold for the players who have
to finish their third rounds in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a few hours later the local news predicted cold
temperatures for this morning, with a chance of frost.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is meticulous in his preparation for every tournament but
especially the Grand Slams. The results can be so seamless it's
hard to fully appreciate his handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 he made a mockery of this tournament's storied history,
shooting four rounds of 70 or better here to run away with his
first major. That sublime week became Woods's cross to bear as
people expected him to hammer Augusta National every time out.
</P>
<P>
   But the golf course is no shrinking azalea. It dug in and got
the best of Woods for 10 consecutive rounds, his 68 representing
his first sub-70 round here since his final round of 69 three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That his round Saturday looked relatively easy was a testament
to Woods's abilities. On the 205-yard, par-3 fourth hole, his tee
shot sailed left of the green, into the gallery. He got up and down
to save par with feathery shot that stopped two feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Ho hum, another par for Woods. That's surely what the scoreboard
watchers on the course were thinking. In fact, that flop shot he
fashioned was phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an easy shot,'' Woods said, ``but I pulled it off.''
</P>
<P>
   He called it the key to what he considered a crucial round.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up (Saturday),'' Woods said, ``I knew what I had
to do, which was go out and get myself back in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   That he did. Then Woods sat back and watched from the warmth of
his rented house as the weather turned really rough and the leaders
came back to him as though they were in the clutches of some
mysterious magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   Which they are, of course. It's called destiny and right now we
have to believe it pulls for Woods.

   (For release Sunday, April 16)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ADULTERY: And Other Diversions  &LR; By Tim Parks. Arcade, $12.95.
The author displays both storytelling skill and acerbic
self-knowledge as he explores the relationship between moral
constructs and real life in meditations on marriage, European
politics and other topics. The result is ``an elegant demonstration
of the freedom and power of the essay form,'' Robert Grudin wrote
in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STORIES OF J.F. POWERS  &LR; New York Review, $14.95. James Farl
Powers (1917-99) was a Midwesterner whose small output _ three
collections of stories and two novels _ has attracted something of
a cult following. This anthology of his short fiction is populated
by housekeepers, parishioners and, especially, Catholic priests
living out their small-scale dramas in the United States'
heartland. ``His talent was happiest in the concentration, the
focus, of the short story,'' Denis Donoghue wrote in an essay in
The New York Times Book Review last month. ``It was as if he
thought life most clearly disclosed in the telling anecdote.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued Powers' novels.  &UR; MORTE D'URBAN &LR; 
($12.95), which won the National Book Award in 1963, is about a
charismatic, go-getting Chicago priest who is banished by his
superior to the Minnesota outback. ``This is a comic novel, with
some fine slapstick touches,'' Richard Sullivan wrote in 1962. ``It
is at the same time sharply satirical.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero of  &UR; WHEAT THAT SPRINGETH GREEN &LR;  ($12.95) is another
worldly priest who struggles to maintain his dignity and resist the
tug of the secular world in his suburban parish. ``No eye has been
sharper, no ear finer than that of J.F. Powers at discerning the
nuances of service to God and mammon,'' Amy Edith Johnson wrote in
1988. ``The beauty of Powers' writing lies in its art's being
almost invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BROKEN TOWER: A Life of Hart Crane  &LR; By Paul Mariani.
Norton, $15.95. The first biography of the poet in 30 years
re-examines Crane's short, sad life, which ended with his suicide
at 32. It includes frank discussions of his sexuality, his
infatuation with New York City and his difficulty maintaining
friendships. The ``aim isn't to moralize Crane's life but to retell
it as `a great Greek tragedy' in Jazz Age dress,'' Langdon Hammer
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBERT FROST: A Life &LR; , by Jay Parini (Owl/Holt, $16), is a
sympathetic look at the cantankerous New England poet who gave up
college (he was a better Latinist than Pound or Eliot) for
subsistence farming and part-time teaching. Last year the reviewer
Christopher Benfey called this a ``sturdy and well-informed''
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES OF THE CENTURY  &LR; Edited by John
Updike and Katrina Kenison.  &UR;  &LR; Houghton Mifflin, $18.95. Each tale
in this celebration of short fiction appeared in an annual series
called Best American Short Stories, which began in 1915. (A new
story from the 1999 edition has been added.) ``Finding wonderful
stories that you don't already know is one of this collection's
great pleasures,'' Michael Gorra wrote last year. There are ``some
surprising _ even striking _ selections.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAST THINGS  &LR; By Jenny Offill. Delta, $11.95. The protagonist of
this first novel is a 7-year-old girl who witnesses her mother's
downward spiral into madness, and who tries to make her way through
a claustrophobic world fraught with codes, disguises and mysterious
signs. ``Offill's fresh voice, endearing and quirky, makes you
willingly suspend disbelief,'' Nancy Willard wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HAUNTED WOOD: Soviet Espionage in America _ the Stalin Era
 &LR; By Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev. Modern Library,
$14.95. Drawing on thousands of secret documents from the Stalin
years, an American scholar and a Russian journalist shed light on
the ``golden age'' of Soviet espionage. ``What emerges most sharply
is proof of the guilt of certain Americans whose spying for the
Soviet Union has been the subject of debate for over half a
century,'' Joseph E. Persico wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MANY THOUSANDS GONE: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in
North America  &LR; By Ira Berlin. Belknap/Harvard University, $16.95. A
historian examines the many forms and meanings of slavery between
the arrival of the first blacks in Virginia in 1619 and the rise of
King Cotton. ``This masterly work ... illuminates the first 200
years of African-American history more effectively than any
previous study,'' George M. Fredrickson wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A TUSCAN CHILDHOOD  &LR; By Kinta Beevor. Vintage Departures, $13.
An Englishwoman recounts her bohemian childhood in a 15th-century
castle in Tuscany, and tells how World War II altered the region
and its inhabitants. Last year the reviewer Philip Gambone admired
Beevor's ability to make ``the irrepressible Tuscan spirit ... come
to life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARADISO  &LR; By Jose Lezama Lima. Dalkey Archive, $14.50. This
ambitious novel by a major Cuban poet concerns a boy's coming of
age and the wisdom he gains while searching for his dead father.
``Lezama not only has the power to create absorbing and memorable
images, he has also placed these images into a vast network of
philosophical and mythical significance,'' Edmund White wrote in
1974.

PALFFY WILL REST SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Ziggy Palffy was downright bubbly about playing
today for the first time in three weeks. But that was 36 hours ago.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy will not play against the Mighty Ducks, instead using the
additional five days before Game 1 of the playoffs in Detroit to
rehabilitate his right shoulder that was sprained in a Feb. 15 game
against the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy isn't ducking the Ducks' 19-year-old defenseman Vitaly
Vishnevski, who checked him into the board to cause the shoulder
injury. Vishnevski also is sidelined with a shoulder problem. It is
just a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake, who has not played since last Saturday's
playoff clincher against the Ducks due to a badly bruised left
knee, will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practices are harder than the game,'' Blake said after
Saturday's up-tempo, 45-minute workout. ``It's time to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings' leading scorer, Luc Robitaille (36 goals, 74
points), will be rested. Defenseman Garry Galley also has been
excused because his wife, Terry-Lynn, gave birth to the couple's
third child just hours after Friday's 3-2 victory over Dallas. The
baby, 9-pound, 4-ounce Blake Liam Galley, was named after Rob
Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty wiped out after staying up all night,'' coach Andy
Murray said of his defenseman. ``You don't want to put a guy out
there and risk injury.''
</P>
<P>
   With Galley out, Jaroslav Modry will play, giving him a chance
to extend his goal-scoring streak to three games. Modry, who has
played just 25 games this season, has impressed Murray despite the
limited playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the approach this year not to let the negative things
work against me,'' Modry said. ``When I wasn't playing, I continued
to work in practice. When I am in there, I want to make it
difficult to keep me out of the (defensive rotation).''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings go with three defensive pairings: Blake/Mattias
Norstrom, Galley/Sean O'Donnell, Jere Karalahti/Aki Berg. The last
two groups occasionally flip-flop, but it doesn't leave much time
for Modry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You love to see a guy push the others,'' Murray said. ``We
know this hasn't been easy. But it has made us a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: If the Kings win today, it will give them 94
points, the fourth-best record in club history. The Kings had 105
points under Bob Pulford during the 1974-75 season but lost to
Toronto in the first round. The Kings had 102 points in 1990-91
under Tom Webster. It was their only division title, but they lost
in the second round to Edmonton. In 1980-81, the Kings had 99
points under Bob Berry but lost in the first round to the New York
Rangers.... Stephane Fiset, who will start Thursday in Game 1
against Detroit, will play today against the Ducks. Fiset was 2-0
against the Red Wings during the regular season.... Forward Pierre
Boucher, who played his first game Friday after missing the entire
season because of a foot surgery, returned to minor-league Long
Beach and played in Saturday night's game against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   KINGS vs. DUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Time: Noon, the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Channel 7; KRLA-AM (1110).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The Kings are in, the Ducks are out and that won't
change today. But the game will mark the return of Kings captain
Rob Blake, who has not seen action since bruising his left knee
eight days ago, when the teams last played. In that game, the Kings
won 2-1 to qualify for the playoffs. Today could be a tough one
emotionally for the Ducks, who beat Nashville 5-1 on Friday but
were eliminated two hours later when Edmonton came back from a 3-1,
third-period deficit to beat Vancouver 4-3 in OT.
