<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Weakens Further Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee weakened
further against the US dollar and closed sharply lower at 35.65/67
rupees per dollar at the interbank foreign exchange market in
Mumbai (Bombay) today.
</P>
<P>
Opening easier at 35.60/63 rupees compared to the overnight
finish of 35.58/61 rupees, the rupee gradually dropped to 35.66/68
on steady commercial dollar buying by corporations and importers.
</P>
<P>
After the rupee attempted a smart rally to 35.58/60 rupees on
fresh dollar sales, the State Bank of India started to heavily bid
the greenback. As a result of the buying, the rupee again fell and
settled at 35.65/67 rupees per dollar at the end of trading hours.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Housing Sector Rallying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's hard-pressed housing
sector has started rallying because of low prices and mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
The value of residential building permits has increased for two
straight quarters following six consecutive quarterly declines,
Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Between April and June this year, municipalities issued
building permits for new housing worth 2.78 billion U.S. dollars,
up 0.5 percent over the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest quarterly level since late 1994, the
federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which followed a jump of almost 20 percent in the
first quarter of this year, was due mainly to a rise in the value
of permits for multi-family dwellings.
</P>
<P>
As building permits take up to six months to result in a start,
the latest increase in the value of permits could result in more
new home construction, and possibly more jobs, by the end of this
year, the agency said.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Overall wages and salaries in
Canada rose by 0.2 percent in May, the second consecutive monthly
increase, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The May rise stemmed increases in these areas: transportation,
storage, communications and other utilities, finance, insurance,
real estate, mining, quarrying and oil wells, and health and
social services.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, pay decreases were noted in construction and
commercial and personal services, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Despite fluctuations, overall growth in wages and salaries in
the first five months of 1996 was 2.4 percent higher than in the
same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment rate rose to
10.2 percent in July compared with 9.9 percent in June, the
Federal Labor Office reported today.
</P>
<P>
The jobless totaled nearly four million in July, which meant
127,000 people lost their jobs that month, Labor Office head
Bernhard Jagoda told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Jagoda said the figure made the situation in the German labor
market appear worse than it was.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increased unemployment partially to factors
such as the release of holiday labor as well and fewer hirings
than usual during the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Germany hit a record high of 11.1
percent last February.

<HEADLINE> Croats, Muslims Reach Agreement On Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Croats and Muslims
signed a deal on Tuesday on the political structure of Mostar,
averting a major crisis in the seven-month peace process of this
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached agreement, which was signed by both parties,"
said Dragan Gasic, a spokesman for European Union, which has
administered the ethnically-torn Mostar in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
There are no immediate details about the agreement, which came
after rounds of drawn-out negotiations involving Muslim and Croats
officials as well as EU representatives.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the EU threatened that it would pull out of Mostar,
if no agreement was reached by midnight Saturday, but postponed
the deadline after negotiators failed to meet it.
</P>
<P>
The Mostar crisis erupted when Croats boycotted the
newly-elected city council, on the ground that there were
"irregularities" in the June 30 local elections in which Croats
lost to their Muslim opponents.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries, as well as the United States, have exerted
strong pressure on Bosnian Croats and Croatia to end the boycott,
for fear that the move, if not stopped, would set bad precedent
for the September nation-wide elections.

<HEADLINE> France to Begin Consultations with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- France will begin consultations
with its European Union (EU) partners on measures of reprisals
against the U.S. d'Amato law signed Monday by U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The law reinforces embargo against Iran and Libya by banning
heavy investments by foreign companies in energy section of the
two countries, causing widespread alarm in Europe whose oil
consumption largely depends on imports from them.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutrizux said that
consultations with EU partners will begin to prepare for measures
of reprisals for possible losses caused by d'Amato law, named
after Republican Senator Alfonso d'Amato of New York, who is the
main author of the law.
</P>
<P>
He said that d'Amato law is "in the same line of"
Helms-Burton law, which reinforces embargo against Cuba by banning
trade between foreign companies and the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the ball is in the camp of American administration. It
has the legislation which will allow it to act concretely and to
punish non-American enterprises, but will it do it? We hope that
reason will prevail," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that the European Council had asked the European
Commission to prepare for some measures of reprisals against
Helms-Burton law, and these measures "are on the desk."
</P>
<P>
Among the measures is the making a legislation allowing
European enterprises to obtain compensations for losses caused by
U.S. court rulings, and of establishing a black list of U.S.
enterprises which try to take advantage of the Helms-Burton law
against Europeans.
</P>
<P>
"One should use imagination in making measures of reaction by
taking into account what d'Amato law is, which is not all the same
(as Helms -Burton law)... in ways of application," Doutrizux
said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Criticizes Israel for Delaying Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today sharply criticized Israel for
delaying its army redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron,
and lifting a freeze on Jewish settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Palestinian Council (PC) in the West Bank town
Ramallah, Arafat called for a plan to stop Israel expanding the
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Israeli government authorized simpler
procedure for granting permission for Jewish constructions in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, lifting a four-year long settlement
building freeze imposed by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be that
the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no
operational decision was immediately made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PC Speaker Ahmed Qreia (Abu Alla) said today that
the Palestinians would not open new negotiations on the Hebron
redeployment, saying the Israeli troops should pullout from the
city, in accordance with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Monday, during his trip to Jordan, that Israel
would be ready to negotiate the Hebron issue in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordehai said Monday that, to his best knowledge, no date had been
set for the redeployment of the Israeli army in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed
to pullback from about 85 percent of Hebron by March 28, however,
following a series of suicide bombing attacks, former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the May
29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Netanyahu, said
after the elections that he would leave the decision of the
redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike,
and tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
their wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram
al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the
center of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish
neighborhood after the 1967 war, during which Israel took over
the town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu had said that he would
like Hebron to be part of the final status arrangements with the
Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would stand
by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
So far, Netanyahu repeatedly said he has been studying the
issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but giving no date when
he would make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, American sources revealed that the Israeli
premier, during his first official visit to the U.S. since he took
office in June, told President Bill Clinton at their private
meeting that he would seek a way to implement the redeployment in
Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Somali Teachers Protest for End of Food Ration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 120 teachers took to the
streets in South Mogadishu today, protesting against the
termination of their food rations by the World Food Program
(WFP).
</P>
<P>
A document signed by G. Van Dijk, WFP's representative in
Uganda, said the organization's "Food for Work" program would be
ended from July 31, 1996. More than 2,288 Mogadishu teachers are
benefiting from the program.
</P>
<P>
WFP used to provide teachers with food valued at 50 U.S.
Dollars per month, but the ration was dropped dramatically by 6
U.S. Dollars per month before it was totally stopped last
October, according to the teachers.
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand the sharp decrease while the food prices
were increasing in the markets," said a teacher.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation in Somalia in general and in South
Mogadishu in particular is worsening.
</P>
<P>
"We can only pass the stock that comes to us from Nairobi to
the concerned parties. We have nothing to explain," said Iddiris
Mohamed Osman, a spokesman of the organization. WFP's Mogadishu
office is currently run by local Somalis.
</P>
<P>
After the withdrawal of the Untied Nations peacekeeping forces
from Somalia, there were few aid agencies that worked in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
And the very few agencies that operated in South Mogadishu
have evacuated their international staff after the factional
fighting escalated in April this year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ostrich Exports to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's commercial ostrich
producers expect earnings worth at least 8.9 million U.S. Dollars
from sales for the year ended this July.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of the Ostrich Producers Association of
Zimbabwe (TOPAZ) Phil Haxen said today the sales figures were an
improvement on the previous year's but he did not give further
details.
</P>
<P>
''There has for the last couple of years been an insatiable
demand for ostrich meat from Europe which with our current small
production cannot hope to satisfy,'' said Haxen.
</P>
<P>
Haxen said a slight increase in demand for ostrich meat is
expected in Europe as many people switched from beef following
health scares over the ''mad cow'' disease outbreak at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
''It's hoped the effect on ostrich meat prices will be
positive, but early indications are that the increase will be
modest. Prices will not double overnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the major exporters of ostriches to Europe
where ostrich meat is fast-gaining popularity because of its low
cholesterol levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldiers was
killed and two others wounded today in an attack by Hezbollah
guerillas in south Lebanon, Israeli Army announced.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in Barrachit, east of Kiryat Shemona, in
the central sector of Israeli self-claimed security zone.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah forces attacked an Israeli military position with
anti-tank rockets and mortars, killing one soldier and slightly
wounding two others, the army said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces retaliated immediately with tanks and artillery
fires, shelling suspected Hezbollah targets, it added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second attack by Hezbollah forces in the same area
in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two Israeli soldiers were wounded, one seriously,
after Hezbollah guerillas pounded an Israeli position at dawn with
mortar shells, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces also responded with shelling suspected Hezbollah
 hideouts in the villages facing the security zone. No casualties
were reported.
</P>
<P>
Today's attack is the latest of a week of intensive
confrontations, during which the Israeli Army said that over 10
Hezbollah gunmen had been killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah forces on Sunday night abducted a South
Lebanese Army (SLA) soldier from his home in south Lebanon.
Both the SLA and Israel have demanded his immediate return.

<HEADLINE> Vegetable Basket for Big Cities In Poor County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 6 (Xinhua) -- "The vegetables you buy at local
markets in Beijing might have come from Shangyi County," Qiao
Denggui, party secretary of the county Communist Party Committee,
proudly tells visitors from the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
This is by no means an exaggeration. Shangyi, a county in
northern Hebei Province, is now making a good living by providing
a large amount of vegetables to other parts of the country and
even selling some abroad.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Shangyi sold 50 million kg of vegetables to Beijing,
Tianjin Municipality, and Zhangjiakou City in Hebei, as well as to
Russia and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
For those who live in places with more favorable conditions,
these figures don't sound like much. But for farmers in Shangyi,
which is in north China, on the edge of the Mongolian Highlands,
with its cold weather and poor economy, it means a not
insignificant move historically.
</P>
<P>
For decades, local farmers led poor lives, with only potatoes
and oats as their staple food, and very little in the way of
vegetables and meat.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Pan Yonghe, a farmer in Dayingzi Village, became the
first in the county to engage in commercial vegetable growing when
he spent 2,000 yuan to open a small vegetable plot covered with
plastic sheeting as he had learned from local agronomists from the
county-seat.
</P>
<P>
For people in this poverty-stricken county, 2,000 yuan meant 10
years of savings, and it was all Pan had, and was money he had
saved to build his dream house.
</P>
<P>
The move turned out to be a big success. In the first year, Pan
earned 7,000 yuan from his vegetable plot, growing celery,
tomatoes, and cabbage. The tale of Pan's success encouraged the
villagers to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The county leaders, who had been looking for a way to help
local farmers become affluent, came to see the unique advantages
of the county in growing vegetables. Shangyi county is
agricultural-based and has less industrial pollution, and urban
residents are eager to buy organic, or "clean vegetables", from
places like Shangyi.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, local officials and scientists have
put a great deal of effort into getting more local farmers into
the vegetable business by means of preferential policies and
bringing in more scientists. They have also sent salesmen across
China, especially to big cities, to market their products.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents in an increasing number of cities are getting
acquainted with Shangyi's produce, as are foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables have brought cash to this underdeveloped county and
its 180,000 people.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, 8,500 rural families no longer had to worry about
their food and clothing, and some 2,000 households became
well-off, thanks to the revolutionary changes that had been
brought about.
</P>
<P>
This year, locals invested 1.36 million yuan in vegetable
production, with acreage increased to 4,000 ha., including 413
ha. of green-houses and plastic-covered plots.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiao, the county is trying to expand vegetable
production, but also plans to introduce investment from other
parts of the country or overseas to set up a vegetable processing
business to produce dried or canned vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that more Chinese and foreigners will develop a
taste for vegetables produced here," Qiao concluded.

<HEADLINE> Geologists Told That They Should Pay More Attention to Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A prominent European geologist
says that it is high time for geologists, who always work in
remote areas, to pay more attention to cities.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter J. Cook, president of the Association of the
Geological Survey of the European Union, said in an interview with
Xinhua here today that our living space has been threated by
increasing population, pollution, and the over-exploitation of
underground water.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot to do in the cities," he pointed out, and "we
should work less in traditional areas and more in cities."
</P>
<P>
Cook worked in Australia, the US, Antarctica, and France before
he was appointed director of the British Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
He was selected as one of four geologists to give a keynote
address at the 30th International Geological Congress, which
opened here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainability embodies the concept that we must not use
resources or degrade the environment in a manner that will impact
adversely on future generations," he says.
</P>
<P>
He noted that even the most basic human requirement of air,
water and space to live in are under great pressure in many areas,
and that the sustainability of our life system depends on an
extraordinary complex interplay of factors involving the
availability and use of water, air, soils, land, energy and
minerals.
</P>
<P>
"Geoscience is a key to this understanding," he points out, and
better documentating, monitoring, modeling, and understanding of
the system is essential to geologists.
</P>
<P>
A research group from BGS has succeeded in pumping water down
to the ground and store natural gas in rocks, he says, but science
alone does not offer a solution. "It is essential to strengthen
communications between the sciences, and also between managers,
policy-makers and others concerned with the consequences of change
and the unsustainable exploitation of resources and the
environment."
</P>
<P>
Change is part of the natural system, but clearly the type,
magnitude and rate of change now affecting many areas is not
"natural", he said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
"We must carefully document those changes and develop a better
understanding of the processes involved, for it is inevitable that
the anthropogenic impact will increase, " he said.

<HEADLINE> No "Middle Way" for Dalai Lama: Scholars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese scholars said today
that the only way out for the Dalai Lama is to give up the pursuit
of "Independence of Tibet" completely - there is no "middle way".
</P>
<P>
Dainzhub Angbun, vice-president of the Central University for
Nationalities, and Yang Gongsu, a renowned Tibetologist and Han
scholar, made the remark in an interview with Xinhua. They have
done research on some recent speeches of the Dalai Lama in
Britain's Parliament and in other places.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the British Parliament on July 16, the Dalai Lama
said that he has adopted a "middle-way" approach and was willing
"to enter into negotiations (with the central government) on the
basis of an agenda that does not include the independence."
</P>
<P>
The two scholars pointed out that by saying so Dalai has
deceived the international community. At heart, he dreams of
"independence", said Angbun, an Tibetan, adding that the Dalai's
real intention is to internationalize the Tibet question.
</P>
<P>
In the same speech the Dalai Lama said that "historically and
according to international law Tibet is an independent country
under Chinese occupation."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this remark, the two scholars expressed doubt
about whether there is any need for the Dalai Lama to negotiate
with the central government if he ignores history to such a degree.
</P>
<P>
Angbun said that, in the 13th century, China's Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368) began registering households, collecting taxes, and
imposing corvee duties in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"This means China's central government exercised its
sovereignty, in a modern sense, over Tibet," the university head
noted.
</P>
<P>
Yang remarked that "judging from international law, there is no
evidence that justifies the saying that Tibet has ever been an
independent state."
</P>
<P>
Although Britain and other colonial powers consistently plotted
the "independence of Tibet" at the start of the century, all
efforts came to naught, Yang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Since ancient times, it has never occurred to people to build
an "independent state" in Tibet, said the two scholars, adding
that, in accordance with available materials, the slogan of
"independence of Tibet" was initially raised by the British
imperialists for the purpose of invading Tibet.

<HEADLINE> No "Middle Way" for Dalai Lama: Scholars (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two scholars said that some "evidence justifying the
independence of Tibet" propagated by the Dalai clique and certain
western scholars is not supportable.
</P>
<P>
One piece of "evidence" cited by western scholars is the "Lhasa
Convention", which the British army compelled three Tibetan major
temples to sign in 1904. It was not effective because the high
commissioner stationed in Tibet by the Qing government refused to
sign it.
</P>
<P>
Although the Qing government conceded the "Lhasa Convention" as
an affiliated contract while signing the Beijing Treaty, China's
sovereignty over Tibet was safeguarded because the Beijing Treaty
stipulated that "Britain should never occupy Tibet and interfere
in any political event in Tibet."
</P>
<P>
Another piece of "evidence" is the Simla Convention of 1914,
masterminded by Britain, where McMahon, the British
representative, tried to bully Tibet's representative into
recognizing the so-called McMahon Line, which ceded large areas of
land to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese representative attending the meeting did not
sign the agreement, and insisted on Tibet's being a part of China,
the British imperilists failed yet another time.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama and some western scholars have also referred to
the announcement about driving the Sichuan Army out of Tibet, made
by the 13th Dalai Lama after the 1911 revolution led by Dr. Sun
Yat-sen which overthrew the Qing Dynasty, as a "declaration of
independence of Tibet."
</P>
<P>
However, the two scholars point out, that circular did not
mention the "independence" of Tibet, and it was the British who
intentionally rendered "snow land" as "country" in English.
</P>
<P>
The announcement reflected the conflicts among various domestic
separatist regimes at the time, but it had nothing to do with the
issue of "independence".
</P>
<P>
The so-called "independence of Tibet", the university
vice-president said, is virtually part of the invasion of Tibet by
imperialist powers.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Dalai clique is asking for support from
certain anti-China powers, which in the past attempted to colonize
Tibet, is a betrayal of the interests of the Chinese nation,
including those of the Tibetan people, Dainzhub Angbun
said.

<P>
As an expert on the history of relationships between Tibet's
local regime and the central government, Angbun said that in the
middle of the 14th century, power was granted to local heads of
Tibet by China's emperors.
</P>
<P>
During the Qing Dynasty, the titles of the Dalai and Panchen
Lamas, as well as the system of reincarnation of living Buddhas,
were created by the central government, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai clique and some western scholars also said that Tibet
was once a tributary state of China, and as a result, China had no
sovereignty over it.
</P>
<P>
Angbun said that the features of a tributary state are as
follow: it is not part of the other country's territory; the
central government does not send ministers and does not interfere
in the replacement of rulers of the state; and periodic tribute to
the central government is part of it, but tax obligation is
not. Therefore, Tibet could not be classed as a tributary state.
</P>
<P>
The 86-year-old Yang, a professor at Beijing University, was
assistant to the representative of the central government
stationed in Tibet, after the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1950.
</P>
<P>
After working in Tibet for 13 years, he became the Chinese
ambassador to Nepal and several other countries, and was in India
and western European countries, as a result of which, he is quite
familiar with the Dalai Lama and his government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that, while in Tibet, he had close contacts with the
Dalai Lama because of his work, and that there was "not much of a
barrier between them, such as was often found between higher and
lower officials."
</P>
<P>
At that time, Yang said, "the Dalai Lama was intelligent, wise,
eager to learn. He not only supported the central government, but
also loved the motherland."
</P>
<P>
After the Dalai Lama went abroad under duress, he began to seek
help from anti-China forces, Yang said, and "I felt a regret for
the fact that the Dalai Lama, under the influence of reactionary
forces inside his government-in-exile, ultimately became the tool
of anti-China forces and the head of the "independence of Tibet"
movement.
</P>
<P>
The current "independence" movement that surrounds the Dalai
Lama is primarily made up of former Tibetan aristocrats, who grew
up in a closed environment, and had little contact with the Han
people, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
They received a western education after their departure from
Tibet, Yang noted, and "as a result, they could not represent the
real interests of Tibetans as they are miles away from the real
lives and the thinking of the great masses of Tibet."

<HEADLINE> Canada to License Fertility Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is set to
regulate fertility industry by licensing researchers, doctors and
possibly drug companies that work with human fetal tissues,
embryos, eggs and sperm.
</P>
<P>
The licensing move is proposed as the next phase of a new
policy to deal with the business and science of human
reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Its goal is to give the federal government a clear picture of
what's happening in the infertility clinics and research
laboratories across Canada and a way to exert control over
practices that now go largely unregulated, today's Globe and Mail
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Canadian government doesn't know how many
private or public clinics there are in the country offering in
vitro fertilization and donor insemination, or who is doing embryo
or fetal tissue research.
</P>
<P>
The licensing regime will be designed to cover a broad range of
medical procedures and research projects that aren't prohibited
under a bill tabled in June in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
The controversial New Reproduction and Genetic Technologies
Act, which is expected to be debated when the Commons return in
the fall, bans 13 practices, including the sale of human embryos,
eggs and sperm. The sanctions include fines of up to 365,000 U.S.
dollars and a maximum prison term of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The licensing package will be tabled after the bill is passed,
and will become part of it, the newspaper said.

NEW YORK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Computer software giant
Microsoft Corp. is mounting an ambitious bid to change the way
graphics are displayed on personal computer screens.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the company is to
launch a two-year research project coded as Talisman, which is to
concentrate on a special microchip to make PCs more powerful in
displaying three-dimensional images at ultra-high speed.
</P>
<P>
Although Microsoft has never been directly involved in
designing chips before -- and will depend on other companies to
prove the concept works in silicon -- some experts believe
Talisman is a breakthrough that many hardware companies will
license and bring to market by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said a key goal of the company is
to make computers that can effectively interpret speech,
handwriting and video footage.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the next version of Microsoft's
word-processing software, for example, uses the research group's
techniques for interpreting human speech in an unusually
sophisticated grammar-checking device.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Backs German Initiative on Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today voiced its
support for a German initiative on banning production and using of
anti-personnel mines and eliminating all planted mines scattered
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah declared that "Kuwait fully backs
the German initiative" and described it as "positive and effective
and can take part in eliminating the dangerous problem of mines,"
according to the official Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was put forward by German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel on July 18, who called for a diplomatic campaign to
restrict producing, exporting and planting anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah stressed on the necessity of an international support
for the German initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to international statistics, mines kill and deform
over 20,000 people in some 65 countries annually, including
Kuwait. At present, a total of 60 countries have joined the
U.N. May 3 Protocol over banning the production and exporting of
mines.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah attacked Iraqi troops which left "hundred of thousands
of different types of mines" when they withdrew from Kuwait on
February 26, 1991.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti people were still suffering from the
human, psychological and environmental impact of the mines which
were planted by the Iraqi forces during the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti government, neighboring and friendly countries
have been working to eliminate them," he said.

<P>
PRAGUE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Czech canoeist Lukas Pollert has
sold his gold and silver medals won at the last two Olympic Games
after criticising the over-commercialization of the Olympic
movement, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech CTK agency said the silver medal Pollert sold was won
in the Canadian canoe singles at Atlanta and the gold came from

<P>
The Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes reported Pollert said the
atmosphere at the Games was no longer attractive to him.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President to Visit Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam will pay a 12-day visit to five Latin American countries
-- Guatemala, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru -- from September
3 to 14.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Guatemala between September 3 and 5,
President Kim will hold a summit meeting with President Alvaro
Arzu Irigoyen. They will exchange views on the promotion of
economic cooperation between the two countries, said South Korean
Presidential spokesman Yoon Yeo-joon.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold a multilateral summit with leaders of
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and President
Irigoyen. The summit will discuss enhancing diplomatic and
economic cooperation with these countries in international forums
and forming a multilateral cooperation body composed of South
Korea and the five Central American nations.
</P>
<P>
While touring the four South American countries, Kim will hold
summit meetings with Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem,
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Chilean President
Eduardo Frei Ruiz - Tagle and Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori. They will discuss ways of increasing economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kim's tour will be his first visit to Latin America since he
assumed office in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
With many Latin American countries developing as newly emerging
economies, President Kim's visit would contribute to increasing
South Korea's trade with and investment in them, Yoon said.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 South Korean industrial leaders are expected to
accompany Kim during his tours of the Latin American countries.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Improvement of Children's Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today called on all sectors of society to assist
the government's drive to improve the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon held at the presidential residence in capital
Pretoria to welcome Lesotho's Queen Mother Mamohato, Mandela said
children are the country's future and therefore deserve to be
nurtured by society with love and care.
</P>
<P>
Too many African children still lack basic rights such as
shelter, healthy living conditions, education and medical
facilities, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Queen Mamohato, the widow of Lesotho's late King Moshoeshoe II
and mother of Monarch King Letsie III, arrived in South Africa
earlier today for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Queen Mamohato is a patron of numerous children's
organizations in Lesotho, Mandela said South Africa and Lesotho
could work together to improve the lives of children.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cracks Baby Trafficking Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese police arrested 10
people suspected of involving in the sale of Vietnamese babies to
foreigners, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police, who stormed a private hotel in the city where seven
babies were to be sold to foreigners, alleged that 15 infants,
aged from two months to one year, were sold mainly to France and
Switzerland since early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tran Huu Phuoc, the ring leader aged 31, was arrested at his
home in Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Phuoc confessed that since early 1995, he and his wife hung
around maternity homes, buying babies from unmarried mothers.
</P>
<P>
Due to social prejudice against unmarried mothers in the
country, unmarried pregnant women are vulnerable to baby
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The ring even went to poor farming families, encouraging
parents to sell their babies, claiming that their children would
be taken good care of by rich foreign families.
</P>
<P>
These traffickers, who paid to the parents about 500
U.S. dollars a baby, would sell the baby to foreigners for up to
5,000 dollars.

NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian officials

cooperative movement.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member Tanzanian delegation, led by Chairman of Western
Zone Tobacco Cooperative Daudi Juma, particularly appealed for
advice from Kenya on how to start their cooperative bank.

The Tanzanian officials, having paid visits to Kenya's
cooperatives, said they were "very impressed" by the success of
the cooperative movement in Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Japan Declares Food Poisoning Outbreak Infectious Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese government officials
finally responded today to the appeals of medical experts to
declare the two-month-old food poisoning outbreak an infectious
disease.
</P>
<P>
But the more than 9,200 patients who have come down with the
E. coli O-157 bacteria will not be immediately rounded up into
isolation wards, Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in 20 years for the ministry to declare an
epidemic as infectious under the country's 1897 Communicable
Disease Prevention Law, which allows authorities to isolate
patients and even set up traffic blockades if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided that the law will be partially invoked
and patients, including 6,500 people in the western Japanese city
of Sakai, will not be moved to isolation wards.
</P>
<P>
The series of measures to be taken under the law include
regulations concerning food-handling work by patients and O-157
bacterium carriers as well as sales and use of contaminated food
and well water.
</P>
<P>
They also include mandated inspections into facilities
suspected of being contaminated with the virulent bacillus.
</P>
<P>
Doctors now have to report to authorities when treating E. coli
O-157 patients.
</P>
<P>
To prevent secondary infection, relatives of O-157 patients
will have to undergo medical checkups as well.
</P>
<P>
Japanese medical workers have been appealing to the government
to declare the food poisoning outbreak, which has so far killed
seven people, as an infectious disease.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Sends Message to Lebanese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
received here today a verbal message from Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak which dealt with the results of his recent visit to
the U.S. and the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ahamed Maher, Egyptian charge d'affaires to Lebanon, said that
he was entrusted by Mubarak to convey the urgent oral message.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mubarak and U.S. President Bill Clinton, when they
met in Washington on July 30, discussed the so-called "Lebanon
First" proposal put forward by the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"Mubarak-Clinton meeting dealt with this issue, but as you know
that it was only a circulating idea, not an official one," the
Egyptian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course all the problems related to the peace arrangements
in the region were discussed by President Mubarak in Washington,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's "Lebanon First" proposal, the Jewish state will
pull its troops out of a 850-square-kilometer buffer zone in
southern Lebanon in exchange for Syria's help in disarming the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerillas and a mechanism safeguarding the
security on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their talks in Washington, both Clinton and
Mubarak refrained from making mention of the proposal, but they
pledged to do their utmost to revive the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Lebanese President visited Damascus and held a
lengthy talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad. They reportedly
discussed the "Lebanon First" proposal.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Syrian president said afterwards that
the two leaders "discussed the peace process and the negative
impacts of the Israeli policy on the progress of the talks."
</P>
<P>
"They stressed the importance of the continuation of full
coordination and the unity of their moves to achieve a just
and comprehensive peace based on the land-for-peace principle,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Hrawi had a meeting in the Beirut Presidential
Palace with House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri and informed them of his talks with al-Assad in the Syrian
capital.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Lebanese house speaker left Beirut
immediately for Damascus to meet the Syrian president.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is also expected to visit the Syrian capital Wednesday
to meet Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam, according to
well-informed Lebanese sources.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese leaders have announced their refusal of Israel's
unilateral withdrawal proposal and condemned it as an attempt
to separate Lebanon from Syria in their peace talks with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Baby Fish Better Protected in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Baby fish in Cambodia have
been better protected thanks to the effective measures taken by
the government to stop catching of the fish, local press reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The illegal fishing has been reduced by 70 percent this year
compared to the previous year, said May Sam Oeun, undersecretary
of state for the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The capturing of baby fish is prohibited between May and
October in the Tonle Sap, Tonle Bassac and Mekong rivers,
according to a law for fishing. Illegal trafficking of baby fish
is draining away one of Cambodia's principal natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Oeun said that most of the young fish captured are fattened
up for a year and then used in paste and soups. He alleged that
some members of the military had made catching baby fish "a
business," so his department needed adequate funds to protect his
inspectors.

<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000 people in the Japanese
city of Hiroshima gathered today at the city's Peace Memorial Park
to commemorate the victims of the atomic bomb attack 51 years ago
and pray for peace with a series of ceremonies, Kyodo News said.
</P>
<P>
After a memorial service to the dead held near the epicenter of
the blast, Takashi Hiraoka, mayor of Hiroshima, delivered the
annual peace declaration and renewed local residents' calling for
global abolition of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
Hiraoka emphasized that Hiroshima should be made a creative,
prospective and peaceful city.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of pupils read their peace declaration,
promising to live on bravely for the world peace.
</P>
<P>
Besides Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other Japanese
attendants, some 450 foreign guests including people from such
Asian countries as South Korea and China also participated in the
gattering, Kyodo News said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day in 1945, the U.S. B-29 bomber Enola Gay dropped
an atomic bomb on Hiroshima to speed an end to War War II. Death
toll in the attack amounted to 140,000 by the end of 1945.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the memorial ceremony has been held annually.

ABU DHABI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak sent a message today to Sultan Qaboos of Oman, in which he
briefed the Omani leader on his recent visit to the United States,
reports reaching here from Omani capital Muscat said.
</P>

The message deals with the results of his talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. congressional leaders on ways
of pushing forward the stalled Middle East peace process as well
as the Egyptian-Omani bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the Mubarak-Clinton meeting in Washington in late July,
the two leaders pledged to do their utmost to revive the Middle

Mubarak has also sent similar messages to some other Arab heads
of state, including Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Kuwaiti
Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
The messages come as part of his continued consultations and
coordination with other Arab leaders on the future of the peace
process in light of current regional developments.

President Hafez al-Assad to coordinate stances on the Middle East

<HEADLINE> Britain Faces More Clashes with EU Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The British government is heading
for a collision with its European Union (EU) partners over various
issues on European integration at the Intergovernmental
Conference, according to the European Policy Forum.
</P>
<P>
The European Policy Forum, a British cross-party think-tank,
said in a research report that the British government is in a
minority of one on 35 issues and opposed 98 out of 148 proposals,
which are put forward for the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
In talks with the Irish presidency of the EU, details have
emerged to indicate that British disagreement with its EU partners
extends far beyond the main row over adopting the single European
currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The issues on which Britain is isolated include the extension
of qualified majority voting, the social chapter, the powers the
European parliament and the reform of the European Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
Britain's rejection of 98 EU proposals is in sharp contrast
with 29 by Germany, 39 by France and 42 by Sweden, which is the
highest number of rejections by a Scandinavian member state.
</P>
<P>
The Forum pointed out that it "seems unlikely" that all these
differences can be quickly resolved within the present structures
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Graham Mather, president of the Forum and a Conservative MEP,
is reported as saying on Tuesday, "This shows it is not just the
single currency that Britain is opposing, underlining the need for
a referendum, but also suggests that Britain may have to negotiate
a flexible agreement on a whole range of issues."

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel Traffic Hits Record in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French
operator of the Channel tunnel, announced Monday that the numbers
of passengers and vehicles through the tunnel rose sharply in July
and its cross-Channel market share was further increased.
</P>
<P>
The company, still locked in tough negotiations with banks over
rescheduling its 8.4 billion pounds (13 billion US dollars) of
loans, said that a record 240,000 tourist vehicles used its Le
Shuttle rail service last month, an increase of 110 percent on the
same month last year and 31 percent up on this June.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel said that last weekend alone saw 31,000 cars and
coaches passing through the tunnel, the equivalent to about
100,000 passengers and more than a fifth of the traffic through
the tunnel in the whole of last August.
</P>
<P>
Le Shuttle freight services handled some 54,000 journeys by
trucks and lorries, an increase of 45 percent on the previous
July. Tons of freight increased by 35 percent from 158,000 to
214,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers using high-speed Eurostar trains went
over the mark of 500,000 for the first time in July, a 72 percent
increase on the total for last July. Just over 2.7 million
passengers have traveled on Eurostar trains so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The company also claimed an increased cross-Channel market
share for July, with its service taking 44 percent of the car
market and 45 percent of the truck market up from the 40 percent
at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging figures for Eurotunnel follow an increasingly
intense commercial battle with the ferry operators and the
short-haul airlines. The group reduced its main return fare by 50
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of special offers, including deals on
duty-free goods for travelers using Le Shuttle services, had also
helped boost trade.

<HEADLINE> WHO Underscores Merits of Breast-feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) on Tuesday called on the world community to support
breast-feeding as an effective practice to promote health of both
babies and mothers.
</P>
<P>
"Preserving breast-feeding where it is the practice, restoring
it where it is not, and creating an environment that enables
mothers and babies to breast-feed merit the unreserved support of
every community and all its members," said WHO Director-General
Hiroshi Nakajima in a statement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The WHO chief's statement was issued to endorse World
Breast-feeding Week on August 1-7, an annual awareness-raising
event organized by the World Alliance for Breast-feeding Action, a
nongovernmental organization spanning all continents.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's event is "Breast-feeding: a Community
Responsibility".
</P>
<P>
According to WHO studies, human milk is a living substance of
great biological complexity that not only provides unique
protection against infectious disease, but also stimulates the
baby's own immune system.
</P>
<P>
When babies are artificially fed the most immediately apparent
result is increased rates of sickness and death, the WHO says.
Moreover, artificial feeding can do no more than approximate the
physiological and emotional significance of the act of
breast-feeding for babies and mothers alike.
</P>
<P>
Breast-feeding also protects a mother's health by reducing the
risk of after-birth bleeding when sucking starts within the first
hour, by helping to protect against ovarian cancer, and by
reducing the risk of anaemia.
</P>
<P>
The WHO also stressed that the length of time and the way
breast-feeding proceeds is also significant, once again for mother
and child alike.
</P>
<P>
For example, exclusive breast-feeding, that is, giving no other
fluid or food than breast milk to a baby, provides more than 98
percent protection from pregnancy during the first six months
after birth.
</P>
<P>
Studies also show that six months of exclusive breast-feeding
provides measurable protection against eczema and food intolerance
in children whose families have a history of allergic disease.
</P>
<P>
"All mother should be enabled to practise exclusive
breast-feeding and all babies should be fed exclusively on breast
milk from birth to four to six months of age", advised Nakajima in
his message.
</P>
<P>
"Thereafter, children should continue to be breast-fed, while
receiving appropriate and adequate complementary foods, for up to
two years of age and beyond," he added.

<HEADLINE> Libya Attacks US Decision to Tighten Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Libya today attacked U.S. President
Bill Clinton for signing a new law tightening sanctions against
Libya and Iran, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed a bill Monday to punish non-American companies
which invest annually 40 million U.S. dollars or more in energy
projects in Libya or Iran.
</P>
<P>
In its first comment on the bill, Libya's official news agency
JANA said that Clinton's decision reflects the failure of the
American anti-Libyan policy, which was opposed by allies of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
JANA said that the decision crystallizes selfish American
policy that harms interests of American people and their allies
and exposes America's bias towards Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of this legislation cements American policy which
is based on narrow and selfish interests which have inflicted and
will eventually inflict damages on the American people's interests
in particular and the interests of the so-called allies in
general," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The measure was an "exaggeration in the demonstration of hatred
and selfishness," it said, adding that the ban would backfire on
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran has also lashed out at Clinton's action, saying that the ban
was doomed to failure because the United States' allies have
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry's spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
Monday night that the American actions are against international
norms and laws on free global trade.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Police to Ensure Peaceful Motorcycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus police will use all
means to avert any incidents on a motorcycle demonstration Sunday
by Cypriot and European bikers along the U.N.-controlled buffer
zone, police chief Panikos Hadjiloizou said here today.
</P>
<P>
Around 120 motorcyclists started a 10-day ride from Berlin
Friday, which they said is a demonstration against the Turkish
occupation of northern Cyprus, and will arrive in Cyprus on August
10.
</P>
<P>
Another 7,000 Cypriot motorcyclists will join them in an
attempt to cross, through Ledra Palace Check Point in Nicosia, to
the northern part of the island, and then to ride to coastal town
of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting between police and the local
authorities of towns or villages bordering the route of the
demonstrations, Hadjiloizou said "we are determined not to allow
anybody to create any incidents and we shall use all available
means for a peaceful anti-occupation ride."
</P>
<P>
Local authority leaders expressed their readiness to contribute
in a positive manner toward the smooth running of the ride.
</P>
<P>
The chief of police said that police have received information
that "some participants in Sunday's ride might create certain
incidents and we want to prevent any of these people from causing
any trouble."
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of confronting anybody but we do not
want to allow anybody to disturb the peace of the people who live
in the area," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has urged all
people on this divided eastern Mediterranean island to respect the
180-kilometer-long buffer zone, which separates the island into
two parts.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has also shown concern over the event
which could have an adverse effect on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides has said that "We do
not wish to see any confrontation between the National Guard and
the Turkish occupation forces, nor do we want the bikers to give
any pretext to the Turkish army to move into the buffer zone and
endanger people living in areas bordering the U.N.-controlled
zone."
</P>
<P>
A meeting was held Monday at the Foreign Ministry to discuss
the measures to be taken to avert an incidents.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides said after the meeting
that it was important to ensure not only the safety of those
participating in the ride but also the security of the state.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General's resident representative in Cyprus
Gustave Feissel, who also attended the meeting, said that people
have the right to protest, provided the manner in which they are
protesting is peaceful and within the law.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Existence of Terrorist Training Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran today strongly denied the
existence of any terrorist training camp inside the country in a
bid to avoid potential military attack by American forces.
</P>
<P>
The official statement was made by Iran's mission to the
United Nations in a communique which was published by the official
news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The communique said "the Islamic Republic of Iran rejects in
the strongest possible terms the existence of any camp in Iran for
terrorist training."
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here analyzed that if the United States
decides to launch military attack against Iran, there will be
three main targets.
</P>
<P>
The first target will be the Bushehr Nuclear Power plant
in the Persian Gulf because the United States and Israel are
accusing Iran of developing mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The other two targets would be training camps -- one in
northern Tehran and the other near the religious city of Qum, 156
kilometers south of the capital city of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, the communique noted, Iran's strength "lies not in
training any terrorists or supporting international terrorism" but
in its "unwavering commitment to the principle of rejecting both
hegemony and hegemonization."
</P>
<P>
The communique rejected USA Today's allegation about the
existence of terrorist camps in Iran, noting the paper "echoes
the disinformation campaign by Israeli secret service and the
desperate attempts by an Iranian terrorist organization in
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
It added, the victimization of Iran in public opinion by
"irresponsible and politically motivated propaganda" will more
than likely continue so long as "Iran refuses to surrender to
American pressure and hegemony."

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Boss Urges Two Parties in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku today urged the two parties in
Zanzibar to solve their differences amicably to ease political
tension there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Dodoma in Central Tanzania
today, Chief Anyaoku said he is concerned of the political
situation in Zanzibar, particularly after talks with the Zanzibar
President Salmin Amour and the Civil United Front (CUF) Vice
Chairman Seif Shariff Hamad.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, all is not well with the political climate in
Zanzibar because opposition representatives do not enter the
House of Representatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned of this situation because it implies that the
multi-party democracy in Zanzibar is not normal. The two parties
should agree to iron out the differences together," Chief
Anyaoku added.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku, who ended his three-day visit to Zanzibar
yeasterday, said he was planning to hold further talks with Amour
and Hamad before departure, saying he was hopeful that the two
sides would eventually solve the tension.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth boss today held separate talks with Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa, prime minister Frederick Sumaye,
Speaker of parliament Pius Msekwa and opposition leader in the
House Fatma Maghimbi in Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Referring to mult-party democracy in Tanzania, the
Commonwealth boss said: "Not all countries have been as fortunate
as Tanzania in usheing in multi-party democracy peacefully. You
have been able to complete the transition with far less headache
than many countries."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief Anyaoku called on Tanzania's small and
medium- scale industiries to draw from the Commonwealth Fund
which had been launched recently in Harare of Zimbabwe with an
aim to promote industrial development in Commonwealth countries.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Meet Syrian President in Alexandria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will meet with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad Wednesday for
talks on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held in the Egyptian Mediterranean port city
of Alexandria, will mainly deal with the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks of the peace process and Israel's decision to restart
construction of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs, particularly the Palestinians, have criticized
Israel's decision on settlements as an obstacle to peace and a
violation of agreements already reached between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-al-Assad meeting comes just four days after
al-Assad met with Jordan's King Hussein in Damascus Saturday to
explore ways to revive the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday in Damascus, al-Assad also held talks with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi to coordinate their stances on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed
willingness to resume peace talks with Syria. Syrian newspapers,
which usually reflect the government's views, said today that
Netanyahu's offer to resume talks was not serious because it is
not based on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly put forward the so-called "Lebanese
first" proposal, according to which Israel will pull out its
troops from an enclave in south Lebanon in exchange for Syria's
help in disarming Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerillas and
security on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria rejected the proposal. During their
talks Monday, al-Assad and Hrawi agreed to adopt a common stand on
peace moves with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria described the proposal as a "trap" aimed at sabotaging
the good ties between Beirut and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Wednesday's meeting between Mubarak and al-Assad
comes within the framework of constant Egyptian-Syrian coordination
on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has been playing an active role in the Mideast peace process as it
acts as a key mediator between the Arabs and Israel in their peace
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Canada Objects to U.S. Sanctions against Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy and Minister for International Trade Art Eggleton
expressed Tuesday their strong objection to the U.S. sanctions
against foreign companies that invest in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law the
"Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996", which will impose
sanctions on foreign firms that invest more than 40 million U.S.
dollars a year in Iran's and Libya's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Clinton has the option of denying foreign
businesses loans under the Export-Import Bank, banning their
imports, barring U.S. banks from making loans of more than 10
million U.S. dollars to uncooperative firms, and barring them from
bidding on U.S. government contracts.
</P>
<P>
"As with the Helms-Burton law, Canada continues to object to
unilateral measures that have extraterritorial effects; this
legislation is an inappropriate response to U.S. concerns," said
Axworthy in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
"The extraterritorial effects of this latest act represent once
again an attempt by the United States to dictate trade policy to
its allies," he said, adding that Canada will continue to "defend
its interests against the extraterritorial application of such
legislation."
</P>
<P>
This latest U.S. move has already aroused strong opposition
from the 15-nation European Union and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Canada would be consulting on this matter with the EU and other
allies to determine how best to address the extraterritorial
impact of the act, indicated Axworthy and Eggleton.
</P>
<P>
Although Canadian investment in Iran and Libya is very limited
and its firms are unlikely to be affected by the U.S. act, the
Canadian government has voiced its strong opposition, viewing it
as a further indication of the U.S. willingness to impose its laws
beyond its borders.

<HEADLINE> June Sees Biggest Fall in UK Industrial Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- British industrial output fell
unexpectedly in June as the manufacturing sector continued to
struggle, fueling suspicion of another cut in UK interest rates.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Monday by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), total industrial production, which includes
factory output, oil and gas extraction and energy production, fell
by 1.1 percent in June, compared with a rise of 0.8 percent in
May. It was the biggest monthly drop since November 1992.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output in June fell 0.3 percent, and 0.5 percent
year-on-year, its lowest level since June 1993. It has failed to
grow for three successive quarters.
</P>
<P>
The decline went against both City expectations of a small rise
in output and more optimistic evidence from recent industrial
trends surveys.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output failed to grow in the three months to June
compared with the same period a year ago, said the ONS.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office estimated for the seventh successive
month that output would remain flat in both total industrial
production and manufacturing industries, with energy production
depressed by the warm weather and activity in the North Sea
constrained by maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that with political pressures weighing
heavily on Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's mind, the
latest figures may offer him useful ammunition to argue for
another interest rate cut in autumn.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Nearly Settled Over Iraqi Oil Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A dispute between Iraq and the
United States over monitoring Arrangement on emergency sales of
oil by Iraq was no the verge of settlement with a few technical
details left for the final accord, the U.S. State Department said
today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said there would be
more monitors than in the initial plan to oversee both the export
of oil and the import of food and other relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
The initial plan was greeted with rejection by the U.S.
delegation to the United Nations, who has said that there were
"loopholes," which Baghdad was trying to "drive trucks through."
</P>
<P>
The United States, determined to block Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein from getting enrichment by sales of oil, has emphasized
the importance of tight control over the 2 billion dollar deal
that would allow Iraq to pay for food and relief supplies over six
months.
</P>
<P>
Burns said a final accord was expected shortly now that "the
United States has resolved the major problem," ensuring that
Saddam would not get to the proceeds by the oil sales and food
supplies.

<HEADLINE> Wildlife Protection in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Augest 7 (Xinhua) -- Natural reserves and wildlife
protection are being improved in China's northwest, home of rare
species such as golden monkey and crested ibis.
</P>
<P>
According to a newly-published research report, there are more
than 230 rare species under key state protection in Shaanxi,
Gansu, and Qinghai provinces and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Ma Naixi says that 69 nature reserves have been established,
covering 5.3 percent of the total area of this region.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, who is director of the Center for Chinese
Natural Reserve Studies at Northwest University in Xi'an, the
nature reserves are the main way of protecting wildlife in such
an ecologically-unstable region.
</P>
<P>
In Foping Nature Reserve in Shaanxi Province, the number of
giant panda has increased from less than 100 to more than 200
since it was established.
</P>
<P>
In Yangxian County in Shaanxi, seven crested ibis, one of the
world's rarest species, were discovered in 1981, just after a
special protection zone was set up. The bird's numbers have now
increased to some 50, and artificial propagation has scored some
success.
</P>
<P>
Similar stories can be found in the protection of wild
horses and other animals.
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, a plan that involves more government
efforts and more participation from local people will be drawn up
to raise wildlife protection in this region to a new level.

<HEADLINE> OECD Under Growing Pressure for Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development is facing growing pressure for
sweeping reform of its operations and budget cuts, according to a
Financial Times report.
</P>
<P>
A top official of the OECD, the industrialized world's
influential think-tank, has called for radical changes at the
Paris-based group and the first management consultancy report on
the OECD has also warned of gross inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
These developments are increasing great pressure on Donald
Johnston, the secretary-general of the organization, to introduce
a series of effective reform measures.
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who arrived at the organization only two months ago,
has reportedly tightened management structures and he is expected
to unveil broader plans for reform later this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States and several other countries are hoping these
will involve radical cost-cutting. One British official is quoted
as saying: "we think restructuring of the group will be possible
and further efficiencies can be made."

<HEADLINE> Italian Businessmen Criticize U.S. Sanction Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian businessmen have expressed
strong reactions against the United States law threatening to
punish foreign companies with business links with Iran and
Libya. They clam, the measures will affect Italy's economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called d' Amato Law, signed by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Monday, any foreign companies or individuals who invest
more than 40 million U.S. dollars in the energy section in Iran
and Libya will be punished by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Most of the local newspapers today published the reaction of
the businessmen in front pages and some newspapers even set aside
special pages and columns for the reactions.
</P>
<P>
The strongest came from such enterprises as Group Eni and Fiat,
which have close investments and trade relations with companies
of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Italian companies could be among those most at risk as Iran and
Libya provide almost 45 percent of the 85 million tons of oil
imported annually by the country.
</P>
<P>
About 24 million tons are imported from Libya by Eni, Italy's
partially privatized oil company, through its production and
exploration subsidiary Agip, which has a significant natural gas
investment in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The total trade volume between Italy and Libya was 7.656
trillion liras (5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995, and the volume
between Italy and Iran was 3,701 billion lira (2.4 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A senior businessman in Eni said the U.S. sanctions against
Libya and Iran was a political issue, but it affected the economic
interests of the companies of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen asked the Italian government to protect the
economic interests of companies affected by the law.
</P>
<P>
The local media said the United States should not isolate one
country today and punish another country the next because that not
only affected the economic interests of other countries but also
made people nervous.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said his government would fight
against international terrorism as always, but hoped that when the
United States imposed sanctions against other countries it would
take into consideration the economic interests of its allies.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government would try its best to protect Italian
companies' economic interests abroad, Dini said.

<P>
Brussels, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
provide Sweden with ECU 17 million (one ECU equals about 1.3 US$)
to improve the competitiveness of its small and medium-sized
enterprises(SMEs).
</P>
<P>
The aid, which comes from the European Union's structural
funds, will be funded to SMEs in Sweden's sparsely populated,
rural and declining industrial areas, the European Commission said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission, another ECU 17 million from the
Swedish authorities and ECU 14 million from the country's private
sector would also be injected into the SMEs, pushing the total
investment to ECU 48 million.
</P>
<P>
The investment is expected to help create 5,200 new jobs, train
20,000 employees and increase sales by 20 percent for 4,600
enterprises.It is also expected to put 3,000 others into new
markets.
</P>
<P>
SMEs with less than 50 staff account for 99 percent of all
Swedish enterprises and have been the main source of job creation
in recent years. Between 1992 and 1994, some 44,000 new jobs were
created in enterprises with less than 10 employees.

GUANGZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Work to build a large
thin-plate continuous cast and continuous roll project has begun
in the capital city of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The new Zhujiang Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. will invest more than
600 million US dollars in its first-phase project, importing the
first such production line from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the project in 1998, the company will be
able to produce 150 tons of hot-roll or cold-roll steel plate.
</P>
<P>
The thin plate is an essential component of containers, steel
tubing, household appliances, vehicles, motorcycles, ships, and
light industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Light industry is doing well in Guangdong Province, especially
in the Pearl River Delta, but a large quantity of thin steel plate
has to be imported.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on this type of plant was signed between China and
Germany when Premier Li Peng visited Germany in July, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Zhujiang company is one of the major enterprises of the
Guangzhou Iron and Steel Group Company.
</P>
<P>
When the new plant goes into production, the entire group will
be able to turn out two million tons of steel a year, and its
annual sales will grow from 1995's 3.3 billion yuan to ten
billion.

KATHMANDU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is holding talks with
India for a new transit route to Bangladesh through the Indian
territory, according to Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra
Lohani today.
</P>
<P>
Lohani, while answering lawmakers' questions here at the lower
house, said that the new route to the Bangladeshi port city of
Chittagong via eastern India's Phulbari was chosen as an
alternative to a former route during Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba's visit to India last February.
</P>
<P>
The former route through India's Radhikapur was found
unsuitable due to various reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a mountainous country, Nepal heavily depends on the southern
neighbor India for the transit of its imports and exports.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Supreme Leader Says US Tries to Destroy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei said that the United States is trying to "destroy the
Islamic Republic and change the Islamic system."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei was quoted by the official news agency IRNA today as
saying that the hostile anti-Iran propaganda campaign of the
United States and the Israeli regime "would not work except for
poisoning the world public opinion."
</P>
<P>
This is the first reaction by Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei to
U.S. decision on toughening sanctions against Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, accusing Iran of sponsoring
international terrorism, signed a new law Monday, threatening to
punish non-American companies investing more than 40 million
U.S. dollars in Iran's or Libya's oil and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri today also
issued a statement, accusing the United States of being "the main
backer of global terrorism" and the Israeli regime of being "the
founder of terrorism in the world."
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri noted that U.S. toughened sanctions against Iran
are "originated from weakness and ignorance because such
conspiracies have been doomed to failure."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has followed a hostile policy
toward Iran because it is determined to fight Islam's flourishing
power in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Parliament speaker noted that Iran is ready to
cooperate with international forums to combat terrorism and would
apply for a member if the United Nations form a special commission
on anti-terrorism campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Syria, Israel Differ on Basis of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that there is a gap between Syria and Israel on the
basis of peace negotiations though both sides are willing to
resume their talks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following his meeting with visiting
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in the Egyptian Mediterranean port
city of Alexandria, Mubarak expressed hope that the two sides
would reach some sort of compromise to resume their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came amid hopes that the Syrian-Israeli talks may
be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad, who arrived in Alexandria earlier today, told the joint
press conference with Mubarak that the peace process should
continue to be based on the terms of reference of the 1991 Madrid
peace conference, Security Council resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
"We heard that the Israeli premier has asked Syria to resume
the talks but he did not mention any formula that indicates hopes
in peace prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question on the so-called "Lebanon first" proposal
put forward by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, al-Assad
said that it should be "Lebanon and Syria first."
</P>
<P>
"Syria and Lebanon are taking the same steps," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu's proposal, Israel will pull out its
troops from the Israeli self-styled "security zone" in south Lebanon
in exchange for Syria's help in disarming the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah guerillas and ensuring security on Israel's northern
border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria have rejected the proposal. During
their talks in Damascus Monday, al-Assad and Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi agreed to adopt a common stand on the peace moves with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference broadcast live by the Egyptian
television, al-Assad expressed hope that peace would be achieved as
soon as possible, adding that it would be for all parties and not
for one party in particular.
</P>
<P>
Both Mubarak and al-Assad stressed that all agreements Israel
signed with the Arabs should be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the latest of a series of recent
consultations between Arab leaders to explore ways to revive the
stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad met with Jordan's King Hussein last Saturday and then
held talks Monday with Hrawi to coordinate their stances on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has been playing an active role in pushing forward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad left Alexandria following the news conference, ending his
brief visit to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> 1,600 VMs Removed from Whitehead Detention Center in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- An operation to remove about
1,600 Vietnamese migrants (VMs) from the Whitehead Detention
Center (WHDC) was completed here today, said a spokesman for the
Hong Kong Correctional Services Department (CSD).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the operation was to remove 656 VMs to
Victoria Prison pending their repatriation to Vietnam and the
transfer of about 950 VMs to the High Island Detention Center
(HIDC).
</P>
<P>
He said that the operation encountered some delay this morning
when some VMs staged passive resistance to the operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the beginning, the operation went on smoothly
with some 900 VMs packing up their belongings for the trips to
Victoria Prison and HIDC, but about mid-day, the process came to a
halt when 653 VMs staged a sit-in in their dormitories and refused
to cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 126 VMs were physically escorted out,
78 were carried out and three were restrained with plastic
handcuffs and removed, while the rest of the VMs left the camp of
their own accord.
</P>
<P>
Three CSD staff sustained minor injuries during today's
operation and a police officer was slightly hurt when he was hit
by a stone from a Vietnamese migrant, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the 656 VMs transferred to Victoria
 Prison will receive medical checks and have pre-flight
documentation before they will be repatriated to Vietnam on August
 12, 15 and 22.

<HEADLINE> Israel: No Comment on New US Sanction Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
today declined to comment on a new U.S. law that will punish
foreign businesses that invest in the oil sectors in Iran and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Fogel, director of the Government Press Office, told
Xinhua that the legislation was "an issue for the U.S. government,"
and Israel would not comment on the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
"However," Fogel said, "we, in Israel, do believe that Iran
has been involved in supporting and encouraging terrorism in the
Middle East and around the world."
</P>
<P>
Fogel also expressed his belief that the international
community should cooperate and make joint efforts in fighting
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill
imposing sanctions against foreign companies with substantial
investments in the petroleum industries of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
In signing the new law, Clinton promised to "continue to
press" American allies "to join with us in increasing the
pressure on Iran and Libya to stop their support for terrorists."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. decision has drawn sharp criticism from
France and other European countries which believed that the move
went against the principles of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that it would "create
a particularly dangerous precedent for the security and the
development of commerce."
</P>
<P>
He said France would work together with the European Union to
protect any French companies from being hurt by the law.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Continue Assault on Chechen Compound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels continued their
fierce attacks on the compound of the pro-Moscow government in the
regional capital of Grozny during Wednesday daytime.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass news agency said the separatist fighters, who had
blockaded the compound, fired grenade launchers at Russian
positions protecting it and one building was already on fire.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels had so far failed to capture the complex, which
included the office of the Russian government's representative to
Chechnya, and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Russian journalists, medical and construction workers
have been holed up in the complex since Tuesday when the rebels
began their lightning offensive against Grozny, the fiercest in
five months.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report, Itar-Tass said a column of Russian
armored vehicles was moving toward central Grozny from Khankala, a
Russian military base just outside the capital city.
</P>
<P>
A Russian official in Chechnya said Russian troops were working
on a plan to oust the rebels from Grozny and commandos had been
sent to reinforce Russian troops there.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Interior Minister Pavel Golubets said 29 Russian
soldiers had been killed and 100 others wounded since the rebels
staged their assaults on Grozny Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said casualty figures for the rebels were "two to three
times higher." But the rebels claimed they only had five dead and
10 injured.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov told Russian Television that the
raid was in retaliation for a month of Russian bombardments of
their villages and strongholds in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials estimated there were about 500 to 700 rebels
operating in Grozny, but the Chechen government estimated there
were 2,000.

FREETOWN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's student union, a
key mediator of the peace talks in the West African nation, today
tried to bring together the rebels and government delegates at
the forthcoming union meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with that," said President Tejan Kabbah in
a reply to the request made by the National Union of Sierra Leone
Students (NUSS) to allow a delegation from the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) rebels to attend the convention.
</P>
<P>
"I welcomed the idea of inviting the RUF," said the civilian
president in receiving a courtesy call by NUSS chief Ibrahim
Njai.
</P>

The week-long meeting will be held in Sierra Leone's second
largest city of Bo from August 8. But they did not say whether
the invitation has already been extended to the RUF and whether
the rebels have accepted the idea.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the government and the RUF rebels,
which has now reached the confidence-building stage, was
described as "very delicate and sensitive" as students and other
interested parties try hard to help bring about a peaceful
settlement to the five-year-old war.

at an Athens seaside resort this morning to discuss relations
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia.

The meeting, mediated by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis,

After meeting with Simitis, the presidents entered into private

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Will Not Join Sanctions on Burundi: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda will not join the
economic sanctions against its neighbor Burundi where the Tutsi
army staged a coup and toppled the legitimate government, a
report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Paul Kagame was quoted as telling the BBC in an
interview that his government would work with the military
government in Burundi to find a way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
East and central African leaders imposed economic sanctions
against Burundi on July 31 to bring down the military junta of
retired Tutsi army major Pierre Buyoya, who took over power in a
bloodless coup on July 25 and toppled elected Hutu President
Sylvestre Ntibangtunganya.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to work with the Burundi junta and help them
find a solution," Kagame, a Tutsi who doubles as defense minister
in Rwanda, said.
</P>
<P>
Kagame's line was a clear departure from pledges by Hutu
President Pasteur Bizimungu at a summit in the northern Tanzanian
town of Arusha that Rwanda would impose the sanctions against
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania, economic lifelines for landlocked Burundi
which imports its fuel and relies 90 percent on coffee and tea
for hard currency, have closed all borders, ports and airports to
the tiny central African state.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, viewed as lord of the Tutsi armies in Burundi and
Rwanda, has yet to join the sanctions package. Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni helped Kagame to power and is a key military and
political ally of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the Burundi military government gathered momentum
on Tuesday with South Africa saying it is committed to African
efforts to tighten the screws on Tutsi junta leader Buyoya.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia opposes the United
States' move punishing foreign companies investing in Iran and
Libya because this is against the principle of sovereignty,
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today.

<P>
Commenting on US President Bill Clinton's signing last Monday
of a bill aimed at punishing foreign companies investing in the
two countries, the minister said Malaysia would not accept the US
decision because as a sovereign country Malaysia had the right to
decide what was best for itself.
</P>
<P>
"The principle is that our sovereignty cannot be violated by a
law which enable the US to act as it likes for its own interests,"
he told reporters after meeting his visiting Australian
counterpart Alexander Downer who arrived here earlier today for a
four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
However, he said his ministry had no information yet on the
involvement of Malaysian entrepreneurs in Iran and Libya.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Tax Increase For Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to raise the income
tax on foreign banks before they get involved in the local
currency business on a trial basis this year, according to an
official source.
</P>
<P>
"To cope with the needs of doing business in yuan by overseas
banks, government departments are planning interim measures for
the selected banks and to raise their income tax rate," the source
said.
</P>
<P>
Differences in the income tax level of domestic and foreign
banks have long been a barrier to doing business in yuan, he said,
noting that the income tax rate at present is 55 percent for
Chinese banks, 15 percent for overseas banks in China's special
economic zones, and 33 percent for other foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, tax privileges for foreign banks should not
be retained after they are allowed to deal in the local currency,"
the official source said. "On the other, it is also improper to
withdraw all tax privileges for foreign banks, because conditions
for an across-the-board opening of the yuan business are not quite
mature."
</P>
<P>
A proper solution will be canceling the income tax privileges
for foreign banks and setting a "reasonable tax rate acceptable to
all sides" so as to meet the needs of experimenting with the yuan
business by overseas banks, the official said.
</P>
<P>
All foreign banks will be taxed at the same rate after the
period of experimentation is over and foreign banks are allowed to
do full-scale business with yuan, the official source said.

<HEADLINE> Mt. Wutai Attracts More Tourists in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Since June, over 200,000 Chinese
and overseas tourists and pilgrims have visited Mount Wutai, one
of the four sacred Buddhist shrines in China, drawn by both the
relics and the cool environment.
</P>
<P>
The popular spot in north China's Shanxi Province has seen a
more than 10 percent increase of tourists in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Local officials believe that the tourist season this year will
be half a year rather than the usual three to four months. The
mountain's hotels are usually packed in summer and empty in winter.
</P>
<P>
Officials attribute the summer boom to efforts to attract
tourists, with seven new tourist routes that combine relics with
natural beauty being offered.
</P>
<P>
The increase is also due to a new weekend tour designed for
people from neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
At 3,058 meters, Mt. Wutai is the highest peak in north
China. The other three Buddhist shrines that enjoy equal
popularity are Emei Mountain in Sichuan, Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui
and Putuo Mountain in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
"With the new routes, tourists not only see Buddhist rituals in
more than 100 temples and enjoy the natural beauty of the
mountain, but also entertain themselves in more than 20 new
Karaoke halls and have spring-water baths and a massage in modern
hotels," an official at Mt. Wutai said.

ROME, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A 150,000-dollar Ferrari sports car
went unclaimed Wednesday as rusty heroes from Atlanta failed to
shatter any world record at Europe's highest track and field meet
held in Sestriere, Italy.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in three years that the top prize on the
line for the athlete setting a world record was not awarded,
though high altitude in Sestriere was expected to help world
record attempts by sprinters and jumpers.

In the men's 100-meter dash, Canada's Bruny Surin won in a time
of 10.17 seconds with Linford Christie of Britain second in 10.29
and Nigerian Osmond Ezinwa third in 10.30.

<P>
America's Olympic 110-meter hurdles champion Allen Johnson

600 million Saudi riyals (160 million U.S. dollars) loan to Saudi
Arabia under an agreement newly signed with Saudi Methanol Company
to reinforce the facilities of the company.

This is the first direct investment loan that the Export-Import
Bank of Japan has ever made to the kingdom, according to Tuesday's
Saudi Arabian English-language daily Arab News.

Minister of Turkmenistan.
</P>

and the shortest land route between the Central Asian Republics
and the sea, "we would welcome any other routes or links which
benefit the 300 million people of the region."
</P>
<P>
He said that the whole region has huge natural resources as
well as very big consumers' markets.
</P>
<P>
"The region can have a system of several pipelines to cater to
the ever growing needs of gas, oil and other items in Pakistan,

Central Asia Republics was the best guarantee for peace and
development in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China's mineral, oil and natural
gas discoveries over the past five years have been significant.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources, more than 500 gold, silver, copper, rare earth
and other scarce mineral deposits useful for economic development
have been found over the past five years. They include 200 gold
mines and 38 silver mines.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of five oil and gas fields on the northern part
of the Tarim Basin, in northwest China, and two others in the
western part of the Tarim suggests that the region has good
prospects for oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
A number of high-yield oil and gas wells have been dug in the
East China Sea with total reserves of 2.3 million tons of oil and
19 billion cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Chunxiao-1 oil well started its trial run,
producing 1.6 million cubic meters of gas and 200 cubic meters of
oil a day.
</P>
<P>
A geological survey in Tibet and in the Badain Jaran Desert in
the western part of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, has shown signs
of oil and gas reserve.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese geologists have completed regional surveys
in various parts of China, giving them a clear idea about the
distribution of underground water and the state of geological
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have also conducted hydrologic and environmental
surveys on 150 state key projects, including the Three Gorges
Project on the Yangtze River.

CHONGQING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 60,000 overseas
tourists visited the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River during the
first six months of this year, according to statistics, an
increase of 50 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of tourists is usually down in July and
August, this year is expected to see continued growth in the
number of tourist ship guests.
</P>
<P>
Yangtze River's largest tourist ship company had over 6,000
customers in July.
</P>
<P>
Tourist officials estimate that the river, which is the longest
in China, will have a record number of tourists this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is because many people from overseas, like many Chinese,
want to see the Three Gorges before many of the scenic spots are
submerged by the huge dam," an official explained.
</P>
<P>
To pave the way for construction of the 185-meter-high dam, the
river will be dammed and the course will be changed next year.

<HEADLINE> American Specialists Arrive in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 7 (Xinhua)-- The first batch of a 1,200
American specialists team has arrived in Saudi Arabia to help
moving 4,000 U.S.troops from towns to more isolated remote base to
make them less vulnerable to terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait New Agency (KUNA), the troops would be
moved from Air bases at Saudi capital Riyadh and Dhahran to the
Prince Sultan Air Base at Al-Kharj, about 70 kilometers south of
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Five U.S. soldiers were killed in Riyadh on November 13 last
year when a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of a Saudi
Arabian National Guard Training Center while 19 airmen were
killed and several hundred others injured in a truck bomb blast on
June 25 in a U.S. Air Force dormitory area of a Saudi air base at
Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement during a
two-day visit by the U.S. Defense Minister William Perry to the
kingdom late last month which decided that 4,000 U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia would be relocated to ensure their safety against
terrorists attacks. Saudi Arabia is host of 5,000 U.S. troops
under task of protecting Gulf security.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the 1,200 specialists team consists of 300
engineers, 200 security police and 100 combat communications
personnel. Others would be air traffic controllers, weather
forecasters, fuel handlers and maintenance workers.
</P>
<P>
The movement work is expected to be completed within
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
During stages of the troops movement, the U.S. military would
supply internal security while the Saudis would provide external
security, it is understood.
</P>
<P>
Americans in Saudi Arabia have been on a very high state
of alert following the two bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, it is learnt that plans of
sending families of American troops in the kingdom back home
are also under review.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti MPs Call for Measures to Curb Visa Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti National Assembly
has called for effective measures to curb visa trading in the
country, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the parliamentarians agreed Tuesday night to
refer to the government a report made by a parliamentary committee
charged with evaluating government measures in fighting visa
trading.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the report falls short of spelling out
clear measures to fight this growing phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The committee set up earlier this year made several
recommendations urging the Kuwaiti government to continue
tightening the restrictions on all violators and intensify
inspection campaigns on commercial sites to book violators, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended reevaluation of granting visit visas to
close the door on those who enter the country under the pretext of
visit.
</P>
<P>
But it is learned that the deputies described the report as
inconclusive and indecisive which attributes the visa-trading
problem to the period after Kuwait's liberation from the Iraqi
seven-month occupation in 1991 when tens of thousands of foreign
workers entered the country.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the deputies decided to refer the report to
the government without making any decision following a heated
debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, the MPs criticized the government for being
unable to check the influx of expatriate manpower into the
country.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the fact that most of them are unskilled laborers
who entered the country with illegal visas they had bought from
Kuwaiti sponsors. One deputy cited the price of visas at 2,310
U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis accounted for 38 percent of the total population last
year, and the figure declined to 36 percent this year with the
Kuwaiti work force registered only 16.5 percent, the deputies
said.
</P>
<P>
They described this trend as contradicting the government plan
in which the Kuwaiti citizens will account for 50 percent of the
population by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
One deputy said if the situation continues, Kuwaitis will be a
minority in the country.
</P>
<P>
One parliamentarian accused some members of the ruling family
of trading visas, but Interior Minister Ali Al-Sabah categorically
denied the charge, challenging him to present evidence to support
his claim.
</P>
<P>
While criticizing the government for inefficiency in curbing
visa trading, the deputies also pointed out that many laborers,
out of fear of being deported, refused to cooperate-operate with
the authorities in providing information on visa traders.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kuwaiti government strongly denied the deputies'
accusations, saying it is taking swift measures to tackle the
problem.

<HEADLINE> Anomalous Astronomical Phenomena Predict Largest Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A series of abnormal celestial
phenomena foretold the earthquake that claimed 240,000 lives in
Tangshan, in northern China, in 1976, but the omens were ignored,
according two geologists.
</P>
<P>
In a lecture at the 30th International Geological Congress, Xu
Daoyi and Du Pinren of the Institute of Geology of the State
Seismological Bureau said that there have been serious earthquakes
in the eastern part of north China every 22 years, a cycle that
coincides perfectly with the magnetism of sunspots.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is supported by earthquake records since 1888,
when a quake hit the Bohai Sea area.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, most earthquakes near Tangshan
occur with monthly tidal high points. On July 28, 1976, the
largest tide was observed in Tanggu Harbor near Tangshan about 16
minutes prior to the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
A meteor shower in Jilin province, northeast China, four months
before the quake suggested an inauspicious future. The meteorites'
remains covered a 500-square-meter area and weighed a total of
three tons. east China's Shandong province and northeast China's
Liaoning province were also hit by aerolites at that time.
</P>
<P>
Both Xu and Du held that historic records show that a meteorite
shower always accompanied a strong earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake is not only a result of kinetic and thermal
changes in the earth's inner part, but also caused by astronomic
movements, Xu said The vicissitudes in sunspots and tides will
be the main force triggering a strong quake.
</P>
<P>
He and his colleagues also suggest that astronomy be used in
earthquake research as a new way of looking at how earthquakes
occur.

<HEADLINE> India Becomes World's Third Largest Debtor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- India has emerged as the
world's third largest debtor with an external debt of 100 billion
US dollars, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (FICCI) has said.
</P>
<P>
In a paper on export strategy and policy change during the 9th
five-year plan (1997-2002), the FICCI warned that India could head
for a debt trap if the current external repayment liabilities of
20 billion dollars are not checked.
</P>
<P>
The debt servicing liability would be 14 billion dollars and
the trade deficit would be six billion dollars in 1996-97, the
FICCI said, calling for urgent measures to face any new balance of
payments problems.
</P>
<P>
The Indian economy, it said, was bestowed with rich resources
and vast foreign exchange earnings potential to mitigate the trade
imbalance.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the country can earn one percent share in global trade
and achieve trade surplus by 2002, if the 9th five-year plan aims
at an export growth of 25 percent per annum and contains import
growth of 20 percent, the FICCI said.

<HEADLINE> American Activists Defy US Ban on Travel to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Three Americans headed for Iraq
via Jordan Monday carrying medicines for Iraqi children for the
third time in open defiance of the U.N. sanctions and an American
ban on travel by U.S. citizens to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kathy Kelly, Bradford Lyttle and Richard McDowell, members of
a group called Voices in the Wilderness, are carrying medicines
worth 8,000 U.S. dollars to be delivered to Iraqi hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The three activists risk up to 12 years of imprisonment and/or
a 1-million-dollar-fine for violating the sanctions and the
U.S. ban, but publicly challenging the U.S. policy towards Iraq,
according to today's English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that one of the most powerful protests that we
can make against the sanctions is to publicly break them by
taking urgently needed medical supplies to Iraq," said a
statement released by the group, quoted by the daily.
</P>
<P>
"The penalty for breaking the sanctions in this way can be
12 years in prison and/or up to 1 million dollars in fine,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this is a small price to pay if it
can prevent the death of even one Iraqi child," it added.
</P>
<P>
The group delivered similar supplies to a hospital in Baghdad
in March 1996 in a much publicized event.
</P>
<P>
Food and medicine are exempt from the U.N. sanctions against
Iraq, but all deliveries should have prior approval from the
U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Those without such approval are technically considered as a
violation of the six-year-old embargo.
</P>
<P>
The group said its members have already received warning
letters from the Clinton Administration but they ignored them.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said most American people remain unaware of the "tragic
affliction that continues in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Many genuinely concerned people mistakenly believe that these
cruel sanctions (against Iraq) have been at least partially
lifted, but, in fact, the U.S. has blocked that U.N.-sponsored
efforts," she added.
</P>
<P>
The three-member mission to Iraq will reportedly hold press
conferences and give television interviews while in Baghdad before
returning to Jordan on August 15.
</P>
<P>
They will also visit the offices of the United Nations
Development Fund in Amman to deliver a letter to the U.N.
reaffirming their opposition to the sanctions against Iraq,
according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to visit the U.S. embassy here in
Amman to "announce the delivery of supplies to Iraq," the
daily reported.

rate of 0.68 percent in July, bringing the inflation rate to 4.7
percent for the first seven months from 6.09 percent in the same

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Egyptian Presidents Meet to Discuss Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
is meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian port
city of Alexandria to discuss ways of reviving the Middle East
peace process and getting it resumed on all tracks of negotiation
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Egyptian summit comes within intensified contacts
currently seen by the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the Egyptian President will brief his Syrian
counterpart on the outcome of his recent talks and contacts with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and other American officials on ways
of resuming the Middle East peace negotiations, especially after
Syria has officially turned down the "Lebanon First" proposal put
forward by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Syria considered the "Lebanon First" proposal a trap intended
to keep the Syria track of peace talks with Israel away from the
Lebanese one, on the grounds that the status of the occupied
Syrian Golan Heights is more difficult and more complicated, in
addition to the fact that Israel is seeking to make of Lebanon a
meeting-point with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria had informed Jordanian King Hussein of its rejection of
the "Lebanon First" proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, the
efforts made by the U.S. through the contacts by its Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and coordinator of the Middle East peace
process Dennis Ross with both Syria and Israel have not succeeded
in persuading the two sides to resume the peace negotiations
between them.
</P>
<P>
By holding meetings with Arab leaders, Syria is seeking to
unify and coordinate the Arab attitudes toward the Israeli
"Lebanon First" proposal.
</P>
<P>
Syria is also seeking to freeze the dialogue and relations
between Israel and Arab states, linking these relations with
securing some progress in the peace process, and getting the
recent resolutions adopted at the Cairo Arab summit held in June
implemented.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- French Delegate-Minister for
European Affairs Michel Barnier said today that France has no
lesson to learn from the United States on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the France-Inter radio today, Barnier said
that France considers this act by the U.S. as a unilateral decision.
"The Americans always intend to play the role of policeman in the
world. Can the world have only one policeman to combat terrorism?
Of course not," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that one can effectively fight terrorism all
alone while taking solitary measures which could undermine
European enterprises," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that France understands that U.S. President Bill
Clinton wants to appease public opinion at home and the congress,
"but I hope that considerations for interior politics will not
take away the necessary and obligatory solidarity (among Western
countries) in fighting terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized countries and
Russia adopted 25 measures last Tuesday in Paris to combat
terrorism, which did not include economic sanctions against Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Barnier said that these measures will prove effective in
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed a congressional bill on Monday authorizing
sanctions against any foreign company or individual investing more
than 40 million dollars in energy section of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was known as d'Amato law in reference to its
main author, Republican Senator Alfonso d'Amato of New York.

BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have warned that
the excessive export of cashmere causes great losses to the
country, as the price gap between raw material and finished
products is huge.
</P>
<P>
China produced 5,000 tons of cashmere in 1995, more than half

</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 tons of cashmere is exported to the developed
nations each year at low price, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Experts urged the Chinese government to quicken the pace of the
legislation on cashmere exports.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 2,000 small and medium-size cashmere
processing factories, which need some 6,000 tons of cashmere for
raw material and have an annual production capacity of four
million cashmere sweaters, scarves and garments, the report said.

<HEADLINE> EU Fears U.S. Sanctions Law Could Hurt Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has voiced
deep concern that the U.S. legislation penalizing non-American
companies with business links with Iran and Libya would have
potentially serious implications for the security of energy
supplies to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called D'Amato law, signed by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Monday, the U.S. government will punish those foreign
companies or individuals that invest more than 40 million
U.S. dollars a year in the energy sectors of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, warned on
Tuesday that 20 percent of EU oil imports came from the two
countries and the U.S. sanctions law could affect EU oil supplies,
according to report carried in today's Financial Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
EU companies including France's Total and Elf, Repsol of Spain,
Petrofina of Belgium, Austria's OMV, and Germany's Veba and
Wintershall all have interests in one or both of the countries on
the U.S. sanctions list, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Italian companies could be among those most at risk as Iran and
Libya account for almost 44 percent of the 85 million tons of oil
imported annually by the country.
</P>
<P>
About 24 million tons are imported from Libya by Eni, Italy's
partially privatized oil company, through its production and
exploration subsidiary Agip, which has a significant natural gas
investment in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Agip produces an average of 110,000 barrels a day from its
Libyan oil fields and has plans to develop pipeline under the
Mediterranean to Italy.

<P>
Local analysts say the main issue appears to be whether funds
spent in Libya on maintaining existing investments are regarded as
"new" by the D'Amato legislation, thus restricting all such flows
to within the 40 million dollars annual limit.
</P>
<P>
There is also particular concern that the law could serve as a
precedent for future sanctions legislation, which is aimed at
curbing EU trade, the analysts added.

<HEADLINE> Levy Shuns Cabinet Meetings as Tension with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy shunned cabinet meetings today as the tension between Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the minister continued.
</P>
<P>
Levy did not appear this morning at the meeting that Netanyahu
held with senior cabinet members. He also stayed away from the
weekly inner cabinet meeting held this afternoon to discuss the
situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The latest rivalry between the two arch rivals came into
limelight early this week as the local media exposed the breakdown
of contacts between them.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu apparently tried to ignore Levy, who has not been
informed of the recent diplomatic contacts undergone by the Prime
Minister's Office. The entourage accompanying Netanyahu on his
recent visits to Egypt and Jordan also excluded any officials
from the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the two had not met since early this month,
and a regular Sunday meeting in last week was also canceled.
Unconfirmed reports said that Levy, holing up in his Beit She'an
home, was considering to resign for the second time in two months.
</P>
<P>
Publicizing his rift with Levy, Netanyahu claimed his primacy
over the peace process in an interview with Channel 2 Television
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has only one prime minister," affirmed Netanyahu,
saying he was given a mandate through Israel's first direct
election to direct the peace negotiations. He offered Levy "a
partnership," but making clear that he would lead.
</P>
<P>
The immediate issue is whether Levy will head a steering
committee on negotiations with the Palestinians. Netanyahu
indicated that the head of this committee would be someone he
trusted, but he denied reports he had decided to give the position
to Cabinet Secretary Danny Nevah.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials also complained that there was an
intention to create a "mini-Foreign Ministry" headed by
Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold, who has been active
in conducting diplomatic contacts on the prime minister's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Levy has barely acted as the foreign minister in his two
months' office, despite the fact that he held the first meeting
with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat in
late July.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear whether the latest Netanyahu-Levy rift
only centered on the peace process or something else. However,
this is the second crisis appeared in the relationship between
the two since the Likud government assumed power in June.
</P>
<P>
In early July, Levy created a crisis by publicly threatening
to resign in order to force Netanyahu to bring Likud veteran
Ariel Sharon into the cabinet. Netanyahu was strongly critical of
Levy's move, though he appointed on July 8 Sharon as Minister of
National Infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The deep-seated rivalry between Netanyahu and Levy dates back
to 1993 when the former defeated Levy and other party veterans to
become the leader of then opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Levy split from the Likud early this year and formed the new
Gesher party, citing Netanyahu was trying to implicate him over a
scandal involving Netanyahu's extra-marital affair. Levy also said
that the internal Likud electoral procedures were biased against
his supporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation by Sharon, Netanyahu forged an alliance
with Levy and Tsomet party head Rafael Eitan in a joint-ticket
agreement, that helped him win the May 29 elections.

Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, China, Hongkong and Taiwan are

The United States has agreed to endow Cambodia with the

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Fiji is keen to learn more
about Malaysia's economic planning program particularly in the
concept that economic activities were not planned in isolation,
Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the end of his three-day visit to
Malaysia, he said "it has had a very strong political
consideration as part of the overall economic development program
of your government, our own economic planners could learn from
you."
</P>
<P>
Describing his visit as "very good," Rabuka said the private
sectors of the two countries could enhance Malaysia-Fiji relations
by stepping up cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He invited Malaysians to widen their participation in Fiji's
agro-based and tourism industries or to invest in new areas like
aquaculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) left here today for Seychelles after a
five-day friendly visit to strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Madam Huan Guoying, Deputy Minister of
the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central
Committee, met with National Chairman of the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) Wilson Ndolo Ayah and other KANU officials
for talks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ayah conveyed best wishes of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,
who is also the KANU president, to the CPC delegation, saying
President Moi hoped to enhance the cooperative ties between the
ruling parties of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said President Moi was satisfied with the existing
cooperation between KANU and CPC, noting that the recent visits
to China by the KANU delegation had "cemented contact between the
two parties" and resulted in Kenya's better understanding of
China.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Huan said she was happy with the cooperation between
KANU and the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
She appreciated Kenya for its consistent support to China by
insisting on the "One-China policy" as well as in other
international affairs including the human rights issues which
have been used by some Western countries to oppose China.
</P>
<P>
Huan, who had arrived in Kenya on Saturday following her visit
to Eritrea, also made a courtesy call on Kenya's Vice-President
George Saitoti on Monday who is also the KANU vice-president.
</P>
<P>
She conveyed the kind regards of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, who is also the CPC chairman, to President Moi and
Vice-President Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti said the Kenya tour of the CPC delegation "fully
manifested the friendship between Kenya and China", reaffirming
that China is "a true friend" of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Seychelles will be the last leg of a two-week three-nation
African tour of the CPC delegation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Stresses Need for Population Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto today urged the people of the nation to help the
government in its endeavors to arrest the rapid growth of
population.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Peshawar, provincial capital of Northwest Frontier
Province, Benazir said any development initiative remained
infructuous in the face of the population growth.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that with the present speed, Pakistan's
population would touch the figure of 150 million by the year 2000
and would reach 500 million in 2060 which were alarming figures.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the population growth with that of Japan and Brazil,
she said that Pakistan was two and a half times smaller in
population than Japan in 1947, but now Pakistan was much bigger
than Japan in terms of population.
</P>
<P>
"Had we adopted the measure the government of Japan had
introduced, we would have been half the population of Japan. We
would have been a wheat exporting rather importing country and
would have achieved universal primary education target," Benazir
said.
</P>
<P>
She asked the Pakistani people to imagine as to what would be
the condition when the country's population reaches 150 million by
the year 2000, 230 million in 2020 and 500 million in 2060.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, however, listed the steps taken by the
present government for controlling the population growth and said,
in 1988 the population growth was 3.1 percent while it had dropped
to 2.9 percent as a result of various government measures.
</P>
<P>
She assured that Pakistan's population growth would be lowered
to 2.6 percent during the next few years.

<P>
GENEVA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government on Tuesday
added its voice to the criticism of the U.S. sanctions law on Iran
and Libya, saying it always opposes such measures that have
extraterritorial power, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland always opposes the laws that have extraterritorial
effect because the country stands for the simple respect of
economic liberalism," said Yves Seydoux, spokesman of the Federal
Department of Public Economy.
</P>
<P>
However, Swiss officials said they did not know of any Swiss
company threatened by the new U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has a relatively low trade volume with both Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Swiss exports to Iran totalled 204 million Swiss
francs, or about 170 million U.S. dollars, while its imports from
the country totaling 69.7 million francs.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, its exports to Libya were 82.4 million francs
while imports from the country, mainly petroleum products,
totaling 350 million francs.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Estimates Latest Flooding Loss at $1.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) said the latest flooding has caused 1.7
billion U.S. dollars loss to the country.
</P>
<P>
Calling it the "biggest floods" in a hundred years, a spokesman
for the Foreign Ministry said here today that the natural disaster
hit 117 cities and counties of eight provinces in late July.
</P>
<P>
It has "a serious impact on the livelihood of the people and
the development of the national economy and, especially, cause a
temporary food problem," the spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The economic losses caused by floods are enormous," he
acknowledged, adding that the country needed humanitarian
assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the flooding in August 1995 caused
a damage of 15 billion U.S. dollars, reduced the national output
of paddy rice and maize by more than two million tons and washed
away about a million tons of rice in stock.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he said, another hailstorm devastated 170,000
hectares of arable land and entailed the loss of more than one
million tons of grain in North and South Hwanghae Provinces.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed gratitude to the relief materials
offered by the different countries in the world, international
organizations, public organizations and individuals.
</P>

"We need humanitarian assistance from the international
community," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Concerned Over U.S. Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's European Union (EU)
Commissioner for Energy Christos Papoutsis expressed his "deep
concern" over the U.S. law aimed at imposing sanctions on
companies investing in oil and gas projects in Libya and Iran,
according to an Athens news agency report from Brussels today.
</P>
<P>
"I should like to express my deep concern over the d'Amato
Law. When it comes into force, it will create major problems for
the European oil industry," Papoutsis said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the information we have, the sanctions include
new investments and the supply of technical equipment, which means
the further development and exploitation of oil and natural gas
reserves will be affected," Papoutsis added.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also pointed out that the EU imported 80
percent of its oil, of which 20 percent from Libya and Iran, while
oil imports covered only 50 percent of U.S. requirements, which
were mainly from Venezuela, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Norway.
</P>
<P>
"We must not forget that the oil market is a world market.
Consequently, any action which affects the market should be taken
after international consultations. Any interruption of the oil
volumes coming into the world market from Libya and Iran would
have a backlash not only on prices but also on the volumes being
transacted. These two countries account for 10 percent of the
world oil market," Papoutsis went on to say.
</P>
<P>
Papoutsis stressed that the European Commission was in favor of
structured dialogue rather than trade "reprisals," particularly
when the latter were foreseen by national legislation with
international repercussions and application.

SEOUL, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean shipbuilders received
orders for 58 vessels weighing 2.11 million gross tons from
overseas during the first seven months of this year, down 39
percent from the same period last year, the Korea Shipbuilders
Association (KSA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The trend is expected to continue as long as foreign shipping
firms are reluctant to build new vessels because of trends that

possibility that the total orders this year will decline compared
with that last year," a KSA official said.

South Korea is the second largest shipbuilding country in the

million tons.

In 1995, the country received orders for 194 ships weighing
7.13 million gross tons, up 11.9-percent increase from the 6.37
million gross tons recorded in 1994.

<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad today on the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place in the Egyptian Mediterranean
port city of Alexandria, had been expected to mainly deal with the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks of the peace process and Israel's
decision to restart construction of Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs, particularly the Palestinians, have criticized
Israel's decision on settlements as an obstacle to peace and a
violation of agreements already reached between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad, who arrived in Alexandria earlier today and was
welcomed by Mubarak at the airport, is being accompanied on his
brief visit by Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, amid hopes that the Syrian-Israeli peace talks
may be resumed soon, came just four days after al-Assad met with
Jordan's King Hussein in Damascus Saturday to explore ways to
revive the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday in Damascus, al-Assad also held talks with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi to coordinate their stances on the peace
process.
</P>

Syrian Ambassador in Cairo Isa Darwish was quoted today by the
Cairo press as saying that the meeting between Mubarak and

willingness to resume peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly put forward the so-called "Lebanon
First" proposal, under which Israel will pull out its troops from
the Israeli self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in exchange
for Syria's help in disarming the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah
guerillas and ensuring security on Israel's northern border with
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria rejected the proposal. During their
talks Monday, al-Assad and Hrawi agreed to adopt a common stand on
the peace moves with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Tuesday that the
Mubarak-al-Assad meeting comes within the framework of constant
Egyptian-Syrian coordination on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has been playing an active role in pushing forward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday
night to inform him of the ongoing diplomatic efforts to push
forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

<HEADLINE> India Calls for Greater Market Access in SAARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Lok Sabha (lower house
of parliament) Speaker P.A. Sangma today urged South Asian
countries to grant greater market access to each other to
strengthen economic cooperation, the Press Trust of India said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here, Sangma said that the economic
expansion and prosperity are being hindered in South Asian
countries because of their excessive emphasis on the
"self-reliance" philosophy and consequent dependence on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
"A country needs to give access to its own market, if is to
gain access to other markets," he said at the seminar on
"Perceptions and Perspectives of India's role in SAARC (South
Asian Association For Regional Cooperation)."
</P>
<P>
Describing market access as a "two-way traffic," he said South
Asian countries with their inward looking approaches have been
losing out over the years to other countries, which have promoted
free interaction and trade with other nations.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Group o Continue Investing in Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Total said
today that it will go ahead with its program of investment in Iran
and Libya in spite of U.S. threat of economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the English-language newspaper
International Herald Tribune published today, Thierry Desmarets,
president of Total, said that the policies of embargo or economic
isolation will not bring about solution to the problems of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Desmarets said it is better to develop economic ties with these
countries in order to "increase their political maturity."
</P>
<P>
"What has become extravagant is that the United States is one
against all," he said. "We count on the government of France and
other governments to see to it that European and French enterprises
will not be affected by these laws."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a congressional bill into
law on Monday, authorizing economic and financial sanctions
against any foreign company or individual who invest more than 40
million U.S. dollars in energy section of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Desmarets said what worries France and other European countries
most is that nothing seems to be able to prevent the United States
from adopting in future new measures similar to the Helms-Burton
law and d'Amato law.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we are preparing counter-measures to allow European
enterprises to keep their freedom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Total signed in 1995 a contract worth 600 million U.S. dollars
with Iran to develop two offshore oil fields in Sirri in the Gulf,
after the U.S. government ordered the U.S. oil company Conoco to
withdraw from there.
</P>
<P>
Total is now looking for partners in the project.

zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in Southeast Asia, Alatas
said at the seminar on "ASEAN Strategies and Actions" organized
jointly by the Indonesian forum and Indonesian executive circle.
</P>
<P>
"It also constitutes another major contribution from ASEAN to

LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government said
Tuesday it is yet to be officially briefed on Cameroun's latest
territorial claim to the Lake Chad area in northeast Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The new development, which arises from the protracted dispute
over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula, is "a policy development
which only the government can handle," Nigerian Director of Defence
Information Brig.-gen. Fred Chijuka said.
</P>
<P>
Comeroun has asked the world court to "specify definitively"
the frontier between it and Nigeria from Lake Chad in the north
to the sea in the south.
</P>
<P>
Chijuka said: "If they (Cameroun) are making claim to the
area, it is government that will reply the world court where they
made the claim. They will then tell the military what to do."
</P>
<P>
Although it is yet to be officially briefed on the
development, the Nigerian government will take care of it, the
defence spokesman said, adding that "ouo duty is to protect the
nation's interest".
</P>
<P>
"We are in Bakassi peninsula today because government said
we should assert our presence. whatever their claim may be, it is
nothing to worry about. It is not anything to give the military

<HEADLINE> Radish Sprouts Probed as Cause of Japan's Food Poison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Health Minister Naoto Kan
said today that radish sprouts in school lunches were probably the
cause of series of food poisoning incidents that has sickened
6,309 school children in the country.
</P>
<P>
The radish sprouts became suspect of ill-making food after an
investigation eliminated most other potential infection sources on
the menus in different school districts served on days the deadly
E. coli O-157 bacteria apparently broke out, Kan told the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kan said traces of the bacteria were not found in samples of
sprouts at the grower that provided them to the schools, but the
possibility of infection of the bacteria cannot be ruled out by
way of epidemiological studies.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of E. coli O-157 bacteria, whose symptoms include
stomach pains, bloody diarrhea and kidney failure, has hit Japan
nationwide, killing seven people and sickening more than 9,000.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Authorities had suspected that school lunches were
the cause of the outbreak in Sakai, 480 kilometers (300 miles)
west of Tokyo, the hardest hit city. But they had not been able
to pinpoint the specific food after hundreds of tests on food
samples.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Overseas Banks Ordered to Improve Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan's central bank has ordered
the U.S. branches of the leading Japanese banks to improve their
risk management in an effort to avoid more embarrassing scandals,
said an official from Bank of Japan here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan investigated risk-management methods at the
overseas branches from late last year to spring this year, finding
weaknesses in the banks' management of securities as well as in
systems to prevent fraud in electronic transactions, an
unidentified official from the Bank of Japan was quoted as saying
on the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was conducted in response to a major scandal
involving the Daiwa Bank. In the Daiwa affair, a rogue trader at
the bank's New York branch racked up losses of 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars in unauthorized trades. Some critics blamed
inadequate risk-management procedures at Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
The Daiwa debacle was a major blow to the Japanese banking
system, which has also been hit with massive bad debts from heavy
speculative lending in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Daiwa was forced to close its U.S. operations and paid 340
million dollars in fines after pleading guilty in February for
hiding the losses at its New York branch.

HANOI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Chemical Corporation
(VCC) has turned out more than 800,000 tonnes of chemical
fertilizers of various kinds so far this year, up by 10 percent
compared to the same period last year, local press said today.

<HEADLINE> Assad Arrives in Egypt for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
arrived in the Egyptian Mediterranean port city of Alexandria
today for talks with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was expected to mainly deal with the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks of the peace process and Israel's decision to
restart construction of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian
territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs, particularly the Palestinians, have criticized
Israel's decision on settlements as an obstacle to peace and a
violation of agreements already reached between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting comes just four days after Assad met with
Jordan's King Hussein in Damascus Saturday to explore ways to
revive the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday in Damascus, Assad also held talks with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi to coordinate their stances on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador in Cairo Isa Darwish was quoted today by the
Cairo press as saying that the meeting between Mubarak and Assad
would produce positive and important results.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed
willingness to resume peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly put forward the so-called "Lebanese
first" proposal, under which Israel will pull out its troops from
an enclave in south Lebanon in exchange for Syria's help in
disarming Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerillas and ensuring
security on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria rejected the proposal. During their
talks Monday, Assad and Hrawi agreed to adopt a common stand on
the peace moves with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Tuesday that the
Mubarak-Assad meeting comes within the framework of constant
Egyptian-Syrian coordination on the peace process.

Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has been playing an active role in pushing forward the Mideast
peace process.

night to inform him of the ongoing diplomatic efforts to push
forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that by 1998 his country would be able to attain
the tax revenue target of 18 percent of the Gross National Product
(GNP).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Legislative-Executive Development
Advisory Council, Ramos said that the country's tax revenues have
moved up to 16.3 percent of the GNP at present from 14.7 percent
when he assumed office in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to reach 18 percent in 1998 which is actually
the average in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would really like to catch up with the highest performer in
tax effort like Malaysia and Singapore at 21 percent," he said,
adding that the enactment of measures under the comprehensive tax
reform program will greatly boost efforts to improve tax
collection.
</P>
<P>
The expeditious passage of the tax reform program would also
mean more money to support much-needed, much-delayed projects and
programs for the Filipino people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is expecting some 13.6 billion pesos (519
million U.S. dollars) of tax revenues this year from the tax
reform program, which is still awaiting the approval of the
congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has invited the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to a meeting slated
for August 29 and 30 in Abuja to continue the dialogue the two
sides had in London last June.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to CMAG Chairman Stan Mudenge, which was made
known Tuesday, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said his
country expects the CMAG delegation to comprise its entire
eight-nation membership and Secretary General of the Commonwealth
Emeka Anyaoku, who is Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
The minister termed the London meeting "a positive step in the
establishment of dialogue" between the two sides. It afforded an
opportunity for Nigeria to "express its concern over the unfair
suspension from the commonwealth".
</P>
<P>
The London meeting reportedly ended in a stalement, in which
Nigeria's hope for re-admission to the organization was dashed.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to CMAG is viewed as step by the Nigerian
government to soft-pedal its face-off with the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The government up to late June this year insisted that CMAG
stay out of the country until the Commonwealth reconsiders the
suspension of Nigeria from the 53-member body.
</P>
<P>
Nnigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth last November
following its execution of nine Ogoni minority activists. The
Commonwealth summit later set up CMAG to monitor compliance with
the principles of the Harare declaration on human rights in all
African member states.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Lasts Overnight in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A fierce fighting between Russian
forces and Chechen rebels lasted overnight from midnight to 5:00
a.m. local time (2000-0100 GMT) in the center and other districts
of the capital city Grozny.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax news agency reports today, the combat
began when Chechen separatists fired at government buildings in
the center of the city and the Russian Federation Army returned
shots immediately.
</P>
<P>
The rebels started a new attempt to storm the city's government
buildings at about 07:00 a.m. (0300 GMT), against which Russian
military helicopters launched missiles to attack the rebels'
positions around the town of Argun, to the east of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
During the daytime of Tuesday, hundreds of Chechen rebels had
assaulted the capital city and two other towns of Chechnya,
leaving 36 soldiers and policemen dead, and 136 wounded on the
Russian side by 9:00 p.m. the same day.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov said in an interview with
Russian Television that the assault was in retaliation for a month
of Russian bombardments of their villages and strongholds in the
southern mountains. But he declared that the Chechens still
wanted to return to peace talks and end the vicious 20-month war.
</P>
<P>
The fighting thwarted Russian attempts to hold peace talks with
the Chechen rebels and embarrassed Boris Yeltsin, the re-elected
Russian president, as he was preparing for his inauguration on
Friday.

ZHENGZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zhengzhou High-tech
Industrial Zone in central China's Henan Province has taken shape
after an eight-year effort.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the zone had approved 325 enterprises,
including 177 overseas-funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
They involved a total investment of 3.8 billion yuan and
contractual foreign investment totalling 179 million US dollars
(one US dollar equals about 8.3 yuan).
</P>
<P>
At present, the zone has enterprises funded by investors from
14 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed the success to the zone's improved
infrastructural facilities.

<HEADLINE> Fourteen Young Black-Necked Cranes Bred in Beijing Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen black-necked cranes, one
of the world's most endangered bird species, have been hatched in
the Beijing Zoo since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
An adult black-necked crane is about one meter tall and weighs
four to five kg. It has grey-white feathers, a black neck and a
red crown.
</P>
<P>
The cranes have been listed for top-priority protection by the
Chinese government. A nature reserve for the rare birds has been
set up in Longbaotan, Yushu Prefecture, northwest China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
Feng Youqian, director of the Beijing Zoo, said that his zoo
began to raise the cranes in 1963.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the zoo succeeded in breeding young cranes using
artificial insemination, he said.
</P>
<P>
The zoo currently has 38 such cranes, and has supplied ten of
the cranes to zoos in other parts of China, he said.

<HEADLINE> Astrogeological Catastrophes As Cause of Natural Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese scientists
have stated at the 30th International Geological Congress that
catastrophes caused by collisions of the earth and materials from
outer space are a source of the earth's evolution.
</P>
<P>
Such catastrophes resulted in the extinction of ancient forms
of life, such as dinosaurs and trilobites, in sudden changes in
the environment, and in the formation of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Xu Daoyi, professor of the Institute of Geology of the State
Seismological Bureau, says that the extinction of ancient forms of
life always occurred with global catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the spread of materials from outer-space and
ancient meteorite craters, the presence of iridium shows an
extraordinary increase in the mineral layers corresponding to a
boundary between two geologic eras. This means that sharp changes
in the environment are the result of collisions of the earth and
materials from the depths of space, or a dynamic supernova
explosion near the planet.
</P>
<P>
Xu's idea is supported by other two Chinese scientists
including Zhang Qingwen of the Chinese Academy of Geological
Science and Sun Yiyin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
They say that his hypothesis tallies with the results of recent
discoveries in the Cretaceous-Tertiary Era boundaries, which
corresponds to the dying out of dinosaurs and the flourishing of
mammals.
</P>
<P>
Xu and his fellow researchers say that an aerolite 10 km in
diameter fell to earth at that time, causing an increase in carbon
dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, and the death of a great
number of animals because of food shortages.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a supernova explosion dating back 10,500 years,
resulted in an increase in nitrogen density, changing the
proportion of different carbon isotopes. Human-beings are
believed to have made their first steps toward civilization at
that time.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the astrogeological catastrophe hypothesis, the
supposition that the natural evolution is driven by the inner
forces of the earth has seen little progress in past decades,
according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
"No credible geological evidence has been found supporting the
idea that evolution was caused by tsunami or worldwide chaos in
ocean currents," he added.

she could not afford three. The well-known French medical
professor Jean-Francois Mattei described the abortion as
"monstrous."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Export-Import
Bank will extend a 600 million Saudi riyals (160 million U.S.
dollars) loan to Saudi Arabia under an agreement newly signed with
Saudi Methanol Company to reinforce the facilities of the company.
</P>
<P>
This is the first direct investment loan that the Export-Import
Bank of Japan has ever made to the kingdom, according to Tuesday's
Saudi Arabian English language daily Arab News which arrived here
today.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to reinforce the facilities at which the
company produces methanol from natural gas supplied by Saudi
Aramco, the largest Saudi state-owned company dealing with oil,
through the technology provided by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Methanol Company is a 50-50 joint venture between
Saudi Arabia and Japan with a consortium of Japanese companies
led by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second expansion of the operations of the
company, which currently produces 1.27 million metric tons of
methanol per year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Japanese Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Minoru
Tamba as saying that "this significant move will make the company
the largest producer of methanol in the world."

<HEADLINE> June Sees the Biggest Fall in UK Industrial Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to figures released Tuesday by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS), total industrial production, which
includes factory output, oil and gas extraction and energy
production, fell by 1.1 percent in June, compared with a rise of
0.8 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest monthly drop since November 1992.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output in June fell 0.3 percent, and 0.5 percent
year-on-year, the lowest level since June 1993. The sector has
failed to grow for three successive quarters.
</P>
<P>
The ONS estimated for the seventh successive month that output
would remain flat in both total industrial production and
manufacturing industries, with energy production depressed by the
warm weather and activity in the North Sea constrained by
maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that with political pressures weighing
heavily on the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's mind,
the latest figures may offer him useful ammunition to argue for
another interest rate cut in the autumn.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Opposes Tougher UN Sanctions on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has reiterated that it is
opposed to imposing tougher sanctions on Sudan for the country's
failure to hand over three suspects involved in an assassination
attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has refused from the very beginning the toughening of
sanctions against Sudan," Adel el-Safty, first secretary at the
Foreign Ministry, was quoted today as saying by a local
English-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
But he warned Khartoum Tuesday that Egypt could not keep up
this stance for long, according to The Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt alone opposed the general and growing trend in the
Security Council to increase sanctions but it will not be able to
keep this stand forever," he said. "We urge Sudan to implement the
Security Council's resolutions so sanctions are not increased."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Security Council sources said Egypt was spearheading
a move to impose an air embargo against Sudan, adding to the
diplomatic and travel ban slapped by the council earlier this year
for Khartoum's failure to extradite the three men accused of
trying to kill Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The council sources said Egypt was still opposed to economic
sanctions against Sudan for the adverse effect they would have on
the Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had also rejected military sanctions because they would
hamper the Sudanese government's 13-year-old battle against rebels
in the south, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is concerned with the welfare of the Sudanese people and
wants to keep up good neighborly relations. We hope for a
reciprocal feeling from Sudan," Safty was quoted by the paper as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Raise Work-Permit Fees for Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will raise fees for work
permits for guest workers in the kingdom from 300 dinars (about
520 U.S. dollars) to 1,200 dinars (about 1,680 dollars) to further
stem the flow of foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor Abdul Hafez Shakhanbeh said the government
"is determined to halt the flow of foreign labor to create
employment opportunities for Jordanian workers," according to
today's English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign residents have increased from 250,000 in
1995 to approximately 300,000 this year, of whom nearly 30,000
are unemployed but continue to reside in the country.
</P>
<P>
Shakhanbeh said the fees for work permits will be raised by
10-25 percent for Arab laborers in agriculture, 100-150 percent
for Arab laborers in other fields, and 300-400 percent for foreign
laborers.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure access to information about foreigners in
the country, the Jordanian government has requested employers and
landlords to inform the local police station about the foreigners
residing with or working for them within 48 hours of the
foreigners' arrival in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Violators of the new regulations would pay 50-100 dinars
(70-140 dollars) fine per day," the minister warned.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would cooperate with the Ministry of
Interior through the issuance of instructions to border police
posts to enforce the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
Visitors will have their passports stamped upon entry with a
stipulation that they are banned from taking up employment in the
country and they should inform the border police officers of their
residence address during their stay.
</P>
<P>
"Violators will be expelled from the country and will be denied
re-entry," the labor minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordanian authorities accused foreign labor of
aggravating the high unemployment in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"Guest workers have noticeably increased in numbers, adversely
affecting the Jordanian labor market and aggravating the
unemployment situation in Jordan," said the minister a few days
ago.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in the kingdom stands at 15 percent
according to official figures, but analysts here believe that the
actual number would be more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, those foreign laborers without work permission, who
were classified by the Jordanian government as "illegal workers,"
were mainly from Egypt and Syria and employed in the trades which
were despised by Jordanians for its "long work hour and low pay."
</P>
<P>
The government tried hard, but in vain, to reduce the number
of foreign labor in the kingdom last year.
</P>
<P>
The authorities demanded last year that foreign workers in the
kingdom get their work permission from departments concerned or
leave the country within three months.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the new moves to curb the inflow
of foreign labors into the kingdom were aimed at easing the burden
of unemployment regarding the current conflict between the
government and the opposition parties over lifting the subsidies
on bread which the latter accused of lowering the standard of
living.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Oil Industry Dismisses US Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian oil industry sources said
today the latest sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran
will have neither short-term or long-term impact on the country's
oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian National Oil Company (NIOC) stated in a report
today that it became very clear that Iran would face no problem
now or in the future since Europe angrily reacted against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry is the pillar of Iran's economy. Iran earns
about 14-16 billion U.S. dollars by exporting crude oil and the
oil export revenue accounts for about 70 percent of the total
export income of the country.
</P>
<P>
The company report noted "it was the U.S. companies and not
Iran that suffered from the June 1995 sanction and it is going to
be even worse this time."

The company was referring to a 600-million-dollar contract for
offshore exploration at Sirri oilfields. Originally the American
company Conoco had the contract to undertake the project but
abandoned it because of a ban imposed by President Bill Clinton in

Aqazadeh claimed, "Having 92 billion barrels of crude oil
reserves, the Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the significant

To thwart American sanction, the Iranian oil industry has
announced a total of 11 oil and gas key projects worth at least 7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran had said that more than 120 foreign oil and gas companies
offered their bids in the Iranian oil and gas sector. The French

Iran is the second largest oil exporter in the world. It pumps
3.6 million barrels of oil and exports 2.5 million barrels every

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Noted Geologists From Around World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today congratulated the convening of the ongoing 30th
International Geological Congress in China, and said he hoped that
the Congress will encourage the development of geological science
in the 21st century, continuing the achievements in the field made
in this century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with a group of noted
geologists from around the world who are attending the 10-day
Congress, which opened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Extending a sincere welcome to the participants, Jiang said
this is the first time that the Congress has been convened in
China, and the third time in an Asian country since the first
meeting in 1878. He said he believed that the Congress will
promote the development of geological science through extensive
academic exchange.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental task of the geological sciences lies in
understanding the earth, and using that understanding to guarantee
the natural resources required for human existence, and also to
protect the environment, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
To make this happen, Jiang added, geological science has a
heavy and historical responsibility, and must develop into an
outstanding scientific branch. Therefore, the mission of
geologists is both difficult and glorious, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that all countries and regions have their own
respective advantages in terms of natural resources. It has become
an historical trend for all countries to conduct international
exchanges and cooperation, and to supplement each other with their
benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the geologists attending the Congress
will strengthen cooperative studies in order to advance global
geological science.
</P>
<P>
William S. Fyfe, president of the International Union of
Geological Sciences, Tatashi Sato, president of the 29th
International Geological Congress, and Robin Brett, chairman of
the Academic Planning of the 28th International Geological
Congress, spoke at the meeting, thanking China for its efforts as
host of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Fyfe defined the ongoing 30th Congress as the largest
geological congress in history, which is expected to bring the
geological sciences into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Congress focuses on looking toward the future and
settling major issues facing mankind and nature, Fyfe said, adding
that the event will provide a good opportunity for the development
of the geological sciences and even mankind.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that geologists from all countries will
make greater contributions to society after this Congress.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Song Ruixiang, President of
the Organizing Committee of the Congress and minister of Geology
and Mineral Resources, and Liu Huaqiu, director of the Foreign
Affairs Office of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Caps Phone Tapping Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indian National Congress
(Congress party) Tuesday withdrew its allegation that the
government was tapping the telephone lines of senior party leaders
and reiterated its commitment to the government of H.D. Deve
Gowda, the Financial Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The recent controversy on the phone tapping issue had posed a
threat to the relations between the ruling United Front and the
Congress party which is supporting the government from the
outside.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of blackmailing the government. We will
continue to support it for five years," a Congress party spokesman
said in response to speculations that the tapping controversy was
a Congress party strategy to browbeat the government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the party took up the matter with Prime
Minister Deve Gowda soon after reports appeared in the press that
the telephones of several leaders of the Congress party, including
that of Congress President P.V. Narasimha Rao, were being tapped.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports that Rao's house was under surveillance
by plainclothesmen.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister assured us that there is no tapping
underway. We were satisfied. Now he has ordered a CBI (Central
Bureau of Investigation) inquiry and, therefore, the chapter is
closed," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nazi Officer Refuses to Face Trial in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Nazi officer Erich Priebke on
Tuesday said he refused to be extradited to Germany and face
trials there on charges of war crimes for his involvement in a
1944 massacre in Italy, officials said here.
</P>
<P>
President of the Italian Court of Appeal Tommaso Figliuzzi
talked with Priebke for two hours in a Roman prison where he was
being held.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyer Velio Di Rezze said Priebke told Figliuzzi
that he doesn't want to be extradited to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said Priebke had said he wanted to return to
Argentina, where he had been hiding for almost half a century, but
the request was turned down by Argentine President Carlos Menem on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to extradite the former Nazi officer arose when he
was freed last Thursday by an Italian court.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Military Court ruled that a statute of limitation
meant Priebke could not be punished and declared him a free man
despite being found guilty of the massacre of 335 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, now 83, took part in the massacre on March 24, 1944,
at the Ardeatine Caves near Rome. He fled to Argentina after the
end of World War II but was extradited to Italy in November, 1995,
to face a trial which began on May 8.
</P>
<P>
The verdict sparked an explosion of anger and protests in and
outside of Italy immediately.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Minister for Justice, Giovanni Maria Flick, delivered a
request to maintain Priebke's incarceration -- a legal formality
that must be completed within 10 days when people are being held
pending an extradition request.
</P>
<P>
Germany requested to extradite Priebke as well as another
former SS officer, Major Karl Hass, who was a key witness in the
war crimes trial of Priebke, after the Roman court issued the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
Hass, now 84, admitted taking part in the massacre but was
granted immunity in the Italian trial in exchange for his
testimony.

ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister and
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) Chairman Necmettin Erbakan's
indirect dialogue with the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
has caused strong reactions in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Coalition partner and Chairwoman of the True Path Party (DYP)
Tansu Ciller said that it was out of the question for the state to
bargain with the PKK, adding that "you can not explain that to the
mothers of the martyrs."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has expressed covert support for an attempt by RP
deputy Fethullah Erbas and Islamist writer Ismail Nacar to act as
intermediaries to help end terrorism in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Nacar has urged the PKK to lay down its arms and Erbas has
called on the PKK to release a group of abducted Turkish soldiers
in a gesture of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's attempt to resolve the PKK issue has brought
uneasiness in the Turkish Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel supported the statements
issued by the Motherland Party, Democratic Left Party, Republican
People's Party, Grand Unity Party and National Action Party in
opposition to Erbakan's indirect dialogue with the PKK, which has
been fighting a 12-year guerrilla war for self-rule in

<HEADLINE> China's Industry Dragged Down Last Month By Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Production at China's industries
slowed slightly in July, due to high temperatures and severe
floods in the southern parts of the country, the State Statistics
Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said in a report that the Chinese industry turned
out 152.4 billion yuan-worth of products last month, a real growth
of 12.2 percent on an annual basis, while the sector showed a
13-14 percent growth rate every month during the past half year.
</P>
<P>
From January to July, the country's industry completed a total
of 1,058.5 billion yuan-worth of products, up 13.1 percent on a
year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The state sector grew the slowest in July at 4.6 percent, while
collectively-owned industrial enterprises grew 17.2 percent on a
yearly basis. Industrial enterprises with other forms of ownership
grew 12.6 percent. All registered drops in their development.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industry suffered more from the prolonged hot weather and
flooding than the light industries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The heavy industry completed an output value of 90.8 billion
yuan in July, 10.9 percent more than in the same month last year,"
according to the report. "The growth rate is 2.2 percentage points
down from the last year."
</P>
<P>
The report showed that light industry maintained its growth
momentum of the first half of the year, turning out 61.6 billion
yuan-worth of products last month. It grew 13.9 percent on a
yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
China's economic efficiency improved slightly during the second
quarter, according to the report. During the January-June period,
the state-owned industrial enterprises reaped a net profit of 3.5
billion yuan after losses were deducted from profits.
</P>
<P>
However, high loss volume, huge debts owed by the companies and
stockpiles of goods are still the major ailments of the state
sector.

BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua)-- A collection of ancient classic
poems and essays written during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 a.d.)
is to be published soon.
</P>
<P>
The ten-volume collection was written by Zhu Xi (1130-1200), a

of thousands of ancient and modern works relating to Zhu's
writings, particularly those in the Song Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
All of Zhu's previously-published collections were reviewed and
revised after careful comparison, identification and proofreading.

OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and defending champion
Monica Seles scored an easy 6-2, 6-0 win over Katarina Studenikova
of Slovakia in the second round of the du Maurier Open women's
tennis tourney in Montreal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The win helped the world's co-number one American avenge her
stunning defeat to Studenikova in Wimbledon last month.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who was beaten in the early rounds at the Atlanta
Olympics, needed just 55 minutes to dismiss the 33rd-ranked
Studenikova.
</P>
<P>
Seles made her triumphant return at this tournament when it was
in Toronto last year after a lay-off of more than two years
following a knife stabbing in Hamburg, Germany, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
But she has been bothered all year by a shoulder injury
suffered while winning her fourth Australian Open title in January.

Seles said this would be her only U.S. Open tune-up as she
plans to rest the shoulder over the next two weeks.

LUSAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has urged South Africa to

cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza

<P>
South Africa as an economic giant should level its trade with

The inability by South Africa to level trade could hamper
development in the region as it would be one sided, Penza warned.
</P>
<P>
South Africa controls 75 percent of the gross domestic product in
the southern African region and it exports large quantities of its
products to Zambia and other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
However, its neighbors complain that it is difficult for other
countries in the region to export products to South Africa due to
its unfair tariff protectiveness.

<HEADLINE> Palm Reading Leads to Breakthrough for Psychiatrists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- People's palms and fingerprints
may be used to diagnose schizophrenia and other mental disorders,
a group of Chinese psychiatrists announced.
</P>
<P>
The occurrence of wrinkles and creases in the palm, and ridge
dissociation in the finger and palm were much higher among
schizophrenic patients than in mentally-healthy adults, according
to psychiatrist Feng Zhiying, the head of the research group.
</P>
<P>
Since 1927, psychiatrists have been reading palms and
fingerprints to diagnose mental disease. Some believe that because
the human nervous system and skin develop together, any
abnormality of the nervous system should appear on the skin.
</P>
<P>
Feng and his colleagues, who work at Anding Hospital of
Tianjin, chose palm creases and ridge dissociation, or uneven skin
texture, in fingerprints and palms as criteria for the diagnosis
of schizophrenia. They have launched a decade-long research study
of 275 schizophrenics, using 275 non-schizophrenics as a control
group.
</P>
<P>
Feng said there is an especially high number of creases on
the palm of a person with schizophrenia, and that the wrinkles are
in disordered patterns.
</P>
<P>
Results showed that the high rate of palm creases was 11.7
percent in male and 40.4 percent in female schizophrenics, while
the control group showed only 2.3 percent of the men and 4.8
percent of the women had the tendency.
</P>
<P>
The occurrence of ridge dissociation was 12.6 percent and 3.5
percent in fingerprints and palms of male and female
schizophrenics, respectively, compared with 2 percent and 0.3
percent in the control subjects.
</P>
<P>
"These parameters may provide an important clue in the
discovery of an auxiliary diagnostic index for schizophrenia,"
Feng said.
</P>
<P>
Feng said a 50-year-old man had been mis-diagnosed as a
schizophrenic, but Feng decided that the patient suffered
from a mental disorder brought on by improper deep-breathing
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The patient's palm and fingerprints appeared normal, Feng said,
and the man was cured later after taking medication.

TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran today criticized the United
Nations for its "snail pace" in handling international political
issues that pertain to the third world.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian official report complained that U.N. Secretary-
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has not yet been informed of the
Iranian official protest letter against the United States though
five days passed since the delivery.
</P>
<P>
The Persian language daily Akhbar reported that the spokeswoman
for Boutros-Ghali's office expressed unawareness about the letter
delivered by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokeswoman Silvana Fao was totally unaware of the letter
or its content when she was asked about the U.N. chief's reaction
to the letter.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokeswoman blamed the slow U.N. postal service
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati in his letter to the U.N.
chief warned the international community of the latest U.S.
military threats against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the threatening behavior by the American
government toward Iran and urged for all necessary measures by
the U.N. chief to prevent the dangerous consequences that such
irresponsible acts by the United States could entail for the
world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, he conveyed the deep concern of the Iranian
government about the continued hostile statements of the
U.S. officials and the American policies to Iran in the last few
days.

</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Turkish Daily News today quoted a senior
official, who asked not to be named, as saying that there was
nothing in the bill signed by Clinton that concerns Turkey since
Ankara does not have any investments in the Iranian oil and gas
industry and has no plans to do so for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Despite a U.S. warning, Turkish Prime Minister and pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) Chairman Necmettin Erbakan will pay his first
official visit to Iran on August 10 since he came to power.
</P>
<P>
On Erbakan's visit to Iran, U.S. Department of State Spokesman
Nicolas Burns said Tuesday: "Such contacts would not bring any
benefits. We are following up the visit and the results with
suspicion."
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Abdullah Gul said: "We are not a state
of the U.S.. We act in accordance with our benefits and
priorities."
</P>
<P>
The warning of the U.S. has brought tension to the bilateral
relations between the U.S. and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said in his government program that Turkey will
further develop its ties with the Islamic world, especially
neighboring Iran, Iraq and Syria.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa, Zimbabwe Settle Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Zimbabwe
have finally settled a lengthy trade dispute, which caused the
tense economic relations between the two countries, a local daily
"the Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Tuesday in Johannesburg, the
Department of Trade and Industry said agreement was reached in
principle at a meeting late last week for South Africa to lower
trade tariffs on textile imports from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin and Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira, came after four years of negotiations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was held in a positive and cordial atmosphere and
marks a new phase in trade relations between the two countries,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's Deputy Director-general for Foreign
Trade Relations, Busi Gaboo, declared the forming of a joint
working group for trade investigateions.
</P>
<P>
"We only reached agreement on textiles and clothing, and the
duties will change from September 1," said Gaboo.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, tariffs on textiles and clothing, which
make up a major part of zimbabwean exports, would be cut to about
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Zimbabwe would also form the basis on which
other trade deals with Southern African Development Community
(SADC) members would be negotiated, Gaboo added.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama's Attack on Population Transfer into Tibet Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, AUGUST 7 (Xinhua) -- An anthropology professor today
debunked as "sheer fabrication" the assertion made by Dalai Lama
in Britain's Parliament recently that the Chinese government has
"moved large numbers of people into Tibet," causing Tibetans to
become an insignificant minority ethnic group in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Ma Rong, director of the Sociology and Anthropology
Institute of Beijing University, said that in truth, Tibetans
account for 95.5 percent of the total population of China's Tibet
Autonomous Region, and Han people just three percent.
</P>
<P>
"Han people really constitute a minority ethnic group in
Tibet," he said. "As a scholar, I believe irrefutable facts and
reliable data only."
</P>
<P>
Ma received a master's degree and Ph.D. from Brown University
in the United States in the 1980s. Later, he studied as a
post-doctoral student in the John King Fairbank Center of Harvard
University, also in the US.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, the central and local governments in China
began in the late 1970s and early 1980s to tighten control over
the transfer of people into Tibetan-inhabited areas. As a result,
the number of Han people moving into such areas has decreased.
</P>
<P>
Since China initiated the policy of the reform and opening up
in 1979, farmers in less developed areas in central and western
China have been moving to coastal areas to seek jobs, he
noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
In Tibet, Han people are mostly construction workers for
projects undertaken by other areas in China, he said, adding that
they are working there on a rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the 1950s, some 200,000 people from
other parts of China have worked in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Ma said that the people are university graduates, young
government officials, doctors, teachers, engineers and
technicians. After working in Tibet for several years, they will
return to their hometowns to reunite with their families.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's claim that the Tibet ethnic group has a
population of six million is "totally groundless," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The assertion by some Western media organizations that the
Tibetan population has "dropped dramatically" and that "800,000
Tibetans were starved to death" is also totally groundless and not
substantiated by specific statistical figures, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A new survey conducted by his colleagues under his guidance
demonstrates that the population of Tibetans in Tibet nearly
doubled in 42 years, from 1.15 million in 1952 to 2.23 million in
1994, rising at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that during that period, the
population of Tibetans in other areas that exercise regional
autonomy grew even faster than that of Tibetans in Tibet, rising
at an annual rate of 2.14 to 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The national population census in 1990 shows that the Tibetan
population was 4.59 million, ranking ninth among the 55 minority
ethnic groups in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to a report accompanying the survey, the rapid growth
of the Tibetan population is largely due to increased
appropriations by the central government to Tibet, that have been
offered since democratic reform was carried out there in 1959.
</P>
<P>
All social undertakings in Tibet, especially medical care, have
been growing rapidly since then, resulting in the decrease in the
Tibetans' mortality rate and a substantial rise in the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
Before 1959, the serf system inhibited the growth of the
Tibetan population; for several centuries, harsh living conditions
and unsophisticated medical services caused a decline in the
Tibetan population.
</P>
<P>
The report said that family planning was first practiced among
the Han people in 1975. Yet Tibetan workers did not take birth
control measures until 1982, and then on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tibetans in agricultural and pastoral areas are not
subject to any compulsory family planning measures.
</P>
<P>
According to Prof. Ma, the Dalai Lama has asserted that Tibet
actually includes other lands in a greater Tibetan region, which
covers the Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan-inhabited areas in
Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that this claim is neither true to historical facts nor
realistic, because the local government never administered a
greater Tibetan region, and that when Tibet was liberated by
peaceful means, the local government administered only the
present-day Tibetan Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scholars on Tibetology agree that the survey uses irrefutable
facts and reliable data to dismiss the attack on the Chinese
government by the Dalai Lama, together with a small number of
people in the West, by taking advantage of the disagreement over
the actual Tibetan population.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen more HIV/AIDS cases have
been detected in Indonesia, bringing the official number of the
cases to 420 in the country, reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new cases were detected in blood samples over a one-month
period, Hadi Marjanto, an official of the Health Ministry, said in
Bali, about 1,000 kilometers east of Jakarta, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 cases with the human immune-deficiency virus (HIV)
or the acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are
heterosexual, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three people have died of AIDS in Indonesia, according to
Health Minister Sujudi.
</P>
<P>
He said the actual number of people with HIV or AIDS in the
country could be "100 times higher than reported" because only a
small number of people have had their blood tested.
</P>
<P>
Sujudi warned that if AIDS is not properly controlled in
Indonesia, up to 2.5 million people could be infected by the year
2000, which breaks down to an estimated 150 people contracting it
every day.
</P>
<P>
"When Indonesia has 2.5 million people with HIV/AIDS, the
country will have to spend over 13 billion U.S. dollars a year to
get the epidemic under control," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali House Looks into Dispute over Sugar Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali house panel is
investigating a dispute between two ministries over 40,000 metric
tons of sugar import from India, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Public Accounts Committee under the lower house today
summoned senior officials of the Foreign Ministry and the Supplies
Ministry to attend its meeting on the controversial import deal of
Indian sugar.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose at a cabinet meeting last week when Supplies
Minister Gajendra Narayan Singh accused the Foreign Ministry of
interfering in his ministry's work on the import deal.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali cabinet meeting had reportedly decided to import the
batch of Indian sugar through the state-run National Trading
Corporation or Salt Trading Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Supplies Ministry had written a letter to
India's State Trading Corporation last month, asking it to make
the sugar deal with a Nepali private company -- Pearl Trading
Concern.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the Foreign Ministry said they had informed
the Indian side to supply the sugar to Nepal's state corporations
after receiving a letter on the issue from the Indian embassy here
in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government customarily provides certain quantities
of sugar to Nepal every year.
</P>
<P>
Secretaries of the two ministries are expected to make their
statements over the dispute at a hearing of the house panel today.
</P>
<P>
Sugar and fertilizer imports have often been sensitive issues
in Nepal, with corruption charges against officials and
businessmen involved in these deals.

<HEADLINE> India, Bangladesh to Hold Talks on Disputed Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Foreign Secretary
Faroq Sobhan is expected to arrive here today for talks with India
on three long-standing issues troubling bilateral relations -
Ganges water-sharing, trade imbalance and transit, the Indian
Express said today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that while a long-term agreement to the
contentious water-sharing problem may not be easy to come by, it
is imperative, in view of improved Indo-Bangladeshi relations,
that a short-term solution should be worked out.
</P>
<P>
While water-sharing may be Dhaka's foremost concern, India is
equally keen on transit rights for Indian goods to its North
Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
But India's request has been met with fears that providing a
transit route through Bangladesh would pose a security risk to
that country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there is a possibility that India may be willing
to sort out the water-sharing problem with Bangladesh in exchange
for a transit route for Indian goods.

<HEADLINE> White Farmers Vow to Stay in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's white commercial
farmers, uneasy with the government's land redistribution
programme, said on Tuesday they would not leave the country and
pledged to help the country's majority black farmers.
</P>
<P>
Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) President Peter Mcsporran said
his predominantly white union members accepted the need for more
equitable distribution of land.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd CFU congress, Mcsporran said farmers
could only increase productivity if they had security of tenure.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the ruling ZANU PF government and the CFU, whose
4,500 members own about 70 percent of Zimbabwe's arable land, soured
in 1992 when the land acquisition act was introduced.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, the state is enpowered to compulsorily acquire
land, mainly from white commercial farmers, for resettlement of
the largely landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
The land acquisition exercise was perceived as "racism in
reverse" and the commercial farmers turned to the international
community for support.
</P>
<P>
The government, riled by the invitation of outsiders, told the
farmers to leave the country if they wished, reiterating it would
not abandon the resettlement programme until the people presently
crowded on parched land were moved to better areas.
</P>
<P>
"We are not planning to leave, we are not expatriates nor are
we all white," said Mcsporran.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Intensifies Water, Soil Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The densely-populated east China
province of Zhejiang, which has more mountains and less farmland,
has developed effective measures to prevent soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
New regulations by the provincial government stipulate that
farming is forbidden on any mountainous area that has a slope
above 25 degrees, or in places with a slope of over 20 degrees
that directly face reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation and tree-planting will soon resume in these hilly
areas where farming previously has been conducted.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, future resource development and
project construction must be carried out simultaneously with water
and soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's mountains and hills make up 70 percent of its total
area of 100,000 sq km. Per capita arable land stands at only 0.03
hectares, or 47 percent of the national average or 16 percent of
the world's average.
</P>
<P>
The local ecological environment has been seriously damaged in
recent years due to natural disasters, and also the deterioration
of land caused by farming, lumbering and mining.
</P>
<P>
Remote-sensing census by the Ministry of Water Resources shows
that soil-eroded area in Zhejiang has exceeded 20,000 sq km,
one-fourth of the province's total area. The annual amount of soil
washed away stands at 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Serious soil erosion has weakened the fertility of more than
800,000 mu (48,000 hectares) of farmland, and also led to the rise
of the river beds of eight major river systems in the province. A
group of harbors and river courses cannot let ships pass due to
increasing layers of mud.
</P>
<P>
To curb soil erosion, the Zhejiang provincial government
launched a tree-planting campaign in 1989. By 1994, the province
had planted trees on more than 12 million mu (720,000 hectares) of
mountainous areas.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Makes Headway in Transportation Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A modern transportation network,
including highways, railways, air and sea routes, is making life
easier for travelers in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, bordered by the East China Sea, has maintained rapid
economic growth rates over the past few years, but unsophisticated
transportation facilities have severely limited the circulation of
goods.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the provincial government is working to develop
infrastructure facilities by attracting heavy investment from
China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
New highways totaling 4,000 kilometers have been built in the
province over the past five years, bringing the total length of
highway in the province to 34,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of the villages and townships in the
province have access to highways, a rate higher than the country's
average.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou-Shangyu expressway, the first of its kind in
Zhejiang, is an example of the province's determination to boost
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the province has opened to traffic three trunk
railway lines, which have effectively eased the overloaded railway
system.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Hangzhou Railway Administration said that
efforts will be made to increase the speed of many passenger
trains, as well.
</P>
<P>
Newly-built airports in Ningbo, Wenzhou, Yiwu and Quzhou have
increased the number of air transport facilities to six, bringing
its air routes to more than 100.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang now has 58 harbors with more than 600 berths, and
navigation courses that link the province with 300 harbors
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The 200,000-ton Beilun Harbor is the largest mineral shipping
base in the country, and the 200,000-ton oil harbor in Zhoushan
makes Zhejiang the first province in the country that can berth
super oil tankers, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Becomes Second-Largest Investor in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan has replaced the United
States to become this year's second largest investor in Shanghai,
China's economic powerhouse, next to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
From January-July, Japan poured nearly 1.2 billion US dollars
into Shanghai, a 38 percent rise over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has invested more than 19 billion US dollars in
Shanghai, and has more than 6,300 projects in China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-month period, Hong Kong's investment in
Shanghai rose 30 percent over the same period in 1995, surpassing
2.5 billion US dollars, and accounting for nearly 40 percent of
total overseas investment in the city during that time.
</P>
<P>
Countries that invested more than 100 million US dollars into
the city during the period include the US, Singapore, the Republic
of Korea and the UK.
</P>
<P>
During the seven months, the city gave the go-ahead to nearly
1,200 overseas-funded projects, attracting overseas investment
from 37 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Contracted Workers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of contracted and
temporary workers in China has increased by 3.74 million, up 6.1
percent, to hit 64.7 million in the past six months, the State
Statistics Bureau said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This means that there are 24.56 million more contracted workers
in China, up 61.2 percent over the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this indicates the country's employment
structure is moving in a positive direction, and serves as a sign
that the planned economy is shifting to a market economy, as the
number of fixed workers is declining.
</P>
<P>
Contracted workers presently account for 44 percent of the
total number of workers in China, up 16.6 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers in enterprises which have implemented the
contract system accounts for 88.7 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
As for the working format, there are nearly 135 million
long-term workers, a decrease of 720,000 over the same 1995
period, while the number of temporary workers is 11.9 million,
1.04 million more than were reported last year.
</P>
<P>
By May, labor departments in China had investigated 5,270 labor
cases; 4,667 have been settled.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 100 million workers, including 22.41 million
retired people, are signed up for a nationwide pension plan.
</P>
<P>
In the past, a job as a fixed worker, rather than a contracted or
temporary worker, was regarded as secure employment.

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras needed
only 57 minutes to fight off unseeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland
6-3, 6-4 on Tuesday, sailing into the third round of the 2.2
million U.S. dollars ATP Championship in Mason, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
But Jim Courier was not as fortunate as his fellow American
Sampras, overcoming a hard-hitting Greg Rusedski of Britain 6-7
(3-7), 6-3, 6-4 after two hours and 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, also the world's top-ranked player, said he was
pleased with his performance after having taken five weeks off
since his quarterfinal loss at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Rusedski, who eliminated Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen
on Monday, shocked Courier with his powerful serves in the first
set of the second round match, which took 56 minutes and was
forced to a tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
But the eighth seeded Courier battled back to win the next two
sets with aggressive service and crafty groundstrokes as
Rusedski's serve faded.
</P>
<P>
Courier, the world's eighth-ranked player, has beaten Rusedski

<HEADLINE> Creatures From the Deep Photographed in Tianchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- If they're lucky, tourists to
Tianchi Lake, a famous scenic spot in northeast China, can look
out from the peak of Changbaishan mountain and see mysterious
animals swimming in the lake below.
</P>
<P>
Some have compared the creatures from the deep to dinosaurs or
buffalo. Others say the strange beasts look like huge iron pots.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, photographer Wang Ying captured on film the
activities of four of the unidentified critters swimming in the
lake.
</P>
<P>
Chai Jingguo, head of the Changbaishan Tianchi Mysterious
Animal Research Association, said that Wang has been monitoring
the things since last summer.
</P>
<P>
Early that morning, Wang went to the lake's nearby Tianwen Peak
and waited for them to appear. At 8:30, he spotted several black
figures moving in the water. He counted four, floating and diving
leisurely, sometimes splashing waves one or two meters high.
</P>
<P>
They swam for several minutes and returned underwater. Wang
photographed their actions for 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 tourists witnessed their appearance, and said
they had never seen such creatures before.
</P>
<P>
The research association is a non-governmental organization,
founded several years ago by Chinese government officials, tourism
officers and journalists, and a number of people from South Korea,
Japan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the association and the Administration Bureau of
the Jilin Changbaishan Natural Reserves jointly set up a station
to observe the mysterious animals, and invited Wang to participate
in a professional capacity.
</P>
<P>
Tianchi is a border lake between China and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. It has a water surface area of 10
sq. km. and an average water depth of 204 meters,
</P>
<P>
It is the largest volcano lake and the deepest mountain lake in
China.
</P>
<P>
Many people doubted the existence of the mysterious creatures,
though local government records showed sightings of unidentified
animals at the beginning of this century.
</P>
<P>
In past decades, hundreds of people claim to have seen the
strange creatures in Tianchi. Recently, people have photographed
the animals, but their shots were taken from the top of the
mountain, more than 1,000 meters above the lake, and only small
portions of the animals' bodies were visible.
</P>
<P>
Chai said that according to the historical records and
tourists' descriptions, the animals are most likely to appear
between June and September.
</P>
<P>
The association plans to organize a scientific inspection tour
in August to explore the myth of the strange creatures.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses US of Sponsoring State, International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati launched a war of words against the United States,
accusing it of sponsoring state and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
While addressing Iran-based diplomats here Tuesday, Velayati
said that "the United States is the sponsor and initiator of state
and international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
All Iranian newspapers and dailies today carried Velayati's
statement in front-page as a strong reaction to the latest
sanction bill signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the relations between the United
States and Iran will be getting more strained and the American
forces will launch an attack against Iran if the United States
finds any evidence of Iran's involvement in any terrorist
attacks against it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the tougher American sanctions against Iran, the
Iranian foreign minister said, "Washington did not have the
competence to pass judgements on important international issues."
</P>
<P>
By adopting hostile attitudes and adopting rules which allow
intervention in the internal affairs of other countries by the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), he noted, the United
States has practically interfered in Iran's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dangerous sign that the U.S. Congress has been turned
into a center for legitimizing illegal steps. This proves that
the U.S. policies are biased and hegemonic," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. failure in compelling other countries to
obey its international regulations, he said, "this measure has
been categorically rejected by the international community."
</P>
<P>
He said Washington's adventurous policies were particularly
against those countries with which the White House had serious
differences of view and approach.
</P>
<P>
"The policies will entail dangerous repercussions on future
international relations," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the baseless and irresponsible charges against
Iran that it supports terrorism and tries to gain access to
weapons of mass destruction, and the threat of using force against
it -- all taking place in violation of international rules and the
United Nations Charter -- were being raised amidst the
presidential election campaign in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Velayati reiterated that Iran condemned terrorism in all its
forms. "We believe that resolving this international dilemma
requires the cooperation of the international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran had made some proposals for the creation of a
comprehensive and non-selective universal mechanism to combat
against terrorism, he said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand First said today
it will allow foreigners to buy outright local companies of
non-strategic nature if it is elected to govern the country.
</P>
<P>
Party leader Winston Peters told the Wellington Chamber of
Commerce that the party has amended its foreign investment policy
so the 24.9 percent limit placed on overseas investors applied
only to strategic assets.
</P>
<P>
Peters came to prominence early this year for his stance
against foreign immigration, Asian migrants in particular, and
against foreign investment in NZ.
</P>
<P>
But during a visit to London last month, he amended his
position on foreign investment. Today's statement is a
reaffirmation of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
"Those strategic assets include telecommunications, utilities
such as electricity and gas companies, ports, transport companies
of importance like Air New Zealand and so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peters announced that his party will release a full list of
assets covered by the 24.9 percent limit close to the election.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First will stop state asset sales and legislate to
stop land sales to foreigners, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The government's success in
reducing inflation to record lows has raised fears that the
economy could be heading for a slowdown, an English-language
investment paper says.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has fallen sharply from an annualized 20 percent in
July 1995 to 2.6 percent in July this year as the government has
kept a tight grip on the money supply through high interest rates,
a squeeze on bank loans and low grain prices.
</P>
<P>
But monthly inflation has been negative since May and falling
consumer prices are now leading to fears that the economy could
stagnate, according to the Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
"Too low inflation is something unusual that needs careful
attention or it can adversely affect the country's production,"
the paper quoted Le Xuan Trinh, chief of the government office, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Although officials have welcomed the fall in inflation for its
stabilizing effect on socio-economic development, the paper says,
some fear the economy will cool down too much.
</P>
<P>
An official from the state bank was quoted as saying that
negative inflation is not a good sign for the economy as it
indicates stagnating production.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is cooling down and there are fears that supply
will exceed demand, causing gluts of some good," the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, Tran Zuan Gia, deputy minister of planning and
investment, said that although some sectors of the economy may be
affected, he did not believe the country's overall production
would suffer.
</P>
<P>
This summer's negative inflation rates are likely to have a
knock-on effect on next year's price index, Tran Xuan Gia said.
Since inflation rates are calculated on a percentage basis, low
prices this year may inflate the percentage price rises in the
index next year, leading to higher inflation.

BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese urban residents enjoyed
an improved quality of life during the first half of this year,
the State Statistics Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1996, the average per capita
expenditure of the urban dwellers was 320 yuan (about 38.5 US
dollars) per month, up 2.9 percent in real terms over the same
1995 period, according to a sample survey of 36,000 households
conducted by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the urban residents spent 159 yuan on
food per capita each month, an increase of 1.6 percent over
Jan.-June of last year; and 48 yuan on clothing, a rise of five
percent.
</P>
<P>
Each of them spent 12 yuan monthly for education expenses, and
6.7 yuan on entertainment, increases of 14.7 and four percent
respectively over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction said it will provide better water,
gas and public transport services for the people in 36 major
cities.

NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya President Daniel arap Moi

team in the just-concluded Olympic Games in Atlanta, U.S.A.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Yield in Bulgaria Drops Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The wheat yield of Bulgaria this
year has been the lowest over the past ten years, a senior
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Dimo. Wzinov, vice minister of the Agriculture Department, told
a news conference that the wheat yield this year dropped
drastically, which is the first time that Bulgaria has experienced
for ten years.
</P>
<P>
The yield is expected to reach at most 1.9 million tons this
year, accounting for only 35 percent of that in 1990, according to
the ministry. Little fertilizer, bad climate and the increase in
deserted land are responsible for the serious situation.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria needs 1.6 million tons of wheat this year. The
government can only purchase 1 million tons from the farmers and
the country have no choice but to import the rest 0.6 million tons
of wheat from the United States and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Help Ningxia Develop Solar Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the Israeli
Energy Ministry have agreed to cooperate with the Environmental
Protection Bureau of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region to develop solar energy.
</P>
<P>
The first group of proposals includes forming a Sino-Israeli
center to expand the use of solar energy in the region, and
developing an energy-efficient solar water heater, which would be
especially suited to sunny north China.
</P>
<P>
With reserves of coal, oil and gas, Ningxia is one of the
country's major energy production centers. But the use of
chemical-petroleum has caused serious pollution in many parts of
the region, including the capital city of Yinchuan.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that a quick way to settle the problem is to
replace the chemical energy with solar energy.
</P>
<P>
The region has a large potential for solar energy, with 3,000
hours of sunshine a year and more than 140,000 calories of
radiation energy per sq cm.
</P>
<P>
All previous experiments on the use of solar energy have
failed, due to the lack of advanced science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with Israel should lead to better results, regional
officials believe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Anti-Iran, Libya Law Condemned Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- More countries worldwide have
joined Europe in the condemnation of the United States for its new
legislation punishing those who maintain economic relations with
Iran and Libya, reports reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 15-member European Union's (EU) collective
rejection, France, Germany, Britain, Russia, Japan and other
countries have protested individually against the law signed by
U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which came after bombing attacks
in Saudi Arabia in June and Atlanta in July, and the explosion of
TWA Flight 800 in July, would panelize non-U.S. companies
investing more than 40 million U.S. dollars annually in the two
countries' energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government accuses Iran and Libya of sponsoring
terrorism, although investigations of the cases have reached no
conclusions so far.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Couriaux
warned that his country would not stand idly by while its
interests are affected.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned of
possible European retaliation, saying, "the U.S. intents and laws
contradict the bases of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ... we
will not accept them."
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Guenter Rextod said, "the threat of
extra-territorial sanctions against European companies ... is not
the right way to fight the growth of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement: "We agree that
there should be a common Western policy ... but we cannot accept
U.S. pressure on its allies to impose sanctions under the threat
of mandatory penalties on our companies."
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Leon Brittan said in Brussels that the regional
alliance "will act to defend its rights and interests if they are
jeopardized." Iran and Libya together provide a fifth of all
crude oil imports to the 15 EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, the Foreign Ministry said, "we need coordinated
practical measures to improve anti-terrorist cooperation ... not
unilateral steps."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Foreign Ministry, describing the legislation as
possibly "inconsistent with WTO rules," said Tuesday that the
U.S. sanctions are "regrettable."
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Ministry refuted the U.S. law
promoted by Senator Alfonse d'Amato, saying it violates
international trade regulations and is "doomed to failure."
</P>
<P>
"The world community ... is aware of Clinton's intention to
monopolize the world's energy resources and markets and does not
believe his false charges," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Libya also condemned the U.S. law as self-defeating and
selfish. "This measure ... reveals America's selfish reasoning,"
the official news agency JANA said.
</P>
<P>
The law "has damaged and will further damage the American
people's interest and those of its allies," it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government banned last year private investment in Iran
and Libya, but U.S. companies have since complained that their
foreign competitors have rushed to fill the vacuum left by the
American pullout.

The report said a severe drought has stricken 35 villages in
Banjarnegara, a mountainous western regency in the country, where
villagers complained about increasing difficulty to obtain
drinking water over the past month.
</P>

The official said that drinking water is being transported in
trucks to the drought-affected areas by special teams, which have
been set up by Central Java Governor Soewardi to handle the water
crisis.

suit a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Ambil had agreed to a request by MNLF general
Abdul Sahrin for an extension of the deadline up to midnight.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said the
presidential palace would not treat the occupation of Limaong by
the MNLF rebels as a violation of the ceasefire agreement between
the government and the Muslim secessionist group.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MNLF downplayed the incident by claiming
it was a simple case of misunderstanding. The two sides stressed
that the incident had no effect on the upcoming signing of a
formal peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Torres Monday announced that the formal peace pact was expected
to be signed in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta by the third or
fourth week of the month.

<HEADLINE> 2 Thai Banks to Form Joint Ventures in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Two Thai banks have agreed in
principle to form joint ventures with two Myanmar private banks,
the New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Finance and Revenue Brig. Gen. Win Tin
made the disclosure here Tuesday at a signing ceremony of a
memorandum of understanding between Bangkok-based Loxley Myanmar
Co. Ltd. and a Myanmar private bank -- Asia Wealth Bank Ltd. -- on
issuing the Smart Card in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture banks are to be formed between the Thai
Farmers Bank and Myanmar's Asia Wealth Bank and between the Thai
Siam City Bank and Myanmar's May Flower Bank, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The eventual formation of the first two joint venture banks
between foreign banks and Myanmar private banks signals Myanmar's
entry into the second phase of its financial reform, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, in the first phase
of the reform, the Myanmar government has granted the operation of
20 private banks in the country and the establishment of 39
foreign bank representative offices as of the end of March this
year, including six Thai banks.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Runner-up Bruguera Falls in ATP Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Sergi Bruguera, who
just won the silver medal at the Atlanta Olympics, suffered an
opening round defeat at the 2.2 million dollar ATP Championship in
Mason, Ohio, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, who went to the event straight from Atlanta, was
beaten by Patrick Raptor of Austria with 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Raptor's serve-and-volley attack proved too much on the
hardcourt for the Olympic-drained Spaniard, who had won all five
of his previous matches against Raptor though.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's other actions, the 11th seed American MaliVai
Washington rallied after being broken twice in the second set and
edged France's Guillaume Rauox 6-4, 7-5, while the ninth seed
Wayne Ferreira of South Africa ousted Belgium's Filip Dewulf 6-2,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
France's Cedric Pioline, now seeded 14th, surged back from
one-set deficit to outpoint Australia's Sandon Stolle 2-6, 6-3,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
Also, Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine outlasted Martin Damm of the
Czech Republic 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), and Swedish veteran Stefan Edberg
rolled over Italy's Stefano Pescosolido, 6-2, 6-1. Sweden's Jonas
Bjorkman downed Renzo Furlan of Italy, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday signed into law a bill to finance federal investigations
into the wave of arson fires at black churches in the South.
</P>
<P>
The new law provides 12 million dollars to support the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' investigation into the church
burnings which are widely believed to be racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has more than 100 agents investigating church fires
which have been reported in at least 40 predominantly black
churches across the south east over the past 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's signature kept a promise he made in June when he

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Listed Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to increase the
number of its listed companies in the next five years, bringing
the market value of all publicly traded stocks to 15 percent of
the nation's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
But the increase in exchange-listed firms should be based
on the demand for capital and market capacity, today's "China
Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
An association of listed firms has been established to guide
their operations, according to a report of the State Commission
for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The report said the country should also issue more State
treasury bonds and increase their varieties, especially one-year,
three-month and six-month issues. And outstanding bonds should not
exceed 20 percent of the country's yearly fiscal revenues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secondary market for State treasury bonds should
be expanded and increased to ensure smooth trading, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed developing investment funds and gradually
increasing institutional investment, to help attract larger
amounts of idle funds to markets that tend to produce quick
returns.
</P>
<P>
The report said the country must speed up the creation of laws
and regulations to govern investment funds.

<HEADLINE> WFP Concerned Over Famine Victims in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program is concerned
that sanctions imposed on Burundi by its neighboring countries are
preventing humanitarian relief from entering the country and
threatening the well-being of hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
WFP was also worried that the cut-off of emergency food,
medicine and fuel supplies could exacerbate ethnic tensions in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were agreed upon by African leaders at the Arusha
Summit on July 31.
</P>
<P>
"Unless key neighboring countries allow emergency supplies to
enter, the situation is likely to worsen," said WFP spokesman
Trevor Rowe. "This will force WFP to find other more costly
alternatives to deliver food."
</P>
<P>
Currently, WFP estimates it has a one-month stockpile of
emergency supplies in Burundi for an estimated 300,000 people. A
key problem is that once transport operations are shut down, it
requires a long time to restart them. Trucks and drivers must be
found again and contracts renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation continues as it is, we'll probably have to
begin seriously worrying in a matter of a couple of weeks because
it will be more difficult to replenish existing stocks," said Rowe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WFP is concerned that the Kenyan government today
denied the organization the right to fly its King Air passenger
aircraft to Kenya from Burundi. The move is expected to make it
more difficult for WFP personnel and cargo to transit through
Burundi.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Green Peace, an
international environmental pressure group, today protested
U.S. dumping of radioactive waste in the state of Texas, which
borders on Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Lopez, a spokesman for the group, said the toxic waste
dump in Sierra Blanca, Texas, poses a threat to the health of both
U.S. and Mexican citizens.
</P>
<P>
The radioactive waste dump is only 32 kilometers from Mexican
territory and therefore could affect aquifers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Green Peace members today gathered before the main gate of the
U.S. Embassy in Mexico to protest over the dumping of the
radioactive waste.

<HEADLINE> First Fibre-Optic Cable in Tibet to Be Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The construction of the first
fibre-optic cable linking Tibet and other parts of China will soon
be started and is expected to be finished in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The planned Lanzhou-Xining-Lhasa fibre-optic cable, the most
difficult of its kind in the country, will be built on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the "roof of the world" about 5,000 meters
above sea level, today's "China Daily" quoted sources from the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Now telephone links between Tibet and other parts of China are
routed through satellites and microwave stations. And there are no
fibre-optic cables so far in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The cable, extending about 30,000 kilometers, will be designed
and built by the China International Telecommunications
Construction Corporation (CITCC) under the MPT.
</P>
<P>
China now has completed 22 major cross-province fibre-optic
cables linking most provincial capitals except Lhasa, capital of
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Four major fibre-optic cables are expected to be finished by
the end of this year, linking Beijing-Taiyuan-Xi'an,
Shanghai-Hefei-Nanjing-Wuhan, Beijing-Jiujiang-Guangzhou, and
Beijing-Huhhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou, respectively.
</P>
<P>
And contruction on another seven cables will be launched
between September and December this year, expected to be completed
in the second half in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Austria Condemns U.S. Sanctions on Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Austria today blasted a new
U.S. law punishing foreign firms investing in Iran and Libya,
saying the hardest hit would be small nations doing business with
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Austria "rejects the unilateral U.S. measures" on a third
country and has taken "very serious diplomatic measures" against
them, Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel said after a ministerial
council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the European Union (EU) criticized the legislation,
which, signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday, provides
for a range of sanctions against foreign companies investing 40
million U.S. dollars or more a year in the oil or gas industries
of the two countries.

Schussel accused the law of eroding the fruit of world trade
negotiations. He estimated the loss of Austrian business alone at
billions of Austrian schillings (hundreds of millions of dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU, which receives a fifth of its oil supplies
from Iran and Libya, is worried about the long-term impact of the
law and said it is considering retaliatory measures.
</P>
<P>
Though somehow hopeful of a switch in the U.S. policy amid
protests by its allies, Schussel said he is concerned that smaller
nations, which are unable to take revenge, would suffer the most
if larger powers choose not to fight back.

<HEADLINE> NATO Agrees to Help Probe 1980 Italian Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO has agreed to help Italy
investigate a mysterious 1980 air crash off the Sicilian coast in
which 81 people died, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Italian media have long speculated that the plane was
accidentally shot down by a NATO missile and the Italian
government has repeatedly called the military alliance to release
secret radar charts relating to the crash.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Romano Prodi Tuesday welcomed the decision of
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana to set up a committee to
investigate the crash and to study relevant radar charts, a
government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Investigating Judge Rosario Priore also hailed the decision,
saying that he was looking forward to unraveling the cause of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened on June 27, 1980, near the tiny island of
Ustica, some 60 kilometers north of Sicily, when an Itavia
domestic airline DC-9 crashed, killing 81 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The committee, consisting of three NATO experts -- one legal,
one security and one military, is expected to meet Italian
investigators later this month, diplomatic sources said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua To Take Dispute With Colombia to Hague Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Ernesto Leal said Monday that his country is considering going to
the International Court of Justice in the Hague to resolve a
territorial dispute with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Direct talks between the two countries on the sovereignty of
the Caribbean islands of San Andres and Providencia are breaking
down, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If this mechanism loses effectiveness, we are going to be
forced to go to the Hague," he said.
</P>
<P>
He had sought dialogue over the two islands off the east coast
of Nicaragua with former Colombian Foreign Minister Rodrigo Pardo
Garcia-Pena, who resigned in early July, Leal added. But, to date,
the most he got was a meeting that bore no fruit, he declared.
</P>
<P>
Leal did not reveal the date on which his government will
submit the dispute to the court.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute has been intensified after Colombia
included the two islands as Colombian territory on a map.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua insists that both islands belong to it and considers
null and void the 1928 Barcenas Meneses-Esquerra Accord, which
ceded the islands, together with other large islands, to
Colombia.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Fresh from its best performance
in 100 years, the Greek Olympic team returned here Tuesday evening
to be greeted by tens of thousands of Athenians.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the welcoming party featuring fireworks at
Panathenian Stadium, Prime Minister Costas Simitis highly praised
the achievements that the Greek athletes made at the Olympic Games
at Atlanta, the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Your victory for all of us is a great lesson, showing
that nothing is conquered without toil; that nothing is won
without sacrifices; that nothing is consolidated without effort;
that nothing is ensured without outdoing ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
Greece made its best ever modern Olympic showing at Atlanta,
winning four gold and four silver medals. Five other clinched
fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Greek weightlifters Pyros Dimas and Akakios Kakhiashvili won
gold medals, along with Yiannis Melissanidis in gymnastics and
Nikos Kaklamanakis in the men's yachting event.
</P>
<P>
The weightlifting team also won three silver medals and Niki
Bakoyianni took the other silver in the women's high jump.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving at the stadium, the motorcade stopped by the
Temple of Zeus, where the eight medalists were awarded the ''Gold
Medal of Honour'' by Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos.
</P>
<P>
All the Olympians who finished among the top eight in their
respective events then proceeded on foot to the packed 80,000-seat
marble stadium, where they were greeted by Greek President Kostis
Stephanopulos, Prime Minister Simitis, ministers and almost all of
the nation's political leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Flag-waving fans lined the road from the airport to the
stadium to welcome the athletes, who displayed their medals from
atop the military jeeps they rode.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Declare 24-hour Strike in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 250,000 teachers
in Colombia went on a one-day nationwide strike for higher pay
today, leaving eight million students without classes.
</P>
<P>
The president of the National Federation of Teachers Boris
Monte de Oca said the strike is intended to force the government
to negotiate and change its proposal for a 13 percent
salary increase for state workers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had given a commitment to Colombians
through its social leap policy to improve living standards for
low-income families. But the reality had demonstrated the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
A 13 percent salary is of no use when inflation this month is
already 15.5 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' strike is also a protest against the government's
economic policies and U.S. meddling in Colombia's internal
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Negotiate Concession of Ports With Bolivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chile is willing to negotiate
with Bolivia on the concession of its ports for trade purposes but
not on a sovereign corridor, Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza
said today.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia "is not talking, precisely, about a corridor but rather
about a concession for trade purposes and we are always willing to
examine things like that," the diplomat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has stated its "full willingness to
discuss the topics related to Bolivian access to Chilean ports on
the Pacific," the Chilean minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is ready to deal with Bolivia about trade
integration and to examine the formulas that would resolve
problems concerning better development of investments, but not to
tackle the issues of a Bolivian outlet to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
He said that "this is a matter that has to do with integration
and it does not mean re-opening or re-examining past issues."
</P>
<P>
Insulza added that Chile is willing to review neither border
nor sovereignty issues with Bolivia because it has no border
problems pending with the neighboring country.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma, Yeltsin May Meet Over Fleet Issue: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukrain has suggested that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma meet
on Friday to try to solve the continuing row over the separation
of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said this at a
press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the Ukrainian and Russian navies over the
ownership and use of Sevastopol in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula as a
naval base for the fleet has become an obstacle in the development
of bilateral relations and is blocking the signing of a friendship
treaty between the two countries, Udovenko said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who held talks in Moscow on the issue last week,
said Ukraine believes the bilateral agreement will be conducive to
solving existing problems, but Russia wants to solve the issue of
the Black Sea Fleet first before signing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, in the latest twist in the long-running dispute over
the Black Sea Fleet, the commander of Ukraine's naval forces
accused his Russian counterpart of not taking the issue seriously.
</P>
<P>
Navy chief Vladimir Beskorovainy threatened to annul his
signature on some of the documents concerning the second phase
separation of the fleet after inspecting the 54 warships due to be
transferred to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
He said the vessels were too old and useless and said Ukraine
should renegotiate the deal.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and
Russia have been trying to agree on how to divide the 300-vessel
Soviet Black Sea Fleet based in Sevastopol and on ownership of the
port.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries agreed to split
the Black Sea Fleet in two phases. The first phase was completed
in late March.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, dealing with the separation of the remaining
warships and support vessels still moored at Sevastopol, was due
to be completed at the end of May this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The summer's unusually heavy
rainfall may not be over and could lead to more flooding in the
days ahead, Beijing authorities warned.
</P>
<P>
Flood control agencies were urged to be prepared to help
prevent casualties, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
Duan Qiang, vice-mayor of Beijing, called upon municipal
flood-control authorities to be ready to deal with floods caused
by more downpours.
</P>
<P>
So far this week, water levels in 10 out of the city's 16 large
and medium-sized reservoirs have risen above their flood-water
lines. Six of them started discharging excess water on Monday
after the latest downpour, which drenched Beijing Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deluge was caused by a low pressure area pushed across
China's southeast coast last week by Typhoon Herb. An average of
77 millimeters f precipitation was measured in urban areas, the
highest this summer. A high of 154 millimeters of rainfall was
recorded in the city's southwestern sections.
</P>
<P>
A flood peak with a rate of flow reaching 1,720 cubic meters
per second, the highest since 1963 was measured in the Jumahe
River, running through the southern sections of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
By yesterday, more than 12,000 people living in nine villages
in Fangshan County, southwest of Beijing along the river, were
still stranded by the floods from the river's southern and
northern tributaries. No casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Communications in the flood-stricken villages remained
undisturbed.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper Monday dismissed his top sports official for the
country's poor performance at the just-concluded Olympic Games in
Atlanta, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Samper named Ignacio Pombo Villar to replace Diego Barragan
Correa as head of the Colombian Institute of Youth and Sports,
according to presidential spokesperson Carlos Castillo.
</P>
<P>
The Colombians returned home from Atlanta empty-handed whereas
Ximena Restrepo got the country a bronze medal from the 1992
Olympic Games held in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said the reshuffle was aimed at revitalizing sports in
the country and striving for a better performance in the 2000
games to be held in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The new sports head said he will have to find a better way to
spend the government grant of 50 million U.S. dollars to pump new
energy into sports.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Barragan, who had held the post for only five months,
said Colombian sports had not been given the importance they
deserved.
</P>
<P>
"Should this continue, we are going to face the same debacle
every four years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesperson said Colombia is going to hire
foreign coaches and promote sports among universities in an effort
to improve the country's sporting caliber.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia today reiterated its
opposition to U.S. sanctions against foreign companies that
invest in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will not help stability in the Middle East region
or the international fight against terrorism, Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Andreyev told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said combatting terrorism requires cooperation rather
than unilateral sanctions, which go against the anti-terrorism
document formulated at the summit of Group Seven and Russia in
Lyon, France, last month.
</P>
<P>
Russia is studying whether the U.S. sanctions will affect
Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. law, signed by President Bill Clinton on Monday,
imposes sanctions on foreign companies that make new investments
of more than 40 million U.S. dollars a year in oil or gas projects
in Iran or Libya, which the United States claims are the chief
state sponsors of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
European countries, threatened to hit back if the law was fully
enforced, saying the United States had no right to dictate where
their companies could invest. Many European oil and gas companies
have significant investments in Iran and Libya.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises and
overseas individuals in Beijing should pay part of their taxes to
branches of the Beijing Local Taxation Bureau instead of the city's
State taxation bureau starting from September 1, "China Daily"
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The taxes, including business tax, individual income tax,
resource tax, land value increment tax, urban real estate tax,
vehicle and ship license tax, stamp tax and butchery tax, are now
collected by the State taxation bureau.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's taxation reform in 1994, the levying of the
above taxes paid by domestic enterprises and individuals has been
conducted by local taxation bureaux. However, the same taxes from
overseas payers had remained to be levied by the state taxation
bureaux in some cities, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Beijing Local Taxation Bureau reminded the
overseas payers of the changes and reminded them to contact one of
the bureau's 22 branches for tax declaration and registration
before September 1 for a smooth transition.

<HEADLINE> Astrogeological Catastrophes As Cause of Natural Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese scientists
have stated at the 30th International Geological Congress that
catastrophes caused by collisions of the earth and materials from
outer space are a source of the earth's evolution.
</P>
<P>
Such catastrophes resulted in the extinction of ancient forms
of life, such as dinosaurs and trilobites, in sudden changes in
the environment, and in the formation of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Xu Daoyi, professor of the Institute of Geology of the State
Seismological Bureau, says that the extinction of ancient forms of
life always occurred with global catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the spread of materials from outer-space and
ancient meteorite craters, the presence of iridium shows an
extraordinary increase in the mineral layers corresponding to a
boundary between two geologic eras. This means that sharp changes
in the environment are the result of collisions of the earth and
materials from the depths of space, or a dynamic supernova
explosion near the planet.
</P>
<P>
Xu's idea is supported by other two Chinese scientists
including Zhang Qingwen of the Chinese Academy of Geological
Science and Sun Yiyin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
They say that his hypothesis tallies with the results of recent
discoveries in the Cretaceous-Tertiary Era boundaries, which
corresponds to the dying out of dinosaurs and the flourishing of
mammals.
</P>
<P>
Xu and his fellow researchers say that an aerolite 10 km in
diameter fell to earth at that time, causing an increase in carbon
dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, and the death of a great
number of animals because of food shortages.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a supernova explosion dating back 10,500 years,
resulted in an increase in nitrogen density, changing the
proportion of different carbon isotopes. Human-beings are
believed to have made their first steps toward civilization at
that time.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the astrogeological catastrophe hypothesis, the
supposition that the natural evolution is driven by the inner
forces of the earth has seen little progress in past decades,
according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
"No credible geological evidence has been found supporting the
idea that evolution was caused by tsunami or worldwide chaos in
ocean currents," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Discuss Security Arrangements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri announced here tonight that his country refuses to discuss
security arrangements in south Lebanon, which will facilitate an
Israeli withdrawal from the area.
</P>
<P>
Berri returned home tonight from a short visit to Damascus
where, the Shiite house speaker held talks with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam and Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Beirut Presidential Palace, the house
speaker immediately had a meeting with President Elias Hrawi and
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and informed them of his talks in the
Syrian capital.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of the meeting, Berri stressed
that the security arrangements in south Lebanon would "run counter
to Resolution 425 and cancel the resolution."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which was adopted in
1978 following an Israeli invasion into this country, calls for an
unconditional withdrawal of the Jewish state from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's "Lebanon First" proposal, the house
speaker said that it was a problem concerning Lebanon and Israel
should not negotiate with Syria over it.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks in Damascus dealt with a five-nation
committee monitoring cease-fire in south Lebanon, which was
established under an April 26 understanding reached between
Lebanon and the Jewish state. The committee will hold its first
meeting in the southern Lebanese town of Naqura Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel have
appointed their diplomatic and military representatives to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Berri said that he discussed with the Syrian leaders the
latest developments in the region as well as prominent domestic
problems in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put forward the
"Lebanon First" proposal in an apparent bid to break the current
dilemma of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Israel will unilaterally pull its troops
out of a 850-square-kilometer buffer zone in south Lebanon in
exchange for a Syria's help in disarming the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
guerillas and a mechanism safeguarding the security on the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was on the top of the agenda in a meeting between
Hrawi and al-Assad in Damascus Monday, the second summit of the
two leaders in 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi summoned to his office this moring the Lebanese prime
minister and house speaker and informed them of his talks with the
Syrian president.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources said that Prime Minister Hariri
would also visit the Syrian capital Wednesday to meet the
Syrian vice president.
</P>
<P>
The intensive Syrian-Lebanon consultations come on the eve of
an expected visit by Syrian President al-Assad Wednesday to
Alexandria, Egypt, where he will have a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> No Special Grants for Soldiers to Buy Motorbikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's defense headquarters
said today that the money to be provided by the military for
eligible soldiers to procure motorcycles could be loans instead
of generally considered special grants.
</P>
<P>
The military announced days ago to offer money for servicemen
to buy motorcycles as part of the effort to show the desire of
the federal government to make all personnel benefit. But the
move has been believed to be one to provide special grants to
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Defense spokesman Fred Chijuka said in a clarification here
today that modalities would be worked out for repayment, in
accordance with civil service rules.
</P>
<P>
The repayment would be deducted at source from the monthly
salaries of each beneficiary, he said, adding that the military
would also ensure the loan is used for the purpose it was
granted.
</P>
<P>
He said some criteria would be applied to ensure that soldiers
most qualified by hardwork, length of service, necessity and good
character, among others, would benefit.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers have been looking forward "with strong desires
to having the loan since the recommendation for it was offered to
the government for approval, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Pupils in Zambia Infected With Bilharzia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred pupils at the Kawama
Primary
School in Chililabombwe, Copperbelt Province of Zambia, have been
infected with the disease of bilharzia.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Mohammed Shehata of the National Council
for Scientific Research (Kitwe regional office) today in the
Zambian border town of Chililabombwe.
</P>
<P>
The infection of the bilharzia was first found there in
mid-July. Shehata is heading a team of medical officers sent by
the government to the epidemic area to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
A news dispatch from Chililabombwe quoted Shehata as saying
that so far 300 pupils are infected with bilharzia out of 415 who
presented urine samples for tests in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"This represents 65 percent of the infection rate at the
school. The situation is acute," said Shehata.
</P>
<P>
Despite the closure of schools in the area because of the
disease, all the 300 pupils found to be suffering from the
disease turned up for free treatment at Kawama Primary School
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Rivers, pools and a dam where the residents in the
Chililabombwe area draw water are heavily infested with snails
that carry parasites with bilharzia germs. "These germs easily
pierce through human skin when the victim steps into the infected
water," Shehata said.
</P>
<P>
Bilharzia affects the brain, liver and spleen, causing anaemia
and cancer to intestines and urinary system in human body.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Meet Syrian President in Alexandria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will meet with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad Wednesday for
talks on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held in the Egyptian Mediterranean port city
of Alexandria, will mainly deal with the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks of the peace process and Israel's decision to restart
construction of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs, particularly the Palestinians, have criticized
Israel's decision on settlements as an obstacle to peace and a
violation of agreements already reached between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-al-Assad meeting comes just four days after
al-Assad met with Jordan's King Hussein in Damascus Saturday to
explore ways to revive the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday in Damascus, al-Assad also held talks with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi to coordinate their stances on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed
willingness to resume peace talks with Syria. Syrian newspapers,
which usually reflect the government's views, said today that
Netanyahu's offer to resume talks was not serious because it is
not based on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly put forward the so-called "Lebanese
first" proposal, according to which Israel will pull out its
troops from an enclave in south Lebanon in exchange for Syria's
help in disarming Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerillas and
security on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria rejected the proposal. During their
talks Monday, al-Assad and Hrawi agreed to adopt a common stand on
peace moves with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria described the proposal as a "trap" aimed at sabotaging
the good ties between Beirut and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Wednesday's meeting between Mubarak and al-Assad
comes within the framework of constant Egyptian-Syrian coordination
on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has been playing an active role in the Mideast peace process as it
acts as a key mediator between the Arabs and Israel in their peace
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Bildt, Plavsic Meet in Banja Luka on Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The High Representative of the
international community for Bosnia Carl Bildt said today
constitutional changes were forthcoming in both Bosnian entities
-- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
After meeting acting Serb President Biljana Plavsic behind
closed doors in the northwestern Serb city of Banja Luka, Bildt
said the elections scheduled for September 14 should be followed
by economic reforms in line with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The talks had also focused on accelerating the "release of all
prisoners of war (POWs) and the exhumations of remains of the
killed, as both of these processes should be completed before the
elections," the Tanjug news agency quoted Bildt as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement to the press, Plavsic said that every
meeting with Bildt gave an impetus to the implementation of the
Dayton agreement to which the Serbs remain firmly committed, and
that the provision on POWs release was particularly important as
this process had been due to be completed by January 19 under the
Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic, who assumed all presidential duties from former
President Radovan Karadzic last month, also pointed to problems
hindering the exhumations of bodies of Serb soldiers and civilians
from mass graves in Glamoc and Sanski Most in the west and on Mt.
Ozren in the north, due to the interference of Muslim-Croat
federation authorities.
</P>
<P>
She also said that Bildt and his staff were working to put an
end to the suffering of the people whose kins are either dead or
in jail, although facing the truth would be very painful for many.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Boss Urges Two Parties in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku today urged the two parties in
Zanzibar to solve their differences amicably to ease political
tension there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Dodoma in Central Tanzania
today, Chief Anyaoku said he is concerned of the political
situation in Zanzibar, particularly after talks with the Zanzibar
President Salmin Amour and the Civil United Front (CUF) Vice
Chairman Seif Shariff Hamad.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, all is not well with the political climate in
Zanzibar because opposition representatives do not enter the
House of Representatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned of this situation because it implies that the
multi-party democracy in Zanzibar is not normal. The two parties
should agree to iron out the differences together," Chief
Anyaoku added.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku, who ended his three-day visit to Zanzibar
yeasterday, said he was planning to hold further talks with Amour
and Hamad before departure, saying he was hopeful that the two
sides would eventually solve the tension.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth boss today held separate talks with Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa, prime minister Frederick Sumaye,
Speaker of parliament Pius Msekwa and opposition leader in the
House Fatma Maghimbi in Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Referring to mult-party democracy in Tanzania, the
Commonwealth boss said: "Not all countries have been as fortunate
as Tanzania in usheing in multi-party democracy peacefully. You
have been able to complete the transition with far less headache
than many countries."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief Anyaoku called on Tanzania's small and
medium- scale industiries to draw from the Commonwealth Fund
which had been launched recently in Harare of Zimbabwe with an
aim to promote industrial development in Commonwealth countries.

<HEADLINE> France to Inaugurate 36th Bridge Over Seine River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- France will inaugurate its 36th
bridge over the Seine River flowing through Paris -- the Charles
de Gaulle Bridge -- Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the Paris Mayor's Office, the bridge, 208 meters
long and 30 meters wide, will link up two areas of the city in the
momentum of development on both sides of the river -- Bercy on the
right bank and Paris-Rive-Gauche on the left bank, which has the
Great Library of France nearby.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will also link two major railway stations of Paris
on the two sides of the river -- the Gares of Lyon and the Gares
of Austerlitz, and will relieve the neighboring Bridge Austerlitz,
which is the most used bridge in Paris by both traffic and
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was designed by architects Louis Arretche and Roman
Karasinski, both of whom are now dead. It is entirely white, light
in weight, has no curve, looks like a plane wing brushing the
Seine, and is located in a position from which one can sight the
tower of the Notre Dame cathedral.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was named in 1990 by the then mayor of Paris Jacques
Chirac to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of General de
Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge costs 240 million francs (48
million U.S. dollars) and 3,000 tons of steel and 2,000 tons of
concrete were used to build it.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims Attack UN Bus Transporting Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- One Bosnian Serb woman was
seriously injured and several others were lightly hurt when a
UNHCR bus was attacked by a group of Muslims on a road passing
through the eastern part of the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place between Osanica and Kravinjac in the
municipality of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. Gorazde is a
Muslim-dominated city connected with the Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo through a corridor carved in the Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
This was the second attack on a bus operating on the
Srbinje-Visegrad line introduced by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) on July 12, the Tanjug news agency reported from
Srbinje, a town in the eastern part of the Serb entity Republika
Srpska.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug, all the windows on the bus were broken
after the Muslims threw stones at the bus and the engine was so
damaged that the vehicle could not continue its journey.
</P>
<P>
The most seriously injured was Mira Vilotic, 41, a refugee from
Gorazde. She was taken by a peace Implementation Force (IFOR)
vehicle to Srbinje hospital where doctors took out two glass
particles from her eye.
</P>
<P>
Other passengers who were lightly injured were also taken to
Srbinje hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, freedom of movement in Bosnia is
guaranteed and the road from Srbinje to Visegrad via Gorazde has
the status of a Blue Route patroled by IFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said traffic is functioning normally without any
incidents on all roads in Republika Srpska, which are also used
by buses from the Muslim-Croat federation.

<P>
PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will pay a visit to France at the beginning of September,
Agence France Presse (AFP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted the head of a delegation of the Representative
Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF) visiting Israel as
saying that Netanyahu has confirmed that he will visit France in
the primary days of September.
</P>
<P>
"During our meeting, the Israeli prime minister described the
role France plays in the peace process as positive, especially in
the case of Lebanon, considering the traditional ties of France with
this country," said Me Hajdenberg, president of the CRIF.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said that France should exert more pressure on
Iran, and ally its position with the United States by cutting its
"critical dialogue with Iran," said Hajdenberg.

<HEADLINE> French Franc Dives Lowest in 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The French franc today dived to its
lowest point in four months in exchange rates with 3.4060 francs
for one mark, as compared with 3.3998 francs for one mark Monday.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the drop of the franc's
value is due to fears of new strikes to be held by public sector
employees in September and the uncertainty over the capability of
the government to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
Investors, most of them foreigners, are selling francs at the
moment against a background of social turbulence in September, AFP
quoted analyst Jean-Jacques Salabi of Fx Concept as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to lay off 8,000-9,000 public sector
employees, most of them teachers in public schools, next month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the government of Prime
Minister Alain Juppe will be able to cut no less than 2 percent of
ministerial budgets due to be announced by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in France now stands at 2 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African Olympic
team returned home this evening to a rousing welcome from a
singing, chanting multiracial crowd of 2,000 at Johannesburg
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
A banner claiming "to us you are all worth gold" caught the
mood of the welcome as the smiling athletes stepped onto a
balcony in the airport's international concourse to accept the
adulation of the young and old.
</P>
<P>
However, the biggest cheers were apparently reserved for
swimming double gold medalist Penny Heyns and the crowd's
undoubted favorite, the first black South African Olympic gold
medalist Josiah Thugwane, men's marathon winner at Atlanta
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The team is officially welcomed back by Gauteng Provincial
Government Premier Tokyo Sexwale at an international media
conference at the airport.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the team, Sexwale said the whole South Africa
is proud of their achievements at Atlanta, which had caused
tears of joy in "many of those who will admit it".
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said
the president, could not personally welcome home the team due to
previous engagements, has been "overwhelmed" by the achievements
of the South Africans in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The South African Olympic team won 3 gold medals, one silver
medal and one bronze medal, ranking 27th in final medals table
among the 197 teams participating in the Atlanta games.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Urged to Offset Costs of UN Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged the Croatian government to
offset costs of the U.N. Transitional Administration for Eastern
Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) as required by the
Basic Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali said the
UNTAES now faces key challenges, which will influence how many
Serbs will stay in the region and whether restoration of the
multi-ethnic character of the region under Croatian control will
be possible.
</P>
<P>
"The most immediate concern is to obtain funding for the local
administration of the region until such time as sustained Croatian
financing becomes available, possibly a period of up to six
months," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed regrettable that the government of Croatia has
not yet been prepared to provide such funding, despite its clear
obligation to cooperate fully with UNTAES and repeated demands by
the Security Council that the host country help offset the costs
of the operation."
</P>
<P>
He warned that unless the problem gets solved soon, he will
report to the Security Council that one of the parties has
significantly failed to comply with its obligations under the
Basic Agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, another challenge facing the U.N.
operation is the uncertainty of its mandate. Boutros-Ghali said
the uncertainty has brought negative effects on Serb confidence
and UNTAES operations.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAES was given a 12-month mandate with the task of
building blocks for the difficult process of reconciliation
necessary for region to regain its peaceful multi-ethnic
character. The mandate is going to expire on January 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Given present conditions in the region, however, its does not
appear realistic to expect that these tasks will be completed by
the expiration of the current UNTAES mandate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, in considering the many and complex tasks that
UNTAES has been mandated to perform and in order to provide
greater clarity and guidance to the mission in the performance of
its mandate, the council, reaffirming its own decision that UNTAES
has been established for an initial period of 12 months, may wish
to consider the possibility of indicating now that it intends to
extend the mandate of UNTAES by up to a further 12 months to
enable to accomplish its tasks," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Somalia to Reach Peaceful Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today called upon all factions in Somalia to use
the current situation for a lasting truce and peaceful settlement
to their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador Antonius Eitel, council president for August,
said in a statement to the press that the Security Council briefly
discussed the developments in Somalia and council members expressed
their concern about the situation there today.
</P>
<P>
The council urged all factions in Somalia to refrain from any
action that might lead to a further worsening.
</P>
<P>
After Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed died of gunshot
wounds last Thursday, his enemies expressed the intention to join
peace talks to form a new government. When the warlord's son
Hussein took over as faction leader in the country, enemies of
Aideed in Somalia said Monday his followers had thrown away a
chance for peace and their forces were on alert.

NEW YORK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street turned
mostly higher today, with the Dow Jones industrial average adding
21.83 to 5,696.11.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 347.23
million shares, higher than 303.77 million in Monday's sluggish
session.
</P>

The NYSE's composite index rose 0.84 to 353.65, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.15 to 662.38.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.33 to 1,128.86, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.15 to 548.74.
</P>
<P>
There was no new economic data today to supplement last week's
encouraging indications on inflation, and there was little
corporate news to steer trading as investors focused on the start
of this week's three-day auction of new U.S. Treasury debt.
</P>
<P>
But the first phase, this afternoon's auction of 19 billion
U.S. dollar in three-year notes, did not erode last week's gains
in bond prices or send interest rates higher.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond actually eased further.

<HEADLINE> Serbian, Croatian Presidents to Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and his Croatian counterpart, Franjo Tudjman, will meet
in Athens Wednesday to discuss normalization of ties, the
Yugoslavia news agency Tanjug said today.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first top-level meeting between Serbian and
Croatian leaders on bilateral relations since Croatia declared
independence from the former Yugoslavia in the summer of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said the talks would focus on "issues of importance for
promoting Yugoslav-Croatian relations."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, which is comprised of Serbia and Montenegro,
recognized the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina
last December and Macedonia in April this year. The negotiation on
normalization of relations with Slovenia and Croatia has been
under way but in a slow process.
</P>
<P>
Mutual recognition between Yugoslavia and Croatia, the two
powerful countries in the region, is seen as crucial for a
permanent peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacles on the way include the dispute over the
Prevlaka peninsula bordering Croatia and Yugoslavia in the south
and the Eastern Slavonia region on the border in the north.

ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Fresh from its best performance in
100 years, the Greek Olympic team returned to Athens this evening,
greeted by tens of thousands of Athenians, who lined a route from
the airport to the Central Panathenian Stadium, where celebrations
in their honor were held well into the night.
</P>
<P>
Flag-waving crowds cheered the athletes, who displayed their
medals to adoring fans, while riding atop military jeeps.
</P>
<P>
During the Atlanta games, Greek weightlifters Pyros Dimas and
Akakios Kakhiashvili won gold medals, along with Yiannis
Melissanidis in gymnastics and Nikos Kaklamanakis in the men's
yachting event. Three more weightlifters won silver medals along
with Niki Bakoyianni in the women's high jump.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving at the Panathenian stadium, the motorcade ended
at the Temple of Zeus, where the eight medalists were awarded the
"Gold Medal of Honor" by Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos.
</P>
<P>
All the Olympic finalists, in the first eight positions in
their respective events, then proceeded to the packed 80,000-seat
stadium on foot.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks subsequently lit up the warm Athenian sky, as the
athletes entered the marble stadium, greeted by Greek President
Kostis Stephanopulos, Prime Minister Costas Simitis, ministers and
all of the nation's political leadership.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Simitis said, "Your victory for all of us is a
great lesson, showing that nothing is conquered without toil, that
nothing is won without sacrifices, that nothing is consolidated
without effort, that nothing is ensured without outdoing
ourselves."

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
dispatched the first of about 1,200 military personnel to a remote
air base in Al Khari, Saudi Arabia, for the preparation of a large
bulk of 4,000 American troops moving to the facility, the Pentagon
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The movement is part of the plan drawn up by the Pentagon to
enhance security measures following the June 25 truck bombing at
an air base near Dhahran that killed 19 U.S. soldiers and
injured several hundred.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said these military personnel,
largely engineers and logistics specialists, will undertake the
tasks of constructing hundreds of air-conditioned tents to shelter
those being moved to Al Khari's Prince Sultan Air Base, about 55
miles southeast of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
He said the move has been designed to avoid interrupting the
mission of American, French and British forces stationed in the
kingdom to monitor the no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has expected the move to
be completed within two to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 750 dependents of U.S. military personnel residing in
Saudi Arabia are expected to return to the United States within
one to two weeks for safety purpose, according to Perry's order.
